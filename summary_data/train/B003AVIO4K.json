      "text": "My son is 1 year now. Got him this trike for his bday. So I have to put those gray rail around the side so he doesn\u2019t fall over. The problem is that the seat is so slippery his butt keeps on going forward and he can never sit straight and his legs come off the foot rest all the time. I had to put glue on the seat, that way it added more grip and my son is not slipping. Also the steering attachment for the parent keep on loosing grip and collapses all the time. I had to manually drill a screw in that to keep it not collapsing. Didn\u2019t expect this from a $70 trike. Highly disappointed.",

In other words pedaling does not produce any feedaback: no opposing force and no movement. We should have realized the quality of this product was bad from the beginning, since there was another defect obvious from when we bought it, namely the handle wobbled before having any impact on the wheel direction. Our neighbor has a similar design tricycle and guess what... they have the same problem.",

Most disappointing was that it is too small for him. Thought the footrest would be great, but he eats his knees with it, very poor design. Can use pedals as footrest with a lot of manipulation of the seat and structure. This will not last him more than one year, to maybe 2-1/2, if that long. Not sure we will keep, a lot of money for one year of use. Radio flyer has been making stuff for kids for 50 years, they really missed it with this item.",

I can't even pull it out of the shed, she has to sit on it first and then I take it out. One part I love is that you can disengage the pedals so they don't hit her in the legs when I'm walking her. Great product, well thought out, and safe. Most importantly the kid loves it.",

Only one understands holding the handles so far, but I have to say we enjoy walks as a family more than when we push their double stroller. The ability to raise and lower the adult handle is helpful between me and my very tall husband. I appreciate that this will grow with the boys for years to come, with the leg protector in these early years into pedals that turn on or off depending if they\u2019re ready to pedal. This is so lightweight it\u2019s easy to pull out of the garage and carry. Weighs less than my toddlers!!!",

I love the fact that there is a footrest for those too young to reach the pedals yet. The sunscreen is a nice touch too.

It took a little time to out together but after the women took over it went rather smoothly lol. The front \"hubcap\" pulls out to disengage the pedals so when she gets older she won't try to pedal off without me. The stroller handle is adjustable and is very easy to adjust. I am very pleased with my order and would not hesitate to get another one for another baby down the road.",

The reason for this are the metal caps that need to be hammered in and deformed into the metal axle rod. However, that is the only difficult part, but enough for 1 star deduction. Additionally, car must be taken to make sure the orientation of the parental handle bars are positioned correctly, but not a big problem. The 2nd star deduction is due to the canopy design. When assembled, the canopy does not provide much if any sun protective coverage, which makes having it pointless.",
