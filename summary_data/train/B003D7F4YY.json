      "text": "This game is completely cooperative; either everyone wins or everyone loses. You are given a number of actions and you can spend those actions to move, gather artifacts, or save the island. This game is great and bought it because Pandemic is one of my favorite games. This is a much smaller game than Pandemic, uses similar game mechanisms, and was designed by the same person. Unfortunately for me, I played Forbidden Desert (the sequel to this game) and it was better than this one. This game is still quite good and could easily be used to get players into this style of game before introducing them to Pandemic.",

      "text": "We do a lot of gaming and actually started by playing Forbidden Desert. We liked it enough we wanted to buy the original, which is this one: Forbidden Island. I have heard people say Desert is better, but I don't agree. Desert has a fun location mechanic (similar to what is used in Targi) but overall I think Forbidden Island is a better game. The tension associated with the game pieces disappearing as the island sinks makes this more fun than Forbidden Desert in my opinion. It's also cheap and slightly simpler. I actually like both cooperative \"Forbidden\" games, but in my opinion, this one is a bit better.",

Its very hard to play on the hardest setting, we haven't been able to beat it yet. We have also played with more than recommended players and it makes game play much more difficult but interesting.

I would recommend for ages 10 and up, or mature 8/9 year olds with good attention spans. Only thing that would make it better is if it were for 5 players instead of a max of 4.",

It was actually quite enjoyable. It can be as easy or as difficult as you would like. Truly, you could play this game alone and just make moves with more than one player. A cool variation is to try and not discuss strategy every move, but let everyone make their own moves without others' input. Then you have to try to get on the same wavelength, and try to understand another's thoughts to accomplish the goal.",

There are several elements - sinking island tiles, rising water level, water rise cards, etc. that create a sense of urgency and despair as you see the escape route slowly sink away.

As such, I often select this game for lighter game night introductions (vs. Pandemic or Forbidden Desert).",

For every round of player action the island gets to fight back with flooding and catastrophes which is fun, but also I've lost about as many games as I've won.

Highly recommend for those of you who want to get into more complicated games but aren't sure where to start.

      "text": "My wife and I have an absolute blast playing this game! It is a cool little co-op game and we play it when we aren't feeling up to something more competitive. It is quite challenging, but very winnable. The only complaint I have (and I do mean the only complaint) is the tin that holds the game. It has a tendency to pop open at the worst times and spill the contents. That is fixable by wrapping a large rubber band around the container, but it better corrected by just placing the contents in resealable plastic bags and carrying them that way. This game is recommended for adults, but is quite easy to play with children as well. Play it!!",

All of the kids were able to pick up the mechanics quickly and the tension of the island slowly flooding as you play is a novel thing for them. I'm glad we got this game!",

The only issue is that replay value is pretty low as once you've played it a couple times, it's time to graduate to Forbidden Desert and then to other more strategic cooperative games.

I got Forbidden Desert before this, and although I like Desert marginally better, I heartily recommend both games.

Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss! The latest creation by cooperative game master, Matt Leacock who created the best seller Pandemic.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nYou and your team can be the first to breach the borders of the Archeans' ancient mystical empire in the collaborative card game Forbidden Island, by Gamewright. In this game, teamwork proves essential to locate the Earth Stone, the Statue of the Wind, the Crystal of Fire, and the Ocean's Chalice as the Island floods beneath your feet. Adventure... if you dare!\n\n\n\n\n\nMEGA T-REX\n\n * Ages: Ten and up\n * Requires: Two to four players\n\n\nAT A GLANCE:\n\n * Be the first team to breach the borders of the Archeans' ancient mystical empire\n * Locate the Earth Stone, the Statue of the Wind, the Crystal of Fire, and the Ocean's Chalice before the Island sinks\n * Find the treasures through collaborative play and teamwork\n * Stimulates problem-solving and strategic skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreach the borders of the Archean empire to locate the four sacred elements. View larger. \n\n\n\nWork collaboratively with two to four players to locate the treasure.\nView larger. \n\nTHE LEGEND OF THE ARCHEANS\nThis game is centered on the legend of the Archean empire, a civilization that possessed the ability to control the Earth's core elements--fire, wind, water, and earth--through four sacred treasures. These treasures stayed hidden from enemies for years on the Forbidden Island, which was designed to sink if intruders ever attempted to capture them. Set the appropriate water level for your gaming skill, and let the adventures begin!\n\nCAPTURE THE FOUR SACRED TREASURES BEFORE THE ISLAND SINKS!\nYour team of adventurers must work together to keep the Forbidden Island from sinking as you seek the four treasures hidden within. The mission is carried out using different combinations of Flood, Treasure, and Adventurer Cards on the 24 tiles that make up the Forbidden Island. Once you've captured each treasure using the appropriate cards, you must make it to Fools' Landing and escape by helicopter in order to win. If the island sinks before you complete your tasks, the mission ends in defeat.\n\nUSE COLLABORATIVE PLAY TO SUCCEED\nEach player is dealt an Adventure Card and given a corresponding pawn before the game starts, designating him or her with a certain set of strengths. This game is designed so that instead of competing with other players, you work to find the treasures and find out how to best use each Adventurer's strengths through collaborative play. This stimulates problem-solving and strategy skills.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nWater level marker, water meter, 58 playing cards, 24 island tiles, 6 pawns, 4 treasure figurines, rules of play, Gamewright catalog, and comment card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIt\u2019s a great honor to introduce the latest creation by cooperative game master, Matt Leacock. There are so many things we love about this unique game: from the rich illustrations, to the collaborative nature of play, to the innovative set of rules, to the infinite possibilities generated by the tiles and cards. Don\u2019t be surprised if your pulse starts pounding faster soon after you start playing \u2013 it\u2019s a game that instantly generates an electrifying atmosphere of tension and excitement. Dare to discover Forbidden Island. Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise.
