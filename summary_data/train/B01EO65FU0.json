The only slight drawback I have had with this rod is the handle shape. Due to the handle shape, it can sometimes be a little more difficult to get the rod out of a short rod holder. If the rod holder is a long tube, there isn't any problem; but if the tube is shorter than the handle, sometimes the wider bottom part of the handle will catch. This is a minor inconvenience and only applies to specific rod holders. Otherwise, this fishing rod is superb.",

I even hiked through a local park fishing a lake for a few hours carrying this rod around and didn't have any issues. I would highly recommend this rod vs getting a cheap rod/combo set from your local sporting goods/walmart store. the difference is night and day. and sportmall has very good customer service if you need to contact them.",

It was my go to rod. Only one issue, it only last a month before it snapped in half during a routine cast. I want to order a replacement, but not willing to take a chance on same outcome. Update 09-12-2016: Sportmall / Amazon, you guys rock!!!! The customer service contact me for a replacement at no charge. That's standing by their product. An awesome customer service. Thank you, I will have my \"go to\" fishing rod again.",

    "description": "Entsport Story: \nMy grandpa has been fishing more than 70 years. Fishing is a way of life. He had a rod in his hands almost since he could walk. In his early days, he had to find old broken tackle and tried to fix it up so that he could use it. Perhaps because of this history, he learned to love good fishing products. That has not changed over his life, my father\u2019s life and mine. We love to fish, and we love good gear.\nHowever, the most fishing rods in the market are not quality controlled and uniform from one item to the next. Only some big companies can provide great products, but too expensive. So we are determined to develop the unique and qualified fishing tackle at an affordable price.\nOur Brand \u201cEntsport\u201d comes from our three beliefs about fishing: Enjoy, Neverending, Technology. So we divide our products into three series: \nE Series: High quality products that are affordable for any fisherman. \nN Series: Premium products represent that entsport's explore to quality will never end.\nT Series: Super products focus on the technology and provide the best fishing experience! \n\nEntsport Service: \nEvery product from Entsport has one year warranty. If there is any problem about the quality, please feel free to contact with us by email. We will give you a satisfied solution within 12 hours, as we always stand by our product and provide the best service. \n\nSpecification:\nMaterial: Carbon\nLength: 7\u2019\nPieces: 2\nGuides: 5+1\nLure weight: 1/8-3/4oz\nLine weight: 6-20lbs\n\nThe Package Includes:\n1 x Fishing Rod\n1 x Fishing Rod Protective Bag",
