There was a little defect in the metal on the handle\u2014the enamel stuff was chipped/sharp. It cut my brother's hand when he was driving the posts. Yes... we could've worn work gloves, but it was such a small job that we didn't think it was necessary. And we shouldn't have had to wear gloves...the company's quality control people should've caught this issue. I thought about sending this back because of the defect, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble, so we just filed down the handle defect ourselves.",

It is s much easier. And safer, too. I am 68 years old. Wish I had learned about these when I was younger. Like another reviewer said, slide the sledge over the post before you stand it up. I would recommend the 12 pound sledge for most people, unless you lift heavy weights on a daily basis. This very rugged and should last a lifetime. I will be passing mine on to my grandchildren.",
