All the other stools were too short, too tall, too hard to move around, too heavy... This stool has adjustable height, swivel seat, is SMOOTH rolling, and is very light weight. It was also a breeze to assemble. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect stool! It's also great for haircuts, styling hair, doing artwork, or any number of other projects.",

Five legs and casters makes it more stable than the four legged models. Another bonus is that it's made in Taiwan not Red China. Two thumbs up!",

      "text": "The seat is tiny and very uncomfortable. It is also unsafe because you can easily slide off the seat. My DOCTOR told me to buy a new chair because this one was giving me large bruises on my rear end because the seat was too small and I had to fight to stay on the chair. A metal seat back is also very uncomfortable. The only purpose I see for it is that is reminds you not to slide of the back.",
