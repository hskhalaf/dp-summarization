Comfortable, waterproof, stable are the qualities that strike most with golfers. Besides that, it is also wrapped in a sleek package.",

      "text": "This is my 2nd pair of BIOM shoes, with the spikes. I normally wear size 10 American-made shoes, but I've found that Ecco's 9-9.5 (43) size fits me perfectly, not too tight at all, no binding or pinching and surprisingly the right length. Most importantly they securely hold my feet in the shoes, no jostling around inside during my overly violent swing. I'm going to try and be more careful when changing the spikes on this pair, as that was the death of my previous pair. Something about the Texas heat must weld golf spikes in - they're always a witch (with a b) to change out, no matter what brand of shoe.",

Their lace ups are pretty good but I'm dissapointed by the Boa system. Mizuno (Boa) is a great shoe at about the same price point as the Ecco. If you're looking for a comfortable shoe at a cheaper price point, try True. They're a little more expensive than other shoes, but their roomy toe box makes them comfortable out of the box. Etonic and Adidas needed a few rounds before they 'fit'.",
