Yes they are expensive, but It's worth the investment!",

I had to return it as it didn't last up to a year, the wire that connects the 2 earphones got internally damaged (like wired earphones) then one of the earphones stopped working. What a stupid design! The manufacturer doesn't do refunds only repairs so basically you get the same rubbish product. I strongly recommend purchasing the extra 2 years damage cover from amazon if you chose this product, as you can get your money back with it. It is way too expensive to get spoilt within that short period of time! So I would NOT recommend the product.",
