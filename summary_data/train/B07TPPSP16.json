      "text": "I bought this with the intention of using it for some intense CAD design using SolidWorks and for the OLED screen. I have been thoroughly impressed by the performance and so far there have been no hiccups. The display is gorgeous and I can't wait for Windows to properly take advantage of HDR so I can get all the benefits from this laptop. I was pleasantly surprised by the battery life with 'office' applications resulting in a good 6 hours of usage. The only drawback is the fans can get quite loud if you want full performance out of the laptop but the fan profiles are adjustable..",
