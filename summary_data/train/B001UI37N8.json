The only reason for 4 stars is that I realized that I had to brush the last 1/2 cup of grains into the feeder otherwise they just sit there. The tip to add corn starch around the rubber ring of the bowl works very well as it tends to stick. On you tube someone suggested putting non-stick cooking spray on the ring. Doesn't sound like a great idea to me. Milled 2 pounds of wheat berries in less than a minute. The resulting whole wheat bread turned out very well.",

As long as you follow the directions in the instruction booklet, you shouldn't have any problems. If you're getting inconsistent results, watch some of the \"how to\" videos online and play with the settings until you know the machine better.

      "text": "The NutriMill is so quick and easy to use and left no flour mess in my kitchen! I just floured the rubber seal, as others have recommended, prior to the first use. I love the large hopper and the ability to grind large amounts of wheat at a time. I do not consider this grain mill to be too loud as others have mentioned. I can easily carry on a conversation with someone while it's running. So far I have only ground wheat into flour, but I look forward to experimenting with other grains and such.",

It mills different kinds of grain (barely, spelt, soft wheat, oats)it makes very fine flour or more course, which ever you prefer and mills it very quickly. This mill doesn't have the mess the other ones did, I don't have to wipe two feet of counter top around the mill after I'm done milling. So it's a very good product and I have no regrets spending the money on it.",

    "title": "NutriMill Classic High-Speed Grain/Flour Mill",
    "description": "Size:11\" x 13\" x 15\" 13lbs. 20 Cup Bowl Capacity\nWhy mill your own flour, when it's so readily available? Commercial mills remove 30 percent of the wheat kernel, removing the most nutritious part of the grain to make white flour. Milling your own flour not only ensures that your flour is as nutritious as it can be, it has a wonderful taste that is lost to commercially made whole-grain flour.\n\nNutriMill is the world's most popular maker of grain mills, and the NutriMill Classic has been its #1 selling mill for over 10 years! The NutriMill Classic electric grain mill uses a high speed impact chamber (also called a micronizer) with stainless steel milling heads to create flour from grains and beans. The NutriMill Classic has raised the bar for grain mill design with new features and abilities users have asked for\u2014a combination of features found in no other impact mill. \n\nThe new design of the NutriMill Classic's impact chamber allows you to put grain into the hopper before you turn it on with no risk of plugging the mill, which can happen with older mill designs. Even if stopped during grinding, the NutriMill Classic restarts again without trouble.\n\nWith the Nutrimill Classic you have the ability to grind from super fine, much finer than any other impact mill, to coarser flour you need for perfect corn bread. Its impact grain milling heads provide a 400% range of adjustment from fine to coarse, ten times greater than earlier impact mills. \n\nThe NutriMill Classic allows you to grind up to 20 cups of flour at one time! Its grain hopper and flour bin are perfectly matched so you never have to worry about an overfilled mess. Convenient, powerful & fast: Just pour grain in the hopper, turn the NutriMill Classic on, and its powerful 10 amp, 1-3/4 hp motor does the rest, quickly producing your choice of fine, medium or coarse flour. The NutriMill Classic's impact grinding mechanism is self cleaning, and it operates dust-free, so grinding grain won't mean extra housecleaning later. Its one piece design, easy-grip handles, and light weight make the NutriMill Classic easy to move.\n\nThe versatile NutriMill Classic grinds wheat (both hard and soft), oat groats (dehulled oats), rice, triticale, kamut, spelt, dry beans, lentils, dent (field) corn, popcorn, dried sweet corn, split peas, buckwheat, barley, rye, millet, teff, quinoa, amaranth, sorghum, dried mung beans and soybeans. It will also grind dried, minimally-sprouted grain. The NutriMill Classic isn't suitable for herbs, spices, oilseeds like flax, chopped chestnuts or fibrous materials. Also note that when set for coarser meal texture, the NutriMill Classic's output remains too fine for making cereal grinds. The Nutrimill Classic is an outstanding machine for making a full range of flour and meal textures.\n\nProtects nutrients: The NutriMill Classic keeps your flour at temperatures typically about 118\u00b0 that protect the nutrients in your grains. Its new airflow design makes the NutriMill Classic the world's coolest-running impact mill. With a sound level about like a vacuum cleaner, the NutriMill Classic is much quieter than the first generation of impact mill designs. \n\nWith a Limited Lifetime Warranty you can be sure your Nutrimill Clasic will output flour reliably for years to come.",
