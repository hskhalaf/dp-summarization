Sealing is excellent and provides normal breathing motion. Working with drywall dust the whole day using this 3M product is not a concern. The straps are designed with comfort and stay comfortably in place. Proper filter (for dusty conditions) to purchase is the 3M 2091 P100 Particulate Filter.",

I'm a welder by trade so I use it daily. The mask filters welding fumes, grinding dust, spray paint and everything else I use on daily basis. Best respirator you can get.",

This one fits a little better in some respects but I am disappointed that this Large size respirator is actually slightly smaller (top to bottom) than than my old Medium size respirator. Because of that, it requires carefully balancing pressure on the bridge of my nose (which gives me headaches) and pressure on my chin, along with ensuring that I get a good seal.",

    "description": "The 3M Half Facepiece Reusable Respirator 6000 Series helps provide protection against particulates and a wide variety of gases and vapors when used with approved cartridges and filters. When properly fitted and used with approved 3M cartridges and filters, this respirator can help provide protection at concentrations up to 10 times the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The swept back design of the cartridges helps improve balance and visibility. Remarkably comfortable, soft, lightweight facepiece has easy-to-adjust head straps that allow for a customized fit to the user. Replaceable cartridges help reduce waste and costs over time. NIOSH, a Federal government regulatory agency, has tested and approved the 6000 Series Half Facepiece with certain 3M cartridges, filters and supplied air systems. The 6000 Series is NIOSH approved for negative-pressure air purifying and positive-pressure dual airline applications. This half facepiece respirator may be used with 3M Cartridge 6000 Series; 3M Filters 2000, 2200, 7000 or 5000 Series; or 3M Dual Airline Systems against a variety of gases, vapors, and particulate hazards according to NIOSH approvals. Some applications include: assembly and mechanical, chemical clean-up, chemical handling, chipping, chiseling, cleaning, furnace operations, grinding, laboratories, machining, masonry, painting, pouring/casting, sanding, sawing, welding, construction, general manufacturing, industrial maintenance, mining, etc. Breathing hazardous particles, gases and vapors can be harmful to your health. The 3M Half Facepiece Reusable Respirator 6000 Series helps reduce exposure to many contaminants. Warning: Respirators help protect against certain airborne contaminants. Before use, the wearer must read and understand the User Instructions provided as a part of the product packaging. Follow all local regulations. In the U.S., a written respiratory protection program must be implemented meeting all the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134 including training, fit testing and medical evaluation. In Canada, CSA standards Z94.4 requirements must be met and/or requirements of the applicable jurisdiction, as appropriate. Misuse may result in sickness or death.
