Just could not get it to link up via wi-fi so have to use the MacBook via a USB cable instead. No real biggie but still, slightly annoying. Print quality is excellent, it is slower than a large printer but what do you expect? First time I used it was to print 12 pages and it was fast enough, but wouldn't want to try and print loads.",

A few points to note though: 1) The battery does not last very long at all, although if plugged in via USB cable to your PC or laptop, switch the printer to stand by and it will start charge up. Also the printer switches off to standby automatically so it can charge and conserve battery. 2) The paper feeder can only realistically hold around 10 sheets of A4 paper with no printing issues, anything more and you will get problems.",

      "text": "The most expensive pile of garbage I've ever bought. Consumes ink like it's water and you have to pay through the nose for it. There's also something called a Maintenance Cartridge that is another rip off. The only good thing is that you save on ink when the useless lump of plastic refuses to print. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE.",

Measuring 309x154x61mm and weighing just 1.6kg, the WF-100 is Epson's smallest and lightest wireless A4 inkjet printer. The printer also comes equipped with a built-in battery that can be recharged anywhere via USB.\n\nHassle-free wireless connectivity and compatibility to Apple AirPrint and Google Cloud Print, the WF-100 allows you to print from anywhere at any time, whether you are at the office or on your morning commute. The WF-100W also benefits from Epson Connect. Whilst the Epson iPrint app allows for wireless printing from most tablets or smartphones, Epson Connect also includes Email Print. With Email Print, you can now print from anywhere in the world.\n\nAs the only portable printer that currently uses pigment inks for all colours, the WorkForce WF-100\u2019s quality is reflected in the clear, durable and smudge-free prints.\n\nThe WF-100W prints at a speed of up to 7ppm in black and white and 4ppm in colour. With an ink yield of up to 250 pages* and 3.7cm LCD screen, the WF-100 is easy to set up without the need for a PC and is ready to go whenever you need it.\n\n*based on black and white printing, colour print yields 200 pages\n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nEpson Printer\nAC Adapter\nMini USB Cable\n2x Maintenance Box\nBlack Ink Cartridge\nTri-Colour Ink Cartridge\nUser Documentation",
