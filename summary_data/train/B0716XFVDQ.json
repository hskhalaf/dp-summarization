There is no support, and virtually NO padding. It may say \"cloud foam\" but there is more padding in my flip flops than these shoes. If you can get a pair for a good price, and just want them for the look then go for it, but I would not recommend wearing/walking in them for long periods of time.",

Don\u2019t pay more than $40-$50 for these, because you\u2019ll be replacing them in six months. DO buy a pair in every color when you find them on sale because there isn\u2019t a stinker in the bunch. They\u2019re that cute. You can adjust the shoe with the laces even though these are slip-ons.

That said, the laces work to cinch the shoe tighter if need be. With my arch there's a bit of a fight to get them on, but not bad. Super light weight.

They are also too flexible so your feet will slide from side to side while doing agility exercises or any side to side movement (like side lunges). I don't know if anyone else experienced this, but my toes also touch the sole beyond where the cloud foam stops so that is awkward and slightly uncomfortable. Save your money and pass on these.",

They even hurt after I took them off for days. I thought I had developed plantar fasciitis or something, but stopped wearing them and the pain went away. So sad because they weren\u2019t uncomfortable. Will wear maybe just to the store or short outings.",

However, when these came in it was basically like there were two different shoes in the box. The left shoe fit great, it was what i expected but the right shoe was so narrow and so tight, it almost like they ran out of material when the made the shoe or something. It was very weird, maybe it was a one off thing but it definitely did not make me want to buy these or even try them again sadly.",

I mostly used them for walking/ jogging and I\u2019m a beginner so typically it was only for a mile or two at a time. For an Adidas shoes to last less than a month is totally unacceptable. I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from. My knees suddenly started to hurt (I\u2019ve never had this issue before) and I 100% attribute it to these. Look elsewhere.",
