They didn't want the other one back either, though not sure what I will do with a intermittent light..lol. Thanks Cave Tools, great customer support and a real nice light.",

With the spot light, his shadow would always get in the way.. and with the flashlight he never had both hands or I had to stand there for him (like I had nothing better to do!).
