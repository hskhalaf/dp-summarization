The repair also did not cover the entire chip, leaving a rough spot that is unsuitable for using the handle bare-handed. I am returning for an exchange and will amend this review should the next pot be satisfactory. UPDATE: Received my replacement, and the lid had multiple (attempted) repaired chips in the enamel on the handle as well as where the handle meets the lid. I'm starting to wonder if this listing is for factory seconds? Extremely disappointing to receive a pot that is not in \"new\" condition at this price point.",

Skip the reissues and buy a vintage Dansk Kobenstyle. You don\u2019t have to use it so delicately and it will last you way longer.",
