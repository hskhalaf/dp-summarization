      "text": "We purchased our original step stool about four years ago in June 2014. The stool is great! It\u2019s very sturdy, easy to put up and put down and easy to clean. The only problem we had with the stool and it\u2019s major flaw is on the corners of the stool. If you try to put too much weight on any one corner of the fixture that connects the leg to the platform it may buckle the welded point which completely Damages the unit. Up until this one incident we had not one issue with the stool. We are now purchasing a second stool and we are going to keep that in mind for our future adventures. Enjoy!",

If you remove the feet, use a long nose plier down through the inside to move the nib to the side. Then adjust the height and slide the nib back. This is a pain but we need the step. Have another idea and will post if it works. Hope the manufacturer is paying attention.",

I bought this foe my small dogs also to use and will have to purchase a mat and adhere it to the step to cover those large gaps to keep a paw or leg from slipping down between the slats.

      "text": "This is a very strong step, mostly well made, except for the ease of adjusting leg length. It is not possible to push in the buttons far enough to allow the leg length to be set at another hole. The metal push button gets stuck on the corner of the hole of the metal leg which prevents the leg from sliding past the button. I fixed this by tapering the hole openings of the leg with a drill. This allowed the metal button to contact a sloping surface in the hole on the leg rather than a sharp edged hole. This took some time as there are a lot of holes that need to be tapered.",

After almost twisting my ankle twice last year camping I decided I needed a better solution. Stumbled across this unit. It is super sturdy and easily supports a lot of weight. The adjustable legs don't give you too much height adjustment but has been great for uneven ground where you can extend a leg to make it level (not rocking). The wide platform, easy adjustment and folding legs make it perfect as a step and easy to pack away in the camper.",

For step exercise, I strongly suggest you consider this vs the purpose built exercise platforms. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.",
