We call them her soft & cozy undies. Also, I found sizing was just right. I was torn between 2T and 3T, I got the 3T and it's slightly loose/baggy but not enough to fall down, they are comfortable for her, glad I went with the bigger size.

They do get the pants/bottoms wet also, but not as much as a thin pair of regular underwear. When we travel I do put a Pull Up over these for extra protection.

      "title": "Great alternative to disposable training pants",
      "text": "These Gerber training pants are a great product for use during potty training, when your toddler isn't quite ready for totally-unabsorbent underwear, but doesn't like the feel of bulky diapers anymore. They're soft and cottony like real underwear, but have a bit of absorbent material between the legs in case of an accident. While they may not be able to absorb a full bladder's worth of urine, I've found that they contain the mess quite a bit better than regular underwear, at a fraction of the cost of Pull Ups or other disposable training pants.",

I don't know where she purchased hers from but every store I went to did not have her size. I was dedicating myself to her training and wanted to eliminate pull-ups since they are not much different then diapers. She weighs 25 pounds and these were perfect. She even seemed excited about them. Great to have four extra pair to add to the three she already have.",

She was able to tell me when she went to the bathroom because she could feel it wet, but we seldom got too much on the floor because the underwear are so absorbent. I first bought two sets of 4, but quickly realized that with her accidents I would need more so I ordered another 8. These are really excellent and I don't think I will go back to diapers or pull-ups while I am potty training. The quality is great, the pattern is cute, and my daughter much prefers them to diapers.",

They're especially great if your toddler is in the stage where they might start to pee, then feel it and stop themselves to run to the potty. We still had to change to a fresh pair often throughout the day, but it catches enough that it's usually all I had to do.
