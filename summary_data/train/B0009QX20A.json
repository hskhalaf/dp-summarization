Includes wall-mounting rack for convenient storage and tool retrieval. Wera \u2013 The Best Tools For The Job!\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n367/6 SCREWDRIVER SET KRAFTFORM PLUS TORX\u00ae AND RACK\nKraftform Plus screwdrivers enable a higher transfer of force with less effort and relieve the entire hand-arm system \u2013 even with intensive use. Combined with other technical and practical product advantages such as the Lasertip for a secure fit in the screw head, Kraftform screwdrivers are the ideal choice for manual screwdriving jobs.\n\nThe basic idea for the prototype of the Kraftform handle \u2013 that the hand should dictate the design \u2013 has, right through to today, proved to be correct. In cooperation with the internationally recognised Fraunhofer- Institut, Wera developed a screwdriver handle designed to match the shape of the human hand as long ago as the 1960s. After a long development phase, the Wera Kraftform handle was launched to the market in 1968. It has been optimized through the years with new technologies, but has kept its proven shape. After all, the human hand has not changed either.\n\n\nThe outstanding design of the Kraftform handle fits perfectly into the hand to help prevent hand injuries such as blisters and calluses. The large contact area \u2013 with particularly high friction to the soft zones \u2013 results in high torque transfer without any bruising from the edges. The Kraftform handle functions superbly in all application situations, even when the environment often does not allow any direct tool access.\n\nWera makes its Kraftform handles from several materials with different properties. The core is made from a hardwearing plastic that holds the blade securely even when subjected to great forces. The colour-coded soft zones of the external mantle consist of a softer material with more friction resistance for high torque transfer. The black areas with a harder surface prevent the hand from sticking to the handle enabling you to adjust your grip more quickly.\n\nTHE KEY BENEFITS:\n * Kraftform handle fits perfectly into the hand\n * Screw symbol and tip size identification markings on the handle\n * Hexagonal non-roll feature prevents any rolling away\n * Screwdriver set is supplied with a wall-mountable rack\n * Limited lifetime warranty\n * German engineered\n\nThe hexagonal non-roll feature prevents any rolling in the workplace.\n\nThe screwdriver sets are always supplied with a wall-mountable rack. This ensures organised storage and quick access. The rack is also available as an individual item. Screws are not included.\n\nThe screw symbol and tip size identification markings on the handle make it easier to find the right screwdriver in the tool case or at the workplace.\n\nWHY IS THE KRAFTFORM PLUS HANDLE MADE FROM SEVERAL COMPONENTS?\nWera makes its Kraftform handles from several materials with different properties. The core is made from a hardwearing plastic that holds the blade securely even when subjected to great force. The colour-coded soft zones of the external mantle consist of a softer material with more friction resistance for high torque transfer. The black areas with a harder surface prevent the hand from sticking to the handle, enabling quick grip adjustment.\n\nTHIS SET CONTAINS:\nCODE 05028062004 367 TORX\u00ae 1 x\nTX 10x80 1 x\nTX 15x80 1 x\nTX 20x100 \n1 x\nTX 25x100 1 x\nTX 30x115 1 x\n1 x TX 40x130 WHY WERA?\nWera is one of the world's leading manufacturers of screw driving tools under the Wera, Kraftform, and Zyklop brands.
