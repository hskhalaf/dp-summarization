You need to place the headphones perfectly on the base or they will not charge. It takes a little getting used to.",

The only thing I would improve is the tricky part of landing the recharging contacts on the built in recharger. It is not easy to hit the mark so that they begin charging. Another improvement to consider would be to put another optical jack to enable you to connect from a second source like a DVD player. Mine is connected to the cable box. Otherwise this is one sweet setup and the 5.1 optical input is really clean. A great product and listening experience and affordably priced.",

      "text": "I've had these headphones for at least two years and I still love them. I use them to listen to TV and find that the battery lasts a fairly long time before needing to be recharged. They're also extremely comfortable. You can't wander very far away from the base at all without them cutting out, but if you know that ahead of time and this fits your needs, they're great. Although I'm not uber particular when it comes to sound quality, these headphones are certainly LOTS better than the TV speakers (I had a 32\" Samsung HDTV) - movies sound terrific with these babies on. All in all, this is one of the best purchases I've ever made.",

Also the volume control is very difficult to find and use. Very poorly designed item. But they were the only ones I could find to use with my bedroom 26\" Panasonic Viera w/digital audio output. It was either these or my wife would divorce me. And now they don't work! Shorting out one side. DOH!",

The volume level can also be kept much lower than my old wireless headphones (I use them while on the treadmill). My only complaint is that the headband doesn't have a snug feel to it, although that really hasn't been an issue.",
