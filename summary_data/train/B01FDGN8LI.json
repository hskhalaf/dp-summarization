I also like the option to mount to a tripod mount and the option to remove the hood and use it as a screen for others to see. The video out in my case can be used to a spare battery operated tv for others to see while I use the goggles, cool stuff! I enjoy these goggles and recommend them. I was not compsated in this review.",

The EV800 seamlessly found my receiver and began displaying the camera in less than 3 seconds. Up and running in no time. Clear picture and no issues. Light, comfortable and durable. I'm certain there are fancier FPV goggles out there but this one gets you up and running immediately without breaking the back. I strongly recommend buying the circular polarized antennae...it drastically expands your FPV experience with slightly longer distances.",

Also the ease of adding a DVR to this headset is awesome. With my limited soldering skills I got it hooked up in less than 20 minutes. If you're on a budget, these are perfect for flying around a small park, your house, or your backyard. Not the greatest signal strength out of the box, but add a nice cloverleaf antenna and you will not be sorry.",

This is my first headset like this, and it makes fpv a lot more fun for several reasons like huge fov, and really helps focus with no peripheral distractions.

VERY uncomfortable. Second pair ordered 7/31/16 ended up being the old design with a foam pad tossed in the box, no AV port, tiny headphone jack.",

I'm very happy with the resolution there's a bunch of settings in the menu and happy with the price I paid.",

The strap and hood slide off to give you a small screen if you don't want to wear them for whatever reason. Well constructed, everything fits together precisely. Cons: It seems like the battery is sealed and hard to access, no dvr, no diversity but it's only $90.",

I upgraded a few months after having this to another goggle because I needed the DVR. The range is decent, battery life is ok. It Would be nice to have external batteries to switch out if it gets low. Just have to remember to plug in after you fly. Very good begginer goggles, great picture quality. Not too heavy and they are decently comfortable. Would recommend for a begginer, well the 800D !!",

I ordered some SMA-Male antennas for it and was disappointed to see that they wouldn't work. Thankfully they work as replacements for the on-board antenna on the quad.",
