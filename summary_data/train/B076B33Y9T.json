Easy to adjust for just the right angle for reduced glare. The only knock against it is the \u201cnight light\u201d ring around the dimmer switch uses a blue LED, which should be an obvious no-no with what we know about blue light affecting sleep. Thankfully you can turn it off, but you can\u2019t outright disable it; it needs to be turned off every time you use it. Would be five stars if they changed the LED color.",

Once you get use to the touch light control of the nite lite versus the actual light, it\u2019s easy to use and really helps her see to work on her projects, especially when using very thin, black yarns which are hard to work with. It was easy to install and keeps its shape as you adjust it as needed. Well worth the price.",

The touch switch is intuitive and the night light feature is very nice. I will be purchasing more of these lights for the other bedrooms in our home.",

Installation was a breeze(about 2-3 minutes). The provided power cord is very long so getting to the nearest outlet wasn't an issue. The dimmable light is very bright at max setting and can dim to fairly low level. The night light feature is actually brighter in complete darkness than I thought it would be, which is a nice touch, although not really for me. Great product, great price, great functionality.",
