If you're looking for something to puree/liquefy, this thing works like a champ. But if you want just to chop veggies, look elsewhere.",

Not to mention, it attaches to the motor, so you can't put it into water or the dishwasher. Why do so many rate this so highly? Why does Amazon give it best buy rating? Do they LIKE putrified food-stuff in every subsequent chopping of additional food? I just don't get it!",

Only drawback I can see is that it doesn't chop/mince 100% evenly, and consequently the bottom half of the contents gets a bit more thorough workout than the top.

We've tried our full sized food processor and other kitchen gadgets, but the Ninja is the clear winner. We found that as long as you chop vegetables in small batches using short pulses we could achieve some uniformity. With herbs we found that if they are dried after washing the result is also good. The powerful motor and well designed blade really helps the Ninja work better than other devices. You will not be disappointed.",

The only thing I don\u2019t love is that the top with the motor doesn\u2019t stand up on its own so you have to lay it on its side when not in use. Not really a big deal at all, and really that\u2019s the only thing I can think of that I\u2019d change. Super affordable for the quality!",

I also have the high speed blender and processor by Ninja, which I absolutely love (and in my opinion I would use Ninja over Vitamix any day), but I tend to use this smaller Ninja much more often for processing because of its convenience. When this one wears out I will definitely get another. Definitely recommended.",

I made salsa today, my first time using it, it was easy to set up, use and clean BUT my salsa wasn\u2019t as chunky and had a higher water content from the break down of the tomatoes.
