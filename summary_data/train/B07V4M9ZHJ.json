After a few seconds it kicks back again and this gradually gets progressively worse to the point that it does not turn back on for a good 5 - 10 minutes. The bike is unridable now. It is very heavy and without battery assistance it is very difficult to ride. (Watch for yourself). The Hub motor itself or the controller is faulty. Trying to resolve this.

It rides very quiet, also showing good quality. With the battery and the motor, it makes the bike pretty heavy, but with the peddle assist, going up hills is a breeze. I've only had the bike 3 weeks and have only put on 24 miles, but I'm still on the first charge of the battery. I use the direct throttle mode mostly, that way I only use power when I need it instead of all the time that I'm peddling.",

It was easy to assemble, with hardly no adjustments needed for things like the brakes or the gear shift. And it has adequate power, with decent acceleration.

Within a week of having the bike both tubs went flat and I had to get thicker tubs and the tires were pretty worn so I bought new ones. Over all a good bike",

I requested to return the bike, but now I\u2019m unable to take the front wheel off. So I can\u2019t box it up. Even if I can, the box is ginormous and won\u2019t fit in my car; so I can\u2019t take it to UPS to drop it off. I feel like I basically flushed my money down the toilet with this purchase.",

It will be mostly fine for short trips but after sitting unused for a day it goes flat. I don\u2019t recommend this.",
