I picked this up and it perfectly matches what is already installed in my bathroom. The only criticism I have is the hot and cold handles seem out of proportion and small when compared to the faucet neck itself. This however could be more a result of the size of the bathtub itself as it's a fairly big whilrpool/bath that it's attached to. Extremely easy installation of the item though.",

We tried filling it it so it's not that noticeable, but it is a shame the new faucets don't have a a larger base. Another note - I didn't need a rough in probably because I was replacing a delta faucet with a delta faucet.",
