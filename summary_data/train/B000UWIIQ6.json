The Good: -Came sealed correctly. -The packaging had the correct corresponding flavors listed. -Super soft and chewy at first. -Flavors were pretty powerful. Each section of the gummy worm tastes like the flavor it's supposed to. Cons -They aren't very brightly colors, but not really enough to cause alarm. -They lose that fresh softness pretty fast, about 4 days or so. -The variety could be more. Ultimately they are a good buy, I even got them on sale. But I wouldn't be mad at paying 12 dollars for 5 pounds of gummy worms any day really.",

When I went to return it, Amazon said to keep it, so I\u2019ve been eating them for the past two months. Hard to tell the difference between the flavors just by looking at them, and the flavors taste only slightly different, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me. The recloseable bag means they\u2019re still fresh.",
