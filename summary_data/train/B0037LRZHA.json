I normally don\u2019t like to spend so much on skin products, as I usually find very good natural products at reasonable prices. But this product instantly made my skin look bright and healthy. My pimples went away immediately and my blemish scaring disappearing daily. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s supposed to be one of the benefits, however, I haven\u2019t seen my skin bounce back to normal so fast in many years!",

Looks/smells/feels identical in all ways to my good genes purchased at Sephora. Great product, if a bit pricey. I've tried a lot of lactic acid peels and this one is gentle enough to use every day, even with retinoids as part of my skincare, but still very effective and I find this one to be the best for my skin even if it isnt the best for my wallet lol.",
