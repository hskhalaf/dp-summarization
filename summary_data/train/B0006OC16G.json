      "text": "This is a pretty neat gadget and it does what it says, just not as effectively as it claims. I'm attaching this to my Bose Cinemate and it provided me wth the Bass control I was looking for. It depends on what you need it for, most new TVs already have a simulated surround effect, but if you are looking to control a 2 channel speaker system to go from stereo to surround to bypass with the touch of a button then this is right for you. I gave mine a 3.5 star rating because the volume control did not work, not for audio processing. another down is the analog connectors. But for the price, can't complain.",

      "text": "I can't say enough good things about this product! Obviously nothing replaces true 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound, but this very well may be the next best thing! I am using a 2.1 speaking stereo system and I used to have to turn the volume all the way up to get a decent amount of sound from it. Now, I'm using about half the volume I was, and I'm getting the amount of base from the speakers alone, as I was with my sub woofer! The sound is clearer and crisper too. Great investment for $11.50! Love it!",

You can adjust clarity, stereo output and bass with the small remote. The sound is a HUGE improvement and converted my 50 dollar speakers into a true surround sound theater and at the price you really can't go wrong. Note: The little led indicators light up red when it's on. Just a tip for those who are concerned with the visual stuff.",

However, as as a straight-on small stereo amplifier or pre-amp, it does well given its very low price as compared to most others that are available.",
