I could not find in the specifications how close you could get it to the wall or table to get a clear image..... that would help this group of people out a lot. :) Very happy customer.",

The image can be as small or as large as you like, but your image will eventually degrade beyond about 70 inches. This Kodak really delivered accurate detail and color. I am so happy with this device for my purposes. Be sure you purchase the right kind of projector for pictures: DLP Texas Instruments (copyright). Some sellers are claiming to have DLP in a projector, but you really have to check that the proper logo appears on the device. I tried one other, the Apeman, and it didn't compare for image quality, sharpness and color accuracy.",

It can focus from about 6\" away (screen size is gonna be small at this distance) so if youre limited on space like me, this is a great choice for a nice screen size and image quality without having to be 4-5 feet away or taking up too much space with a bulky and expensive short throw projector.",
