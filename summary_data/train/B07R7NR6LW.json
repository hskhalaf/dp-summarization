This is a great bathing suit for someone trying to cover up some tummy. The bottoms fit me perfectly, however the top is a little tinyyyyy bit loose for my liking but i think if i went down a size it would be too tight. Only thing I'm worried about is going in the water and it getting loose. Otherwise, i can't wait to wear this in mexico. Ill probably order the pink and black as well, if everything turns out great on my vacation :)",

The top piece in pink was a tiny bit see through (when wet) if anyone is concerned, this can be fixed with inserting the provided padding.

      "text": "Cute. I feel like it is sized for juniors because it was a little tight, but I will still wear as it covers enough 'bulge'. The straps on the top seem to be oddly placed though, more mid-boob versus off to the sides where normal spaghetti straps would be placed. The material is not lined in the back of the suit so beware of your crack possibly showing through when getting wet. I'm wearing out of the country with all female adults, so I could care less about it being see-through. I am 5'7, size 14-16 and ordered an XL.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve bought plenty of swimming suits here on amazon, but this one is by far my favorite! I\u2019d definitely suggest ordering one size up because it will fit perfectly that way. Very very flattering on the body! Even if you aren\u2019t curvy, it\u2019ll make you look curvy and if you are already curvy it\u2019ll make your curves look amazing. The butt coverage isn\u2019t too much or too little. It\u2019s just perfect for little peek at the cheeks. It makes you look sexy, but still covered where you don\u2019t need to feel self conscious. Great quality for the price. I even have this in black, blue, and red. I\u2019d definitely buy all the colors!",

I just fold the top to make it a bit smaller. Note that the bottom is \"cheeky\" so it will not cover your entire booty! It's also the perfect amount of high-waisted... covers the belly button and ends right above it. So flattering!!!!",

If you try wearing it as a bandeau like pictured, the little loops where the optional straps attach show like little tabs..so either way the top looks really cheap/poorly made in my opinion because the little details show..but its fine for wearing in my backyard.",
