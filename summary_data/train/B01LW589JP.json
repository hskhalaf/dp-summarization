No, I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking this on a through hike of the Appalachian Trail but for weekend warriors, disaster preparedness etc. this is a great kit. If you are doing longer distance ultra light backpacking then of course opt for one of the $80 kits that will save a couple ounces and boil 30 seconds faster. As seen in my photo I could almost fit a 3.5 oz fuel canister and all the items inside the unit except the bowls. Leaving off the smallest bowl/scoop thingy I can fit them all and fuel canister in the mesh bag.",

      "text": "Very pleased thus far. I have a smaller set for solo backpacking by a large brand name that was quite pricey compared to this. This is perfect for car camping trips when I take more people. Lightweight too. It's big for backpacking but if you were splitting your load with someone else it would be great. My compact stove fits right inside too!",

      "text": "Bought this after reading the reviews at outdoorgearlab. Package showed no damage when received. Opened package and larger pot had a big dent in the bottom edge, and the coating was damaged and the aluminum was exposed. Product was fulfilled by amazon, so I returned it. The next day I received an email from the company and they went the extra mile. Within 2 days I had a new replacement set of pots. I have tested both pots and they are right on par with the review noted above. This is an excellent lightweight set for 2 people. You can boil 7 cups of water between the 2 pots, this should be more than enough for food and drink.",

In any case, if the green plastic on the handles melt they can be easily peeled off of the handles.",
