I don\u2019t use a lot of concealers or foundation but a bit of this on my brush with a light moisturizer and I\u2019m done. It\u2019s wonderful. I bought two and am pleased I did!

I wore it all day and never creased or left that weird residue (that I have personally experienced with other products).",
