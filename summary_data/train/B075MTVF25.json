There is no remote or thermostat so it just keeps heating. It heats up rather quickly and is very quiet as well. The lack of thermostat or any type of dial to adjust the temp makes this useless for our intended purpose, which was our bedroom.",

The faux fire place makes a horrendous clicking noise when running. Heater works fine, just the lights. Not sure if something is messed up in the drum or what. Will be contacting customer service. Luckily, it's only 6 screws to remove it. Pretty disappointed actually. Will reassess after speaking to CS.",
