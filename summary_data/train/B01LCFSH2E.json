Installation was a breeze and the effect is just spectacular. Very impressed with the appearance of these lights. Only issue I had was the initial installation power supply used worked for one on/off cycle, and then did not work anymore. Not a problem, as each strand has its' own accompanying power supply, so I just swapped it for another and been working fine ever since.",

However, would totally recommend this product.",

Wrap in electrical tape or a bag to keep dry-haven't had any problems yet in the rain and snow this year, I'll probably buy some more next year if they hold up this season. We bought the multi color and so happy I did. It matches my led color strands perfectly!",
