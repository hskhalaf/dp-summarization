I tried quite a few items as striking instruments before I found what worked for me, including bell mallets and the side of a box end wrench. Whatever you use, it must be very hard to get a good clean sound. For my self, I hot glued a standard size glass marble to the end of a wooden dowel and I have found nothing to work better since. My other issue is that its not very loud. Being a music hobbyist, I could rig a couple vocal condenser microphones to a mixer then to an amplifier and that solved that problem.",

So, I needed another, and I was hesitant to purchase this one, because I thought it would be more likely to tip over than the wooden one. Now that I have received both, I think I prefer this one. Both have a beautiful sound and they sound wonderful together. However, I think this one is actually less likely to get tipped over by over-zealous hands. I highly recommend this quality instrument.",

    "title": "TreeWorks Chimes Medium Top Bar Chime \u2014 MADE IN U.S.A. \u2014 For Percussion Tables, Desks, Classroom Music, Meditation or Yoga, Includes Powder Coated Metal Stand (TRE421)",
    "description": "At TreeWorks Chimes, we specialize in crafting exceptional, high-quality American made percussion instruments from our small shop in Nashville, TN using locally sourced materials. Our specialty started with handcrafting chimes (sometimes called bar chimes, wind chimes or chime trees). These instruments are incredibly well made and produce lush, beautiful waves of tone with a sweep of your hand. They are simple to play. Use your finger to drag along the face of the chime bars just below the hole where the strings are mounted, and let one chime gently drop into the next. TreeWorks does not recommend using a beater or striker, due to the contact sound it creates. The magic comes from the chime bars themselves making contact. The metal 3/8\u201d diameter chime bars are made of TreeWorks' exclusive Aluminum/Titanium alloy, comprised of 11 different metals melted together. They are heat treated for 8 hours to create a crystal clear tone, then the bars are polished to a brilliant finish. The unique chromatic-like tuning has been described as ethereal and shimmering\u2014great for any music or sound immersion setting. The mantle, TreeWorks' name for the wooden frame, is crafted from solid Tennessee hardwood. The deep color is brought out with a hand-rubbed oil finish that is high-end, yet understated. Each chime bar is individually hand-tied to the mantle. One-bar-at-a-time. NO PLASTIC TIES and NO STAPLES are used. The braided CordLoc(TM) we use can hold up to 50 pounds (think miniature rappelling rope). To say TreeWorks chimes are durable is an understatement. This chime is great for using on your desk, a percussion table or for meditation and yoga. The stand makes for quick set up and takes up practically no space\u2014no assembly is required. Its \u00bc\u201d diameter metal frame is hand-bent in our shop and will keep the chimes from tipping over. With a simple sweep of your hand a wondrous tone is released. It is a calming way to begin meditation. The perfect signal for a teacher to begin class. That extra something you add to the end of the song. There are many uses for this beautiful instrument. No musical training needed. Made in Nashville, Tennessee, U. S. A.",
