      "text": "Beware of photos. This speaker does not stand upright. bought this speaker because Wirecutter rated it as the top portable wireless Bluetoothspeaker, but I realized to my great surprise that there was no way to stand the speaker upright as all the photos of it picture it. The loop shown in the photos that looks as if it is a right stand is in fact a rope for hanging the speaker. The speaker's sound quality and controls are, indeed, as Wirecutter says, excellent. However, I need a speaker that sends sound outward into the room and not toward the ceiling. So I took advantage of Amazon's generous return polity and sent the speaker back.",

It can't even make the minimum advertised battery time when played near full volume (So its not working as advertised there), even when you give the speaker a break. battery does seem to last much better and as advertised when played at lower volume sort of around half volume. Amazing sound and form factor for a speaker this size and price. good features too except no 3rd button on device. I'm considering retiring to manufacture since I seem to be alone with this battery experience, but remember this is a compact speaker so it will never last as long as it's larger siblings.",

I don't think it's an issue with my phone because I am able to connect to other bluetooth devices with no problem. I have tried both the associated app and my bluetooth settings menu to no avail. I am hoping to find a solution soon, but until then, my speaker is rendered virtually useless.",

Honestly one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers, great volume and clarity with minimal to no distortion at full volume. If you buy 2 you can set them up to link up and play in true stereo form. Also when two are paired together they are loud enough to be heard over the sound of a motorcycle running at 75 mph on the highway. Rin\u0303e or shine great for hiking and camping, and I take these to the beach every single time, great design, easy to use and most importantly works when wet since it is extremely water resistant.",

      "text": "Rich, full sound with more bass and treble than one would expect, and the sound quality gives other more expensive systems a run for their money. Volume can completely fill a good-sized room or rooms without distortion. Outdoors or in a car the bass can get lost, but the highs remain clear. The large, accessible volume controls on top are handy, responsive and the most convenient aspect of the design. Compatible and easy to control with an iPhone app, but easier still to pair it once via Bluetooth and it will always connect thereafter when powered up and remember one's previous settings. Equalizer presets are standard and can also be customized.",
