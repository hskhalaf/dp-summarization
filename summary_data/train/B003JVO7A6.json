Upon two washes, the shirt remains wrinkled where it touched sunscreen. Not pleased with the way this shirt reacted to sunscreen. It obviously has to be worn with sunscreen around your arms, face, etc - so this seems to be poor quality or bad planning. Material does feel soft, but would not purchase again given the wrinkles - this was after 5 minutes of wear...",

I would suggest going a size bigger than you normally wear. That is my only reason for not giving a 5 star rating.",

Like some reviews say, it fits a bit snugger than a normal t-shirt. However this is what you want as when it gets wet it will fit slightly larger. Fits close to the chest up top and more normal towards the waist. If you are looking for a baggy fit that compares more to a normal t-shirt then I would recommend going at least one size larger.",
