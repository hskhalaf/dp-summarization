      "text": "I purchased these cards to assist in studying for the CAPM exam. I quickly realized a two things about these cards. 1. The cards are not current for the PMBOK 6th edition. There are cards containing information that was removed. 2. They are very wordy, is it more like studying small chapters from the book than actually a flash card. While still somewhat useful for quick studying the information being old is concerning.",

      "text": "My only study material was the latest PMBOK and these flash cards. I took two weeks off work and I started off by reading the PMBOK and then using the flash cards. I would study the cards and put the ones I could not answer into a separate pile. I went back and studied the sections of the PMBOK I had problems with and then reviewed the cards in that pile again. I repeated this process until that pile was practically non-existent. I was able to pass the test the first time. I have never taken the PMP test, so I can't say if this method of study would work for that as well.",
