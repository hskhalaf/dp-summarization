      "text": "This ball is so much better than the prior ball. This ball is more responsive to spin, so you can shape serves and hits more easily. It also doesn't float up nearly as readily as the prior ball. Both of these things are good in that you can work to have a better serve and you have to earn a good serve. (That prior ball felt like the best move was just to serve a floater and hope it didn't something wild.)",
