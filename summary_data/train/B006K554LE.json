      "text": "I bought this camera to replace a damaged 2012 model of the Cybershot series. Unbeknownst to me, it is a compact version of the original. The zoom button has been moved to the back of the camera, which makes a one-hand shot w/zoom more difficult. I actually looked for the 2012 model and fortunately was able to find some in stock yet. The larger version of the cyber-shot had a larger lens & was better-proportioned all around, with the zoom more conveniently located on the top of the camera. Cyber shot line is quite good for the price, but the larger model is easier to maneuver. The compact series are just too small for larger hands.",

My other Sony (touch screen technology) was stolen and even though I had to pay $150.00 to have it repaired at one point I loved the camera. Will probably end up giving this to a grand child as a first camera. This is why I don't like ordering on line. I know it was my fault for not reading more carefully but I thought it was a \"given\" that it had a touch screen.",

I have owned 5 Cybershots prior to this one and had been trying to buy this particular one for several weeks after I had dropped my previous one, but was unavailable (pre-order). In the end, I was excited to finally get it. I like the size of Cybershots and the simplicity, but in this case, the photos were horrible. Not to say that I might've gotten a lemon, but I wasn't going to take another chance.",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W690 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)",
    "description": "Color:BlackThe Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W690 Digital Camera is a super-compact point-and-shoot with more under the hood than meets the eye. This sleek little number is host to a 16.1Mp image sensor, a 3.0\" LCD screen, Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, 10x optical zoom, and more! And in addition to capturing stills, the W690 also records 720p HD video. A bevy of auto functions also come in handy by taking the guesswork out of image making. Functions like iSCN, Natural Flash, Picture Effect, and more do all the hard work while you enjoy the memory in-progress.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nSONY CYBER-SHOT DSC-W690 16.1 MP DIGITAL CAMERA WITH 10X OPTICAL ZOOM AND 3.0-INCH LCD \n\n * 10x optical zoom\n   \n * Capture your videos in 720p HD Movie mode\n * Take stunning images in Sweep Panorama mode-up to 360\u00b0\n * 16.1 MP plus a 3.0-inch LCD\n   \n * Optical SteadyShot image stabilization reduces blur\n   \n * Picture Effect for more expressive photos\n * iAuto mode automatically optimizes camera settings\n * Face Detection and Smile Shutter technologies\n   \n * Anti-Blink, Face Priority and Red Eye Reduction functions\n * Soft Skin mode reduces visible blemishes and wrinkles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShoot beautiful photos and HD 720p video with the slim Sony 16.1MP DSC-W690. Get close to your subject with the stabilized 10X optical zoom lens, use its colorful 3.0-inch LCD to compose and share images, and select the iSCN mode to automatically set the best exposure for tricky scenes.\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n10X OPTICAL ZOOM\nThe Sony 10x optical zoom G lens brings distant subjects super close for great outdoors, sports, and travel photos. The compact size makes it easy to take with you in a pocket, purse, or backpack.\n\n\n720P MP4 HD MOVIE MODE\n\nIn 720p MP4 movie mode, the DSC-W690 shoots 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps, a standard format when working with a PC.1 Users will create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac computer. Once transferred to your computer and connected to the internet, you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube.\n\nSWEEP PANORAMA MODE-UP TO 360\u00b0\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360\u00b0 full circle, the DSC-W690 can take a variety of panoramic shots. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.\n\n\n16.1 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR\n\nA powerful 16.1 megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 16.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19 inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots.\n\n3.0-INCH CLEAR PHOTO LCD DISPLAY\nGenerous 3.0-inch (230K dots) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight.\n\n\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT IMAGE STABILIZATION\n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\n\n\nINTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground, landscape shots, a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT FOR MORE EXPRESSIVE PHOTOS \n\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects. \n\nPHOTO CREATIVITY\nPhoto Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera\u2019s monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting.\n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY \n\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY \n\n\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority andindicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\n\n\nANTI-BLINK FUNCTION \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\n\nSOFT SKIN MODE\n\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION (ISCN) MODE\n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\nNATURAL FLASH\n\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\n\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE OPTIMIZER\n\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing.\n\nSELF-PORTRAIT TIMER\nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self-portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture. \n\n\n * \n * \n\n1. Records in 29 minute segments",
