Have them hooked up to replace small home theater in a box set of speakers. Good clarity. I went a step further and ordered a stereo equalizer so I could customize the sound and make is more crisp. I wear hearing aids, so sound shaping is important to enjoying home theater and music. I believe the Fluance speakers provide very good bang for the buck for a modest sized (13' x 19') listening area, along with a subwoofer.",

I do agree with earlier comments about the need for a subwoofer to complete this system. I happen to have a wonderful Klispch 8 inch powered sub that makes these speakers sound like those costing twice the price Attention to detail is extends to the packaging for shipment.

With the ability to double wire each speaker, I can provide more power to the speakers and thus there is more sound definition. I will buy Fluance for my speakers from now on.",
