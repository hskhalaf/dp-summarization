No flickr, no lag. The wireless card is excellent. I have Spectrum 100Mb internet, and there is very little dropoff from ethernet to wifi. I consistenly acheive 100Mb on wifi, and about 110-115 on ethernet. The wifi connection is rock solid, which may be due in part to the Motorola MG 7315 Wifi Modem I have. So far, this machine has performed flawlessly for me. The build quality is excellent. For the price, I don't believe you can find a more well-configured machine.",

The memory and hard drive are easily accessible, the replacements took about 15 minutes to install. Overall, very satisfied with this machine. By the way, the 128GB SSD is a SK Hynix M.2, I may replace that eventually, I've only had it for about ten days. Okay review update time. I still love this machine, it's a little slow on battery but holds a charge well when using the Intel graphics adapter. I highly recommend the purchase, you won't be disappointed.",

I don't understand what some people are saying about the fan being loud, my laptop is pretty quite and so far has only gotten warm - not hot, but that's an easy fix if it did. Battery life is great for normal use but I leave it plugged in for heavier use so cannot comment on how long it goes for gaming. All in all I think this is a GREAT little laptop. If you're expecting a tower pc you might be disappointed but no laptop compares to one. Good buy and I'm very happy with it.",

      "text": "So far its been a great laptop. Wife pretty much set it up and got her games going without much help and the games (ESO and FO4) look & play great. Good budget gaming laptop. Edit: Taking a star due to bad specs in the listing, we love it and it works great with our high demand games, but it doesn't have the same ports listed which is causing some issues until we get a splitter/hub. Its short at least one USB port and I think one other type, but I'm going to check it against the listing again when I get home tonight to see what else.",

The laptopn is always cool and at low tempreatue even at high load (playing games). The only problem is that its so loud but thats not a big deal as its a laptop and the fans produce loud sound to keep the device cool. Finally i would really suggest anyone buying this.",
