After 2 uses one failed on the highway. I contacted Malone who dragged out the return for almost a year until I finally contacted Amazon who allowed me to return them. Malone never even asked me to return the cradles to them to inspect. I suspect that they know there is a manufacturing flaw in the new design. As I said, I used the first set for years and they were great, but I'm done with Malone. Poor product, and even worse customer service.",

It also voids the warrantee if you don't use them for a trip. 2) Make sure you check and tighten up the wing nuts on your first stop after hauling your kayak as mine needed an extra quarter turn after its initial carry on my first trip.",

No matter how tight you turn the hard-to-reach thumb screws, the brackets will slip back and forth on your side rails. Worse, the red straps are a major hassle. You're supposed to feed them through an open guide at the top of each J-bracket but they pop right out as soon as you throw your boats up there and then you can't slide them to the proper lengths because they get bound up. So getting two kayaks up there after a long day on the river is a struggle\u2014especially if you lack upper-body strength and aren't 7 feet tall.",

I have an Outback with oblong bars, and the brackets do not have much contact. They should offer a few different shapes of brackets to have an even better fit.

Because of the product's lifetime warranty, Aaron at Malone technical support resolved immediately (and for free!) three issues: first, he sent me new brackets to better fit my 2013 Ford Escape. Second, he replaced a release pin that broke. He also sent me a replacement pad for the base when I lost it. There's something to be said for a company with such great customer service to support their great product. I bought two sets of these and used them all summer for my two kayaks... Dynamite.",

The first set I bought from another source and paid around $140, these were around $100, only problem was that they came in a plain box with no mounting hardware or any of the straps and bow lines. Luckily I contacted Malone customer service and they were very helpful in supplying the missing parts for free, no questions asked. So I rate the carriers 5 stars and Amazon 1 star.",

Fold down feature and the strapping feature is great versus standard carriers where you have to tie down the kayak with loops etc. For the next feature, try to work in a way to easily get the straps back over the kayak once you've loaded the kayak in order to tighten it down. If you can do that then you get that 5th star! :-)",
