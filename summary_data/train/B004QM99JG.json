My folks who have Windows and Macs went through endless problems getting their Macs (and sometimes Windows computers) to work together with a printer. Many printers did not have Mac specific drivers so compatibility had to be kluged, or even had to be connected to their Windows computer with the Mac connecting to that shared printer to use it. With this MFC7860DW, every PC, Mac, MacBook, laptop, tablet and smartphone, etc. connects directly, wirelessly, easily and reliably so far, to print and scan with the Brother Mac drivers/software. Also we successfully printed and scanned with both a Samsung Galaxy SIII and and iPhone 4.",

They eat toner like crazy. Even with the larger cartidge it seems like we're replacing them very frequently. Second, I bought this one because its predecessor began chewing up the paper I have to assume because the rubber rollers went bad after 2 years. Never could figure it out. Which leads me to my last and biggest issue and that is support. The support is automated and therefore useless. When the Brother runs it runs great. If some glitch happens - you're on your own",

For large print jobs carefully watch the out feed tray. The paper does not lie flat and square, which creates artificial height, which may create a paper jam at the out feed rollers.

The scanning software that comes with it is quite good and allows me to OCR documents into usable text files about as good as the high-end scanners that I purchase prior to the Brothers. It does a nice job of converting documents into text and is an easy machine to use. the issue, of course, is toner. I experimented and found an expensive replacement cartridge that works quiet well. it helps to manage the cost. I have no regrets on any of these Brother machines.",
