      "verdict": "Overall, the Nike PG2 is a solid on-court performer\u00a0and\u00a0 arguably better than the first. Everything about these basketball shoes just works, and all the performance-oriented enhancements are on point. Right off the bat, wide-footers feel the improvement with the shoe\u2019s fit.

I have pair of original Jordan \"quilted\" sneakers from the 70's I think that I wore maybe twice because his foot is too different from mine. They were great walking down the aisle of airplanes and having everyone staring at them, but nothing to compare with the comfort of these PG 2.5s. Paid exorbitant amount because they are getting rare, but could not let this pair pass.",

The large metal eyelet sits right on top of my ankle bone, rubbing the skin away during most lateral movements. Even with a sock covering the ankle, the shoes are still painful. Wearing a low cut no show sock is not an option for me wearing these shoes. I wouldn't purchase these again.",
