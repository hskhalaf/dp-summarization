SCRUTINIZE THE FOOD BEFORE FEEDING- I had to run to the store to get single replacement cans, and upon opening them and comparing they were a brighter color of pate and there was no dark cloudiness in the gel.",

So, sad to say, won't be ordering it again.",

Since I started her on this she has only thrown up the first day when starting the transition, and she\u2019s been better ever since. She\u2019s more energetic, her coat is in better shape, and she\u2019s finally being more interactive and not hiding somewhere throwing up or trying to hack up a lung.",
