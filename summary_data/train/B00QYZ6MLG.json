I don't get the jitters from it but I am sure for people sensitive to caffeine wouldn't be able to handle a full serving, I stack this with creatine and trace minerals. If I could give this ten stars I would. I am about 270 lbs and have been working out for over 20 years, this has helped tremendously with making gains. This is also super clean compared to all other pre-workout supps, and I highly recommend it!",

Two serving options, 1 scoop for watching TV and 2 scoops for putting in work. Powder mixes up good, no clumping or anything. This definitely gets you up and motivated. I thought with all the caffeine that I was going to crash and burn like Maverick and Goose but to my surprise it let me down gently like a high school girlfriend. Little cheaper than Pre-Jym and a few more servings. Will probably buy again.",

I definitely would recommend giving this a try, though.",

I was really disappointed that it changed as well as the fact that there was no notification of the product changing. Hoping they go back to the original formula, but until then might have to find something different",

I haven't really felt a huge crash, but I could tell when it was leaving my system. And I didn't mind the taste as much as I expected to. Overall I'm very happy with this product.",

There is definitely the tingling feeling that lasts a good 20 to 30 minutes. I use this product to help wake me up in the morning and motivate me to go work out. This is actually one of my favorite flavors. I mix it with about 4 oz. of water so the flavor is more concentrated.",
