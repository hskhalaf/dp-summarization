You can still achieve the spirals and bullseyes but the colors bleed into each other. I can\u2019t recommend Tulip but I\u2019ve used Dharma Trading company a handful of times and their dyes and products are AWESOME! They are a little more expensive but worth it!",

It came with easy to follow instructions & tips, rubber bands, gloves (8 pairs), and a plastic bag or two to put your shirts in while they dry. It's a great kit. Also, they say to use the dyes very soon after adding water or they'll lose vibrancy. That seems to be somewhat true but it doesn't mean the extra is worthless. I left older dye on a little longer and it just makes for a slightly diluted, but not horribly faded look.",
