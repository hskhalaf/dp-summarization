It works on most stains but I have found that it does not work on ink, koolade, blood, crystal light ,grape or red juice ,beats, red wine or dried fleeces . Other than the feeces alcohol sparkling water and or vinegar and peroxide work best. What it is good for is keeping the stain from setting. You just have to use the appropriate cleaner for these spots . I like it because it's small enough to be mobile.",

You have to wait to put on stain before washing, depending on quality of fabric use warm or cold wash.. If rarely item comes out wet with any little stain left, do not put in dryer. Put more on and wash again... I use on carpets, furniture etc. Don't worry about blue color, it will go away with wash or water. But hands down best stain remover around, especially for whites. The spray and detergent version to use on whites is best. I recommend warm, not hot water - unless you want shrinkage.",
