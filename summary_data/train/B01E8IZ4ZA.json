This ice roller works so well to ease the pain from sinuses and tension. It froze very quick and I felt instant relief. The rolling motion even cleared my sinuses and I could breathe better right away. I love this. Would highly recommend.",

I read other reviews about people complaining that the handle is plastic and cheap.... COME ON people YOURE paying LESS than $20.00 for this what do you expect?? Top of the line material??",

Not to mention, when used on my face, it leaves my skin feeling tight and wakes me up in the mornings. It also stays cold for forever, but it never sweats or leaves water behind. It's like magic. I also bought one for my mom who suffers from nerve damage in her arms and legs. I think it'll really help when she has bad pain days.",

Everyone has a different shaped face so maybe that makes the difference. I use the ice roller first thing in the morning to help me to wake up and reduce puffiness under my eyes. It makes my skin feel tight and I have a nice healthy glow for the day. There were several reviews that said that this ice roller is good for migraines and I bet it is. I'm going to buy one for a friend that suffers from migraines.",

So far I haven't had any issues with re-attaching after cooling the ice roller. One thing to know though is that the ice roller can accidentally pop out if you apply too much pressure on it - but again no issues with putting it back in. This has really been so convenient for the summer heat and unexpected humidity of the year. I enjoy using it and so does my mom. I can't really say anything else about it regarding skincare absorption mostly because the main purpose for me is to have something cool for my face.",
