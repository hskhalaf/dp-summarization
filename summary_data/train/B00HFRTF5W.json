The space behind the motherboard and the back removable panel is tight in my opinion. I was surprised at the weight of the case - it was light. No soundproofing material. Overall, a 7 out of 10 IMO. Corsair cut every corner they could for the almighty dollar. From the reviews I read, I expected more. I sent it back immediately and repurchased a Thermaltake case I used in an earlier build. Good luck to you and your purchases.",

Unlike that one this is flimsy, quality control has dropped with pain chips, bent storage bay, and generally the layout isn't as perfectly designed as the other. The case is light but very easy to bend and didnt sit flat on a table, it would rock if you touched it. The front panel isnt as attractive with the visible case fans and the side panel glass is plastic and not symmetrical with the rest of the case. Its slightly offset. As a Corsair fan this is a disappointment. Avoid if you are looking for a 350D quality case.",

I ended up getting aftermarket filters from DEMCiflex for the top panel and intake fans. Maybe they made the large mesh to increase airflow.",

You will have to buy one from Corsair (Search obsidian 350D Dust cover on their site) or from 3rd party manufacturers. This seems like a \"duh\" moment for Corsair - the part is $3.99 to purchase, why not include it with a case that costs ~$100? Outside of that oversight, the case is solid.

Pros: - Great Airflow - Less silent - Cool dual 140mm Fans - Easy to clean magnetic filters and front vent - Good Cable management - The PSU gets a cold air at the bottom rather than getting warm air from the MoBo above. - and specially, the CPU cooler catches more air. cons: - nothing. Conclusion: This is a must-have case for gamers, because this one has it all! however, liquid cooling might be a best option for overclocking or casual gaming when it comes to a warm temperature.",

It will fit most of your general components, including full sized graphics cards (I got a GTX 780 in there with no problem). The major con to watch out for is that you can't fit just any 240mm radiator in the case. I had originally purchased a Corsair H105, but it's too wide, and I had to return it and bought an H100i off a friend to use. As long as it is about as skinny as that radiator, it should fit fine.",

Cable management is a bit tricky, but that could be because I've never built with a case this small before. It looks really nice though, and it does a good job of muffling noise. Every vent on this case has a magnetic filter to keep dust out, that is a huge plus to me.",

I only wish they included the air filter for the top of the case, I had to buy and after market one. The tool free design is pretty nice, it makes installing the drives real easy. All in all, I would definitely recommend this case to others.",
