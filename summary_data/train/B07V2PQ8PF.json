I sleep better and have less pain because of this pillow. It is made of quality materials and comes with a great breathable spandex cover. Best pillow for the $",

For me it is softer than I prefer (I could sleep on a cinder block) but she loves it and the scent is very light, I dont smell it in bed at all. She hasn't complained about her neck so I would say it was perfect for her needs support wise from a pillow.",

I have a foam mattress cover that makes me feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud. So why shouldn't my head get the same treatment? I was leery of the pillow at first. It felt soft and the holes were unusual. But I gave it a try. Oh my stars. It's like my head was cocooned in a marshmallow. Soft, but firm. And there was no weird bunching up of stuffing, so no need to flip to find the fluffiest side. I usually get up 4,5 times a night, but I slept 6 hours without moving. Yes please!",

      "text": "I've only had this for a month or so, so I can't speak to the longevity of the pillow. But it's extremely comfortable and doesn't lose its shape like normal pillows. The memory shape really holds its form and never gets flat throughout the night. It does have a cool side, which is nice, but the coolness doesn't last all night. I would say it stays cold for about 30 minutes-1 hour of laying on it. But I didn't get it for that, so I'm fine with that. Love it!",

It had small holes in it and is shrink wrapped in some weird plastic, additionally, it has a strangely weird smell that smells like musty? It smells like a towel that did not dry right in the dryer. I have wiped it down with clorox wipes and a wet towel with dish soap\u2014 but since it cannot be put in the washing machine i fear i am stuck with the odor.. i can smell it through the pillowcase. other than that it is a good product.",

I use one normal pillow underneath this pillow and wow, my head has great support and comfort. It forms around my head and keeps me steady. No more constantly adjusting my pillow in the middle of the of night. The cooling gel side does it\u2019s job well, which is great for my sleeping needs.",

I also have the yellow PharMeDoc pillow, which although thoroughly satisfactory is a little soft for my liking. Would buy this green one again in a heartbeat.",
