They fit well, are comfortable enough to wear all day, easy to get on and off, not sized in weird proportions, have excellent dexterity, and the touch screen perfance is excellent. I just wish they would last longer. They are very robust in construction. However, after use in dirtier job environments (like handling corroded steel) the touch screen feature starts to suffer. I find that after 9 months to a year of steady use they are worn out and need to be replaced. 'Not really that bad and after trying other brands nothing else is worth buying.",

Raking, mowing, weed trimming, they are actually better than regular work gloves. Fingers fit in switch loops, you can manipulate cords and buttons. Palms grip most materials without being overly bulky. Probably not what you would want for daily construction work, but for most peoples purposes these work really well. For the price of $10 they are way better than the cheap ones from the hardware store. Oh, and they're still good for working on cars.",

They compress down well in a pocket, are very slim and trim while providing a fair amount of hand protection while maintaining good dexterity.
