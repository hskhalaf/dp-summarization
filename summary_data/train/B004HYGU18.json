It's a third of what a magic mouse costs, and it does its job with a few minor annoyances.",

Also when the PC is left unattended for a while (turned on) but you don't use the mouse for a while I had to turn it off and on again to make it work. The gestures are nice but I couldn't get used to the lack of middle button (specially useful to open links in new tabs in Chrome for example).",

So it's not too useful if you play certain games. Another side note for gamers is that you may inadvertently trigger things with the touch pad while playing. As you can see there's no middle wheel, if you use it a LOT in certain programs, you might still prefer the roll to the touch-slide.",

It works great for what it does and has many gestures you can use, similar to the magic mouse. My biggest quip with the Microsoft Touch Mouse is that is isn't as comfortable to hold in your hand as the Apple Magic Mouse. I would recommend for users seeking a similar experience though.",

I have a hard time remembering to turn it off after use so I run them dry fairly quickly. I do Graphic Design and being able to lock windows with a simple gesture is AWESOME.

It does come with a USB extension for the receiver so it can give you an extra 3-4 ft but I've never used one before. Other than the distance issue, the mouse is great. Once I customized the settings for my uses, it has to be the best touch mouse I've ever used with Windows 8.1. This mouse also gives you more customization settings than other mice do using the Microsoft Keyboard & Mouse Center. If you are a Windows 8 user and the distance is not an issue, I would definitely recommend getting this particular mouse.",

The touch features are amazing, make browsing the web and using a computer so much simpler. Gestures and touch-detection are accurate and snappy. Can't recommend it enough in terms of being both high-quality and future-proof.",

The mouse actually has physical buttons for left and right click but lacks a middle click. I was able to work around this problem but using a simple program created by a developer that adds function to the mouse and allows you to manipulate a middle click. I wish the mouse functioned this way straight out of the box but for some it might not even be an issue. The built in gestures to manipulate windows are quite handy once you get familiar with them as well. Overall a great mouse that is missing one specific feature.",

The three finger and two finger swipes do work quite well and their function is useful. The scrolling is really as bad as people say, it actually induces pain after as little as 10 minutes. It seems to respond randomly. The texture on the mouse feels nasty, like crumbs are permanently stuck to the surface. The whole thing smacks of design by committee and build to price. This product does nothing but harm to the Microsoft brand.",
