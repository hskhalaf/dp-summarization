You can control how bright it gets. You have a host of options on alarm sounds and radio. It looks great by itself, which is saying something for a funky light.

My one criticism is that the clock has no built-in backup battery, so that you have to reset it manually after a power failure, and may miss your wake-up time. In some places that's not something you'd worry about very often, but where I live there are frequent power cuts. I think a backup battery should be a standard feature in a device that costs over one hundred dollars.",

It was kind of hard to figure out at the beginning, especially when I kept bumping it, but you get used to it after a couple of days. There are so many different settings and levels of light. You can change pretty much anything on this clock. It also doesn't clear out if you accidentally unplug it or have to move it. I just wish my dog wouldn't wake me up when the light starts up!",

      "text": "I liked it in concept, and it was working pretty well for a time. The light was easy to adjust and it was refreshing to wake up to. However recently with no rhyme or reason, the clock will randomly make the 'tick' noise that should only sound when you hit the on-screen buttons. I've had to resort to just leaving it permanently unplugged because it will randomly start making the noise and it won't stop. It's actually quite creepy, especially at night. I've come home from work and the clock has been making the noise for who knows how long. Not worth the money.",

But it works as well as the previous one and has some additional features that I appreciate (two alarm settings, sunrise simulation, the ability to choose not to have any alarm sound, the 24-hour clock). All in all, I'm very happy with it.",
