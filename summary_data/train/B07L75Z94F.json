When I wanted to buy another one, Amazon said there are no more, so I bought this model instead, assuming it would be even better. However, this product (the LAPAC1750C) is terrible because it doesn't work and tech support tells me they can't support it on a Saturday (like their \"home\" products) because it is a \"business\" product, which is supported only Monday through Friday. So the fact that I am trying to set it up for a house on a Saturday because I have to work Monday through Friday is completely lost on them. What a stupid policy. I will likely return the device.",

In my case, since I already own both, I returned to the Orbi. First, this mandates cloud set-up which sounds good but it less than impressive in action.
