This humidifier is so much more effective than what I have been using. The true test will come when we are running the pellet stove 24-7. I love orchids and they don't like the dry air so much. They are very happy, as am I! It runs all night and I can easily vary the density of the mist. It is just fabulous. I confess I was a little leary because the price was more than I am used to, but it's worth every penny.",

      "text": "I absolutely loved this unit, for two months. I used this daily and kept if filled and clean. All was great. We have had wet weather and then warmer weather so I left if off for 5 days. When I filled the tank and turned it on...NOTHING! I cleaned it, and refilled it and still no green light! Checking to see what kind of warranty after Amazon's 30 days. What a shame. Reading reviews I see this is a somewhat common issue. Dern it. Too Good to last.",

      "text": "Despite scrubbing the bottom between fills and using a demineralizing product the unit only worked about 10 times. You could see the mist but it wouldn't come out of the unit. I cleaned it multiple times and decided to get a refund. Maybe if I'd used distilled water but never had that many issues with my other humidifiers.",

Only thing I am disappointed with is that it is shown as being bought with a fish to help keep the tank clean.....the fish will NOT fit into the opening of the tank, so don't bother.",

The one that doesn't work well produces a very low amount of mist on the highest setting. I've cleaned it several times per the manual instructions and it has not helped the mist output at all. I have to run the humidifier on the highest setting to get any mist at all. On halfway or low there is no mist at all.",
