I was pleased that I was able to find such a perfect solution for her.

It is easy to setup, and high quality construction. Ir provides a place for everything so we can avoid diving into the back of the minivan to find lost pencils / pens. I really like the side pockets, and the pencil included pencil set! It helped us avoid a last minute trip to the store before our trip. I highly recommend.",
