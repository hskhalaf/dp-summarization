IF we could have gotten the discount on a replacement, we would have ordered a half-size down, but you can't transfer the Prime Day discount, sadly--and Amazon should reconsider that for clothing/shoe items where trying them on matters so much. Beautiful, gorgeous blue. Very attractive sneaks. The laces are a tad brighter than the suede part, but just totally cool sneaks.",
