The reviews made me a bit hesitant but I even ordered one that was \u201clike new\u201d with damage to the box and the table came PERFECT! The shipping was actually very secure. It doesn\u2019t look cheap like my last one, and it has all the storage I need. I don\u2019t see it chipping or staining at all. (Which is why I was worried about the white). Quick and easy to build. But seriously, look no further, this coffee table is the best on the market for this price!!!! So in love!",

Most have an easy locking screw, this product uses a slip bolt that must line up to the hole the connecting screw feeds into. It\u2019s a lot of feeling and hit or miss. At one point I was unable to get one screw in only to find out the thread was defective and would screw into any of the adjoining slip bolts. I had to improvise and use a regular screw and drill my own hole. But over all this table is sturdy and looks good in my space. It\u2019s the perfect size as well.",
