Bottom line, reliable and easy to use entry level CD-RW.",

Problems seem really common with Iomega; I would not buy another Iomega item unless there was a very compelling reason. I had an internal Iomega Zip drive and that broke too. Iomega has real quality control problems and appears to be willing to release products before they are proven to be reliable. Because of Iomega's particularly bad record with external CD-RW's, I would be HIGHLY hesitant to get this specific device.",

You said that the USB interface is modular with the Predator, and that if you upgrade to a machine with firewire, you could upgrade the interface. I have firewire now, does this mean that I could choose to use a firewire interface with this drive? Also I think that Toast will allow you to set your cache buffer up to 4 times the write speed, to avoid the underruns. You can also get a little help by increasing the RAM allotment to Toast.",
