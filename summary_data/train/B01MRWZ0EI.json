When I received it I saw that it was adjustable, so I adjusted it to fit the pistachio's I had been saving to try out this Nut Cracker. It worked great. The first one I tried blew apart in a million pieces. I readjusted the anvils and the next one cracked perfectly. Might sound silly to spend money on pistachio's, but I love these nuts and hate it when I have some that are not open. Would recommend this to anyone.",

Also the design seemed to suggest you can control the pressure against the nut so that it could be cracked open without damaging the meat. The pressure required to crack the shell is so high, that when the shell breaks, it smashes into the meat. This could be corrected by a longer lever but the relatively small size of the unit and the base makes it unsuitable to open macadamia nuts.",
