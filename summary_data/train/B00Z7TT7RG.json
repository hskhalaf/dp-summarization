Easy to put on and fits well. Arrived on time and in \"frustration-free\" packaging. A little pricey, but worth the investment to protect an expensive device.

For gigs, we just put it on a regular music stand. There are iPad holders that attach to mic stands, but unfortunately, they don't offer any protection to the iPad while it's in the holder, so we've opted for this method instead.",

Between my grandkids and myself, protection is needed and this delivers. It has been dropped and sat on and like every Otter Box I have owned, it fully protects my device. Worth every penny!",
