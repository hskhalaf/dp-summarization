The time it takes to read your fingerprint and open is about 5 - 10 SECONDS, and it doesn't even pop open with spring assisted. And say it can't read your finger prints for whatever reason. The \"code\" buttons don't even WORK!! Except for the first one which you have to press in order to read your fingerprint. If I knew about this I would have not wasted my money on it.",

After setting up the fingerprint reader, it sometimes takes 15-20 finger swipes before the reader will open the box. I would have just used the manual finger key pad, but when they added the finger print reader to the design, they disabled the keypad so you can only use the fingerprint reader or key to open, so it truly is worthless. Terrible design!! The only good news is that once locked up, your kids can't get into it. Unfortunately, you can't either when you really need it!!!!",

I don;t trust the biometric element that much, so even if mine did work properly I would not have used it as my primary pistol storage. The return process was pretty simple ass most Amazon Prime stuff is, maybe I should have read the description even closer somehow, but why is there four buttons on the top if only one has a purpose?",

If there's an urgent need to access my gun I need the key, the bio-metrics is simply unpredictable.

I don't carry every day and probably only need to open the safe 6-8 times per week (3-4 uses, in-and-out). Even at this low usage, the batteries dies every few weeks. If used for the purposes of home protection, I would suggest either changing the batteries quite often or having the keys handy. I read the reviews beforehand, so I had some idea that this would be the case, so I gave it four stars.",

It works but you must swipe your finger the exact same way each time. It can sometimes take several passes before opening. I have tried reprogramming it several times to no avail.. I find this strange since it is not new technology. The bio-metric scanner on my laptop is much more accurate and it is a few years old. I'm sure Gunvault can do better.",

Lots of blogs out there on the internet warn of this already, unfortunately I didn't shop around enough before purchase. Also, the biotmetric reader on the safe is a joke. Don't make the same mistake. Buyer Beware!!!",

What's I've noticed is there is a little lag between hitting the button and it's willingness to read your print. It would get 5 stars if you could hit the button, and slide your print in one motion, but instead you have to hit the button, wait 1-2 seconds and then scan your print, otherwise you get a failed reading. A little inefficient if you ask me, I feel like I could plug in a 4 digit code faster.",

Audio disable feature allows \"stealth\" mode operation. Battery power for maximum security and easy portability. Tamper indicator notes invalid entry attempts. Built in computer blocks access after repeated invalid keypad entries. GunVault Biometric Technology: GunVault Bio uses biometrics, specifically fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents. A high-performance algorithm is used to achieve speedy identification of enrolled fingerprints; and at the same time has a very low False Reject rate (FRR) for a given False Accept Rate (FAR). This self-learning algorithm of the GunVault Bio adds new minutiae to the fingerprint templates each time a user touches the finger print sensor, which decreases the likelihood of FRR, updates slight changes that might occur over time to an enrolled fingerprint, as well as to help distinguish variations. System can handle a maximum of thirty fingerprint templates between the enrolled fingerprint.",
