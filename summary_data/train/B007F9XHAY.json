It is nothing like anything else Sony- doesn\u2019t work 3 out of 4 times you put a dvd in it. Everything is cheap and our DVD player from 15 years ago works far better. When you initially put a dvd in it won\u2019t play for 10+ minutes and you need to keep turning it on and off to get it to work. Save your money and buy any other brand this one is horrendous.",

The second had just the on/off light only and this one doesn't have any display of any type. You can't tell if it's on or off just by looking at it. This is stupid! It just gets cheaper and cheaper. One of the most fundamental features of any piece of electronics is an off/on light. The various features of all these DVD players from Sony has just been fair. Never again!!! The photo is showing the player \"On\". Would you know it?",

This one I paid $10 more and the same thing. Spend a little more money and get a quality DVD player. This is crap.",

      "text": "I initially used an HDMI cable to connect to my TV. It improved the image quality of an older DVD and I was happy. NOTE however that CC won't work using an HDMI cable, so I had to hookup 3RCA cables in addition for DVD viewing when CC are needed. Image quality was still good. The input/source has to be switched from HDMI to AV if CC are required, also, the Sony remote wouldn't turn on CC but my [Samsung Smart] TV remote DID.",

The discs started stuttering and skipping until eventually the DVD player announced that a disc was \"dirty.\" I didn't think it was a disc problem because it stopped playing all my discs. So, I ordered a DVD cleaning disc, thinking that maybe some dust got on the laser lens. Didn't work. Still does not work. The OTHER player is doing fine...but for how long? Would not recommend as I recall reading a review similar to mine before purchasing.",

I always thought Sony made quality products until now. Warranty expired shortly before issues began.",

We have only had it one day so far but I am super happy with it. (One review said that the player does not have buttons on it- it does! No need to worry if the remote flakes out).",
