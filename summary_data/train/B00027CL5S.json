      "text": "jut received this morning and all 3 cats (one of them a kitten) absolutely LOVE!! I'm grateful to find something HEALTHY but the price is a bit staggering... UGH. I would really love to freeze dry & make my own since I feed raw & want the best for my \"kiddos\", but all the research I've done has proven that it is a VERY expensive undertaking..OY!.\" That said, I think for now I'll just dehydrate chicken in my convection oven for treats. This stuff is great but just too $$$ for my pocketbook. I still give it a 5 star.",
