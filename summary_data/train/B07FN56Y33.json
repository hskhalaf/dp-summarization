To make it worse we left them on the porch with the cooler to throw away and the next day there were growing this horrible orange mold that produces a fine dust when we moved them to throw them away. These are so overpriced and I feel so ripped off. Terrible.",

The plastic handles do feel a little flimsy, but as something that only gets used on occasion, they should hold up. And man is sound satisfying when the ball makes contact with the wood.",
