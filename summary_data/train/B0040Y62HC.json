The whole set is cheaper than JUST the 10mm off the tool truck. A+ quality.",

The foam is pretty durable and if the kit is kept in the original box, it should last forever. So the carrier is just fine to me.",

My tools are a mix of Matco, Gearwrench, Snap-On, etc, So I have experience with many tool brands. I stress that for the price, these are a nice set, they seem well made and the chrome plating is uniform. I have only one complaint and that is they only have a one-year warranty. I was a little surprised when I opened them to see such a short warranty. But then again, how much abuse do you plan on giving 1/4\" flex sockets?",

They come loose from time to time and have to be tightened. Not a big deal but worth mentioning in a review. They hold up pretty good but if you really have to put a lot of force to them they will break. However I believe these are the best 1/4 inch swivels in this price range.",

A big concern for buying inexpensive tools is that the size is almost unusable for the application in which you desire to use them. Also has a good storage case. Nothing negative to say so far.",
