Had a handyman install it for $200 so I cannot speak for install. I do know that wiring to an outlet was required. It took him about 6 hours to install start to finish. Also this one was the right choice because it could be wired to a existing outlet, had I got the bigger units (18k) I would have had to buy new wire and pay to have it run to the garage. This would have added more than $300 to the project at least.",

The only downside is that I was never able to configure its Wi-Fi. The manual must have been translated, and poorly, from some other language, probably Chinese.",
