Also the instructions are confusing and don't explain how the system works or have good diagrams of how to attach the hoses, etc. it does seem to be relatively quiet, but other than that I'm rather disappointed.",

    "description": "Danby 70-Pint portable dehumidifier is equipped with a built-in vertical pump that allows the unit to pump water upward directly into a sink or out a basement window for continuous operation. This energy efficient unit operates quietly on 2 fan speeds (high/low) in rooms up to 4,500 square feet. It has a smart dehumidifying function that allows the unit to automatically control humidity by factoring in ambient room temperature. If the unit shuts off unexpectedly due to a power outage, it will automatically restart with the previous function settings when power is restored. The automatic de-icing system ensures the coils are always ice-free while the low temperature feature allows the system to continue to operate at temperatures as low as 41F. Maintenance is easy with the removable air filter and direct-drain system. Plus, Danby 70-Pint dehumidifier has four built-in caster wheels making it easy and convenient to move the unit from one room to another.",
