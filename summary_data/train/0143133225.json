My kids are very arts-oriented free-thinkers. Their language is sometimes colorful, rooms messy with creative materials, quick to be there for friends whenever needed, plenty smart in many directions... and caring. Your book refreshes my journey, reminds me of the broader characteristics of real education, and helps me see from my kids' perspectives, helping me to be a better mentor and co-learner. God bless!",
