These shoes DO NOT suffer from these issues. I've tried several brands (in this price range) over the last 6-7 years, and I've found these prove to be the most durable. The foam-fitting works as expected. * I waited until I am well into my second pair to provide this review. HIGHLY recommended.",

These are not really running shoes and won't feel like bedroom slippers (at first) like a new pair of running shoes would feel. These would not be my first choice for running shoes. That is not what they were designed to be. They are a little stiffer, heavier, and tougher than running shoes. I like them a lot!",
