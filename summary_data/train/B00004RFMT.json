Well balanced, great steel, handle has amazing fit into my hands. Upon inspection, the knife is not made in Spain as advertised, but in China. The Henckels 'Classic' lines is transitioning into Asian markets for their knives. This advertiser posted pics stating their knives are 'Made in Spain'. My collection of Henckels are all Spanish knives. So I was a bit disappointed the advertiser did not tell me the truth about where the knife was truly made. I wish this retailer would have been honest, because their pictures of their product was blatantly ....***",

The knife completely oxidized and discolored after the first washing. I hope to attach a photo showing this. Next, the TOP edge of the knife (not the cutting edge), IS SO SHARP IT CUT MY FINGER DEEPLY WHILE JUST HOLDING THE FOOD WITH MY LEFT HAND AND THE TOP EDGE OF THE KNIFE GRAZED IT. I have exclusively owned Henkels knives my entire life (I\u2019m 59). Honestly, I could\u2019ve brought a cheap, crap plastic knife from Ross that was higher quality. I hope I can reopen this sham produce of a once great knife company.",

The steel is X 50 CR MO V15 which is respectable with a Rockwell hardness of around 58 so I don\u2019t know what the issue is. My problem is that for the third time since I\u2019ve owned it, I\u2019m going to have to take off an excessive amount of material to get below the chipping and I\u2019m already seeing a curve in the blade just forward of the bolster which really degrades the quality of this knife.",

After just a couple times of washing and use, The Henckel logo almost completely came off the blade and the handle started to look a little discolored and maybe like it was getting some cracking lines - Leaving me wondering if this is just a really bad Henckel or a fake knockoff.",

    "description": "Size:8 InchExperience confidence with each cut. The Henckels International CLASSIC 8\" Chef's Knife boasts a precision, fine-edge blade that is honed for long-lasting sharpness. Chop potatoes, dice apples, mince shallots and slice salmon effortlessly\u2014this kitchen workhorse is up for almost any task. High-quality German stainless steel strengthens this durable, Spanish-made knife. With a seamless transition from blade to handle, the knife's fully forged construction provides balance as the traditional triple-rivet handle encourages tireless cutting. Henckels International makes essential kitchen tools every home chef needs. From steak knives to spatulas, every product boasts high quality at an exceptional value. Created in 1895 by Zwilling J.A. Henckels, this value-driven brand guarantees the same durability, design and ease of use for which the global company is known. Equip your kitchen with expertise with Henckels International.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nA good chef's knife becomes your daily kitchen companion. It's used for everything from prepping steaks for the grill to finely mincing onions, and chances are you'll reach for it every time you cook--so it better be good. This lower-priced line from Henckels is a great value: excellent quality knives with their standard lifetime warranty. There's good balance, and the handles are a shade heavier than other lines, which some cooks will prefer. The 8-inch blade length is the most practical for multipurpose use, and regular sharpening will keep the stainless-steel blade razor-sharp. It's only minimally flexible, which makes it a great choice for vegetables such as potatoes and turnips. While it's dishwasher-safe, unless it needs sanitizing after use with raw meat, it's often easier to hand wash. --Jill Lightner",
