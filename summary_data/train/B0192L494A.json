A small will fit a 15-16 year old. The ONLY thing I was upset with was the color of it. When it says green, I thought of a darker shade of green, not neon green like I got. I am on The Athletics, so the color of it is a little to bright green. But I can't change that, so it's still 5 stars. Great sleeve!",

Not sure of the size, I ordered 1 Youth Med and 1 Youth Small. The medium fit perfect, he loves this sleeve. You made a little boy very happy, he picked the pattern, America and Baseball what could be better. His little brother playing his first year of little league got the YS, he feels the same. Two very happy baseball players and a happy grandma.",
