I go between Handheld and TV mode quite a bit and each time I take off the case, I can feel the Joycon bending in their spots and I'm worried I might break them at some point.",

All the cutouts line up perfectly and the buttons, ports, and vents are easily accessible. You can also still use the stand with the case on, and the built-in grips actually help keep the system from tipping over as easily. The added grip also helps prevent hand cramps and makes the Switch feel so much better for extended play sessions. While it can't be docked with the case on, it's very quick and easy to take on and off. The packaging is even nice looking. I highly recommend this grip case!",
