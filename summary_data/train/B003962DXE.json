Ruff Rollin Wheelchairs for Pets actually used the picture as a blowup 10' x 10' poster for trade shows because it was so clear. Sad part about the camera: I recently dropped it and now it is not working properly. I cried!!! I am buying another one but an upgrade as they have changed over the past several years. I would highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix cameras to anyone looking to buy a pocket camera that does not cost a fortune.",

One note, the file size that the pictures download to on the computer, at least for me were HUGE. They took a long time to download, and you can't email or attach them to anything really unless you can find a way to reduce the size. I'm still working on it myself. Other than that it's great. It's sleek, attractive, easy to carry for smaller hands, and just a really good buy for a beginner.",

If you lose the cable that comes with it getting a replacement is more difficult, and if say you leave it at home and want to display photos on the TV where you are at, the likelyhood of them having a cable that will work is almost zero. I wish camera manufacturers would standardize on one interface plug type. I also had to adjust the white balance to get pictures to look right.",

You do have to adjust the white balance while shooting indoors, otherwise you will get pictures that are too warm. The image quality is great, but if you blow up a picture to about 16 x 20 then the image gets soft. There is a bit of lag time between takes. It can be annoying if you are shooting live action shots or toddlers that are constantly on the move. Other than that, it is a great little camera for purse or pocket.",

The 8X zoom is a great feature; with it I snapped close-ups of waterfalls, distant grottos, whales, and banana bunches in far-away trees. I was pleasantly surprised to hear music accompanying the slide show feature when I watched the pictures on my TV. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product.",

My only criticism was about the time it took to process each image was a little too slow but I think that is becasue it has a high MP rate (14) creating images that are around 1 mb. On the more positive side; the computer interface was very simple and easy to use, the autofocus worked great, good battery life, and it has the ability to capture low light images without a flash",

Be aware that it has a rechargeable battery, not AA etc. Might want to order an extra. Only draw back from my side.",

Panasonic has removed the autobracket feature from the menu of this new camera, even though the interface is the exact same. Very disappointing Panasonic. It costs nothing extra to put this feature in. No reason to buy Panasonic again for me",

My two biggests dislikes about this camera is the lack of zoom adjustment when recording video (pretty common complaint), and the lack of photo controls. My TZ4 had an ISO-max feature, which would set an ISO ceiling that the camera wouldn't exceed, but it still allowed the camera to select a lower iso setting if there was enough lighting. My FH20 seems to only allow auto ISO, or for the user to fix one ISO setting. I think this camera is a good value.",

For some reason the pictures are a little pixelated when I zoom in all the way, but the videos are not. I'm not sure the technicality of why the zoom works better with the video than with the photos, but it doesn't stop me from loving this camera. It's still FAR better than any other zoom camera I've used.",

Even when it was working, the picture quality was only so-so, with the autofocus only working effectively about 1/2 the time. Also, not having zoom when video is running is annoying (video quality itself is much better than picture quality, though). Also annoying is that it takes several clicks of small buttons to switch from still photo to video mode. Why can't there just be one dedicated button for that switch of functions? Next time, I'll spend more to get a better camera . . .",

    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThis Stylish Compact Does It All from Wide-angle to Zooming \n\n\n\n28mm Wide-angle Lens\nThe 28mm wide-angle lens* lets you easily capture large groups of people indoors or expansive architectural structures and scenes with dynamic width and rich perspective, even from short distances.\n* Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the maximum wide position. Powerful 8x Optical Zoom\nThe DMC-FH20 sports a powerful 8x optical zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 28-224mm). This gives you highly natural expressions from people and animals that you can't get close to. And its slim, compact, pocket-sized body can easily go wherever you do for both everyday snapshots and traveling. \niA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\nWhen you don't know which mode will give you the best shooting results, or when a sudden photo opportunity pops up and you don't have time to make any settings, simply choose iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode by simply pressing the dedicated button and let the camera do it all for you. You just choose iA Mode, aim at your subject, and shoot. 4 detection and correction functions are simultaneously activated to optimize the settings, so you get stunning photos every time. \n\nHD Movie Recording (1,280 x 720 pixels at 30 fps in Motion JPEG Format)\nThe DMC-FH20) can record motion images in high-definition (1,280 x 720 pixels at 30 fps in Motion JPEG format). The pixel mixed readout method enables bright motion-image recording even in low-light settings. The DMC-FH20 can also record full-size motion images in WVGA (848 x 480 pixels at 30 fps) or standard motion images in VGA (640 x 480 pixels at 30 fps) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels at 30 fps). \n\nExtended Battery Life\nThe energy-saving Venus Engine IV image-processing engine and the efficient, rechargeable lithium-ion battery which has been slimmed down to fit into thinner camera bodies work together to extend the shooting time of the DMC-FH20. This lets users take approx. 300 shots on a single battery charge*.\n* Based on the CIPA standard.",
