The pliers came with a broken spring and the other tools look like they won't hold up either. The description indicates these are nice glass beads but they are cheap plastic. None of the beautiful beads that are in the manual are included in the set. Deffinitely not worth the amount I paid. I wouldn't pay $15 for this set. Very dissappointing to figure this out Christmas morning. Returning these ASAP!",

Most of what is mentioned is not even included, so you will have to go buy more things just to complete anything. Even the crown knot bracelet requires additional waxed cording that is not included.
