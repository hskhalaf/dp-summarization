Please consider this before buying. Or atleast throw out the leaves and straw.",

I found it's difficult to line up the groove and opening after cleaning and now I mostly clean it while it's assembled so I don't have to bother putting it back together.",

Not wanting to take the top on and off every day as we cleaned the cat box, we at first tried to scoop the litter through the entrance hole.

We then tried pulling the top off to clean the litterbox, but it\u2019s not as easy as you\u2019d think. We ended up using just the bottom as a big circular litterbox, which definitely defeats the purpose. For us, it was a waste of money.",

I\u2019m not sure how, as I agree the plant isn\u2019t the greatest around, and I didn\u2019t even replace with a better one. But I guess people perceive what they think should be there and don\u2019t look too hard. So I\u2019m extremely happy with this unit.

Arrange them and zip tie them together. Before you do this, cut the 6 stems a bit shorter then the fern stem that comes with the box. This way it will balance well when you insert the fern stem into the top allotted hole. I bought some potpourri that had shells and sticks and arranged them on the top.

I thought I would paint it immediately, but ended up keep it au natural. It is NOT terracotta colored. More taupe... so if you want that orange terracotta color, you'll need to paint it. The plant is not that skimpy, in fact, I don't have enough space for a super bushy plant, so it works for me. I don't use an additional liner, I found it isn't necessary and super easy to clean this out daily and then wash it once a month.",
