I reinserted the slipped gear and locked it in place. So now it works and I\u2019ll keep it..... but buyer beware- Amazon does not test the returns that they sell - it appears.",

The peg in the receptacle wasn't long enough to activate the micro-switch, so I had to shim it with duct tape to get the machine to turn on when a pencil was inserted. Either that, or hold the receptacle in with one hand while sharpening the pencil with the other, making it a two-hand operation. I should have just returned for a refund, but this was the quicker fix. Cheap build quality. Not recommended.",
