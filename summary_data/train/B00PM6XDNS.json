This is my second SH with GPS and the easiest to program and use-especially with the ability to put my DSC address book on from my PC. If only the mounted units could do the same-I am sure the next iteration will! The only missing option is a scrambler. If you use DSC, this is the unit to have.",

I like the gps as back up, and the distress button for emergencies. I would love a battery that would last for days but that ain't happening yet. It does last for our typical cruising/sailing times and recharges quickly. Why are electronics becoming more complicated to use? The basic functions are pretty intuitive, but the multiple menu system takes practice to use quickly. Haven't tested the floating capability and hope not to. It has handled being rained on/cockpit splashing without apparent damage.",

      "text": "Just got mine in the mail. Charged the battery and took it outside. Within 5 minutes there was condensation on the screen. Sending it back for a replacement. I'll update the review when I get the second one. UPDATE I guess some trolls are unhappy that I didn't update my review so here you go: Amazon replaced my defective unit and the new one has worked well. Statistically I don't know how many come from the factory like that but it was 50/50 for me. I'm just reporting real life events. Not trying to make anyone mad.",
