I wish the mini chunks came in other flavors so they could have some variety. My only issues are that the price fluctuates from anywhere from $20-$40, but most of the time is around $30. I also wish that I could subscribe in custom increments. I need the food every 3 weeks, but every 4 weeks is the lowest time frame I can choose. I find it easier just to order it when I need it instead.",
