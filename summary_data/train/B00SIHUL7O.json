They are perfect for me, although I feel that they are closer to a medium bristle than a soft bristle. I love knowing that this toothbrush is Eco-friendly. Everything is biodegradable - yet highly durable - and is a fantastic replacement for those old-fashioned, typical, Earth-destroying plastic toothbrushes we're all used to. I recommend giving these a try! Slowly but surely we can all change one thing at a tijme to reduce our environmental impact.",

I like how it looks and it made me feel good that I was buying toothbrushes that had a lot less plastic i.e., better for the environment. A couple of downsides: the first time using I had some bristles come out in my mouth which wasn't horrible just a little inconvenient. Also I like my bristles a little harder but on the flip side if you have sensitive gums these may not be the brushes for you.",

      "text": "After the first week of use, the shaft begins to retain water and ostensibly bacteria, producing a foul odor. The bristles do not last as long, nor are as effective as traditional toothbrush bristles. When the brush needs replacing, the bristles do not come out of the shaft very easily and are nearly impossible to recycle. All in all, I'd recommend a Boie USA if you're looking for something that is both effective and easier on the environment.",

The wood grain also rubs slightly uncomfortably against the corners of my lips. Will look for a smaller option next time.",

Also it is a bit more on the medium side for stiffness. -Update 15 July 2016- Still love these brushes however the new black ones are a bit soft.
