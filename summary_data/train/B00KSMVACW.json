Your wallet and phone will fit fine, but there isn't enough room for bulky keys, snacks or cameras. Having the waist strap for this can by a little overkill unless you use it for jogging. I mainly (used to) take this hiking and found the waist straps to be annoying when they hang down, and even more annoying when buckled. The bag itself is pretty short therefore the straps sit closer to your ribs rather than your hips. It works great for carrying water, but that's about it.",

I had this bag about 40 days never used it once. I wanted to use it solely for OCR runs longer ones.

I do wish you could tighten the upper strap a little bit more to prevent bouncing, and depending on your height the lower strap being too tight may prevent your ability to take full/deep breaths, which in turn may cause the pack to move. The hydration bladder itself sits very comfortably on your back and does a great job holding ice cubes and keeping it cold. 88 degrees and 10k out in the sun and i still had ice left over in my pack after filling it 50/50. Value all over the place.",

I have it 3 stars because fit can be different for different people. It's a high quality product, lightweight and the bladder doesn't leak. I was able to throw my phone, keys and chapstick in.

It requires little effort to get water and has the best locking mechanism to make sure you don't have drips from the mouth piece.

My only complaint would be the mouthpiece. The slit where you suck the water out was so small I could hardly get water out. However I just took scissors and cut it open longer and that was the perfect fix. The only reason why I wouldn't give this gem 5 stars. Overall, I do not regret it at all and love it more than my super expensive other packs.",

So, if it tightens up after waterfill, then I will reccomend this product but if it doesnt I would not reccommend because it wouldnt work for runners, which is why I bought it.",

I'm a proud owner and I would recommend Camden gear to anyone! Thank you for a great product! -Lail Cothren",

      "text": "This hydration pack is exactly what I needed for some of my longer runs. This is the first one that I've ever owned, and I definitely recommend it for anyone interested in backpacking, long distance running, or any related activity. The backpack is adjustable, so it doesn't rub if it's adjusted properly, and the compartment that holds the water bladder keeps the water cold for about an hour to an hour and a half. Overall, it's lightweight, comfortable, and it meets all of my needs. I've only owned it for a couple weeks, though, so I'll have to see how it holds up after a few months of wear and tear.",

The weight is good, the pocket placement worked well, and being a full-figured female I was particularly impressed with the comfort of the fit, especially the chest strap. I did have a problem with dripping from the mouthpiece - intermittent, so I'm not sure if I'm just not getting it closed adequately every time, or if there's a design issue. There was no leaking or dripping when I pre-soaked the interior overnight to prevent plastic taste in the water. Only suggestion for improvement would be to attach the mouthpiece cap to the straw line so it won't get dropped.",

For the type of activity (OCR) I am doing I really needed the waist belt so the pack wouldn't flop up and hit me in the head. This pack stays on securely, provides the hydration and energy storage I need, is very comfortable and (a BIG plus) it was so reasonably priced.

So while I had originally intended to store my phone in one of those pockets I've gone back to my trusty armband instead. But apart from that it's great and I'm very happy to be using it.",
