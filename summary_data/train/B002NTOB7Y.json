They are exactly what we wanted for them to sleep in our room for the first few months before sleeping in their nursery. So many people complain and say negative things about these and I honestly don't know why, this is the first review I have ever written and trust me, it's because this product is worth it! PS: we did buy another mattress because the one that it comes with is too thin.",

The mattress that comes with it is super thin, so I purchased an 18x36 replacement mattress here on Amazon that is about 1.75\" thick. The replacement mattress is much better and firmer. For the price, I think it should come with the nicer mattress or else it would be 5 stars. I got the cherry finish. It is beautiful and traditional style and looks good in my home.",

It's good for a newborn because you don't want them in a big crib yet but the metal stoppers for the crib kept loosing up. Maybe it's because I have carpets in stead of hardwood floors. It's kind of cheap for something so expensive. I'd look for another one and not this one. I give it 3 stars because it was my baby's first bed.",
