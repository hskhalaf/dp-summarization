I use coffee filters in the machine and find this is easiest for cleaning. The coffee tastes great and I love the functions that allow you to brew smaller portions with the same strength of coffee. I use the timer function daily and it is great to wake up to a brewed coffee before I head off to work. Would fully recommend, great product for the price!",

We do use coffee filters even though there is no need to. But it makes cleaning 10x faster. You just throw the ground away.",

My partner works nights so sets the timer when he gets home and the coffee is waiting for him when he gets up. For the filter we do use filter papers as it makes it easier to clean. Highly recommend this machine.",

Setting the machine up for 4 cups it just emptied across the work surface before it could brew one cup. I used 5 flat scoops of coffee, the coffee was ok but not strong how I like it. I have now gone back to using an old coffee machine, and am using less coffee for a stronger brew. Needles to say - I won't be buying a Russell Hobbs machine again.",

The amount of coffee has to be adjusted accordingly which is all a matter of personal taste. Coincidently we have a Russell Hobbs glass kettle which also has the rather fetching blue lighting effect so all in all they both give a very pleasant and \"upmarket\" light show!",

If you don't want fast coffee, or if you like strong coffee and are happy to take time to work out how to make the pot of coffee to suit you then this is treat but if your after a pot of quick filter coffee buy a different machine...",

The one downside is the hot plate only stays on for 40 minutes thanks to new EU energy regulations, so it\u2019s not a fault that I can blame the manufacturer for as every coffee machine you would buy now is restricted to the same hot plate time limitations. Clean up is made much easier by using size 4 paper filters.",
