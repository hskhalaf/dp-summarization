This was the thing he kept asking for, for Christmas... it wasn't even his biggest gift, his biggest gift was a play house. But he absolutely loves it. It's very good for pretend play and there's room for more than one child to play. It's also good for fine motor skills. I depend on reviews when deciding to purchase a product, a lot of the times reviews will sway me one way or another.

Child will not be playing with running water. Child will be either pumpung water to get squirts out or playing with water already in the sink. It is quite a workout to keep it pumping so for the pleasure of your baby be ready to be pumping water for them while they play. My daugheter likes it if i am pumping. That is not why i get toys for her. I want to relax not be with her every minute of the day. Well its just me.",

I was so excited for her to play with this and I\u2019m really disappointed. It cannot be taken apart once assembled so I\u2019m not sure I can return it but I\u2019m going to request it.

I highly recommend this toy for anyone who needs a break. Seriously, best purchase of my life. Things to note: * A 19 month old is not strong enough to push the pump once the water is in the basin. The pressure needed is greater than the amount needed prior to filling it up so once it's empty, he/she will push down repeatedly demanding water comes out. Shrieking may happen. * To ensure nothing gross grows in here, be sure to dry thoroughly after every use.",

First of all the water doesn\u2019t just run you have to continuously manually push on a pump thing for the water to come out which after a couple of pumps your hand starts getting tired so no kiddo will be able to just sit there pushing on it. Then, the stopper doesn\u2019t even click in place, it just sits there so after pumping the water the water doesn\u2019t even stay in the sink it slowly drains which then leads to more pumping to fill back up.

In the Spring, we all run like crazy buying water tables. I found that this is great indoors during the winter months! Set them up to wash and dry! A creative twist for the older kids would be to have them play restaurant! Comes with a nice selection of dishes/silverware, etc. Sturdy and convenient! Makes a great gift!",

It is still fun even without the water coming out. My kids like to bring this in the tub (warning:it takes up a lot of space in there!)",

My kids (1 & 3) played with this for 2 hours as soon as I opened the box & then brought it in the tub for another hour. DO NOT put it anywhere youre not ok with getting soaked. It fell over in the kitchen & separeted & all the water went everywhere. It was a wonderful find for the play kitchen since it has burners, knobs, a faucet & accessories. Very happy with this purchase.",
