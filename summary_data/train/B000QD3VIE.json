There was plenty of ice left when I got home after a 4 day hunt. I bought two of these - my third pronghorn fit into the second one with plenty of room to spare for other food. Difficult to carry, but if you need to pack a lot of food, game or fish then this is a great option.",

Now I need to find those ice packs that are meant to refreeze and fit into the lid as pictured with identical product.",

I can't figure out how to contact the seller, which kind of sucks, but oh well I guess. To reiterate, satisfied with product, slightly bummed with misleading description and quality of plastic.",
