I can imagine doing this without a drill or electric screwdriver, as there are a lot of screws. This package is very heavy, I brought it upstairs in pieces. The weight, though, adds to the quality of this furniture. There is nothing cheap feeling about it, it is very solid and sturdy. While that makes maneuvering the parts harder, it makes for furniture I feel will last, despite the fact that I put it together.",

The color was not as golden as pictured so I wonder if they've changed finishes as the time goes by. Fit and finish were good and it looks nicer than the cost would indicate. Assembly took longer than expected and I'm middle of the road handy. Since it's particle board with veneer it's heavier than solid wood furniture but not unmanageable. Be sure to point the drilled holes on the uprights towards the outside. It'll work until I can make one out of oak plywood.",

One note: for some reason, the instructions want you to start attaching heavy boards to the light under-top-piece molding strip early in the process. This caused my molding to come apart and almost ruined the project. It was much easier (after damage control!) to put most of the heavier pieces together and then screw the molding to the top as one of the final steps.",

It took my elderly dad and I about 2 hours to assemble it, it might have gone faster for two people that work with others better than we do. I attached it to his existing bed frame once it was assembled. For the price, you won't find a nicer headboard and the storage is quite nice. I would buy again. I dunno if I'd assemble with my dad again, tho.",

Assembly took me about three hours (working alone), as I took my time and followed the instructions carefully, exactly as pictured. As I did so, it occurred to me that perhaps a different approach might not be as awkward, but no, one gets to a couple of points where the headboard needs to have been assembled exactly as instructed in order to take the next step. So don't be tempted by your creativity -- follow the directions. I am happy with the purchase.",

There is a small part where the \"wood finish\" is a little damages but it's not very noticeable and I didn't notice until I was an hour into assembly so it's going to stay. Overall I'm happy with my purchase for the guest bedroom.",

I have a few problems with it so far though. if I were to put my bed on a frame and attach it to the headboard, my bed would then almost cover the shelves and block cute decorations. also, if it's against the wall, doing \"fun things\" in bed is hard because the headboard will rock and bang against the wall and possibly cause wall damage. I'm thinking of getting a thick blanket and pinning it up behind the headboard to alleviate the noise and wall damage caused by my ... intimate moments.",
