I am very satisfied with the sound and the size is perfect for the small area I have in the truck for my stuff. I keep it cranked to 11 all day and just alternate my charging cord between my phone and the JBL GO. Rock on!",

There is as much bass as a speaker of this size can provide. Each frequency band is well balanced for the speaker because there is no clipping or distortion at max volume. If you put an overdriven input (too high volume) into the 3mm jack you will only hear minor distortion at high volume which will happen with even the most expensive speakers.",

The sound is astonishingly good out of this. I'm usually a Bose person, but this little guy is super impressive! Battery lasted a solid 5 hours for me. I use this during travel with my laptop to watch movies and it's amazing!",
