It is very difficult to hang, the build process is simple up to the point of hanging the chair. Luckily my fifteen-year-old daughter was able to help me and we got it on but it would have been almost near impossible for one person to complete this task. Overall I am ecstatic with this purchase so far",

My apartment balcony isn't that big so I was skeptical that it wouldn't fit but it fits perfectly. It's not too big. It takes up about a third of my balcony and I still have room to play with the rest of my balcony. Love it. Try it for yourself.",

It took some muscle to open the \u201cpumpkin\u201d shape all the way and put the screws in to hold it open. After struggling with it for about 20 minutes, we finally covered the metal with a towel (to prevent scratching the frame) and had to hammer the metal joint to fully open it. Make sure you have two people to hang it up on the frame. The cushion is nice, but it slides down and hangs over the edge of the swing. Thinking Velcro might fix this issue. Happy with it overall!",

When assembling, you have to pull the collapsed skeletal bars back enough to fit the bolts into the holes. This was a bit difficult by myself. Otherwise this is the best swing for the money.",

Have it in a covered space that protects it from the elements, but it still gets the breeze. A perfect place to relax, read, or nap. We are pleased with the construction and feel it will last for a long time. Can see we may have to add another as guests are drawn to it as much as we are. Grandkids love that it \"rocks\" them to sleep.",
