I haven't needed any warranty service, so I can't say if Husqvarna would deny the claim, but chances are they'd deny it because the purchase didn't follow their terms (even though they were both part of the same order).",

There is one thing about backpack blowers I had not considered. With a handheld blower, you can change hands to keep from having issues with long term use. You do not have that option with backpack blowers. You can get right or left handed ones, but they are not ambidextrous. They are also better in larger open areas as they're larger and harder to manipulate in smaller areas. Husqvarna 350BT is a beast of a machine. Works great!",

Shoulder straps are comfortable, seems to be a rugged machine, plenty of power pushing small sticks, rocks, dirt and wet leaves with ease. Aside from the price variations, I'm happy with it. With ear plugs, not too loud. Yes... Wear ear and eye protection! Shipping was fast and secure.",

The machine cranks about the second or third pull, the pull is a littler harder than I expected. All in all the machine does a great job of blowing and I would buy it again.

It is not too heavy yet it is powerful enough for pretty much every residential application. It is fairly ergonomic as my injured back did not suffer from working full day on a fairly steep slope. I highly recommend the unit. The only con, in my opinion is lack of the chest strap to keep shoulder harness from slipping off your shoulders. I will have to improvise to add this feature on my own.",
