In the past I have had terrible experiences with economy suction cup mounts. And I swore that I would only ever use RAM Brand in future. The Panavise is not as high quality as the RAM line of product, but seriously at this price it is an outstanding buy. Super stable. Nice tight feel when GoPro is mounted. I\u2019m a picky buyer and this product gets A+ from me.",
