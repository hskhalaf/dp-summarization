(The most recent pair broke when he was at a jousting tournament and someone plopped a piece of plate armour on top of the glasses which he'd left on a table.) So I tend to buy him inexpensive sunglasses in bulk. He really likes these glasses. They are the only ones that he has specifically asked me to buy more of. They look good on him, too.",
