I'm happy to have found a cover that lasted this long at an okay price. It maintained it's waterproof capability until the end.

It was 2 to 3 months in the brutal michigan sun (sarcasm) and the color was fading. Otherwise it's good. Hasn't leaked. Moisture/condensation can collect on the underside which means the cover does not breath well. I've used the cover to protect and waterproof an empty hot tub for 2 years now. A small amount of water, maybe from condensation does make its way into the hot tub. I'll be purchasing the same cover as the old one ripped in several places, my fault, from dragging nails across the top.",

None of the four clips will hold the nylon draw cord tightly - thus the wind will blow the cover off. Guess I will have to find some stronger ones and replace them.",

Our hot tub is out in the open, so it can get windy. The cover has stayed on great. Most of the time it even stays on when we take the main cover off (we have a lift bar). I recommend.",
