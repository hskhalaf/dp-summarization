I know because both their grandma and myself have taken this baby for a spin! \ud83d\ude02 Great purchase!",

The only thing that (besides the rope) we dislike is if it rains a lot or hard water does get into it after a while which made for a few wet butts before we realized it.

Highly recommend if you have a sturdy branch reasonable in height and don't mind the ground under swing to be worn. Good alternative to the traditional swing!",
