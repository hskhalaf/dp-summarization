It cleans really well and I love that it's dishwasher safe. It is breakable but it's not as flimsy as some other models. Great for having a casual get together or glass at home but I'd probably bring out the better, stemmed glasses for celebratory dinners. Overall - I recommend this product.",

They fit in your hand more comfortably than the more traditional stemmed glass and because of their shape are less likely to be knocked over accidently and break. Ideal for sipping a quiet glass over dinner or for a party with a number of friends. A good combination of style and practicality. Alex.",
