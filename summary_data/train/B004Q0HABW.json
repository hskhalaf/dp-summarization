In fact, I assembled sections over three days. When I came to the directions for installing the hinges, I was certain they were rolling on the floor laughing at the factory. However, they were not that difficult to install. The mallet was essential to me. This can be assembled by an elderly female, working alone, wearing a modest nightgown, in her very private backyard.",
