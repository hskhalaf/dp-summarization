Outlook freezing, Bluetooth connections with other MS devices dropping etc etc. I will definably not be buying anything from MS again. The docking station connection and disconnect is convenient but many programmes such as Quick Books and Adobe DC Reader don't resize from the monitor and requires a restart anyway, Then it takes ages for the BT mouse and Keyboard to re connect if it ever does. And I can go on but I have waited too much time on this machine this morning already. Rubbish for \u00a31799.00 (I have had this product for 12 months)",

I have had laptops and desktops from other manufacturers and I\u2019ve never experienced this level of defects.

It's not the cheapest device for the hardware but it is more than capable and you are paying for the design/features. I'd confidently recommend.",

The screen is absolutely crystal clear, the colours pop out, and I have no problem at all with the screen size. Totally portable, though it's fair to say I have a pretty big handbag!",

Honestly Amazon, get your act together and create a Microsoft Amazon App!!!! You have one for Android, Apple... why sell products which are incompatible with your own things! Very disappointed and will probably have to switch to Netflix.",

This is very disappointing - as the machine loos and feels beautiful - but they need much more robust testing before dispatching to customers. I am pretty computer literate but do not expect to have to spend half a day to find out why the camera cannot be found by the software straight out of the box.",

Things like hello windows dont always work typical windows approach offer 100 that work in 90% don't trick your selfs with features , usability is the key and this thing has: battery not worth for money paid (3-4 hours) windows hellos feature that operates on its mood, and my son when using it as tablet says it's not ipad , so if want both worlds NOT good things pay and get it , other than that get a good laptop or good tablet.",

I don't regret going with this fanless version instead of the Core i5. RAM seems to be enough though my previous computers had 8GB onboard. The screen is a beauty, the pen works fine. Battery is mediocre but who cares. This thing is amazing. Should I need to work away from the plug for extended periods, I will get an external battery. There are plentiful of those here on Amazon.",

However every now and again especially after receiving updates it won't turn on. I have to hard start it by pushing the start and sound button together. Sometimes this works immediately other times I have to keep doing it, which is very worrying. Going on reviews on Amazon and other sites this is a common problem. I can't see why Microsoft continue to sell this machine while it has such a basic fault.They need to correct it and then replace all the units they have sold.",

Then the 3D camera stopped working which I used for logging on with. There is also a problem with downloading updates, and it is still suffering from freezing problems. I have been on many forums and tried numerous suggestions to rectify these problems and to date none of them have worked. Would I recommend this item to anyone.....not until Microsoft sell trouble free products. Very disapointed with this item and still trying to fix it.",
