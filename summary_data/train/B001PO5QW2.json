It allows you to get familiar with the all the modern advances of today's compound bows without paying an arm and a leg. If you need a bow for a small child I would recommend the Bear Archer Scout over the Barnett Lil' Banshee since it's draw weight is much lower and very easy for little ones.",

I ended up going by YouTube videos instead. The only reason for knocking a star off is that the arrows fell apart, the tip broke off after a few shots into a cardboard box and there are only two arrows included for a fuller quiver. All in all, I'd recommend this for juniors getting into archery.",
