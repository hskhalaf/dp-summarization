      "text": "The frames are flimsy we used wood around the base for extra security. The plastic is delicate so use caution when assembling. There's only one entrance so you're constantly zipping and unzipping the door. The zippers are plastic and hard to zip and unzip Plus on a few occasions came off track. On a positive note despite the cheaply made product this was my first Greenhouse I made adjustments to help the longevity of the screen house. I do enjoy the spaciousness and the extra windows this provides",

      "text": "The frame for this greenhouse took a couple hours to put together and the instructions are comprised of just a few pictures. The cover for this greenhouse doesn't have enough velcro strips to secure it to the frame. There are only velcro strips at the front and rear of the 26' span so the wind likes to blow it around. We did buy brick to help hold the cover down but that's not great either. The velcro strip in one corner is already starting to tear the cover and it's only been on the frame for about 2 hours. The strings to tie the door and windows are too short also. I wouldn't purchase this again.",

The tarp is also a lot more durable than we thought, but due to bending the poles it didn't fit perfectly. This is the perfect green house for beginners looking to customize their garden.",

This helped hold in heat during cold snaps as well as protected it from high winds. Now, the zippers are s***. I framed a door on mine.
