We have tried sprays, netting, and other things to keep them away from our plants but don't always have success. Deer are not supposed to like hydrangea and yet we have been unable to keep them away from one that was taken from my grandmother's property before it was sold. They had eaten it back pretty hard, but I have placed one of these pouches near the plant, and it seems to be coming back. We also placed one near a rose bush that they have been eating, and it was able to bloom without them eating the flower right away. I hope this continues!",

I give it 4 because deer have eaten hostas and bushes despite the fact that the sachets have been placed strategically properly. The larger reality is that a hungry deer will eat without regard for the presence of soap, human hair, predator urine, flashing lights, or sachets of various kinds. Crossbows are the next line of defense. I'm sorry to add that our two resident wild rabbits seem to roam freely about, too.",
