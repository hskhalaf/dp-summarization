I've gotten moisturizer that is different color than normal, the shaving cream container split open on the sides when it was still half full, the plastic caps break extremely easily if you drop it in the shower. I contacted their support to get replacements and they just ignored me. Call me crazy but at $25 for three trial size containers of product I would think it would be better quality and their customer service would be great. I won't be buying this garbage any more.",

Overall I've never been disappointed by Jack Black products, and believe you won't get better men's luxury toiletries for the price. I also recommend Jack Black's Face Buff energizing scrub. Order this to spoil yourself or as a gift. You will return.",

    "description": "Step up your shave regimen with the pain-free shaving essentials included in Jack Black\u2019s Shave Essentials Set. This set of superior facial care products cleanses, refreshes, hydrates, and protects. It includes a clay-based cleanser, a daily moisturizer with sunscreen, and a shaving cream. The set includes Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser, Supreme Cream Triple Cushion Shave Lather, and Double-Duty Face Moisturizer SPF 20. A $47 value!\n\nEach product in the Jack Black Shave Essentials Set offers multiple benefits. Deep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser is a multifunctional clay-based cleanser that washes away dead skin cells, pore-clogging oil, and buildup. It can also be used as a deep cleansing mask. Supreme Cream Triple Cushion Shave Lather is a luxurious shaving cream that lifts hair up and away from the skin for a smooth, close shave that leaves the skin soft, hydrated, and refreshed. Double-Duty Face Moisturizer SPF 20 is a lightweight emollient moisturizer. It combines an advanced facial treatment and broad-spectrum sunscreen in one easy-to-use product.\n\nDeep Dive Glycolic Facial Cleanser can be used two ways. When using it as a cleanser, apply a small amount to wet hands, work it into a creamy lather, and apply it to a slightly damp face using a circular motion. Rinse immediately. When using it as a mask, apply a small amount to a dry face and spread it evenly using a circular motion, avoiding the eye area and the lips. Allow it to dry for five minutes and rinse.Start with a slightly moist face. Apply an even layer of Supreme Cream over face and neck with the fingertips or a shaving brush. Activate it by working it into a rich, creamy lather using circular motions. Shave with a sharp, clean blade, rinsing the razor frequently. Rinse the face with cold water. The Double-Duty Face Moisturizer SPF 20 should be used after cleansing or shaving. Apply it liberally to the face and neck 15 minutes before sun exposure.\n\n\n\nBRAND STORY\nJACK BLACK CREATES SUPERIOR, ADVANCED SKIN CARE FOR MEN INCLUDING SHAVING CREAMS, MOISTURIZERS, GROOMING SETS, CLEANSERS, ANTI-AGING, HAIR CARE, BODY CARE AND SUN CARE PRODUCTS SPECIALLY FORMULATED FOR A MAN'S NEEDS.",
