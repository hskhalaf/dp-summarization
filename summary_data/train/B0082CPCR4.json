As a tablet, its great. very clear photo, great use for camera, video (skype etc) and reading books/magazines which i primarily use it for. The issue i have is this...since day 1, the tablet freezes and apps need to be \"killed\"...they just stop. I'm thinking its a software issue and will contact Asus so i dont want to give the tablet itself a bad review, but its certainly frustrating. Will update when i know more!",

Although android itself is not always the best for functionality, the portability and functionality of the tablet/keyboard is amazing--I can type notes in class, or detach the tablet to review ppt slides, etc. The tablet itself has been fast and working well for the past 10 months. I like the color, and after using the textured plastic back cover I would not want anything else for durability or appearance. It will tip over forwards easily when docked to the keyboard, but I got used to keeping a hand over the keyboard or setting it where it isn't an issue.",

Only odd thing is Google Maps gets you spot on with the internal GPS, but the default weather app seems to always pick a city 200+ miles away. Cannot override the auto-pick except with a manual, forced city that then will not change as the tablets location changes. An oddity not likely a function of the tablet hardware or Asus.",

No one offers you the option of returning for a refund and, when asked for that option, the only response given is they will give you a RMA number, which means you are returning it for repair, not refund.

I liked it and bought another only to have it start doing the same thing on and off and no I was not Hacked. Bought the tf701 everything was fine but was not impressed with it and got a Samsung Note 10.1 2014. Update...I did seem to find a fix to my problem with the ghost inputs. 2 days so far with me in control of my tablet.",

      "text": "I am more of a pessimist when it comes to technology, since I'm a huge geek and love my two laptops, but so far this little device has done nothing but impress me. It surfs the web better than i had hoped but i hadnt played around with a tablet for a few years, also it has great gaming capabilities for such a slime device. I have had a few problems with games but i would assume that is due to the app itself and nothing to do with the tablet. I will report back in about 3-6 months with a progress report and a final verdict.",

I also picked up the keyboard which I am typing with right now. It turns your tablet into a netbook and for some people may eliminate the need for a laptop or computer entirely. I also picked one up for my father as well (with the keyboard of course). My wife has an IPad but this thing is much better. Mine was cheaper by about 100 bucks and I now have a total of 96 GB of memory for this device. My wife only has 16.",
