      "text": "i bought this for the purpose of making an Ubuntu ultrabook for programming with. excellent choice. it came with windows 8, which i replaced with 12.04 LTS. very easy install, all the hardware worked. the next day i decided to upgrade to 13.10 upgrade process was smooth, went to 12.10, then straight to 13.10. no issues. 13.10 runs great on it, and i haven't noticed any problems with compatibility. my only complaint, and this is being very pedantic, is that it could use better friction hinges on the lid. they're a little weak sometimes if you bump the computer. but really that is a minor complaint, over all i couldn't be happier with it.",

Best laptop I have ever owned in my opinion. Never had any issues and it still runs like the day I received it. Battery still holds 3+ hours unplugged while running photoshop and other programs. I got picked up by apple and they are providing me with a macbook pro so this is gonna go home with me and replace my desktop at home now. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a powerful pc!",

I use my ham radio internet remote base on this laptop--it is very stable and the audio is superb. I had initial problems with the touchpad. After I updated the drivers it is rock solid. Battery life is sufficiently long for cross-country flights. Buy this laptop. I researched greatly, settling on this one--I am glad I did!",

I also tried Fedora 18 and 19a, but no luck even booting with either. Windows 8 was different, but not what I want. The zenbook is fast and keyboard is very usable. Screen is sharp and nice to work with. I've only been using it for a few days, I may add more comments later...",

I spend hours attempting to download app updates that wouldn't update, and had to manually deal with other software issues that should have automatically worked. I do not mind tinkering with a laptop to get special features to work, but this one was way too much work for too little value. I returned this computer within 3 hours of opening the box. Again, Please DO NOT purchase.",

I am still returning it, because the available disk space is almost half (66GB) of what was stated (128GB). Losing 10 - 20 GB on OS and recovery is OK, but losing 50% of an already tiny disk space.. you got to be kidding me. And I was told, you cannot extend memory and disk space on this machine as things are hard wired and it is intended for use as is purpose. okkkk.. May be good for gaming and entertainment. But, not for work + entertainment...",
