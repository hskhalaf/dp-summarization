I realize this is an inexpensive product and did not expect it to last decades but I did expect it to last longer than 4 months and 6 uses. Never used it for anything but salsa so, tomatoes, onion, peppers, garlic and cilantro are the only things it's seen and they were cut into pretty small pieces. Maybe mine was just defective to begin with?",

I've also used the slicer on top to make cucumbers etc. I've since gotten rid of my mandolin slicer because this one is so much more convenient. I use this at least 5 times a week. It has so many great features and the price is amazing!!! I have since bought one for two family Mbrs and they are also in love with it",

If you garden, you can grow all the ingredients and save even more. This one is a replacement for one I had for years.

The additional attachments (and recipe book) show the versatility of this item but again, I've only used it for salsa. ONLY CON (and only reason for 4 stars)...The turning handle on top (self-powered) is slightly flimsy, if your ingredients are course and it takes some strength to turn, do so cautiously or you may break the turning piece.

      "text": "We bought this because we wanted something quick and easy for daily use. We have a big, professional food processor but it's more work putting it together than this. We cook daily and eat a lot of vegetables; this has been great. Easy to use and easy to clean. Be very careful, the blades on this are very, very sharp. Hubby got a cut the the first time we used. It works great and does what it says. We both agree that we'd buy it again and we do highly recommend it.",

    "description": "Ultra Chef Express Food Chopper - Chop, Blend, Whip, Mix, Slice, Shred, Julienne, and Juice - An amazing food chopper and so much more! Anyone can produce perfect results quickly and easily. There is no skill involved, no strength required, and no complicated steps to learn. The Ultra Chef Express is a 7 in 1 kitchen gadget that will save you time and effort when preparing all sorts of foods. It's indispensable as a chopper, but with the collection of extra parts it comes with, you can also whip, juice, shred, slice and more. Make hash browns for breakfast, mix up a meatloaf for dinner, chop onions without any tears, prepare salsa, mix cake batter, the possibilities are nearly endless with this powerful tool. Just turn the crank to spin the blades, and anything inside will cut with ease. Thanks to the super sharp blades, and precise, manual operation, you can easily achieve any consistency you want. Spin a few times for large chunks, spin more for smaller ones, and keep on turning if you want to puree the food inside. The clear bowl allows you to see exactly what's going on, and the sealed chamber contains smells and messes that would otherwise annoy you. This deluxe chopper comes with many additional attachments to add to its usefulness, so it's much more than a chopping tool. Get it to dice onions and tomatoes with incredible speed and accuracy, but then experiment with the other parts to discover all of the other tasks it can handle.",
