Get's even less so the more I adjust for the low blue light feature. Don't get me wrong, that part works decently, but I still need to wear my glasses when I use it. Now that I think about it, unless you're gonna adjust the low blue light feature to it's fullest extent and be okay with the mediocre display quality, I'd pass on this monitor. There's nothing great about the display.",

Reduction of blue light and flicker sounded like the right prescription. I knew by the 2nd night of use that it had to go back. Even with the most blue light reduction, I still could not look at it.

But as far as quality, seriously can't beat this short of an IPS monitor. Blows the TN monitors out of the water. I play games such as Skyrim, Witcher 3, ESO, and Arkham Knight on full graphics and I have no issues. Highly recommend.",
