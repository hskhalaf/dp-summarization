The snake grippers are too large for my drain (which is probably regular sized), though it could probably work if you remove the plunger beforehand. I would prefer something that can work without needing to remove the plunger. The value is okay though, since snake grippers can be useful for grabbing other things (dropped screw under engine hood, things beneath the couch or behind a dresser, etc.)",
