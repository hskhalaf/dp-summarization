      "text": "This nail polish was thinned out A LOT. When I opened the bottle the whiff of paint thinner, or nail polish remover, or whatever they used was so strong that I knew right away. It took three coats to get an even color, and the paint only lasted a week. Orly is my favorite brand, I have several colors they produce. My bad for trying to buy a color they seem to no longer make. BUYER BEWARE!!! I did not try to contact the seller because they would just ship it out to someone else. I tried to buy a color Orly no longer makes and paid for it. Hope this keeps anyone from making the same mistake I did.",

One layer is perfect: not too clear, not too thick! 2. Absolutely no streaking 3. Dries FAST! \u2014all the three I got on Amazon this week dry really fast! 4. It wears really long! 5. The shine is incredible! No need for a top clear layer. 6. Colors are sophisticated, especially all of the French Manicure line. 7. The brush is very thick and has a rounded tip. 8. Easy to remove too! Orly, please keep making your nail polish forever!!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

Not only because of the color but because it is a great quality and even when I don't use a base coat, it doesn't stain my nails. It also has a great application brush that reaches the corners of the nail bed with ease. Orly is now my top 2 favorite polishes.",

I've so far only used it in gradients but it's a gorgeous vibrant yellow that goes super well with pinks, purples, reds, and oranges (I sponge it on top of white polish). I like that the brush is big so it's easy to apply a lot in one stroke. The formula is a bit watery and I'm not sure how many coats it'll take to be opaque over the natural nail but I usually sponge 3-4 coats on top of my white polish and it shows up really well.",

It looked silver on her (she was a pale lady) and it looked more of a gold/bronze on me (I'm olive-skinned). I loved the color on me anyway and decided to order it. The only cons are that it chips pretty soon if I don't use a clear topcoat (all my Orly's do that), and Amazon.com can't ship it overseas where I live so I had to ship it to my mom who held onto it after I decided I was going to visit, and I found it cheaper at Sally's.",
