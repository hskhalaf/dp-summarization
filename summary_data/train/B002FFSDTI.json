      "text": "I bought these a few months ago, thinking the boot-like tread would be good for the winter. I wore the shoes a few times (<10) when it snowed and the traction was respectable. The shoe did fit well enough, despite being a bit on the heavy side. Unfortunately, with single-digit usage numbers, the oxfords starting falling apart. The \"leather\" cracked, rippped, and started peeling off the shoe. I have bought dozens of pairs of various Skechers shoes for myself and my family over the years, and had never experienced such poor quality. I hope this is an anomaly, but recent experience with most of my footwear purchases, seem to indicate a trend by the manufacturers towards creating short-term disposable shoes.",
