Along the folded crease there were small holes which caused the thing to leak air. I had to inflate this thing 4 times during the day. When I called the customer service number to complain I was told that the warranty does not cover HOLES! The float had not even been used 6 hours! And I have had to patch up holes before the kids could even use it. We paid too much for a defective product. Not a happy customer.",

If you are looking for a high-quality floating island that the kids can jump-off and have a good time, this is a good one to get. If you are looking to \"get some air\" and launch into the water, do not buy this, as you will get very little bounce from it.",

My kids enjoy it as a swim platform on our lake, but there is absolutely no bouncy-ness to it. The black surface area sinks in as you walk or jump, and does not spring back up. That has nothing to do with how tight you blow it up. Ours is tight; the design just doesn\u2019t allow for a tout spring.",

Not sturdy enough to support even a 5 year old child. Our neighbors have a different brand. Their slide has an enclosed, air filled, chamber. Theirs works great",
