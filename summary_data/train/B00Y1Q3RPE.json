      "text": "I have been riding for 40 years and have owned dozens of riding jackets. This one is my all time favorite and it is a stellar value. I am 6'1\" 185 and the large fits perfectly. Love the zip out lining. I should be able to wear it in the winter with the lining zipped in and be comfortable. Down here on the coast it gets blistering hot and humid. I wore it for a 20o mile ride the other day and the temps were in the 90's. It was comfortable and the mesh is very effective. This is no lightweight jacket and is very substantial with padding and armor in the right places. Very happy with my purchase.",

I'm 6'0, 185 lbs and a large fits me like a parachute. It's very large and the picture is deceiving as it is nowhere near fitted or slim fit. The CE protection is great, but rendered useless with the amount of movement due to the size issues. Overall, if they could get the sizing right, this product could compete with the likes of products from say Alpinestars.",

Because of that I went with an XL (I'm normally an L) and that was much better. W/o the interior liner it's great for the Florida heat. Cool when riding and a bit warm when standing still, but that's expected of a black jacket in Florida. Sub 70\u00b0 it gets pretty cold without the interior liner. Great jacket",

This jacket has the ability to conform to really any body type with the amount of adjusting straps and buckles. It has pockets for days on end, and the mesh outer material gives it the ability to breathe while riding, so ideally its meant for warmer climates. I wouldn't wear it any temperature below 55, because even then that'd be a chilly ride. At the end of the day, this jacket is worth every penny.",

I am not sure if I am going to keep it and sew a patch over it or go through the hassle of exchanging it for a new one. The armor that comes in the sleeves and shoulders is ok, I am definitely replacing it with a higher quality because the shoulder armor sits on my back, I have broad shoulders though.",

I don't have to adjust and readjust while riding. This jacket is a must have for everyone on a motorcycle. Thanks so much Viking Cycle for making great products.",

      "text": "Nice jacket so far. Have had it about a week. Let me say first off this is my first jacket and I'm a new rider. I bought a large, I am 5'10 170 and it fits descent I have long arms so mediums tend to be short on the arms. I think the large is good for me but I am on the low end of weight for the large. The billion pockets are great the unzippable liner is nice. My only complaint this far is that I thought this was a warm weather jacket and at 75 degrees I'm still pretty warm in it if I'm under 30mph or stopped for a bit. More update in the future.",

The fact that the inside layer is removable also is a big advantage for year round use. the Fabric looks high quality. The only down side is that the zipper is a little hard to zip on and the collar kinda rubs against your neck.",

The only thing I wish this jacket had was zippered venting on the outside of the jacket for riding on the warmer summer days. But as I mentioned before it still breathes pretty well so it's not a huge deal. Great jacket all around especially for the price. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
