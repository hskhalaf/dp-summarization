Not only has it made life bearable during recovery and given me the ability to get around, I have gained a lot more confidence in using it even in some mild 4x4 situations. One start lost because the bearing in it is a bit looser, a little tighter less wiggle and it'd be a solid 5 stars. Even then, I'm probably going to keep it on my truck even when I no longer need it.",

Since this is almost all black, putting it on my black steering wheel did that and I have experienced no problems with any slipping of the spinner. I have a medical issue that makes it painful to use my left arm to steer. This device allows me to safely control the steering of my vehicle with total confidence. GREAT DEVICE!!",

Fit easily (for hubby at least) over my steering wheel and cover (Honda Odyssey van), is very secure without using the adhesive strip, and steers very comfortably with left palm. I like that it is flatter and less rigid than other modes, so will be less likely to cause injury in a car accident. I have it at the 9:30 position so I can rest my hand on the steering wheel horizontal post, right next to knob. I would definitely recommend this product; will probably keep using it after shoulder heals.",

No cutting or tools required and you \u201cpalm\u201d it rather than hold it. By pressing it when you are palming it for use it helps keep it on. The quality is much higher than previous plastic ones I have had to buy. So far it is my favorite device I\u2019ve used. I also liked that it came with gripping tape that is optional. I didn\u2019t use it bc I didn\u2019t want to mess up the leather cover and I don\u2019t see why anyone would need it.",

Moves easily and works extremely well. I can remove it easily to use it on a rental car if necessary. Wonderful product.",

I have a cover on my steering wheel and was not sure this would fit or be secure if it did fit. It popped on one time and has been locked-in perfect ever since. I am a big fan--helped me drive after operation on arm--AWESOME!",

I put the steering wheel spinner over the rubber tubing and it stays in place. For easy \"palm\" turning, this spinner is perfect and just what I was looking for.",
