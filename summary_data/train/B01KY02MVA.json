I assumed that like most IoT IP devices that you could just include them into the WiFi and go, and you can if you have a simple home networking setup. They get more complicated if you have many devices on the network, some with priority routing (cameras, streaming video, etc). Many IP routers and switches support quality of service (QoS/WMM/Airtime-Fairness), which prioritizes real-time applications, and may delay non-real-time devices and applications. The LIFX protocol does not like this, and you end up with the \"No Ack\" or unresponsive issues. A little tweaking of your network, and these are the best light bulbs!",

I very much suggest to find a guide as there are a couple tricks that can make the process very quick and easy. Im pretty tech-savvy and ran into a couple hiccups that were easily worked thru. LIFX also has their developer API available so if you are even barely familiar with programming, you can take advantage of that (This, combined with Amazon Alexa's open API and a little fooling around with AWS or even just IFTT makes for some fantastic results)",

I have to unplug them, wait an hour, plug them back in and they work great until the next episode. For the money you pay for these things, they are junk.",
