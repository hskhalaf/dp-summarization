The sound is quite good and the noise cancelling is almost too good for my needs. The microphone is excellent for phone calls. There is one thing that I would like the Treblab people to consider for the next model. Please, do an automatic shut-off feature.

They also stayed in my ears, were comfortable, and the battery lasted a long time before having to charge. The reason for the 3-star rating is because I had to have them replaced less than a year of owning them (the company was very good about replacing them). Now, just after the warranty expired (this is only 3 months after the first pair was replaced), one of the ears died. I really like these, but they don't last long enough.",

The batteries go bad pretty quick, their life getting really short after just a few uses. Any \"noise cancellation\" comes from the design of some of the included earbuds, which are basically just earplugs you can jam in deep. So, it's a bit of a misnomer, but at least somewhat effective. Worst feature is that when the battery is low or you click to pair, it screams the warning messages and beeps in your ear like the crash alarm on an airplane. At this price point, they really aren't bad, though. Got to pay more money for better quality.",

Before the earphones broke, they were great quality, loved the hooks, greta battery life (I got about 6-7 hours on one charge), fit well in my ear, sound quality was decent but slightly lacking in the low end (not meant for bass junkies), and the range was exceptional for budget sub $40 earphones.

Update. Will have to give it to this company as far as customer service goes, they are excellent. I was contracted thru a company rep. and offered another set of ear buds. They arrived this week. I have not had the chance to try out yet. I do appreciate the willingness to \"get it right\".",

The sound quality was excellent and the battery lasted quite a while. They also worked great for phone conversations. However, after nine months, of travel and sweat, the right side has developed a short, and cuts out quite a bit. I just re-ordered another pair, because I figure for the price, and nine months of use, I probably got my moneys worth. I heard they have a one-year guarantee, but not really going to sweat it, these things are worth it.",

It started to go in and out (the sound when I move) and now it just doesn't work. So unfortunately I can not recommend these for more than a couple of months of use. Also really wished they used an usb type-c port because it's 2018 and most of the phones have type-c charger ports but also I don't have to carry an extra wire around just incase.",

Only reason why I'm giving a 4 is because they didn't even last a year, but up until then they were perfect for sound quality, battery life, and comfort. Also, I did drop them a few times and went through the washing machine (on accident of course) twice. But somehow the ear buds lasted for a while after that. So it might have been my fault as well, but don't expect to get more than a year's use with these.",
