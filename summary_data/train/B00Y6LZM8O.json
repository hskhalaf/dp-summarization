Also have used Free pdf redaer on this read documents. MS office on this tablet by default but have not really used :s . Other then that the tablet works flawlessly Battery life with use is amazing most the time i forget to turn it off over night i,e last night it was 88% this morning it is 76% charge with veriosus apps still running. I like the Professional mode i think its called and have purchased the offical lenovo keyboard stand for this which works well.",

To cut a very long story short, the seller advised me to keep the product when it first started to work again, meaning that I am unable to get a refund as it breached the 30-day cut-off to be considered \"Dead on arrival\". Lenovo have failed to fix the device despite it having been sent off to them twice for repair. Now both seller and Lenovo are refusing a refund or replacement device, despite the fact that it was flagged up as being faulty within days of having receiving it. Shockingly bad customer service - just don't go there!",
