      "text": "I've had this ice cream maker for about a year now and I love it! It is so much smaller to store than the standard style. Considering that most of us with ice cream makers don't make ice cream more than a few times a year, that's a nice feature! Make sure that you run it inside in the air conditioning though. We tried running it outside on a hot day and the ice cream never did set up. It works so much better inside!",

So naturally when I got it I had to try it out, it was actually pretty easy to use and put together. Although I did have one batch that came out not so good, but that was because of what I put in it, or lack thereof. I have used it a few times but my lady is much better with it. This product works very well and I have enjoyed it.",
