Additionally there was a very strong chemical smell. When I went to use them a second time I pulled them out of the cabinet and immediately saw that they were covered in hairy mold. I dried them thoroughly before putting them away but clearly they were soaked and rotted through. What a horrible waste of money.",

I also lost half of my batch of buns to the insides of the steamers as they were all stuck and wouldn\u2019t come off, I soaked them in water for less than 5 mins and they still won\u2019t come off I\u2019m sure if I let it sit any longer they will fall apart.

      "text": "Bought this along with a couple packages of perforated Joyce Chen steaming paper, and this made steaming frozen dim sum much easier (I had previously been using a metal vegetable steamer). Seems to work best on bow-type dumplings; not so well on greasy dumplings, such as some shumai. The problem there is that the oil escapes from the dumpling, passes through the perforated paper, and soaks into the bamboo basket. Makes cleaning difficult. Now looking for some metal baskets to avoid that problem!",
