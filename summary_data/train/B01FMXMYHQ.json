Pity the camera looks good and feels good to hold but if it cannot take a decent photo there\u2019s zero point in buying it as the film is so expensive.

The focusing is terrible, it locks, but until you see the final result, you can't tell if it's on focus or not - and that can take about 10 minutes or more, to tell. That makes it impossible to redo the exact same moment.",

For an ASA of 640, photos are typically very under-exposed or endure serious color shifts. The camera's remote software is pretty cool. The camera's flash seems very insufficient for the film --- outdoors, in bright sunlight, the camera does okay. Maybe my issues are film related - maybe it's the camera - I dunno - so I offered a conservative 3 star rating. I've seen much better results with a fuji instax camera.",

    "description": "THE ORIGINAL. REINVENTED. The I-1 is a camera unlike any you\u2019ve seen before. It\u2019s the first new camera in over a decade for the original Polaroid format. It\u2019s the only instant camera that comes with a companion App for iOS and Android - connect the I-1 to your smartphone via Bluetooth to access a variety of essential creative tools. It\u2019s also the only instant camera with an adaptive ring flash, which provides a soft, diffused light that\u2019s perfect for portraits. Take full manual control of your instant exposures by adjusting shutter speed and aperture. Experiment with creative techniques like double exposure, and paint with light on instant film. Make beautifully lit, well-balanced analog photos in a wide variety of shooting conditions. The I-1 lets you do more with instant photography than was ever before possible. It turns your phone into a remote control for the camera, using Bluetooth to allow the two to communicate. Use the App\u2019s Manual Mode to adjust the camera\u2019s shutter speed, aperture, focus distance and flash strength, balancing exposure with the help of the built-in light meter. It\u2019s perfect for atmospheric portraiture and landscape shots, or capturing trails of city light in long night-time exposures. The App also lets you use your phone to draw loops and waves of light onto a photo, or to superimpose two images onto a single piece of instant film for a dreamlike, unreal effect. You can even trigger a shot by making aloud noise, capturing a glass at the moment it shatters, or a portrait at the moment a laugh rings out.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nOne Impossible I-1 Camera",
