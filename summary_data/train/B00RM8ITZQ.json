      "verdict": "The Adidas D Howard 6 is a performer despite its size and ventilation issues. The non-scuffing outsole can stand wear and tear from either playing or casual use. The athlete can rely on the SprintFrame and Adiprene technologies to deliver support and responsiveness during gameplay.If you are one who love to play hoops outdoors, the Adidas D Howard 6 is a great pair to own. You will enjoy the comfort and support so much that you forget that you still have shoes on, especially after breaking it in. This shoe is just like the HOVR Havoc from Under Armour.",

        "The Adidas D Howard 6 has a traction system that is loved by many",
        "Plenty of users recommend for new buyers to go true to size",

        "A lot of wearers commend these all-black basketball sneakers for its thick and solid outsole, which is good for outdoor plays",
        "Multiple users love to wear the shoe casually because of its unique design",
        "Many acknowledge that the shoe model has a soft landing because of its good cushion"

        "A handful claim the shoe is not breathable enough even with the surrounding perforations in the leather upper",
        "It is as hot as the 12th basketball shoe from Air Jordan"

After a year both soles are peeling at the toecap and there is a horizonal full thickness tear in the leather around the midfoot on the left shoe. I only wore these shoes for a twenty game season in an Army basketball league. The durability of these shoes is questionable, but the comfort is good. They are soft on landing with good cushion. I would not recommend if you want a shoe for its longevity.",
