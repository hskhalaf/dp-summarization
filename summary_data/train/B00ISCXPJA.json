We have done it multiple times and the only difference is this tended to round down. For example if the Striker clocked 76.7 the pocket radar registered 76. We have enjoyed this very much, use it all the time to compare speeds. We bought this several months ago and are still on the original set of batteries. We do not usually use the continuous feature on a regular basis. Great tool.",

The bushnell is accurate if you're very close -within about 20 ft. -otherwise it picks up the ball too late to give an accurate read and gives a lot of misreads. Was constantly off by ~7-10 mph. Ball coach has good range, easy to use, and accurate. Wish I'd bought it sooner. It's expensive, but personally, an inaccurate gun is useless. What's the point in measuring ball speed, using something that doesn't work (Bushnell). Would definitely recommend the upgrade.",
