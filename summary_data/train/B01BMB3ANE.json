While not a Samsung, Asus or HP which we've all heard of, this thing beat them all and for about half the cost. My requirements were a 27\" monitor with virtually no bezel and it had to be visually appealing as I wanted to hang it in our family room for a CCTV system and $200 was all I was looking to pay. This was it. Its thin, has VESA mounts, super thin bezel, very crisp, clear picture and best of all its the price of most 23 inch screens.",

The only issue that i had was when I was trying to figure out how to remove the stand arm from the back of the monitor. I downloaded the PDF manual, but there were no instructions for this. You have to pop out the long silver panel on the back and then unscrew the four black screws that hold the arm on the monitor. Once the arm is removed, you can mount this on the wall or an adjustable arm.",

Now the second one is flickering and sometimes goes to a static-like screen, like the old CRT tvs connected by antenna. Stay away from AOC monitors.",
