But it DOES prevent rust from forming on anything that it's sprayed upon. That's what it does. It prevents rust. It doesn't correct it. Once you understand that, you'll be able to use it for what it was intended. It's a great product, used for rust prevention only. Don't count on it to do anything else. Spray it on nuts, threads, joints, supports, bushings, whatever. It is a great product for maintenance, but not for correction. Once you have a problem, this will not solve it. This is used for prevention only.",

But functionally, this spray tip is useless, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get a nice even coat, The pressure isn\u2019t high enough and the tip does not atomize at all. If your set up for hvlp spraying, go that route. Otherwise you\u2019ll end up with an uneven coat and probably use more of it than you have to. And another thing, yes it does attract a lot of dust/grime. If using underneath a vehicle it will be pretty nasty once the fluid is embedded with grime.",
