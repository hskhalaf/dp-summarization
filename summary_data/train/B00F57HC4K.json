Once I replaced the insoles, all was right in the world again - knees stopped hurting. I average about 22+ hours a week on my feet.

It really does help u from slipping when you're working in a restaurant with slippery/oily floors. I haven't slipped once since I wore these shoes. For scale, I usually get a size 8/37-39 for heels or wedges, 7 for regular boots, and I'm wearing size 8 for winter boots. I guess it really depends on the style and cut of the shoes hence the different sizes.",

It makes them sore after a few hours.",
