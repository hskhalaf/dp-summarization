It is really easy to use and keeps bread/rolls warmer for longer, but only for about 15-20 minutes longer than if I'd used no warming stone at all. I even wrap the rolls in several cloth napkins with the stone in attempts to seal in as much heat as possible. I will continue to use it because it's definitely better than using nothing at all. I just wish it emitted enough heat to keep items warm throughout the meal.",
