I will avoid buying in the future, what's the point of detergent bags that can't keep the detergent safely contained?",

At least one of the three pouches of Tide leaked during shipment- not much but enough to show up inside the shipping box and to make the outside of two pouches slippery, thus the 4 stars. Not a big deal, but I can see the potential for a real mess. Maybe the rush to fill, ship and deliver orders during the pandemic means less careful handling.",
