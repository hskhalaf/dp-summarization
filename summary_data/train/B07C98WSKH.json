To say I'm angry is an understatement. Don't purchase this online. Just go to a bike shop and pay the extra money... it's nothing with our assembly- it's the entire shaft just came apart while my daughter was riding it and since there's no hand brake, she almost crashed.",

I was able to assemble it myself with little or no drama but it was impossible to get the seat on securely so I took it to our local bike shop for final tuning and tightening. I wish it had handle bar breaks if I was to make any negative comments but thats my fault for not paying attention when we ordered it.",
