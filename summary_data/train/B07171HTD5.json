Also the fan is very quiet, and the LED lighting is nice and bright. However, there is only one brightness level for the light, and it is bright. Also, there are no filters included with this unit to use it in a ventless situation! We did finally find some charcoal filters that fit (after some trial and error) elsewhere on Amazon, but they cost almost $50! So add this into the cost if you\u2019re planning on using this as a ventless.",

He removed the plate for inhouse duct after reading all the instructions. Figured in his mind how to go about installing. He held the hood in place, I marked the holes, he drilled the holes, inserted the screws. connected all the wiring. Looks awesome, quiet, love the LED lights. Lights up the whole stove top. This replaced a range hood that was probably installed when the house was built in 1977. Sooooo happy with this. Addendum: Ordered the charcoal filters. Tried to post pics but did not see that as an option. Abke to edit and able to add pics.",
