Though it\u2019s somewhat bulky versus the majority of the tennis shoes today, this stability court trainer is arranged with comfy padding from the collar and tongue to the midsole. It\u2019s designed with a supportive upper and sole to keep you balanced while you dart around the court. If you\u2019re up for the retro vibe, this budget-friendly pick might be the perfect match for you.",

Required no break in before tennis match, had no issues with slippage within the shoe or sense of vulnerability of ankles. I bought these shoes to replace the discontinued Prince Viper which was a mid top shoe, I have had issues with ankle rolling and wanted to have best possible protection in a shoe. These shoes have a sturdy supportive area surrounding the ankle area, not like a mid or high top, but a noticeably firm feel. Time will tell if this structure wears under the pressure of match play,but for now, I feel safe from the dreaded ankle roll.",

Great fit, great support, great ventilation, etc. I was referred to the Ultrascendor as a replacement for the Defier, but I don't really care for the shoe. Unfortunately, I bought two pair. I don't feel the same support, my feet sweat much more, and the material seems flimsy compared to the Defier. I've got to seek out a different shoe. They look pretty good and are an OK shoe, but definitely not as good as the Defier.",

Different folks find different shoes to be a good fit, so perhaps there are those who will not find them to be as comfortable and supportive as I do, but I am very satisfied.",
