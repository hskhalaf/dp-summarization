It is adjustable and has hooks that came with it that attach to it and hook to the side rings (if you have them). Also comes with other ways to attach it if you do not have hooks. I thought it was just a net but was pleasantly surprised to see that it opens up and you can put smaller items it so they do not slide around. It is just what I wanted and more. So glad I purchased this product.",

For sedans, sometimes there are no hooks so you have to drill the given screw into the car body or the inside. No one wants to drill a hole into their baby for a ~$10 net unless it was a major operation. Although there is the adhesive option, the net is stretched from left to right, creating hard tension on the flexible line. There is no way the adhesive can hold that tension. Mine fell out in less than 5 minutes of net being hooked on. Newer cars have push clip options, I guess manufacturer can use that as an advantage for designing hooks.",
