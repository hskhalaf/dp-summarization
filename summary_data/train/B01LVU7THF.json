      "text": "I've had \"silk\" pillowcases before, and they weren't really silk, but I liked them. So I ordered this Zimasilk case, thinking it was more of the same, but it's a step about the others I've had, both in the silkiness, and the fact that there's a zipper on the end. This is pure genius, because with all the other non-zippered pillowcases I've had, the pillows have always slipped out of the case. Adding a zipper solves that problem. I recommend this product.",

I can't speak to that aspect of the pillowcase, but I LOVE using this. I thought the fabric might be too slippery or sticky, but it is SO comfortable and feels so nice against my face. The fabric is incredibly soft, smooth and cool. I've found that traditional cotton pillow cases can sometimes bunch and become uncomfortable but that is not the case with this one. I can't recommend this product enough. 10/10 would buy again.",

I accidentally ordered a slightly bigger size than I need, so it gives me a perfect excuse to replace my flattened pillows. They do come out of the package pretty wrinkled along the fold lines, if you care about that. I'm guessing the lines will fade with time though, so no biggie :)",

I have noticed that my hair gets less tangled during the night using this pillowcase and seems to be less crazy in the morning than it otherwise has been. I can't speak for any skin benefits but it does feel soft and comfy to sleep on. It is slightly too large for the pillow I have it on which makes it look baggy and weird but I don't mind all too much. It has a zipper on one side instead of being open.",

A lot of bedding products contain flame retardants that are toxic, which I want to avoid. Going with silk seemed like the best option. I am so happy with this purchase.",

Also my natural curls keep their shape overnight - seriously, no frizz. I haven't changed anything else, just my pillowcase. I wish I had done this 10 years ago.",

The pillowcase is a little small for my standard size pillow (don't know why), but I fit it in regardless. Other than that I LOVE the color!.
