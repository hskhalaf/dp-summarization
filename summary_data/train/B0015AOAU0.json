The masonry bits are what I needed, but I always need the small normal bits, because, well you know, normal men break them because we are not careful enough. The case is very nice.",

I used these masonry drill bits on a hammer drill to drill holes in 6\" thick concrete blocks and it worked great. I was able to use the 5/16 and 3/16 sizes to drill about 16 holes and had no problem. I'm not sure how they will do for heavy duty applications but for the DIYers this fits the bill.",

They have a tough carbide tip for a long service life. All bits 3/16-Inch and larger have 3 flats on the shank to prevent twisting in the drill chuck. Wide spiral flutes quickly remove dust and debris from the cutting area. These bits are designed for rotary drills and are excellent for drilling brick, concrete, stone and ceramic tile (use at a slower speed). They will require more pressure than a hammer drill.",
