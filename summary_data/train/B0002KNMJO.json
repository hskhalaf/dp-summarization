It was sort of hard to actually get to the table lol But it all went together smoothly and was definitely a beautiful, solid piece. My only complaint was, somehow, the hardware bag came loose so all the pieces were scattered in the box. Turns out I was only missing (1) flat washer, which I could do without. All together, its an easy to put together and heavy piece that is absolutely beautiful! Definitely a table for 2, maybe 4 depending on how much elbow room you want. We only needed 2.",

Do yourself a favor and make sure you measure out the dimensions in the room you plan on putting this table before you buy it! Some people complained and stated this is a kid's table.

It was packaged in an outer box and an inner box. Getting the table unpackaged was probably the most difficult part.",

The smell is getting less noticeable the day after I pulled the table out of its box (or maybe I am getting used to it) and I now have to put my nose right on the table surface to smell anything from it.",

The placement of the screws already makes it incredibly difficult to tighten the legs, but also the wrench does not really wrap around the entire bolt, so it is twice as hard to do.
