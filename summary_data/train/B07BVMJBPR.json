And I guess with a larger dog or multiple dogs you could reload it from your own water container. Anyway, I've ordered several types of water holders for long walks with my dog, and this is the best one yet. Doesn't leak, handy loop to carry with, and the fact that I can fill and draw back the water with just a press of my thumb is super - I'm not pitching it if I pour too much out. Buddy and I like it very much!",

We haven't had any issues with water leakage or any dispensing problems and it seems pretty durable seeing as I've tossed it into my backpack a couple of times when I'm rushing to head out with the dog. Definitely recommending this to my friends with larger dogs and hoping their dogs love it as well!",

The bottle part, however, well...let me just say that I was not even sure what it was! It shriveled up so small, it looked like a doll's toy. Since we only used this item one time, I can't really speak to its other qualities. We did get my dog to drink out of it, so that was good. Unfortunately, I'll have to buy another one (different brand).",

It is also easy to take to the vet or on walks so you are not worried about fumbling around with a separate bowl and water bottle. The lock works great to keep it from leaking, and I love that you can easily drain the water back into the bottle if your pup doesn\u2019t drink it all! Definitely recommend it!",
