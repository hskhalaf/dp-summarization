The test strips were original all white but this morning (Saturday) when I opened them they were a yellowish orange on the test point. Now I\u2019m questioning if I really am in keto or if I have false readings. I\u2019m going to try another brand. $8 gone down the drain smh Edited. I am adjusting my rating to 5 stars. I got my Nurse Hatty keto strips today and did a test of each brand to compare and they are the same. So it doesn\u2019t seem that the discoloring of the strip had an effect.",

I'm getting a new bottle and hopefully they will respond the same way this one did early on.

I am a hospital laboratory technician, I am very familiar with how testing strips work. The fact that I'm not getting any result with these strips after a week and convincing weight loss is unsettling. I'll give it a few more days then I'll go to my urologist for confirmation.",
