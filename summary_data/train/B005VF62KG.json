The unit itself is solid -- mostly metal -- and heavy, which is actually a good thing because it stays put on your desk. It just feels well made. I'm giving it 4 stars because often it takes more than one finger swipe to login. Not terrible, but I would like it if it was able to get it on the first try more often.",

So often I have to smack a key or click the mouse and then go for the fingerprint reader, and if I do it too quickly it won't read it.

This was a very unfriendly setup and I wasted 2-3 hours trying to make it work without success, so I returned this unit to Amazon. Buyer beware, unless you have a full knowledge on how to set this up, don't go there!!",
