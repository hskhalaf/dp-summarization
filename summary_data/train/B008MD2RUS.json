      "text": "BUYER BEWARE! Have owned this microwave for 7 months and it is used occasionally by 2 adults. The glass pane on the door completely shattered and sprayed glass shards everywhere after simply pressing the button to open the door. VERY DANGEROUS. Amazon did nothing as the 30 day window for returns expired, which is unfortunate given that (1) the product is obviously defective, and (2) the life of an appliance--regardless of cost--should last longer than 7 months. Now I have to contact the manufacturer, have them file a claim, see if they will agree to fix the busted microwave, and wait the endless days while eating cold pizza. Pay more for something better!",

I used it manly for heating food and baking potatoes. the one thing I'm not keen about is that at the end of its cook time it beeps five times in rapid succession, my old oven beeped just once.",

It has 10 different heat settings including defrost, cook delay, a keep warm feature, and it's very quiet. For the price of this machine, you can't go wrong!! don't think that is a valid complaint. I can see fine when putting items in and the light in my kitchen is plenty for me while cleaning.",

I needed it small enough for an apartment counter top but large enough for large plates - plus I wanted higher power than most small ones. It was exactly what I hoped for - plus it has the instant time settings - one push of a button. It was a little noisy - rattled on top when running. I put a place mat and baking dish on top and it stopped. I know that shouldn't be - but it is light weight metal and affordable so a small price to pay.",

We have had a microwave for years with identical wattage but it finally died, ordered this one with same wattage but it takes half again as long, at least, to heat anything even on highest setting. VERY slow to heat. Would not recommend buying this.",
