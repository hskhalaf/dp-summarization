If I need more cameras I will definitely go with this brand.",

All was fine until a couple of days ago when I went to unplug the cord from the camera. The camera was so hot is started to melt! The entire thing is warped! This is a big problem! Please be cautious and check your cameras occasionally to see if they start getting overheated and get rid of them immediately!",

      "text": "This was easy to setup, video looks really good. App was easy to follow and camera seems sturdy and fairly small so is descrete if u find same colored background or hiding place. Only downfall is need to have memory cards or their cloud storage which can get expensive if on a budget and have several cameras. It's 70 for 3 cameras/7 day storage. 100 for 5 cams /15 days and 170 for 7 cams/30 days. U can download to phone, PC or tablet but not tried that yet...so not sure if u can do that remotely. Also not sure if u can download from memory card or if u can clear something from card remotely.",

The camera is great, and it even works at night thanks to the night vision. My only issue with this model is that it needs to be manually adjusted for a different angle, however, there are models that are just a tad more expensive that you can purchase that have that capability so I will not fault it for that. Overall, great price, and works just as it was advertised.",

Also- the camera has a really wide scope and covers a lot of area. The two-way audio also works really well, and the speaker on the camera is actually a lot louder than I expected!
