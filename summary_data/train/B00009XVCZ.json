The one that focuses fine, is my favourite go to lens, from street photography to various wedding pictures, and general all round use. its a pretty magical lens for certain situations and at F1.2 it creates a one of a kind Bokeh which I love. its almost dream like in its beauty. I rate this lens up there with some of my Leica glass which costs substantially more. I have seen some negative reviews on this lens, but if you buy from Amazon and aren't happy its easy enough to get them replaced.",

      "text": "Bought this for my dad's birthday, as he's recently taken up photography as a hobby. It is brilliant for indoor shots, due to its low aperture; which basically means how much light is let into the lens through to the camera. This means that for indoor use, you can get amazing bright shots of people, or objects! The only thing that is different for a amateur, is that you can't zoom in or out, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, as you get another perspective of the image, as the photographer is forced to move! Brilliant lens would highly recommend for someone wanting to brighten up their indoor shots!",

This lens equates to an 80mm lens which is ideal for portraits although I have used it for other topics. With an aperture at f1.8 lower than most zoom lenses this is great for capturing the subject when a small depth of field is needed. Although criticised for the plastic shell it is light and small to keep in anyone's camera bag. Also with being an EF lens it fits the older EOS film cameras and the Professional EOS 1's and 5's.",

The 50mm bodes well in fairly low light and social situations, being fast enough to catch anything you want. I actually dropped it this year, shattering the plastic part of the lens. Guess what? Still works. Gonna keep using it until it falls apart and when it does... I'll buy the same one again.",

      "text": "canons entry level 50mm 1.8 is the ideal \"next lens\" to buy for anyone wanting to move away from the standard lens supplied with their camera. It takes amazing portraits with a very pleasing \"blur\" in the background so your subject \"pops\". In my view the only thing which i find annoying is the manual focus ring, it's just too small (right at the very front of the lens) to do anything useful with (not a problem if you use autofocus) - of course if you have the money, you could go for the canon 50mm 1.4 which has a proper dedicated focus ring (.... and costs three times as much)",

      "text": "This is my first prime lens and after using this lens at a party it's a great lens, Especially for the money. Yes it's cheaply made but it does produce some good shots. The only problem I found was focusing in the dark it would seek quite a lot, sometimes missing a good shot. The 1.8 aperture is very low and good in low light and creates great images with bokeh backgrounds that helps focus on the main subject. I would recommend this lens to anybody with a canon dslr with a low budget .",

With a constant f/1.8 this makes a lovely portrait lense; crisp, clear pictures that really do take your dslr up another level. One word of caution though, you will need to buy a lense hood seperately (naughty Canon), and it's awful to use; why make something so simple so bloody awkward. Anyway, super lense and super cheap.",
