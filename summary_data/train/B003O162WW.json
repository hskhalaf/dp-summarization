Our children and grandchildren (not to mention other people on the beach and in the lake) had a blast as we launched the rubber chickens, also purchased from Amazon, from the beach out into the lake. Our family and others enjoyed racing to the chicken for retrieval and passing back to the balloon launchers. Our object was to see who could get the featherless chickens to fly the furthest. The launchers worked great! They were easy to handle, took some real stretching and never broke or skipped a beat. We packed them up to use again next year.",

      "text": "Not a bad launcher, but the 120 yard unit might go (at most) 75 yards, unless you're slinging water balloons in a vaccuum. And to send it the furthest it can go, you'll need quite a strong person (adult) to pull it back and let it go. Don't think you can have a kid hold the other ends either. You MUST secure at least one side to a post or tree, otherwise you'll be lucky to have it travel 40 yards. Best case is to try and build a wooden transportable launch station that you can mount to the ground or in the dirt, and do all the launching with one person. Still, a lot of fun this thing is.",
