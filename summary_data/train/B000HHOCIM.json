The only thing stopping me was that it was a waste because I had perfectly functional scoopers already when I got this one for the other locations. Super recommend this for anybody who has trouble bending over or has litter boxes in hard-to-reach corners. Seems super sturdy I've been using it for several weeks now and I'm very very pleased.",

It's supposed to help you not have to bend down so much - I have't really noticed that positive but I do feel this thing is almost indestructible! I wish it came with a holder but alas it doesn't but for the price and quality? This is a great scoop!",

But, we've been a multi-cat household for many years before that...that means many years of scooping litter. We currently have 7 litter boxes and I've decided to upgrade all our litter scoops to this Petmate Ultimate Scoop after using it once. Not that scooping cat waste is my favorite task - but this scoop is that good. It makes the chore an easy one. Even my 13-year old commented that she loves this scoop. In her words: \"It's sturdy and easy to use\". If that means she'll clean litter boxes more often then the investment in these Ultimates are well worth it!",

I get several years usage per scoop, though; and keep buying them, because they fit the bill so nicely (price is right, too). RECOMMENDED",

With this one, you don't have to get down in to the litter box like others, and it gets a lot done with each scoop.",

      "text": "After asking my question about using with Yesterday's News Litter, I went ahead and ordered one to test since the slots appeared to be larger than \"usual.\" I am happy to report that this scoop does indeed work perfectly with the shape of the Yesterday's News Litter! (YNL is slightly narrower than Feline Pine). I ordered three more just now to go with my other litter boxes. I hope others are able to find this when they look at Yesterday's News Litter!",

This distressed both me and my adorable 10-yr-old rescue cat and he began holding his urine until the box was clean -- not healthy for a cat his age. The day before this scoop arrived, he watched her leave, and as soon as the door shut behind her, he got up and went to the litter box. This scoop has made it possible for me to attend to his comfort myself and we are both delighted. Just sign me A cat slave!!",

It is the perfect length so that you don't have to bend down too much and it's strong enough so that you don't have to worry about it snapping in half or flipping a lump back up into your face. Bought one initially and then came back and bought one for each box. =^..^=",

      "text": "I needed a scoop that would be big enough to handle waste from my 11 lb cats - both deep and broad scoop, and strong, but also with a longer handle as I had just gone through hip replacement surgery and could not bend over too far. This was exactly what I was looking for! While it isn't super long, it added just enough length for me to scoop while sitting on a stool. And the size and strength is just right, the grip on the handle with the indentation for the thumb, just perfect. Love, love this scoop.",

Oh also, I've read some negativity about the 'teeth' on the front of the scooper. I think they work great and have had no issue with the litter breaking up.",
