I called again this year and the rep sent me a \"Santa\" to placate me. Well, it's a Santa body and hat but Geldolf hair. The Santa hat won't fit on the head. I'll be especially careful next year.",

If you do this, just make sure you put the tray back in correctly, as the Lego build directions are on the back of each Advent calendar flap. We got this for a Black Friday /Cyber Monday price. It was a fantastic deal. He loves the little Star Wars ships, people, and accents. Awesome! :)",
