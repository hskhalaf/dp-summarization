Not super fitted or tight but gives the right amount of looseness around his legs. Also compliments his butt ;)",

The quality feels so cheap and they aren\u2019t comfortable feeling at all. There is no fleece lining inside like usual sweatpants have and even just the outer fabric feels scratchy and gross. Not good at all. I didn\u2019t even wanna keep it for myself let alone give it as a gift. Returning right now.",
