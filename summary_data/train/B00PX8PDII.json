What did it for me was the fact that lays nearly flat to create a bassinet that can be used with a newborn. My son is 4 months, but we plan to have more. Love the canopy! smooth ride. Only 4 stars since the parent tray is hard to install and it doesn't have a child try...other than that great stroller and it stands on its own taking little space.",

Kids bar with drink holder is a little awkward and tips drink back a lot, but generally a nice feature to have. When it folds up it is still pretty big, but it rolls very easily making the fact less of a detractor. Just a few of our favorite features, the list could go on!

The seat does not have as much padding as other strollers I've seen, but my son does not seem bothered and always enjoys going for walks. The stroller steering is excellent and it is good on bumpy surfaces. Highly recommend as a more affordable alternative to other jogging strollers out there",

The only thing I wish it had is a tray. The seat reclines to a totally flat position, which is great if your baby tends to fall asleep while in motion -- and again, it only takes one hand to recline the seat. Plenty of storage under the seat, and I love the zippered compartment on the handle for my phone and keys.",
