Hey, that's what they are designed for! Some sort of design failure with this shoe. I just ordered another pair of a different design and will return these to Teva. I still love Tevas but not this particular design.",

However, two years ago, my Tevas broke after less than a year. I figured it was a fluke, so I ordered them again. It happened again. Same issue: the part near the ankle that is anchored into the sole literally ripped out. That's two pairs in two years, so I'm tempted to give this product a 1-star review. But I still think maybe I'm just unlucky. Teva still seems like a good product, but maybe it's just this one particular model (Holliway) that has poor workmanship.",
