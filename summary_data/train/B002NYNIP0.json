      "text": "I usually do full coverage only since I have a lot of discoloration, freckles, and redness in my skin. This product has converted me to tinted moisturizers. It is thinner than a more expensive tinted moisturizer I was trying but covers better. It absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way. It'll last long since you don't need very much and I am perfectly comfortable wearing it out and about all day. The coverage holds fine and doesn't fade terribly. I was really impressed with how it made my skin feel. I have sensitive and extremely dry skin, especially in the winter. Love this product.",

I have a lighter complexion, but expect it to become a couple shades darker, now that summers aporoaching. So, this level of tint works perfectly for me.. very natural looking. I would highly recommend this product! It has now become my, go to tinted moisturizer. I needed search any further!",
