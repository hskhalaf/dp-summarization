None of the neighbor kids tease him about not riding a regular bike. They all ask to ride it. My only complaint is that his lower back gets really red when he rides for a long time at once sometimes resulting in a bruise. He just puts a small rolled towel behind his back and it\u2019s helped a lot. Great trike and would definitely recommend to others.",

The back wheels worry me as they are not rubber but a thick hard plastic (picture the wheels on a Lil Tykes toy but much more durable) and I'm concerned that after more use they will wear. But I can't dock a start based on what might happen, so five stars. My husband is 6'3 and he is able to ride it.",

It is a real bike tire on the front and plastic wheels on back. Our younger sons like to stand behind the seat and go for a ride!",

The tools it came with were subpar and striped out after the second bolt. Over all it\u2019s pretty cool and turn lots of heads while riding it. I gave it a custom paint job and put new grips. The flag pole had to go it rubs on your back and is very uncomfortable. And if anyone knows where to get a coushined seat replacement please let me know.",
