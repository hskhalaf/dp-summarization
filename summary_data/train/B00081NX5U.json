Their installation is easy and versatile, either with the included sturdy brackets or can simply hang on the wall directly via the screw hole. Construction is solid and they have a bit of weight. The composite plastic material with which they're built should see them withstand the elements - but that's not how I'm using them. I'm using them indoors as mains in my store room setup, with a separate 8-inch sub that complements their sound. They do sound really good, though. There is some bass and the heights are not harsh at all. No distortion at high volumes from my Sony receiver. Nice clean sound. Highly recommend.",

I was skeptical to buy a set of speakers priced well under $50, but they are for outside around my pool, what could it hurt? These speakers exceeded my expectations 10x over. They sound great, no distortion, even with the volume cranked up(on a high quality amplifier). I ran 14 gauge oxygen free copper stranded speaker wire, the book recommends at least 18 gauge but mine are a good distance away from the receiver and amplifier.

I paired these with a cheap amplifier for ambient noise on my porch, and they work more than well enough for that.

Pair this with a Lepai amplifier and you have a patio or garden stereo system for about $50. My only complaint is that the clips to hold the speaker wire in place are a bit flimsy. I used some lower gauge wire and they definitely had some trouble holding it in. You're probably best off sticking with 18 gauge wire, which is what the manufacturer recommends. You will hear some distortion if you pump up the volume too high, but you're buying the wrong speakers if you're intend on rocking the neighborhood.",
