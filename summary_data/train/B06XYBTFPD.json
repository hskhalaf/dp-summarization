Was very easy to install on the wall. A small level, screw driver, drill to make holes in drywall for drywall anchors. Looks fantastic on the wall! I would recommend that you swap out the wall attachment hardware that comes with the shelf with better quality ones. Good drywall anchors and stainless steel screws is what I used. Firmly attached to wall. At this price point, I would highly recommend this.",
