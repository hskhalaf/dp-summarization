Again AIMESH is getting better and better over the last few firmware updates and phase 2 of AIMESH will bring further enhancement. Only slight negative if I was picky is its range appears slightly less than the RT-AC86U which uses the same Broadcom chipset. I use this router with RT-AC86U AIMESH nodes and the setup works brilliantly.",
