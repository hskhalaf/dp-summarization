B+D made \"Cost Savings\" by removing the inner ring dirt shield that prevented dirt from flying out in front of where you are edging. I'M sure B+D management will say the new design is a \"Product Improvement\". I will say it's a Profit Improvement !! I swapped out the black plastic blade shield part from the old one into the new one, and now it works just fine like the old one !! Shame on B+D Management !!!!!",

      "text": "While this edger works, the quality of the results are lacking. The edger doesn\u2019t penetrate deeply enough to my liking. In fact, I will sometimes forgo this one to go back to the 25 year old b&d edger that this one was supposed to replace. It is more difficult to use because it doesnt have as much power, but the resulting edge was much more deep and defined than this one. I wish I could return this one.",
