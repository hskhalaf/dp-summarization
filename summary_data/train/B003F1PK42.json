You can see that is a cheap headphone, but it works. You can easily plug in any headphone that you may have. Everything else seems to be of very good quality. The violin is not as silent as I thought. I wish it would be like an electronic piano where you just plug in your headphones and no one can hear anything. You can hear what you are playing perfectly without the headphones. The sound is more beautiful with the headphones. But compared to an acoustic violin the sound is much lower.",

Not sure what brand of strings it comes with but the G&D are decent; A&E are pretty rough. Give the strings a few days to stretch - they will stay in tune eventually! Buy better ones when you can. Cecilio seems to be a fairly reputable company from the videos I've seen. I purchased with the \"fretless finger guide\" and it fits perfectly.",

Saying it isn't silent when it makes minimal sound, you're being ridiculous. I have 2 mutes on my traditional violin, and it's still louder than this thing. It's light, durable and just a nice looking instrument. It's a classy compared to other electric violins that are horrendous looking. I haven't played it much, but it has a very nice timbre.",

      "text": "The violin is great. Everything about it is great. The only downside is false labeling and a string problem. The false labeling is that the product states that it is silent, but it is not. I could be wrong and do not know how to make it silent. But as of the moment, I believe it is false labeling. Once I received my product, it was all great until I tried the G string. The string was all loose, it would not tighten at all. it took a while until I finally managed to keep it tightened. But overall, the product is great.",
