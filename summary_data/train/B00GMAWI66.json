You don't have to use a lot of it, but other oils can easily do the same at better prices.",

Not only did the argan oil seem much thinner/watery, but the dropper is horrible. When you pick it up out of the bottle, the oil drips almost in a stream from the dropper so that you don't even need to squeeze it and can't control the amount you use since the oil is too thin to stay in the dropper. I returned and bought my tried and true brand (Foxbrim) and am much happier with it!",

I am about 60 percent gray, by my natural color, and the texture of the gray hair is very dry. With the argon oil it feels and looks like the rest of my hair without being oily. Warning, only use a little on the ends, or it can be really oily! This one little jar will go a long way.",

So far, it's all good. Delivery was fast and that pleased me. The price is a good bargain for the size bottle I received. Stay tuned. Thanks AriaStarrBeauty!",
