This is based off one time only and both new, so I can't speak to the wear of either or anything other than these cookies, so take this review as you will",

The sheet itself was room temperature, so there was no unreasonable thermal shock. This is completely unacceptable. I suppose the other 7 sheets will do the same thing. I'm very disappointed with my purchase. Seems that Amazon reviews aren't much more than initial impressions of products and borderline useless.",

I didn't spend much on them but im still disappointed I suppose, so I can't complain much, but I will. The pan came with a massive dent on the side, that affects how flat it is. They must have gotten hit by some machinery. The massive dent is making the whole bottom of the pan a bit warped. Which sucks! The whole point of a nicer pan is that it stays flat. A pre bent pan doesn't really pas muster to me. So I got a great deal on these pans, but they aren't really worth more that what I paid for them.",

I feel so mislead con the fact that I was missing out on great cooking. I use this for everything! The food always comes out great whenever this pan is used. It gives any meat I cook a nice sear. This is easy to clean as well. I never have had any issues with food being stuck. My daughter accidentally put one in the dishwasher. It lost its sheen but it still works great.
