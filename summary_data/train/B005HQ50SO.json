      "text": "If light is low, don't zoom in too far--that's going to be the advice almost any affordable camera you can find. The swiveling screen is great for taking high resolution selfies--or if you need to hold your camera above your head to get photos over all of the other parents. The viewfinder is excellent when you don't want to use the screen, or can't because it's too bright. Takes good photos. Easy to use if you want it to be, has lots of features if you want to fiddle with settings.",

I have had people stop me and both concerts AND baseball games and ask me what kind of camera I have because the pictures turn out so good! I bought this camera for my upcoming vacation to Disney World because I wanted a decent camera to take with me. I could not have asked for a better purchase. This camera only cost me $450 when I ordered it and takes pictures like any $1000 camera would. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice camera without that $1000 price tag. My sister was so impressed with my photos, that she purchased one for our vacation too!",

      "text": "I use digital cameras to write operating manuals for charter yachts, and this is my second Panasonic (my first was my standby for seven years!) I love this newer one. I like the extreme closeup capability, the extended zoom, and the flexible positioning range of the viewfinder screen. And, of course, I like the quality of the images, which is terrific. My only complaint is the closeness of the camera's lens to the front of the lens bezel: it's easy to smudge the lens while shooting in tight quarters, but certainly this is a minor squawk. This camera will satisfy all but the most demanding photographer's needs.",

We've taken candid pictures of animals, grandkids, relatives, etc. as well as crafts and flowers, and are quite pleased with the results. The camera handles well , responds quickly and predictably, and the image quality is pretty good. These things we kind of expected. We were pleasantly surprised by the zoom lens. I thought with a bonkers long lens, it would be hard to locate and track subjects, and frame pictures. Not so. It's actually pretty easy. Also, the high def. video is outstanding and easy to use. Not a cheap camera, but one of our better purchases.",

It still works. The newest version I have excels in every manner, except the 2.8 f-stop can no longer stay at 2.8 with the larger sensor, but with much better low light quality it is a worthwhile trade off. The newest feature of outstanding quality is the video. For professional use I still use Canon cameras and their best lenses, however for freedom and great fun the Lumix is my daily companion. It is the Swiss army knife equivalent in image capturing.",

Once you master the settings you will find that this camera takes fast sharp pictures in all lighting conditions. For example, taking a portrait, there are numerous combinations of settings that are available. The bottom line - This is not a camera for someone who just wants to just point and shoot.

For everyone complaining about the jerky video on the FZ150 but then state the 1080 on their other cameras is fine, they need to know that 1080p on the FZ150 requires more processing speed...That sometimes includes the computer processor, video card, software, RAM and especially the SD card..The 1080p moves almost double the data over the 1080i...

I myself will add the rode videomic pro with the rode dead cat wind muff for a better audio. However; the audio is acceptable, if you are in close proximity to the camera. The Panasonic DMC-FZ150 is a winner.",

    "title": "Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "The 12.1-megapixel DMC-FZ150K continues a long line of great hybrid digital cameras from Panasonic by giving you more options not only in how you take pictures, but including the ability for full HD 1920x1080 60p AVCHD movie recording. The camera's 24x Leica DC Vario- Elmarit lens system featuring two aspherical lenses, three aspherical surfaces, three ED elements, and one Nano Surface Coated Lens gives you more options for framing both your photos and movies, and the intelligent auto shooting mode allows you to take great worry free photos and movies. A new High Sensitivity MOS imaging chip, hybrid digital camera technology, and an improved processing engine make sure that you're able to capture photos and movies in the moment by reducing shutter lag and increasing burst shooting potential. Add in a bevy of scene options, movie color modes, and an anti-glare treated 3.0\" LCD view screen and you've got one incredible package in digital camera form! And it shoots 3D still images that can be viewed on your 3D compatible TV.File Formats Still Images: JPEG, RAW. Movies: MPEG-4 AVC/H.264.Battery Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery Pack, 7.2VDC, 895mAh.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe LUMIX DMC-FZ150 is fully equipped with a 25mm ultra wide-angle LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT lens and a powerful 24x Optical Zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 25-600mm) available for shooting both stills and videos. Additionally, the LUMIX FZ150 has two of Panasonic's newest features \u2013 newly advanced Nano Surface Coating technology which helps minimize light reflection that causes ghost and flare \u2013 and the new 3D Photo Mode. \n\nAs the top-end model of LUMIX's popular FZ series, the FZ150 combines a new 12.1-megapixel MOS sensor and the renowned Venus Engine giving the camera high-performance image recording capability in both higher light sensitivity and speed. And as a step-up from the recently announced LUMIX FZ47's 1920 x 1080 60i video feature, the FZ150 realizes 1920 x 1080 60p Full-HD AVCHD Progressive (MPEG-4 / H.264) format. It is also possible to take still images while recording video simultaneously (3.5-megapixel) and the powerful 24x optical zoom is available in video recording. The FZ150 incorporates a stereo zoom microphone with a Wind Cut function, so that videos come with high-quality stereo sound through Dolby\u00ae Digital Stereo Creator. \n\nThe Light Speed AF of approx. 0.1 sec never misses fleeting photo opportunities. To encourage step-up users to enjoy shooting even more, full manual control is available with the FZ150. Users can enjoy image shooting while expressing their intention not only in photos but also in video, utilizing a host of options including the new Creative Control and Photo Style with a wide variety of preset options. The effective hand-shake correction system POWER O.I.S. now gains Active mode, which helps to record stable video even if shot while walking. \n\nThe LUMIX's popular iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode powerfully assists in any shooting situations to get the best results. Thanks to the Intelligent Resolution technology, Intelligent Zoom is available with the FZ150 extending the zoom ratio by approx. 1.3x, maintaining the picture quality while combining a digital zoom. This means the 24x optical zoom can virtually extend to a 32x equivalent. Not only drawing near the subject that is far away with its powerful optical zoom, the 25mm ultra wide angle lens captures approx.196% wider angle of view compared with a standard 35mm camera. This is helpful for shooting dynamic landscape or indoor group portrait. \n\nThe popular iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode is also available in video recording. The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer), Face Detection, Intelligent Scene Selector and Intelligent D-range Control also support shooting beautiful videos with ease. The Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Normal, Portrait, Macro, Scenery, and Low Light modes according to the situation, to optimize visual quality. The Intelligent D-range Control makes images look more natural by preventing blocked shadows and blown highlights to optimize the exposure for each part of an image. It also ensures a beautiful reproduction of gradation and details. \n\nA new 12-Megapixel High Sensibility MOS sensor pursuing Resolution, Sensitivity and Speed has been incorporated along with the renowned Venus Engine enabling the FZ150 to excel in image processing power. The combination of these powerful components results in the S/N ratio improvement by 3.9dB (ISO 100) to 4.7dB (ISO1600) compared with the predecessor \u2013 the FZ100. Newly developed Multi-process Noise Reduction applies optimum noise reduction according to the brightness of the part of the picture. Both high frequency noise that occurs in the dark part and low frequency noise in the light part are suppressed even in a picture. As a result, Images recorded in low-lit situations are now dramatically clear. \n\nThe Venus Engine has a quad-circuit system for processing large amount of progressive Full HD data at high speed. Not only 1920 x 1080 60p smooth Full-HD video recording, but also super fast consecutive shots at 12 fps (without auto focusing) and 5.5 fps (with auto focusing) in full resolution. It is also compatible with recording high-speed video at 220fps in QVGA. At the same time, the multi-task image- processing engine, the Venus Engine, realizes a super-fast response time. The auto focus gains approx. 50% faster speed compared with the FZ100, achieving Light Speed AF of approx. 0.1 second. The speed in AF Tracking also becomes faster, thanks to the improved tracking performance which doubles its sampling frequency. \n\nThe FZ150 provides the new Creative Control mode with a selection of artistic effect modes; Expressive, Retro, High Key, Sepia, High Dynamic, Miniature Effect, Film Grain and Pin Hole. In addition, Photo Style is newly added to the FZ150 for the expression of finer nuance. It has Standard, Vivid, Natural, Monochrome, Scenery, Portrait presets, while enabling finer adjustment of contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction by each. \n\nAs a further step-up from the FZ47, the FZ150 is equipped with a hot shoe allowing attachment of various accessories including an optional stereo microphone (DMW-MS1) or an optional external flash (DMW-FL220 / FL360 / FL500). The FZ150 is also compatible with an optional remote shutter (DMW-RSL1) for advanced expression in photography. \n\nThe newly-added 3D Photo mode takes 20 panning shots and then the camera automatically selects the two most suitable images \u2013 one for the right eye and one for the left eye \u2013 to synthesize a 3D composite. The 3D image can then be viewed on any VIERA 3D HDTV. The format of 3D images is compatible with MPO which can be played back on other MPO-compatible equipment. \n\nOther features of the Panasonic LUMIX FZ150 include:\n\n * Motion Deblur Mode, which helps to prevent blur. \n * Intelligent Handheld Nightshot Mode, which generates beautiful night scenery with illumination by layering multiple images shot consecutively. \n * PHOTOfunSTUDIO 6.5 BD Edition Software makes it possible to sort and organize photos not only of those newly taken but also of those stored on the PC with quick start-up and fast read-in of images. Recorded videos can be edited with the Short Movie Story function and written into MPEG2 to burn onto a Blu-ray or DVD disc. \n\nWhat Is In The Box:\n\nPanasonic DMC-FZ150K Digital Camera, Battery, Battery Charger, Instruction Manual, CD",
