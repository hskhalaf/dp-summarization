The only thing I'll note is that, although it doesn't say so on the product description, in the package there was a warning that these candles are designed to melt and turn liquid like votive candles do and should be burned in a container. However, I've been using them for short burns and so far they have not actually melted and turned liquid (this is not a complaint, just an observation that you may want to get a votive holder if you don't already have one if you're planning on burning these candles for long periods of time, but for short periods, e.g., for meditation sessions, it's probably unnecessary).",
