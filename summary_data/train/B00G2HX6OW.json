      "text": "I bought this projector for my business, a hookah lounge. Needing something of quality yet budget friendly, I decided to give this projector a try. I am thoroughly impressed with what this has to offer. It has a great picture and my customers love coming to watch hockey and other sporting events on it. The picture is awesome and clear. I am showing it in a semi-low-light space, but still with ambient light and multiple windows this item shines through. My screen is 84 inches wide and not sure how tall, but if I had more wall space this thing could fill it. It makes me regret buying my 47 inch tv for a hundred bucks more.",

We have it at about a 11' distance from a white painted wall, and it makes avery nice 100\" screen. Still visible with sunlight coming through 3 windows, but much nicer when it's dark out. Cheers!",

Otherwise the product is worth for your penny spent.",
