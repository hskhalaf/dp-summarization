I have nothing against using a cheap body board from CVS ( that's what I ended up buying anyways because I returned this item) but when I am paying a substantial amount for a body board, I expect it to be better quality than the one I bought at the drug store. This material is so cheap. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. this is a great board to use if it was only $10, but not for anything more.",
