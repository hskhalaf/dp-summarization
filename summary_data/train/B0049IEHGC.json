The True Induction brand cooktop is not only 25% faster to heat a gallon of water, it also has a much nicer control surface. The True Induction top is solid and crumbs can't fall into the edges.... the Other Brand has edges which can trap crumbs and grime. My sister loved this for making a white sauce. I used it under a pressure cooker. It is very easy to keep the temps right where you want them.",

    "description": "The True Induction P3D single-burner induction cooktop has a glass-ceramic top with a 1,600W burner and a control panel and is suitable on a countertop for heating and cooking food using stainless steel or cast iron cookware (sold separately). The heat on induction cooktops typically can be adjusted more quickly and precisely than on electric cooktops, and induction cooktops typically use less energy than electric or gas cooktops and can be wiped clean once cool. Glass-ceramic withstands quick temperature changes. The burner can be adjusted from 150 to 450 degrees F and has 10 quick-touch settings for precise heating. The timer can be set for 0 to 150 minutes. The cooktop measures 12 x 15 x 2-1/2 inches (W x L x H). (W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; L is length, the horizontal distance from front to back; H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point.) It is rated for 120V.\n\nSequoia Brands manufactures products under the True Induction, Sentry Safety Pool Fence, and Chicago Food Machinery brands, among others.
