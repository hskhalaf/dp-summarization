But even with its shortcomings, it is outstanding. I have a collection of such books and this is the best.",

      "text": "One of two field guides I purchased. They're my first and I'd say I'm very impressed. I don't know jack about rocks or minerals or gems or that there is a difference. I liked this book a lot because it adds the chemical composition and it's broken down very nicely. A little history, a little insight. Each page has a couple of different rocks on it with what it is along with a picture. Really nice little book.",
