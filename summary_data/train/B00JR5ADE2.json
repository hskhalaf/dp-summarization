This style is much easier to clean and maintain than the faux cart poppers, which require disassembly after each use in order to clean. Its best not to melt butter on the top as it will only coagulate along the sides of the lid - - this is common with all poppers of this style. Its easy to just microwave butter in a small bowl and pour over the popped corn when done. One negative is that when I tried to pop the maximum allowed (3/4 cup) half the kernels did not pop. I now always pop 1/2 cup which works great.",

I have to unplug and replug several times to get it to pop adequate amount of kernels. Contacted customer service within designated time for Return and no response. Good flavor but a pain to operate.",

I think it heats up enough to start popping then the heat element goes off too soon and it stops popping. If you let it sit and stir for a couple more minutes some more kernels will start popping again but by then it's too late and you'll never get a full batch.",

Had to re-pop 90% of the time. Finally it just would not get hot enough to pop at all. Poor choice. Don't bother.",
