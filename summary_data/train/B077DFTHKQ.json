The audio is terrible because there is so much static you can't hear whats going on near the sending unit. The reliable range is less than 60' in our house with no metal or concrete walls in between. The field of view of the camera is smaller than other monitors we've used. The brightness seems to auto adjust on its own randomly so it gets very bright and dim every couple minutes which is really annoying in the dark while you're trying to sleep at night. Maybe I got a dud but this thing was junk.",
