It does what it says...it stays on all day and it doesn't come off. Because of this, it's imperative to get it exactly right when you put it on which isn't easy because its very gloppy right out of the tube. Any mistakes will be there all day (a lip liner might help). Once its on, it looks great but is definitely matte. A layer of lip balm makes it shiny. Recommened.",

Also, it lasts a decent time like 4-5 hours without a touchup if you put a thin layer on. It is very pigmented too so no worries about that. One other negative is a lot of product goes on the applicator when applying so I usually have to try to scrape some off before I apply it so o don't get too much on. Otherwise great product!",

It's very very matte and not at all moisturizing -- and applying anything like chapstick to moisturize your lips will dissolve the color. Once applied, make sure you wait until it's totally dry so you don't smudge it-- but after that, it's bomb-proof. I can put it on in the morning before work and when I get home after dinner that night, it will still be there! Very long lasting and great if you like the dry/matte finish.",

I would recommend this if you wear matte lipstick with no gloss or moisturizer over it. But if you like to add a clear gloss over your color, this can get all over your face.",

The lipstick has staying power and isn't too drying, but I don't want to look like a corpse all day.

All 5 times I have worn this lipstick, it has easily smudged, from minutes after application to a couple hours later. Drink and food wipes it off, even brushing against any surface causes smudging, and it doesn't fully last beyond a few hours.",

It isn't 100% transfer proof (very small amount comes off on straws/coffee mugs) HOWEVER this doesn't really negatively impact the staying power, and I found I can go almost a full 8hr work day before applying a second coat, because while it does fade some, it fades in a very natural way. It also smells and feels lovely on the skin, almost buttery? It goes on lighter than it dries also, maybe darkening a shade or two in the process, so don't be alarmed if it seems too light at first. I've got the shade Patina. Just buy it!",

      "text": "One of my friends introduced me to this lip stick. I tried hers on and I LOVED it, she got hers from Ulta it lasted me all night I this product did not need to be applied again ( even after eating and drinking). I then decided to order mine off Amazon when I got it it seemed different and it did not last me all day. It had to be applied several times and it started to flake. I ended up just taking it off completely since it was already starting to come off. I might try the one that Ulta has to see if that is different.",

It is a perfect dusty rose that can be applied with a light hand for a touch of color or with a heavier hand for a dramatic pop! I exfoliated, moisturized and primed my lips prior to application and the result was TEN HOURS of continuous wear. It lasted throughout my entire shift at work, through multiple cups of coffee and a serious case of the munchies. I cannot recommend this product highly enough and have already placed an order for several more shades.",

I was also able to dab on a bit of lip balm over the lipstick once in awhile to keep my lips hydrated without the color coming off. The shade 'Amore' is a deep matte berry/brown shade that looks awesome on my fair, cool toned skin. I like that it is a darker shade that isn't too loud.",
