It keeps my entire small body warm. This jacket is fantastic. It is so freaking warm and instantly blocks out the cold. The only thing that I do not like is the Hoodie. It is so small it doesn't stay on my head. Oh and the velcro on the Hoodie keeps snatching my hair! Everything else is great the inner pockets are nice and I just love this jacket.",

I'll waterproof it, even if it's repellant. Durability is unknown, but it seems very well made.",

I am 6 foot and 155 pounds, slimish build and normally wear a medium to large in coats and shirts (depending on brand).Jacket is very warm, light weight, not overly bulky,and has enough pockets...although as others have stated, the chest zipper is for show and not a pocket (could have, should have been a real pocket!), Have not tested it in heavy rain for waterproofness yet. Overall so far...very pleased.",
