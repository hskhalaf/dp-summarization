This makes me hate the dam thing. I did not tighten them excessively at all. Just enough to hold the visor up, adjusting them just to the point that the visor would not fall down easily. Tightening them this lightly caused them to strip. If it wasn't for that I'd give it five starts because otherwise it works well, but it deserves one star for failing to perform it's designed purpose.",
