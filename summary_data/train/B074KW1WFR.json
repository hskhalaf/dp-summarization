      "text": "I have used two gas cooktops that are from different manufacture. This gas cooktop (GE PGP9030SLSS 30 Inch Gas Cooktop) is the best. I thought gas cooktops were more or less the same regardless of who manufactured them, it was just transferring gas plus oxygen. After purchase this gas cooktop, I realized my thought was so wrong. Apparently GE knows that how gas cooktop works and knows how to build it. This is the best purchase I made.",

      "text": "Love this cooktop. If we had room for the 36 in model, we would have bought that one. Only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars was because it is difficult to clean. Seems no matter what you cook on it, splatter gets down on the stainless surface around the burners necessitating the complete removal of the heave cast iron grates to clean the stainless under it. Would be nice to redesign it for easier cleaning.",

It is very nice looking and works well -- love the middle burner for boiling a big pot of water for pasta -- and easier to clean than the older one. However, the knobs are higher than the burner grates, and if you put something hot down on the grate and it touches a knob, the knob melts. My older cooktop had shorter knobs and this never happened in 20 years.",
