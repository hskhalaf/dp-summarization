The drill gets the job done, especially for the price, but I wish it had some sort of speed control. It has one speed, and that speed is very fast. That was fine for drilling into my walls, but ended up making some tasks like a building an ikea bed a bit harder than good old fashioned man power.",

Once you apply even the slightest bit of switch pressure, you are at 100% power. Not bad if your drilling. Not perfect if your screwing.",
