The wash and wax (main reason you're buying this) is absolutely excellent. The only bad thing in this kit is the window wash. The little wipes dry out very quickly and leave little fuzzes, but does good with the cleaning part. Overall I still give it a 5/5 because it works and it's a damn good deal.",
