When you're weighing the cost and benefits of this saw, that should be figured into your calculations. To me this is the main issue with this tool and the reason it is a 4 star rather than a 5 star item. The battery also makes the saw quite heavy compared to other gas and electric chain saws.",

This was on sale for $289.00, and it came with a 60v 6AH battery. The battery is much bigger than what was advertised. Can't wait to use the Chainsaw.",

You have to be aware since the noise is so low compared to a gas saw. The battery is big and although well balanced, it's not as light as say a plug in saw but probably comparable to a small gas saw. I noticed that it uses a good amount of oil and that you are probably going to have to fill the oil before you need to charge the battery which outlasted me by far. No case but does have a chain guard. Works for me!",

You can cut set it down, move brush, pick it up pull the trigger and you\u2019re ready to go no pull starting.
