The handle gets super hot and I hate the knob that you have to push up in order to pour the water out. I wish I could just return and purchase the old version. The handle is also a crappy plastic material where as the old one was a soft nice rubber. HATE THIS TEAPOT!!!!!!",

      "text": "When heating more than a cup of water, it certainly is faster and works exactly as advertised. The fins on the base do add a small amount of weight - so for small quantities, the speed advantage is negligible. One additional benefit I've noticed is that there is much less hot air that flows up towards the top of the kettle, so even if you're heating a full pot, the handle doesn't end up getting hot. When you're trying to get that coffee going quickly in the mornings, the faster boil time is definitely helpful.",

He loves it, and it heats up on our gas stove about as quickly as the electric kettle did.

Cons: None really but it is a bit heavy. Not a con for my boyfriend though!",
