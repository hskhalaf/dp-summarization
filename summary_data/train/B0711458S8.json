I used it to cut 1/2\" PVC for a sprinkler line I put in, and it cut through it without any problem at all. It's very well made and heavy, and the ratcheting action takes all of the stress off of your hands. Highly recommended!",

Would prefer a more swift, scissors like cut. At times I would loose my place while cutting due to the multiple ratchets need to bring the blade to full cutting position.",

For my needs though, I will revert to another curved non-ratchet tool. I think this is really designed for heavy duty or industrial use only, and for that purpose, its probably excellent.",

The ratcheting teeth seem too far apart, so it doesn\u2019t grab well after each handle squeeze. I had to push the blade end with my free hand to get enough blade movement to catch the next ratchet tooth, which defeats the purpose of this tool and is probably a safety risk (along with the pinch point many others have mentioned in their reviews).",
