I haven't used the camera a ton yet, but did take a number of photos and videos of my son playing basketball and baseball. The ability to select stills from a 6K or 4K video is really cool. Autofocus is fast when you use Panasonic lenses. It didn't perform as well with the Olympus 75mm, but I need to do more testing this upcoming week.",

I still own GH5 and loved it taking stills, but G9 is much better in taking stills. Positives are: It has EVERY possible features in a camera and did not spare any, ergo, fps, large eva, quick focus, rugged, sharpness ... etc. Initially I did not like the sensitive touch of the shutter, but I love it now",
