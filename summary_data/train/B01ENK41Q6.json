My only complaint (- 1star) is that the dispersion holes in the reservoir are a bit too centered and do not direct water to the outer ring of coffee in the filter. I find I have to remove the reservoir and pour a little hot water around the edge to wet all of the coffee. As with most single serve drip units I find I have to add a little more coffee for a decent cup verses a multi cup brewer (1 scoop per 6oz). Otherwise really a great unit, would downgrade just a half star if I could.",

Since I've only used the french press for ages, I had no filters on hand when the OXO arrived and was tickled to find that there were quite a few cone filters included in the package!

Brews a single cup quickly, simple construction, super easy to clean, packs away nicely when not in use, doesn't need special coffee, and doesn't cost a fortune. And the taste is great. (Although, in all honesty, I think the french press made a slightly better-tasting cup of coffee, but the trade-off for ease of use was worth it to me.) I highly recommend this product.",

The tank makes it so you get the perfect amount of water and spread every time for the best extraction from your coffee. No need to worry about using a gooseneck kettle. Also, the benefit of being able to pour the water into the tank and then walk away for a few minutes can't be overstated, honestly it's my favorite part. This has quickly become my go-to coffee making method taking the place of my AeroPress. Easy to clean, just throw out the filter and grinds and quickly rinse.",
