I didnt know what to do but I was definitly upset. I started setting the temp 30\u00b0 above and it mostly came out right. Has a small leak on the glass seal on the door.",

Super helpful :( After back and forth emails, I got a very short, we don't have that part anyway. If you are looking for a pretty smoker that doesn't work to sit outside and look good then get this.

After about three months, the meat probe stopped working, so I bought a bluetooth thermometer and discovered a second problem. The internal thermostat consistently read 20-25 degrees too high (It would say 225, my new thermometer would read 200). No wonder it took me so much longer to smoke anything! If you read other comments here, you will see the same complaint, so its not just my machine, but a design flaw. Now that I bought a reliable thermometer, it's working better for me, but I shouldn't have to.",
