I have been using these to process pallet wood. They get beat on and slammed and prayed on and loaded up and they have stood the test. Even the foam bumpers on the top are not showing wear yet (so far just pallet wood but plenty of nails and staples) I suspect these will last me a long time. Very pleased",

The materials are a little \"lighter weight\" than I expected, though the rating of 1300lbs is clearly printing on them. I bought these to make a platform for working on my lightweight truck camper. Given that I can leave the jacks down, I feel reasonably ok about them in this scenario, and when I use them to make a regular work bench they are very nice.",
