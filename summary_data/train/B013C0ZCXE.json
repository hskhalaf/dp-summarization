The initial setup did take a little bit of time, but once you get through this first step adding it to your additional iPads or iPhones gets much faster. As far as printing is concerned it's pretty fast. I was also very impressed with the quality of printing color photos. As an example, my wife printed a copy of our grandson on photo paper, and wow! the quality is outstanding.",

The installation though is an issue. The dialog windows are small and the selection buttons at the button were truncated. I had to guess which one to select, and fortunately I guessed correctly so the installation was quick and easy. This will be a problem for some not as lucky.",

All other colors print excellent, but no black. This is the second Canon printer that has done this to me! What do I buy next?",

The only negative I have is that the lower paper tray will not hold very much paper.

The problem i have is with the maintenance required with the printer head. It has to be cleaned or it will not print correctly. The printer does come with a self cleaning mode. Also the time it takes to actually print after you press print is longer than I would like or expected. I suppose it's fine for home use but I would not but it again.",

So far no disappointments or problems, it works exactly as advertised. Easy wireless set up and all of our various devices (both PC and MAC) immediately recognized the unit and printed through it. Posted reviews stated that this printer works well with low cost non-Canon brand inks. I use them and can attest that this is true. Purchased the white model as it was a bit less expensive than the other colors offered. Very pleased with this printer would recommend it to a friend.",
