I wish I hadn't purchased this and I wish I had paid for attention to the reviews - the real ones.",

The pulleys are made of a cheap plastic with no bearings, this creates a lot of friction and noise (squeaking and friction) while using the cable hand attachments. This noise is a constant noise, and the more weight on the machine the louder it gets due to lack of bearings (I only weight 150lbs). Additionally, the sliding track is nowhere near as smooth as a total gym would be, seeing that I\u2019ve owned a total gym in the past. The attachment for squats is very narrow which causes your knees to be in a position that puts a lot of stress on them.",

Features wise, it compares to some of the most exepnsive Total Gym models while coming in at a lower price than the most basic Total Gym model. The additional resistance available from the the bungee cords puts it over the TG in available resistance.

This is the perfect piece of home exercise equipment when you can\u2019t make it to the gym. It offers a versatility to perform many of types of exercises that target most muscle groups. The adjustable resistance is a great feature as well. Best part of this product? It folds up into a compact form that can be stored upright or laying down! If you are looking for a piece of home exercise equipment that will essentially help you accomplish a total body workout at home without breaking the bank, I would highly recommend purchasing this product!",

I don't have much problems using it, but I feel if they just slightly changed some things about the design it could make it much more stable and comfortable. All in all worth the money, but I bought it for $130.00 recently the price has increased to $145.00, I'm hoping it's because they improved the design. Also the upper arm/leg bar isn't adjustable and is pretty uncomfortable on you're feet even when wearing shoes.",

I will be able to add incline and resistance as my strength increases. The only issue I have is that the exercise chart/ workout guide was not included as advertised. I have messaged Amazon but have not heard anything on this issue. Therefore I couldn't give 5 stars.",

As far as use compared to Total Gym: sled is heavier on this so I found myself lowering the incline to a lower degree to get the same performance as a higher level on the TG. Also sled slides not quite as well but nothing to complain about. I only used base model TG, which this has many more exercise options. Leg workouts and chinup/pullup bar plus added resistance bands make this well worth it. I'll amend this after long term results.",
