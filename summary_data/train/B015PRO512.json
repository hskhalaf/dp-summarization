Just be sure and either open the appropriate ports on your firewall or temporarily disable it while the controller software initializes and adopts the AP. Any difficulty you may encounter setting these up is generally associated with your browser version (use Firefox) or blocking by your firewall. After setting this up I did a speed test and was getting 76 mbps down and 7.5 to 8.0 mbps up..... wirelessly. Ain't bad.",

I'm not sure how easily a non-network engineer will understand all of the nuances, but the base install would probably work for everyone and leave the more complicated features for those willing to explore. It's a great AP. And, yes, you can turn off the blue light if your kids complain it's too bright. :)",

Noticeable reduction in latency. Great great experience.",
