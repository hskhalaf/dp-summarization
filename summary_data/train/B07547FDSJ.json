I was sad when I got it that it was missing screws but then I emailed support and they replied within an hour. Probably within 30 min and told me that 8 of the heavy duty screws were already in the bars. I thought it was missing because it also came with screws in a small plastic bag. I\u2019m very happy!!!",

So far, not an issue, but I will update if they do break. ... the board is permanently tilted. I wish I could adjust the tilt, but it is what it is.

If you plan on writing a lot on the board though, I do recommend getting dry erase marker pens, as regular markers make it near impossible to write small and ledgible. Very satisfied with this product in general, and I would definitely buy it again!",
