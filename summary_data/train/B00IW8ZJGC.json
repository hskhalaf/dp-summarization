On my first day out I was digging about half coins and half trash, which is a good ratio, and I found a cool ring. It is super light, usb rechargeable, and very compact. Setup takes seconds. It also has a ton of advanced features for experts, but the simple defaults work great.",

Then delve a bit deeper into Deus Fast and the other modes for more detailed detecting. This is a great detector for cherry picking since it's so fast. Absolutely love it, and the updates keep coming! V5 was just released along with a bunch of new coils and a new MI-4 pinpointer!",
