An unfilled dummy is best for us since we can add weight as he grows. Also saves shipping cost. The fabric on this is tough. I don't see it ever ripping or blowing open. Cotton is the best fabric to use for filling as it is the heaviest. We only gave it 4 stars because we haven't taken it to a ring and used it alot yet.",

Then tying the strings was difficult- especially the last part and trying knot it off. But the kids are having fun, so it is worth it. Warren B",
