      "text": "This set is perfect for at-home workouts. The weights are well-wrapped with a slightly texturized coating, and the grip areas are a comfortable diameter for my hands (I wear size small ladies gloves). The stand was a nice addition and was simple to assemble. Since it has been difficult finding reasonably priced dumbbells in higher Weights (like 10 -15 lbs), this set is a good compromise\u2014 I will be able to double up on some of them to get close to the higher weights I need. And, the price was quite good!",

I struggled a bit with screws, not hard but didn't seem like the fit easily when putting the stand together. I took me about 10 mins to put it together. It's nice that it came with its own screw driver. I agree with previous reviews that the stand isn't sturdy. However I consider the stand bonus. Overall very nice set of weights.",

The little stand is easy to put together and a great way to keep the weights organized and out of the way when not in use. It even came with a screwdriver to assemble. Packaging was kept to a minimum, keeping the weights safe and avoiding too much extra waste. Really excited about finalling purchasing these for myself!",

I use it to put the weights away, behind the couch when the grandchildren are coming, that's it. For the money, absolutely worth it!",

Dumbbells require more balance than training with barbells or machines, and balance is crucial for optimal performance. Dumbbells also require more muscular control than barbells, thus enhancing kinesthetic awareness. The best part of training with dumbbells is it allows the athlete to train through a greater range of motion than barbells on some exercises. Understand that it is sometimes more valuable to trade heavy weights (Barbells) for more sport-specific movements.\n\n\n\nStyles: \n\n * 20-pound dumbbell set with stand: 3 pairs of dumbbells in 2-pound, 3-pound, and 5-pound sizes; \n * 32-pound dumbbell set wth stand: 3 pairs of dumbbells in 3-pound, 5-pound, and 8-pound sizes; \n * Vinyl coated dumbbells (Pair): From 1-pound to 20-pound colored vinyl coated hexagon dumbbells in pair;\n\n\n\nAT A GLANCE: \n\n * Wide selection of dumbbells;\n * Hexagon shape for easy storage;\n * Sets come with dumbbells and stands;\n * Vinyl dumbbells come at a pair;\n * 2-year warranty.",
