Very sharp chain that stays sharp for a very long time. I have mine to cut down trees 20\" in diameter and have cut a lot of firewood with it, and still haven't had to sharpen the chain. Still goes through the wood like butter. The instant stoppage of the chain as soon as the trigger is released is a real nice safety feature. This is a great product.",

Just a 2% drop in voltage could cause a motor to overheat and fail. A 16g vs a 12g could result in a 50% drop in voltage and that's just free spinning.

I would stop every fifteen minutes or so to keep the motor from overheating. The wood was weathered and very hard but it did the job. Never had the chain come off as some reviewers stated. I just made sure to tighten the chain every so often.",

This saw went through it without ever stalling or kicking back. Nice and light it took about an hour. It doesn't cut real fast like my Stihl saw but does the job at a nice easy pace. Its actually light enough to trim trees and thick hedges. For the price and ease of use highly recommend.",
