The light background still makes it easy to read. I had a tricky time getting the batteries snug enough to keep the pendulum working, but eventually found success. As a whole effect, the accent on the top is diminished, compared to the design of the lower portion. Maybe it just appears a little out of proportion (bottom heavy, as is the nature of a pendulum)? The clock is quiet and I am still glad I chose it !",
