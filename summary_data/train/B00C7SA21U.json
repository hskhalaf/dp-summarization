      "text": "Purchased this cable after returning an AmazonBasics 10' USB 3.0 extension cable. This cable seemed to work at first, and so I kept it, but it's only slightly better than the Amazon's. Anything connected to the cable -- be a simple flash drive, or a USB hub -- disconnects from time to time. Most of the time reconnecting the cable fixes the issue -- sometimes it doesn't. Big file transfers? Don't bet on it. Midway through a transfer (1GB or 60GB), 50% of the time the drive will disconnect. Lesson learned. There are no reliable 10' USB 3.0 extension cables. It's a USB 3.0 limitation. Best bet is an active/repeater cable for cable lengths longer than 6'.",

I own a few of these cables, either 3-feet and 10-feet, to attach flash drives to a laptop, a desktop, a television, a computer monitor, or a Roku. These cables are extreme time and frustration savers. I choose blue cables so that these can be easily seen and distinguished from other cables that might be in use.",

I can use it with my phone, but I don't get a fast charge. I think the great price is due to an inventory reduction of outdated cables. They are great quality, though!",
