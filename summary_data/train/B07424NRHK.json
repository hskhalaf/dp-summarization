The problem is that they are extremely flimsy (you can easily fold each shoe in half) and they simply cannot hold up to stepping on rocks or uneven surfaces. The rocks go right up into your foot and cause it to hyperextend. They\u2019re cheap, and you get what you pay for! If you\u2019ll be navigating rocks with your water, do yourself a favor and spring for something with a rigid sole.",

My feet were in real bad shape. Anyway, I would definitely use these shoes on regular sand or rocky beaches, but never again for shelly areas.

It is pretty light I wouldn't think it would work for a hike in river beds or even sandy beach but is a good water aerobics shoe.",

We walked 10+ beach miles a day, and my feet felt great. Yes, they can pick up small pebbles in the sole, but that doesn\u2019t affect comfort, and those pebbles can be removed at the end of the day. They pick up some sand, but that\u2019s easily dealt with at day\u2019s end as well. My only wish is that they would dry faster, but I bought 2 pairs in order to trade them out when one got wet. Would absolutely buy them again and recommend to others.",

Some cons but not deal breakers: When wet sand gets into the shoes it does feel like you're walking with concrete bricks on your feet. Also, small rocks do tend to get stuck in the holes of the sole. No big deal, just pull them out. I will definitely purchase these again!",

      "text": "I bought these shoes to wear while river tubing and they did great. The upper material is basically a light plastic material that easiky drains so shoes do not get heavy with water. These were quite easy to slide on and off. While they stayed in place for me, if there had been a stronger current or mud I think they would have slipped off. One con is that after being in the water for hours, these shoes seeemed to rub on my skin more than normal making them uncomfortable until they dried out.",

I have yet to try them in water, I probably never will - unless I get caught in the rain while on my scooter. Haha.",

Some folks have noted that smaller rocks and pebbles can become embedded in the honeycomb-like the sole pattern. This is true. But they can be picked out fairly easily. Run true to size and are size equivalent to a pair of Nike or Adidas running shoes, in my experience.",
