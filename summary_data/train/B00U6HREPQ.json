Not sure what adult could tolerate sleeping on this, but I returned it immediately, and purchased a different brand (not sure why I strayed in the first place, my fault for trusting reviews).

      "text": "I\u2019m really thinking about taking this off my mattress and returning it. Been sleeping on it for a few days and I swear it feels like sleeping on a toddler bed. This cover makes a plastic swooshing noise when you move around and it\u2019s loud. Its probably good at keeping the mattress safe but I\u2019ll never know because I can\u2019t get over the swooshing. On the plus side, it fit my 14in king mattress just fine. It wasn\u2019t too big and was easy to put on. I did it by myself. It was well sewn and put together. I will try a different brand tho for a quiet cover like I had before getting this one.",

We have slung this thing around cleaning under our bed and the material is strong enough to not rip, tear, or having any issues with breakage at all.

The cover feels really nice and it\u2019s not crinkly which is what comes to mind when I think of waterproof mattress covers.

However, this one when I finally figuired it out fits around the longer part of mattress side. I don't believe their were any instructions to explain this or I just didn't see them. But it is still a great buy! Sheets stay on top of it great also. So I would recommend this one.",

I bought this mattress encasement and was very pleasantly surprised with the quality. The waterproofing is on the inside, and the outside is a soft fabric that feels just like a bedsheet. It is not at all crinkly. It is thick, feels very well-constructed, has velcro, and was comfortable all week. I can't speak to the waterproofing of the protector because it didn't come into contact with any liquids. However, it definitely seems like it would be more protective than a regular mattress cover. The thickness alone would probably prevent most stains.",
