It did have a long break in period during which the cocking effort was very difficult and the trigger was a bit gritty. After about 500 rounds it has smoothed out, cocks easier and accuracy is good and getting better. This is an adult airgun because of the cocking effort and it is heavy at over 10 lbs. scoped.

I purchased a red dot sight from Amazon and installed it on the rife. Now it shoots really good for the price range (about an inch or under at 20 yards) and still has plenty of power to take care of pests.

I ordered 30mm Cantilever Scope Mount Tri Rail Rings Picatinny Weaver Solid Aluminum Which fit right on it, but I didn't realize the tri rail was for a larger scope diameter. That was remedied with electrical tape bushings around the scope, worked great.",
