I bought an extra 2-pack, so I can do 4-player Tetris and Mario Kart. I wish the price of the controllers and accessories was less.

The joy cons are very sturdy! i would recommend the pro controller, buttons on it are a lot bigger and feels more natural! I 1000% recommend the switch there are so many games to come! I\u2019m hoping for Smash Bros Switch and some kind of Poke\u0301mon game!",

We will see how it lasts but the picture is great, my son loves it, and it appears to do what it says on the tin.",

Any slight touch on the stand will literally just let it fall over, just by breathing on this stand while it had the switch in it, caused it to fall over and scratch the switch. In all seriousness, the stand is absolute garbage for a stand, it literally just sucks as in just a slight touch it falls over. Not only that, the switch literally has NO way to stay in the stand, allowing the switch to just EJECT the hell out and you can't even put a screen protector on in stand mode.",

      "text": "I basically spent $400 to play two Nintendo games. In terms of the hardware and experience, the only gripe I have is that using the joycons is painful. They feel fragile and the right stick is way too low to make the handheld experience comfortable. They did a great job making the \"switching\" functionality seamless, though. My major problems are this: - No messaging - No voice chat - No party options - Very limited third-party apps (I have a freaking weather app on my PS4) - Too expensive If Nintendo would improve their app marketplace to make the console a more encompassing home experience, I would increase this to 5 stars.",

When I called Nintendo, they told me Amazon didn't register my device's serial number. Right now, my device runs for a couple hours after being left turned off for about a day. However, it can't detect any wifi networks. After running for a couple hours it eventually freezes and gets stuck on the Switch screen again. This is so upsetting.",

You have great selections like Breath of the Wild (duh), Mario Odyssey (yes), Fortnite (meh), Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! (absolutely), Dark Souls Remastered, Skyrim, Monster Hunter: Generations Ult, and of course Smash Bros. Ultimate (everyone's here BABEEEEEEEE)!

      "text": "The Switch itself is great, if a little underpowered. The Joycon controllers, however, are really unreliable. When playing in handheld mode, they generally work fine, but docked, they disconnect frequently and the controls get stuck. This seems to be a universal issue with all Joycons as I\u2019ve tested several different sets since the Switch first launched, and all of them suffer from the same issues, with varying reliability. The Pro controller is generally much more reliable, so I highly recommend getting one if you plan on playing with your Switch docked.",
