These are very entertaining even for us parents and are great for learning colors and developing gross and fine motor skills. The white base pieces are a little difficult for little hands to push together, but that's okay by me because they don't slip apart while playing with them.",

They have four prongs which are very delicate and break off easily. After a few years' occasional use I had only two (of 24) left. The new set has held up better, but three of the four prongs which hold the crank onto a gear have also broken. They should sell these more delicate parts separately so you can replace them rather than having to buy an entire new set. I won't buy another.",

      "text": "This toy was purchased as a Christmas present for a 3-year-old granddaughter. It is an excellent gears-type toy with beautiful pieces that work very smoothly together. The turning mechanism is easy to use and the colorful designs look gorgeous when the gears are turning. A variety of configurations are possible, adding to the play value. The one drawback is that each circular gear has 4 tiny prongs that must be lined up with 4 tiny holes on a base piece. Sometimes the 3-year-old was able to place the gears successfully but more often than not she required help. Despite this problem, this toy is fun for adults and children alike and invites exploration and experimentation.",

When I was in High School, it was mandatory to take an Air Force test prior to graduation. One section was all about gears, and thinking about which way each one would be turning. I aced the Air Force test......especially the mechanical part.....not too shabby for a *gurl* LOL! I want my grandchildren to do more creative, critical thinking. This is such a fun way to encourage it. I have given these to others in the past, and the funny thing is, even grownups have a blast with them! They definitely encourage *quality* time.",

Only two small issues: The handle had a tendency to fall off as it was turned. Also, the user must fit the gears into the base by pushing four pegs into the holes in the white pegboard-style base. This required a bit of adult help. The pegs are thin enough that I can imagine kids eventually bending and breaking them. In fact, several extra mounting pieces are included, so it seems like this is anticipated by the manufacturer.",

He enjoys snapping the base pieces together though and watching the gears spin. If I could do it again I think I would get a different gear set. This is just too hard to construct for a toddler.",

I am a little dissapointed that the plastic pieces that hold the gears the gears are held together by friction; they don't actually interlock. This is good for young, small hands but because they don't truly interlock, they flex a little too much for me. For this reason, they are better assembled on a hard, flat surface rather than on a carpeted floor. They are carefully molded and the gears spin freely on their \"hubs\" so they work well even with long assemblies of many gears. Overall I am satisfied.",
