      "text": "Wireless set up is a breeze if you follow Canon's Youtube video which demonstrates clear, step-by-step directions on how to set up the printer for wireless use. Set up video for Windows and MAC can be found on Youtube . If you use MAC filtering on your wireless router, you will need to ADD the printer's MAC address to your router BEFORE you begin the setup. The printer delivers clear, crisp documents. The scanner is a bit LOUD but it works well. Copying a document works well and copies are delivered quickly. I don't have a telephone line so I can't comment on the fax system but I have a similar unit at work and it's perfect.",

It's fast, quiet and print quality is great for a monochrome. It has a ton of useful features like the quiet mode, scan to email, and scan to a network share. The web interface is very simplistic and i can see how some can get lost in it when setting up smtp/pop/smb settings but there's plenty of help online for those looking. Seems to be better built than some competitors. I highly recomment it if you don't need to print in color.",

Riddle me this: I can connect to the printer and print wirelessly with no setup at all, but I have to buy this special usb cable for scanning? Complete bullcrap. Very poor customer service. Additionally, the cable is only $5. I'm not fussing about the extra money - I'm irritated I have to waste my time because Canon was too cheap to include the cable.",
