I plug it in about an hour before I have to eat lunch and my food is perfectly warmed. As a teacher, I get tired of turkey sandwiches or trying to wolf down what's supposed to be a hot lunch but isn't for whatever reason. One of the best things is I don't have to worry about microwave explosions or having to clean up after someone else. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a hot lunch every once and while, and is crunched for time.",

By then the contents are perfectly hot! Great for on the go! It fits perfectly into my suitcase and doesn't take up much room at all! Easy to clean as well. I recommend this to anyone who is look for a cheaper alternative to a hotlogic! Two thumps up!!",

The plastic cover is what covers the opening of the pot and is separate from the colored cover. The plastic cover doesn't fully seal the pot and is slightly ajar no matter how hard you try to press down. I'm not sure if it's because we had kept the pot plugged in and on for a long period time as it was meant to keep warm the food my grandmother received in the nursing home. However, I don't think a product that is a heating element should have parts that can be so easily warped by heat.",

At that time I stick the container in the crock pot, plug it in and an hour later my lunch is nice and hot, all the way through, not like a microwave that heats in spots. I love it!",

Not sure how long it takes to heat up as I just plug it in when I get to work, but everything is piping hot 4 hours later when I go to lunch. Good volume for lunch, works with more than just soup. Lid starts to smell a bit after lots of uses and warps as well so it doesn't fit as nicely, but the screw top holds it in place just fine.",

The plastic lid is ok but an aluminum lid would be better, but the item doesn't get hot enough to melt the plastic but again it is heating up plastic. The cord wraps around the then tucks into the underside so it sits flat. Great product for anyone who has access to an electric outlet for an hour or so. Also great to take a hot dip (Artichoke green chile cheese) to a party.",
