I was able to fit the power cord, hdmi cord, 4 games in their cases ( i was not going to trust the disk sleeves to hold my game), 2 controllers, and the xbox1 itself. The construction is fare, not as durable as i thought it would be. I had to rearrange the dividers that came with if for the storage of games, ect.works best when the case is on its side so that the xbox1 isn't pouting pressure on the storage underneath. as of right now i would buy it again unless something better more rugged comes out.",

I usually do business travel with my Xbox and found this case to be very useful, it has room for 2 controllers, the Xbox, the power supply, a small external HHD, cables and even has slots for some games. Here is the con: Flimsy slot for the games, I don't use those slots. There is no room for larger headsets that most gamers use. The case uses odd Velcro straps to hold the Xbox in place if feels flimsy but it is secure.",

First of all you have to take your games out of the case and store them in this \"Flap\" that rests on top of the XBOX, every single time, WITHOUT FAIL, they get loose and flop around begging to be scratched. They simply do not secure the games and is the worst thing possible. Even if by some miracle they stay in their \"Flap\" when you open the bag they fly all over the place. It's so upsetting. The bag ripped with only a week of daily use so it's sewed together really cheap. This is a flawed design and simply does not work well. Avoid at all costs.",
