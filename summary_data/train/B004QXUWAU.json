I'm sure I'll kill the plants eventually, but I like to garden so I keep trying. Very happy with this purchase. Update... My dill plants not only survived my brown thumb, they flourished and matured! I also planted the garlic chives and they did excellent as well. Yay! Happy dance!",

I would advise to plant the zuchinni and summer squash directly into a big, deep pot- they don't do as well in seed starter pots, and end up leggy.

The 12 Pack CERTIFIED ORGANIC HERB SEEDS offer a wonderful selection of possibilities. These created a beautifully trailing thyme and a robust basil. The real Jack-and-the-Beanstalk-Winner is the dill, which (in Southern California) doesn't do well at all. But with these seeds and the Aero Garden, we've made abundant supplies of it. In fact, the dill gets too big for the Aero Garden and then goes outside, where it promptly withers. But we just plant another kitchen crop and the dill keeps on growing.

      "text": "Herb Farmer.. Let me start by telling you I've bought many herb seeds, and I'd have to say this has to be one of the BEST! They have great and easy instructions on every package with pictures. I'd have to say about 90% of my seeds germinated. I recommend this product and will continue to buy. If you aren't growing amazing herbs with these seeds you just don't have a green thumb.",
