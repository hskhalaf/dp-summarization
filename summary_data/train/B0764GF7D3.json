We went for a long walk and my daughter did a wear test- she said it was comfy (she had 2 water bottles and a jacket in it). We are a big fan of North Face bags because they just last incredibly long-two we used to have lasted so long, that they were donated instead of thrown away (they looked still new after couple years of use; we weren't using those particular style of bags anymore).",
