This is the nicest tool I own and when you take it out of the package flick your finger on it and it rings like a bell. Beautiful tool steel and made in the USA!! Perfectly beveled and you can get into tight spots within passes and scrape out stubborn slag. I think these are way better in quality than the wood handled Atlas brand - my buddy has one of those and he's constantly resharpening it.",

Wooden handle junk that loosens up, hammer heads flying off, made in that other place where everything seems to be made.

You don't have to use any force, just a gentle 'tap' and the flux falls off. Its also a beautiful hammer. The handle will never come off, and it doesn't have that horrible wire handle that is always getting crushed. If I ever need another chipping hammer I will not have to do any research, I will buy another Estwing E3-WC.",
