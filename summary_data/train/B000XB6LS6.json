I do have to turn the temp up to max, and then about 25 minutes of waiting after that. The \"bun warmer\" concept on the top of it will only do just that... warm them. And just a little bit. But let's face it... when you open your fridge, and you see relish... you know that hot dogs are the only logical and realistic way that you are going to be able to eat it. Sweet relish... dill relish... doesn't matter. Makes you think of hot dogs.",

The coupling that turns the rollers does not match or hold the gear tightly enough for the rollers to turn consistently. This results in hot dogs being burned on one side and uncooked on the other. The rollers are difficult to turn as well. Combined, this is just a cheaply made product that anyone should be ashamed to sell.",

However, I have to say, this was a very good buy and exceeded my expectations. Very easy to both put together and clean. Following the previous tips about pre-heating the roller, being attentive to the \"size\" of the hot dog or sausage that I placed on the machine, I was well prepared to adequately cook for our event. I pre-cooked the 1/4 lb. dogs and Italian sausages before putting them on the roller. It's not the fastest way to cook hot dogs/sausage. But it provides a gr-8 ambiance and good tasting food!",
