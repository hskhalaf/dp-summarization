I haven't had them through the winter yet, so I'm curious to see how they hold up, but I did spray them with Camp Dry, so I'm hoping that helps to keep them in nice shape! The color is Toffee is also really fun. I was crossing my fingers when I ordered because they went down to a great price and I was pleasantly surprised by how pretty the color it. It's nice and warm without being too \"orangey\"(is that a word??) and coordinates well with lots of colors.",
