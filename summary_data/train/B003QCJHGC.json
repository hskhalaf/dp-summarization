There is also no contact number anywhere in the documentation to speak to someone from the company. The documentation say it can take 7-14 days for delivery. of missing parts.",

The entire project took about 20 minutes, and that's even with customizing the glass rack! For the price this is a beautiful wine rack.",

The top shelf was a bit uneven, color wise, but easily concealed. The hanging glass rack is functional, but not very smooth. My cheap large wine glasses are a bit larger than ideal for this track, but they fit ok. The wine rack itself is simple, but fully functional. This rack is inexpensive, but functional. For the price, I have no major complaints. It is a simple, high capacity, inexpensive wine rack. If that's what you need, this certainly fits the bill.",

Be careful not to shake it too much as wine bottles can and will eventually fall but it takes a decent amount of movement depending on the bottle. I modified mine to have rubber grips where the bottles sit to create some traction on the wood. They move way less and everything feels much sturdier now so in case a dog or child bump it the wine shouldn't move much. Otherwise fantastic product. About as good as your going to get for something premade at this price point. Cheers.",

This was acceptable to me as I was favoring sturdiness and the ability to hold a good number of bottles. I had all of the parts and didn't find any glaring imperfections. My wife loved it.

If you've built a piece of furniture from IKEA, then you have all the skills required to assemble this wine rack. Ended up fitting really nicely near my kitchen counter and the dark wood seems (to me) more appropriate than a light colored wood to hold wine bottles.",

Took no more than 20mins (at max) to put together. Like how it hold different size bottles. A plus why I got this and not other ones. Think I might have to get another just for my hard liquor.

Once together, it was very sturdy and wasn't wobbling. Since I have big wine glasss, i had to put the wine on the second rack and work down but that's not a problem. The wine rack looks great and blends i well with my living room furniture. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.",
