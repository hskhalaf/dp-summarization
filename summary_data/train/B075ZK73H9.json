Since neodymium magnets are generally priced by volume I docked two stars for false advertising of the size which is effectively skimming profits on their part. Diameter: Advertised 1.26\", Actual 1.16\" Thickness Advertised 0.20\", Actual 0.18\" These delta's seem small but end up being a reduction in total volume of about 20% The seller could had advertised these as the size they actually are for the same price and I still would have bought them and I would have been 5 star satisfied with the purchase.",

This is different from the last set, that came in \"pairs\" or \"sets\" with opposing countersunk sides so you can \"mate\" them together on opposite surfaces.",
