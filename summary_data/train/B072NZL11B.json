The knob expands so it doesn\u2019t matter how wide. Slides in and out and locks it in securely. Can\u2019t wait to take it out! Built well and love the red accents to match the peak design accessories I have. Fits the peak design sling also!",

This is a good tripod if your subject is further away, but if you want to do portrait work and your subject is within 20 feet, it gets tricky. It depends on the lens and the distance from the subject. Using an 18-105 kit lens on an APS-c camera required me to use a table to get an eye level shot, otherwise, I had to point the camera slightly upwards which can change the composition. However, if you just want to take pictures and need a decent tripod and not too concerned about bending down, if over 5'8\" inches tall, this tripod is just fine.",
