But nevertheless, the amount of artistic options for my daughters to create new things using this box is amazing. This gift set is more on the serious side when gifting someone. It\u2019s more like a gift that a parent or grandparents can give children or even teens that will carry them forward for many years. I guess it can also serve very well for art classes for teachers. I am looking forward of using this set with my children for many years to come and joyfully cover the cost of this investment.",

I buy lots of craft items and they are VERY expensive. There\u2019s easily several hundred dollars worth of products in the box. My only complaint is that the box might break under the weight of the amount of crafting stuff in it and I wish they had included painting supplies although I don\u2019t know where they would fit as this box was packed full! I know I will be buying this again as gifts for grandkids and other crafting people in my life!",

Since we don\u2019t have an art studio yet, this comes in handy in keeping some of her things organized. I also like that the box is unfinished wood so we can make it our own. My daughter has already decorated it. I can\u2019t wait to see what other things this company has in store. Thanks!",
