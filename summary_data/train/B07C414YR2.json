Overall they were great, held up well, drained and dried quickly, and were fairly stylish :)",

Feet were a bit sore when I got back to the truck but that was 4+ miles of hiking in them which they are not designed for. On the river I had good traction and my feet did not get cut up walking through rocks in and out of the water. They do tend to collect sand but that's just a trade off for good drainage. They fit as expected because I expected them to run slightly big. I wear a 9 so I got an 8.5.",

There also is a crease line I noticed at the heal and the ball of the foot. It looks warped. Just putting them on you can tell it's cheap netting and plastic/rubberish sole. I highly do not recomend. You can tell it's a cheap knock off from China. For $35 dollars you can get better water shoes from Target or Walmart.",

Hiking: I don't use them much after they dry while on the hike since little peebles get stuck in the drain holes. But if I'm around town these have become my go to beech and errand shoe as well.

I consider these somewhat disposable though in the sense that they'd probably only last one more backpacking trip. In less aggressive environments, they would last longer.",

The very small river pebbles can & likely will end up inside of the shoe, which become uncomfortable. Great alternative to wading boots & much, much less expensive !!!!",
