Definitely recommend this professional hair product and the roots situation got taken care of. Thank you so much for offering this product to my family!",

I finally decided to perm it. The curls are a bit tighter than my original look, but I think they will fall a bit. Very easy to use, just smells awful. Didn\u2019t burn or fry my hair though I was deeply concerned it would. Definitely recommend! My advice: use a rod size smaller than you originally thought. You won\u2019t regret it.",
