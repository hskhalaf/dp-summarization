I am literally plowing through thousands of slides and images captured on sheet film. This tool outperforms any lightbox I've used in the past. The fact that it is about a half an inch thick and yet produces even light corner to corner makes it portable and it's surface is large enough to handle the task at hand. Looking forward to using it as a light source after I finish sorting my transparencies.",
