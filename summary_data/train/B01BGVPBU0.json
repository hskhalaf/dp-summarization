The side wine bottle holder is clipped in and can be removed, and is also secured to the side of the bag by a strip of velcro. It also fits a good sized water bottle and is insulated. The blanket is the perfect size with a water-proof bottom. The only negative I have about the bag is that the insulated part for the food is narrow and tall, so it can be harder to fit in tupperware of salads, etc without having to place them in sideways and having your food slide about. It fits a lot though, and would be perfect for a hike!",
