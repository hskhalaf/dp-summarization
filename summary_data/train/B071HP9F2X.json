Also incredible is the sound sensitivity (picks up softer/lower volume sounds easily) & capturing video in low light situations. I recorded many events on my trip to Central America in 720P and the video quality was amazing, as was the audio. Very easy to back up the contents on the camera. This unit is well built and very rugged. This unit has fantastic quality and performance at a great price!!! I cannot say enough good things about the MIUFLY 1296P HD Police Body Camera!!!",
