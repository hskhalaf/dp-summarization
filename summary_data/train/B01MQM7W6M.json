      "text": "Really cute swing overall. A few things make me question the quality control. The piece that is supposed to hold the power cord on the lower leg is backwards and therefore can't be used, and there's no way to turn it around. The feet don't sit flat on the floor which is really cause for concern, it also makes a metallic clicking noise while swinging because of it. I tried to adjust it but it goes right back. I'll probably return it due to poor quality when I can find the time to break it down and stuff it back in the box... Very cute but very disappointing. It was quick and easy to put together however.",

The cloth cover for the swing is soft and was easy to machine wash when my baby had a leaky poopy diaper. I like that we are able to rotate the swing so that it can swing either side to side or front to back. She's also started looking at the mobile and seems intrigued by the little animals. I wish it was a little lighter / easier to move around but it definitely seems safe and sturdy. So far no issues with the swing!",

Design is lame and primitive. (Cannot believe it cost more than $100.) 4. Very expensive considering all cons above",

The only con to this is that it's quite large and not easy to move around. You really have to have the space for it so toting it around from room to room isn't super feasible.",
