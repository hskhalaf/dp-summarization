This is the first bathing suit I have bought online and this is also the first bathing suit I have ever owned that made me feel sexy/cute wearing it. It has A LOT of padding in the bust, which normally isn't something I care for, but in this case it helps shapes my body to a more hour glass figure. I want to say the padding is almost a 1/4 inch thick. It is well fastened in, so the padding does not shift around. (I have had other bathing suits with padding that rolls/shifts around after the first swim).",

Overall its a nice suit, material and quality looks and feels good. The skirt covers my behind. This is comfortable enough that I will wear it to a water/adventure parks as an outfit without feeling under dressed and don't have to worry about my regular clothes getting wet.",

I'm sure if you are too flat or too big in the chest for your specific size, it might fit weird. I'm fairly small-chested and my size fit well everywhere. The bottoms cover up my butt too. The skirt part is well-flared, which I like. :)",

Great company to deal with, if your order is not fulfilled by Amazon: One of the sizes I ordered was not free returns but the company refunded me and told me to keep the suit to donate. I never even tried it on, since the largest size was too small. I guess I will keep it for if I ever lose weight again.",

If one is on the border between a 12 and a 14, the 14 will probably be more comfortable. This is a fun looking suit and definitely gives one good coverage. Modest, but still fun and good-looking.",

They are very comfortable especially for being on the heavier size. I have a tummy but skinny legs just like my mother. And these suits make you feel good in. Your fat don\u2019t show like in other bathing suits I\u2019ve tried. So pleased with with both these purchases.",

It has HUGE cups and no actual shelf bra under the boobs so it feels weird and doesn't give much support. The area under the boobs and stomach are very loose and flap around. Pity as I really liked the look of the rest of this dress. If it had support and a strap under the boobs I would keep it. Unfortunately I'm returning it.",

The skirt is a fair amount of fabric which floats around when you're in the water, but that's fine. The styling on the top allows for a little loose fabric at the bottom, which makes the belly less noticeable. The foam inserts on top were awkward and didn't offer enough support for my large chest, so I bought a racing-back bra to wear under it. The foam inserts were easily removed. It felt SO good wearing a bra and the cute suit, I felt confident and happy. I highly recommend this suit!",

Looks just like in the picture except I didn't have that much excess in the shirt length. Had I gone a size up, I think the bust might have been too big for me. I have large hips and small bust comparatively. Hope that helps!",
