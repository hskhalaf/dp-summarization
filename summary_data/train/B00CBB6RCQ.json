If I lost this mouse, I'd happily and promptly buy it again. But I really like it, so I keep track of it, because I don't want to lose it. Know what I mean?",

      "text": "This mouse works very well, especially for someone with mild arthritis.. the touch panel is a welcome change from the normal scroll wheel. In addition the mouse is much more rugged.. I've broken several scroll wheel cordless mice in my bag,, and since there are effectively no moving parts, it's much stronger. The only negative is the effect that the side rubberized panels have after some time has passed.. they look sort of dingy, as a side effect of the type of rubber used. There's no cure for that. Because this mouse was used, I used alcohol swabs to clean it off before using it.",

Its a decent smaller size good for folks looking for portability. The neutral shape means it's good for both right handed and left handed use (Yes, I mouse with either hand). I paired this with my Logitech K360 with no problem.",

I would buy this over a scroll wheel and will probably even buy another one for a different machine. The battery life really is amazing. Just that alone will save you enough money in batteries to make this pay you to take it.",

I couldn't get the mice to work properly due to dragging, \"freezing\", and being unable to direct the pointer correctly. So, I thought I would order this one, as it stated it would work with Windows 8. Yes, it does! It worked perfectly the first time I connected it, and it glides smoothly over the window contents and doesn't hesitate for a minute! Also, the feature of being able to access the \"desktop\" and \"Windows\" screen, with just a click, is fantastic! I highly recommend this product.",

I'm also not a fan of the flat space in place of the wheel and that may just be that I didn't give myself a chance to get used to it...my finger was always in the wrong place and I was uncoordinated scrolling with it.

It works but the top is difficult since it is very smooth on top and with no wheel you basically have a remote touch pad. If the center pad was raised or had a different feel than the outside area it would be 100% better. I would prefer a wheel in the center with real buttons on either side. Otherwise it is well built unit at a good price. Lots of luck finding another mouse that will work with Windows 8.",

Small form factor which doesn't take up much room and the dongle is small enough to leave in the USB port permanently. The main draw back is that the touch scroll pad in the middle is very sensitive and when using excel if you accidentally touch the strip the mouse scrolls down multiple pages. I switched off the sideways scrolling as while this was great for web browsing it made the excel use much worse. I will keep working on the settings to see if I can get to a point where I can make better use of the touch strip.",

I like being able to swipe side to side in the Windows 8 interface, and using Logitech's software you can map the buttons how you like and change the behavior of the mouse. I swapped the middle click and the back-of-the-middle click so that if I click the front of the middle button, it registers as a middle click, and if I click the back of it, it registers as a \"home screen\" button. Others may prefer the default, which is the opposite. The mouse is comfortable, and it looks very nice/professional. Definitely a quality product.",

      "text": "I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 8 on it and no touch screen, not realizing how touch-centric windows 8 is. When my wireless mouse failed, I started checking into replacements that were designed to work with Windows 8 and this one came with some of the better ratings. I found the installation to be quite easy and was up and running with a much better interface for the windows 8 environment than the previous mouse. The gestures feel natural and make use of the nuances of Windows 8. I did adjust the responsiveness to my liking. Very happy with this purchase.",
