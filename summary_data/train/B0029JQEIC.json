      "title": "Great pan for yeast breads",
      "text": "I get so many compliments for the loaves I make in this pan, due to the crisp, professional-looking edges. Perfect for handmade yeast bread - most \u201cloaf pans\u201d are meant for banana bread and will make a yeast loaf (using 500g flour) look flat and sad. The slightly smaller dimensions of this pan mean you get a nice round dome over the edges, like a cartoon image of bread! The bread pops out really easily, making it quick to check whether it\u2019s done. I\u2019ve used the pans several times now and have no complaints. They seem sturdy and I am confident I\u2019ll be using them for years to come.",

My only complaint, as I've seen others mention, is that it is hard to clean out the folded corners. I let it soak in warm water for a few hours and used the kitchen sprayer to try and blast out the stuck in crumbs, but it was impossible to get everything. I didn't want to scrub and ruin the silicon coating. It's not really a big deal, just a bit annoying. Pan great overall, though.",

All my bread bakes nice and even with no spots that are over browned. Sometimes I grease this pan and other times I don't. Each time the loaf slides right out with no problems. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. The pan is nice and heavy and is a very good quality. I look forward to buying more in the future.",
