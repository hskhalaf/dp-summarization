But if you lie down over gravel or rough/hard surfaces, you'd not feel a thing. I have bad hips and I'm large so I need alot of cushioning. This does the trick! Its not firm enough to use as a chair however, so I wish they'd not bother with the extra hinged pillow option.",

It's fine when it's being used as a chair, but as a mattress it gets caught on a cover or bedding. That said, it folds easily, is not difficult to move or carry, and the cleaning instructions for the cover are easy to follow. While it's for guests, my cats have stolen it.",

Some shelf liner on the bottom may help from the sliding. You could also use some Velcro to secure them together but the fabric will snag up from the Velcro pulling it. They are not that comfortable for an adult as a chair due to the proximity to the floor and the back not really being supportive. The other thing to think about is the Sheer Size. They are very large and difficult to haul.",

As it is, the couch shape is not very comfortable to sit on. It would make a good couch for kids but that's about it, and it is difficult to protect from my cat who loves to lie on there and cover it with filth so the protector would be nice. All in all, I'm very satisfied with this purchase compared with an inflatable mattress that would likely suffer a fatal wound at the hands of the cat.",

      "text": "The mattress is fine, comfortable and easily adjustable. Seller should tell in the posting that the foams can float. It surprised me when I got it as it was rolled in a box with 1x1-sqr-ft top. At first, I thought I was tricked by the seller or the foams were missing. I almost requested to return it. Later, after unpacked it, i saw instructions in the package and i unzipped the cover and left the foams out of its cover for 2 days. The foam expanded as shown in the posting.",

I had also hoped to use it occasionally myself as an outdoor mattress, but, the material is very coarse and not at all good against the skin. I still consider this to be a great purchase though.",

It\u2019s very comfortable as a sofa which was a relief considering the back support being shaped a bit oddly. As a mattress it feels a tiny bit thin but as someone who likes hard beds that is no problem. I\u2019m overall pretty happy with it. I wish there were bedsheets that could fit well over the mattress, but oh well. It will have to do with bunched up sheets under the mattress.",
