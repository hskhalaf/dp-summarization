My parents bought one as a gift when I went back in the classroom in 2016, bought a used off Amazon in 2017, and bought again new in box from Amazon in February of 2018. All three are no longer working. I cannot figure out what is happening, but having 3 sharpeners with almost $100 invested and none working is a bit extreme. I have smaller classes, so it cannot be an overuse issue. I have tried blowing out the wheels/blades and still cannot get it to work. Any advice?",

      "text": "This pencil sharpener was brand-new when we received it, but acts like it is already dull. The wood on the pencil comes out looking as if an angry beaver has chewed on it. Workers, it\u2019s almost impossible to get the point centered on the pencil, always chewing off more from one side. Maybe this is a side effect of trying to have one sharpener for many sizes of pencil. I have tried applying less pressure, but that will just cause the lead to break. The blue LED is just a useless gimmick, because the pencils are already sharp before the LED turns on. The pencils in the photos were new, never sharpened before. Overall, I\u2019m very disappointed.",

When she opened the box it was noted that the wheel that is used for selecting the size of the pencil to be sharpened was not attached. I tried to reattach the wheel abs could not determine how to do it so that it would stay attached. Unfortunately the sharpener is now beyond the return window. Needless to say, she is not happy with this product and yes, the item should have been inspected when received so we are to blame for not being able to return it.",

The sharpener works quickly to get your pencil super sharp. It also shuts off when it senses your pencil is sharp enough. According to her it's a lifesaver for her 6th grade class of 30. Shes had the first one for a few years now so we know its durable too. It is a little loud for my liking but the fact it takes only a couple of seconds to fully sharpen a pencil makes it worth it.",

For an adult, it can be a little bit annoying, but it functions well and sharpens nicely. Overall, I think it was a good buy. We will have to see how long it lasts. My previous Boston pencil sharpener lasted over 15 years and I was impressed. It is no longer in production, so I'm giving the X-ACTO a shot at the title for longest lasting.

It worked flawlessly for one year. Unfortunate, the \"SmartStop\" function is always on when sharpening pencils rendering the sharpener useless. I would recommend this but for only one years use for ~50 dollars, there are much better sharpeners you can buy for less. I would try and send it in for warranty, but we as teachers all know that waiting isn't the best option when 28 10 year olds need to sharpen their pencils. Going out to buy a new sharpener today, it won't be an X-ACTO though.",

It was fast, and created very sharp points without grinding too much of the pencil. The light was also very useful for letting students know when the sharpening was done. We tried several other sharpeners for the library, but they couldn't take the strain and broke after a few months.

      "text": "I purchased this sharpener last October. The classroom sharpeners are really crappy and do not sharpen pencils adequately. I loved this sharpener and I have not let my students use it at all. Unfortunately, it seems that the sensor has malfunctioned and shuts off before the pencil is sharpened. I am not really sure whom to call for support. I have tried to contact X-Acto twice but not heard a thing. It was a great sharpener while it lasted but certainly did not last as long as it advertised.",

      "text": "I bought this costly sharpener for my son's in home use. It didnt work well from minute one but I just thought we had to get used to it. Well, no matter what size pencil you put in, the led light never lights up and it will just keep sharpening until you pull the pencil out. On day three the sharpener stopped working altogether. My daughter bought a $20 sharpener that works great. Do not, repeat, do not waste your money on this large sized poorly constructed item!",

It hold more pencil waste then most electric sharpener. It also has a light indicator to show pencil is finish sharping. 6 available size sharpener. 10 year warranty. Cons: Waste bin is not easy to open. The indent part of the waste bin is smooth and has no pull latch.However it not that bad from preventing little five year old touchy finger from opening it. Conclusion: So far a great sharpener in class and home.",
