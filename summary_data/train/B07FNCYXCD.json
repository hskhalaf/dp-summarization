The seams are well sewn so I don't worry about them ripping easily like other affordable duvet covers and the zipper is small and inconspicuous while still being good quality.

      "text": "We loved this teal color and how the fabric had a wrinkled effect. We decided to purchase the matching sheets set to go with but beware the color of the sheets although same name of color were a different color of the duvet. A slight difference but noticeable. The duvet is so soft and has ties on the inside of each corner to tie your insert to. It zips shut. It\u2019s made of a soft wrinkly cotton material that is cozy.",

The fabric is very thin, so you can see the stamps on the pillow it's on, now I need to purchase additional white pillow cases. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. However, I don't like all the little wrinkles. I washed it and dried it before use and it was incredibly wrinkly even after high heat dry. It's a good for the price so I can't complain.",

I have very sensitive skin and the pillowcases do bother my skin a bit but I think one or two more washes will break that- they feel very soft to the touch, so I know it's just my skin having a cow. Something to note- the color is a little off. I ordered the off-white color to match my sheets and they're definitely more yellow than cream. They don't look bad though, they just don't match.",

If I had ordered or exchanged for a King duvet cover it might have worked out, but since the color I wanted is so far off I\u2019m just returning for refund.
