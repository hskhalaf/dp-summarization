The pockets are also the same fabric as the dress, so any weight in them will definitely change the silhouette - and not for the better.",

Just a little shy of hitting my feet in length (I'm 5'8\"). If you're wondering what size to buy, I'd recommend going with the bust measurement, just because that seems to be where the dress is the most tight. Everywhere else it's pretty loose.
