I have a mild case of rosacea and have to be careful with what I use on my skin. I am very impressed with this product and am very glad I ordered it as a subscription. After the first use, my skin was smoother and the redness on my cheeks and forehead was markedly decrease. I\u2019m very, very satisfied and will be recommending them to friends and family.",

This particular sponge in Julep' s line helps to thoroughly clear out pores and, in turn, reduce the perceived size of them in addition to having antimicrobial properties, making it great for acne. As someone who has enlarged pores from makeup usage and acne prone skin, I've seen massive improvement in the quality of my skin, which is now smoother and softer. I would highly recommend this product if you have any of the following: -Large pores -Sensitive skin -Heavy product buildup -Acne prone skin",
