It does take a long time (about 8 hrs. plus) to charge the battery. The indicator LED on the charger goes from red to green when it is fully charged. You can notice when it needs charging as the brilliance power of the light drops off slowly. Thus its a good idea to keep 3 AAA batteries in the backup holder ( it works great as well).

I have gone through three of these lights in two years. They are breaking pretty quickly nowadays. And that is without even dropping them or them being old. In the end, it's probably better to drop a few more bucks if you really will depend on the flashlight like we do.",

The picture I took is with a \"more powerfull\" flashlight, that runs $85, but as you can see, look for the little square, that is the beam tightened up on this one, overpowering the more expensive flashlight. This one has a good battery charger Comfortable to use in the hand, the beam expands and contracts easily. High quality battery charger.

It takes a while for it to charge. So if you're in a hurry, get another light! Everything like the carry case, charger, and the flash light, seem well made. And I would for sure buy another if I needed one. I don't see where you can go wrong with this light. I could care less about all the functions it has. A bright flash light was what I wanted, and got.",

One had a little less juice than the other, but I installed both batteries, turned the flashlights on, and let them drain the batteries. It took almost a full 24 hours to drain completely, but I'd say they would have been unusable after maybe 12-14 hours of being on. I'll update if this change, but for now, I recommend.",
