This scam monitor lacks HDCP copyright protection required to stream 4K entertainment. I paid for UHD Netflix and this monitor and was underwhelmed by the quality, only to find out it's impossible to watch UHD content on this via either displayport or HDMI. There is no way Samsung didn't know about this, and they're ripping off many people who wouldn't know the difference between 1080p and 4K. I'm returning it, avoid! Find one that supports HDCP 2.2",

Aside from that, the picture quality is excellent, the monitor has built in upscaling which is good for me as my PC struggles with native 4k at times and is great for all who have 1080p devices that could stand to benefit from the upscaling.",
