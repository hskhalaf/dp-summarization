Thought I was buying top of the line for my needs and it should have lasted more than 3 years. My biggest complaint is not being able to contact Arris. Since it's discontinued, I can't even ask a question. No more Arris products for me.",

I purchased this unit to avoid paying Comcast modem rental every month so it will pay for itself in a little over a year. Xfinity Internet screams on this unit.

It looks like I could setup a 10. network if I wanted for example but I left it on the 192. Only caveats are you that this is a larger unit than most and not (in my opinion) wall-mountable.",
