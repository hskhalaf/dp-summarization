The only thing (that all Sanders tend to have an issue with) is the dust catcher. It detaches easily, so easily that it tends to fall off, and the power cord is rather short. But the sander itself does the job flawlessly. I did have to let it sit every now and then after extensive use just because it started to get really warm; but I did not have any issues with it. I definitely recommend this. Pros: Quick Efficient Cons: Loose Dust catcher Short power cord",

Vibration is minimal and discs stay on the sander longer than any other sander I've owned. Some reviewers complained that the dust bag did a poor job of collecting sawdust. I disagree. When the bag is properly connected to the sander, it does a very respectable job. Of course more sawdust would be collected if the sander was connected to a dust collector or shop vac. I would recommend this sander to anyone looking for a quality finishing sander.",

My solution is to use spray glue but it's a hassle. DeWalt used to be a good company. I'm going back to Porter Cable for a better orbital sander.",
