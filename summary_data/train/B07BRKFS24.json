We can download the camera manufacturer's app to stream the video, but we'll no longer have any of the features we purchased this product to get.

My husband and I can both watch our babe on each of our phones and my husband even gets to talk to baby in the crib from work! I did have an issue with the camera and the support team emailed and texted me within 10 minutes. Issue was completely resolved within a day. Absolutely recommend the Cocoon Cam and will use this for the next baby!!",
