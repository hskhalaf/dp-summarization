The auto lock feature takes too long to trigger so I have to lock the door with my phone each time.

I gave up and uninstalled it after many guests were locked out of my house. I would recommend a keypad type lock or just a lockbox instead, which both are much more affordable and reliable options.",

I do have to point out that I ended up buying a Yale touchscreen deadbolt that is working fabulously well, with just a small quirk with the Wink hub for remote unlock but im happy to live with that as the ease of use of the lock it is much much more satisfying.",
