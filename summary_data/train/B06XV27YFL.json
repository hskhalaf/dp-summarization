They have more fun with these masks. You'll be better off with a model that the head band is not attached to the face seal. When water leaks into the mask, it's natural to tighten the band around the head. If that band is attached to the face seal, the face seal quickly get pulled out of the hard plastic part of the mask and once that happens the mask is ruined.",

The best way to beat the fogging issues that all masks have is to get some plain colgate toothpaste, rub it on the inside of the lens, let it sit for awhile, then rinse it off. This removes the film that comes inside all dive masks and keeps it from fogging. I do this to all of my masks and have never had a problem. My son \"borrowed\" this mask from me for one of his dives and likes it so much that he continues to \"borrow\" it.",
