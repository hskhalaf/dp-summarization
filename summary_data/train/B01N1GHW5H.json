Again it\u2019s a great product but it won\u2019t last half as long as you would expect it to so you\u2019re basically getting less than half what you paid for!",

This device allowed me to go a few days without prickly shadow. What it did not do: it did not kill my hair. I'm going back to my epilating tweezers. At least the roots are ripped out over time.",

One Draw back I found out myself when using the Gilette is that It was creating me spots all over my legs. I personally was never into shaving but nowadays I started going GYM and it helped my confidence. so It was a nice purchase for me after all.",

I saw a slight reduction in hair while using it, however after skipping 2 weeks I feel there is no longer any reduction of hair. This is more time consuming than shaving and doesn't last much longer than a shave. Unfortunately the return timeframe they allow is just a few weeks after purchase, leaving you no time to actually see if it works. Not worth the expensive price. I wish I could return it since I got no results.",

    "title": "Braun Gillette Venus Silk-Expert IPL 5001 Intense Pulsed Light, 300,000 Flashes, Face & Body Hair Removal System with Razor",
    "description": "Venus Silk expert is a ground-breaking IPL system, which results in permanent hair reduction in as little as four treatments. It works beneath the skin's surface by targeting the melanin in the hair follicle, helping to break the cycle of hair regrowth. With continued, regular use, it helps prevent unwanted hair from reaching the skin surface. Skin tone varies across different parts of the body, with each tone requiring a specific energy level to target the melanin. Only Venus Silk-expert has the unique SensoAdapt skin tone sensor that continuously reads your skin tone 80x per second and automatically adapts the light intensity for best efficacy and safety. This removes the guesswork of having to match your skin tone against the complicated color matching charts other devices require. Power source 110 to 240v Mains ( It comes officially with a 220V UK EU cable. Local plug is provided inside the box as extra. Machine itself is 110 to 240v can be used anywhere in the world ). This model is same as Braun Silk expert 5 IPL BD 5006 but it has Gillette Venus razor only. Braun BD 5006 has pouch too.",
