The way they were made, I highly doubt they'd be strong enough to survive a few years in the weather. Unfortunately, we will not be ordering again.",

I had to screw in the bottom portion because it wasn't flush screwing down with the mounting hardware provided at the top.",

      "ECO FRIENDLY WAY FOR YOUR GARDEN TO FLOURISH: Nasty chemicals have no place in your garden oasis. Instead, help the friendly bat population survive. Many bat species eat vast amounts of insects, including some of the most damaging agricultural pests. Mosquitoes are a particular favorite among bats, some of which are said to eat up to 1,200 mosquitoes in one hour! That alone should be reason enough to put a bat house in your backyard.",
      "CUTIES NOT SPOOKY: Most bats have very cute faces, some even resemble deer, rabbits, and little Chihuahuas! These cuties help your flora flourish naturally by pollinating plants and taking care of nasty bugs during their nocturnal routine.",
      "POLLINATION STATION: These nocturnal creatures become active when the sun goes down, and work magic in your garden during the night. They go after the nectar and bugs, spreading pollen as they fly. Many bat species eat vast amounts of insects, including some of the most damaging agricultural pests.",
      "BEAUTIFUL IN ANY OASIS: Crafted from humidity controlled natural wood. The rustic look and unique bat shape cut-out make this the perfect addition whether your taste is modern, rustic, farmhouse or industrial! And, as most bats can see just as well as humans, they can appreciate this beautiful item too!",
