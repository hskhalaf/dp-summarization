I don't like how there's no adjustable base wedge like my safety first carseat (amazing btw) it just kinda floats where you install it with a big gap under it. Yes I read the instructions. Yes I even watched videos on how to. And I even asked my stepdad who's a fireman to help me install it. He said he's never installed a carseat quite as difficult as this one. I'm not quite sure the cheap price is worth the risk of safety. WONDERING if it's installed tight enough.",

You are probably going to have to buy a new carseat when you realize this so save a few dollars and just get a better one!",
