    "description": "Here is the Brooks model for walking. Brooks Caldera for men. Maximum cushioning has been added to the design of this model. Brooks Caldera guarantee an optimal cushioned and flexible shoe, offering an optimum energetic and stable bounce, just what you need for running on unstable terrain and trails. This model is equipped with many surprises, such as its fitted leggings on the back. With regard to its cushioned sole, there are two differences in its construction: a first layer made by DNA, which adapts to every part of the step, and a second layer which aims to protect and provide stability in every footstep. Lastly, it has a protective mesh top, which provides flexibility with a soft and seamless feel. Despite this increased height, which you can see at a glance on the front, the shoe has a drop of 4 mm so it offers good stability on all types of terrain. It should be noted that thanks to its thickness in the front, the Brooks Caldera is a shoe suitable for use in long distances. Another characteristic is its wider tongue, which prevents the entry of loose material into the inside of the shoe and they have a special section for storing the laces to avoid getting entangled in any shrubs or branches. Weight: 280g.",
