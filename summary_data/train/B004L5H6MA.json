At which time when my client put their head down the headrest dropped giving quite a shock to both me and the client on the table",

The adjustable head tilt face rest worked excellently without the usual problems getting it to stay in place. The case fits snuggly, and once you figure out the toting procedures for it, its nice. The padding was comfortable to all my clients and all my flannel sheets fit it well. Excellent table!",

Only 2 negative comments- 1.Table is too heavy 2. It came with a carrying case (useless) it's uncomfortable, awkward and made a bruise on my shoulder, your better off throwing it away.",
