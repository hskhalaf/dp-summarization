The size is also nice, not to heavy to carry around all day and fit nicely in my crossbody purse. Overall I am very happy with it.",

Battery is aftermarket but keeps charge well. Charger Canon, it does bothers me the full charge light constantly on, when plugged in, regardless if it has a battery in or not. It is it's design, newer charger I have doesn't do that. If I could have any wish with it, would be a camera strap for sure. I had to make one in the hurry, where we live, no store carries straps or camera accessories in2 hr drive distance (one way). Overall very happy with the photos.",

With its APS-C sensor and 18 megapixel resolution, it is adequate for most ordinary shooting situations. It appealed to me because my kit is all Canon, and my current lens fit on it. Coupled with my 40mm pancake lens (one of these days I'll get a wider lens), it has become my walking around camera when I don't want to lug my 5D around. Some people have complained that its small size makes it somewhat awkward to use, but I haven't found that to be a problem.",

It would have been simply outstanding if articulating screen and WiFi feature were also present (no regrets on the good quality of touch screen tough IMO).

The only two faults I have with it is that the screen doesn't articulate and the Fstop and shutter are set using the same dial meaning that you can't really control both while looking through the viewfinder.

This camera takes very good quality photos with the kit lens for an amazing price. I am very happy with the purchase and it has been getting a lot of use. It is user friendly on it's own, but beginners can also benefit from books and/or YouTube videos to help learn all the different features. There are several different shooting modes which is nice when you don't want to mess around with the settings yourself, but you are also able to adjust everything manually if you choose.",

    "title": "Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Body Only| Configuration:Base \n\nIGNITE YOUR IMAGINATION\nAs the world's smallest and lightest digital SLR*, the new EOS Rebel SL1 is small in size but enormous in performance. With a newly-designed Canon 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and speedy Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor, it delivers images of extraordinary quality \u2013 ideal for those stepping up from a smartphone or compact camera. An impressive ISO range of 100\u201312800 (expandable to H: 25600) for stills and 100\u20136400 (expandable to H: 12800) for video plus up to 4.0 fps continuous shooting make this camera the go-to for any photo opportunity, even in dim lighting or when capturing fast action subjects. And Hybrid CMOS AF II delivers accurate AF tracking during Live View shooting, helping ensure your photos and movies are crisp and clear. The EOS Rebel SL1 makes amazing movies with Canon EOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF, working in concert with Canon STM lenses for smooth and quiet continuous AF. In addition to its Optical Viewfinder, the EOS Rebel SL1 has a bright, wide Touch Screen 3.0\" Clear View LCD monitor II, perfect for viewing a number of special scene modes and Creative Filters available in real-time display. Here is the DSLR you'll want to bring with you everyday and ignite your imagination!\n\n* Among digital SLR cameras that use APS-C size equivalent sensors. As of March 1, 2013, based on Canon's research.\n\nAMAZING CAPTURE AND PROCESSING POWER, ASTONISHINGLY COMPACT.\nWORLD'S SMALLEST AND LIGHTEST DIGITAL SLR*\nFor ultra portability with a minimal footprint, the EOS Rebel SL1 is the world's smallest and lightest digital SLR*. Weighing in at approximately 13 ounces, the EOS Rebel SL1's astonishingly compact size does not compromise its excellent performance as a member of the Canon EOS family: it features an 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor, the speedy DIGIC 5 Image Processor, a wide ISO range for both stills and video, and advanced AF performance. Designed for entry-level DSLR users, the EOS Rebel SL1 ensures performance and operation while still remaining compact.\n\n18.0 MEGAPIXEL CMOS (APS-C) SENSOR\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 features a newly-developed Canon 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor in the world's smallest and lightest digital SLR*.

This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).\n\nISO 100\u201312800 (EXPANDABLE TO H: 25600) FOR STILLS; ISO 100\u20136400 (EXPANDABLE TO H: 12800) FOR VIDEOS\nThanks to its DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel SL1 features an ISO range of ISO 100\u201312800 (expandable to H: 25600) for stills and ISO 100\u20136400 (expandable to H: 12800) for videos that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. The EOS Rebel SL1, with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor's remarkable noise-reduction technology, performs brilliantly in low-light shooting. Used with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer, the EOS Rebel SL1 can record beautiful images and video even when light sources are scarce.\n\nDIGIC 5 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe EOS Rebel SL1's DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera's CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel SL1 can achieve higher ISO sensitivity, can shoot up to 4.0 fps continuously and can even perform advanced functions like displaying art filters in real time, new scene modes, lens correction and much more. The camera's brilliant imaging core supercharges every facet of still and moving image capture.\n\n* Among digital SLR cameras that use APS-C size equivalent sensors. As of March 1, 2013, based on Canon's research.\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT!\nHIGH-SPEED CONTINUOUS SHOOTING\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 can shoot up to 4.0 frames per second (fps) for up to approximately 7 consecutive RAW files or approximately 28 full-resolution JPEGs. Shooting at speeds of up to 1/4000 sec., the EOS Rebel SL1 can capture even rapidly unfolding scenes with ease.\n\nTRUE HD PERFORMANCE, REBEL SIMPLICITY.\nEOS FULL HD MOVIE MODE WITH MOVIE SERVO AF\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 offers easy-to-use, professional video capture without compromise. Capable of shooting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates, the EOS Rebel SL1 offers outstanding video capturing performance, quality and simplicity. The EOS Rebel SL1 enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. When shooting video with one of Canon's STM lenses, Movie Servo AF takes advantage of the lens' stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF. With an STM lens attached, the EOS Rebel SL1 meets high standards for SLR moviemaking performance!\n\n \n\nResolution & Recording Sizes Frame Rates Full HD\n1920 x 1080\n16:9 format 30 fps (29.97) 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard 24 fps (23.976) HD\n1280 x 720\n16:9 format 60 fps (59.94) 50 fps \u2013 PAL standard Standard Definition (SD)\n640 x 480 30 fps (29.97) 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard \n\nBUILT-IN MONAURAL MICROPHONE, MANUAL AUDIO LEVEL ADJUSTMENT\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 has an internal monaural microphone for audio capture and a wind filter feature to reduce wind noise when shooting outdoors. Sound recording levels can be manually (up to 64 different levels) or automatically controlled. A built-in attenuator is also provided to reduce audio clipping. For more advanced audio recording, the EOS Rebel SL1 is compatible with many third-party electret condenser microphones with a 3.5mm diameter plug.\n\nVIDEO SNAPSHOT\nWith the Video Snapshot feature, the EOS Rebel SL1 can capture short video clips (of 2, 4 or 8 seconds) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights \"album\". With no editing needed after shooting, the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera's HDMI port. Additionally, stills can be recorded during video shooting simply by pressing the camera's shutter button. During playback, video clips in an album can be reordered or deleted.\n\nMULTI-TOUCH, BRILLIANT VIEW.\nTOUCH SCREEN WIDE 3.0-INCH CLEAR VIEW LCD MONITOR II WITH MULTI-TOUCH OPERATION AND TOUCH AF\nUsing capacitive touch screen technology similar to today's popular mobile devices, the EOS Rebel SL1's gorgeous LCD monitor is touch-sensitive, delivering intuitive operation with ease. Two-finger touch gestures can be used for zooming or changing images. Menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip using Touch AF. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), the camera's Touch Screen Wide 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a new, solid construction between the monitor's resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD's surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and to maintain a bright, clear image display.\n\nOPTICAL VIEWFINDER WITH APPROX. 0.87X MAGNIFICATION\nIn addition to its amazing multi-touch screen, the EOS Rebel SL1 also sports an Optical Viewfinder, ideal for composing shots when shooting in bright conditions or capturing the moment as it unfolds. Shooting with the Optical Viewfinder also ensures steadier images. The viewfinder displays exposure, AF, flash, plus other relevant image information right along with the image. The 0.87x magnification factor ensures that subjects are easier to find and track.\n\nINNOVATIVE AF SOLUTIONS FOR CONSISTENTLY EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE.\n9-POINT AF SYSTEM (INCLUDING A HIGH-PRECISION DUAL-CROSS F/2.8 CENTER POINT)\nWhen shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel SL1 has exceptional autofocus with a sophisticated 9-point AF system, including a high-precision dual-cross f/2.8 center point, for accurate focus whether the camera is oriented in portrait or landscape position. A proven AI Servo AF system achieves and maintains consistent focus with an exceptional degree of reliability.\n\nHYBRID CMOS AF II\nCanon's amazing Hybrid CMOS AF System is perfect for shooting photos and video in Live View. Combining two different kinds of AF \u2013 phase and contrast detection \u2013 and aided by pixels on the camera's CMOS sensor that assist in predicting subject location, continuous focus tracking becomes faster and more accurate than ever before in Live View. And with the EOS Rebel SL1 you'll get Hybrid CMOS AF II, which provides the same fantastic performance as the original but boasts an increased AF area that covers approximately 80% of the sensor for easier composition. This performance is enhanced further by Canon's line of STM lenses, which provide smooth and quiet operation.\n\nCOMPLEX FUNCTIONS MADE SIMPLE.\nSCENE INTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 features Scene Intelligent Auto mode, which incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation. Users without extensive photography knowledge or experience will not need to puzzle over settings; the Scene Intelligent Auto mode simplifies DSLR image capture so photographers can simply concentrate on composing images.\n\nCREATIVE FEATURES, AMAZING IMAGES.\nADVANCED CREATIVE FILTERS THAT CAN BE DISPLAYED IN REAL TIME DURING LIVE VIEW SHOOTING\nAdding to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS Rebel SL1, the camera offers seven different creative filters for still images: Art Bold Effect, Water Painting Effect, Miniature Effect, Fisheye Effect, Grainy B/W, Soft Focus and Toy Camera Effect. Each effect can be applied in three different levels (low, standard and strong), and easily previewed on the LCD panel during Live View shooting. The EOS Rebel SL1 also features the new Miniature Effect for Movies. You will be amazed and delighted by the artistry that these creative filters will allow you to create.\n\nEFFECT SHOT MODE AND BACKGROUND SIMULATION\nAmong the dynamic new features designed to make creative photography both intuitive and fun, the EOS Rebel SL1 has Background Simulation, which makes it easy for beginners to achieve dramatic blurred or sharpened backgrounds. The result is previewed on the LCD screen, so users can see in advance how their final image will look. Plus, a new Effect Shot feature automatically captures two shots simultaneously: one without effect, and one with a preselected Picture Style or Creative Filter effect. This makes it easy to see how each effect changes the photo without compromising the original image. Effect Shot mode is available in both Live View and viewfinder-based shooting, and can easily be viewed immediately in playback mode.\n\nTHE RIGHT MODE FOR THE RIGHT SITUATION.\nNEW SPECIAL SCENE MODES: KIDS, FOOD AND CANDLELIGHT\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 has three new easily accessible scene modes to capture the perfect image the first time. Kids mode ensures high-speed shutter priority, focus tracking, healthy skin tones and flash when needed; Food mode delivers bright, vivid food images, limits flash by default and limits the red tint often associated with \"restaurant plate\" photography. With Candlelight mode, the camera will take care not to blow out the scene, maintaining the glow of the candle, leaving the flash off and reducing exposure fluctuation.\n\nFLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE RECORDING.\nCOMPATIBILITY WITH SD/SDHC/SDXC MEMORY CARDS, INCLUDING ULTRA HIGH SPEED CARDS\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC, and is even compatible with Ultra High Speed (UHS-I), memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the camera's compact design.\n\nAdditionally, the EOS Rebel SL1 is compatible with Eye-Fi* SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi\u00ae transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel SL1 can display the Eye-Fi's connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.\n\n* Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada; please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF OPTICS PERFECT FOR VIDEO AND STILLS.\nCOMPATIBLE WITH EF AND EF-S LENSES\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses and including the STM series, like the new EF-S 18\u201355mm f/3.5\u20135.6 IS STM, optimized for video shooting. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer help to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light; STM lenses even feature a stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous autofocus while capturing video. With an array of lenses perfect for travel, sports, still life and everything in between, photographers can truly maximize the quality and performance of their EOS Rebel SL1.\n\nMORE FEATURES FOR INCREASED VERSATILITY.\nLENS ABERRATION CORRECTION\nThe EOS Rebel SL1 features lens correction tools that compensate for lens characteristics that can affect overall image quality. The EOS Rebel SL1's lens peripheral illumination correction feature corrects light falloff in the corner of the image according to the characteristics of the lens being used. It even has correction data for a number of popular lenses stored in its memory. With the EOS Rebel SL1's chromatic aberration correction tool, distracting color fringing can be corrected at the time of shooting.\n\nFEATURE GUIDE\nTo help explain the specific function of features found on the EOS Rebel SL1, the Feature Guide displays a simple description helpful in determining the applicability for the situation at hand. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions. It appears automatically when a function is selected \u2013 a lifesaver when trying to determine the best mode or function for the next picture. The feature guide works automatically by default, and can be disabled easily through the camera's menu.\n\nGPS COMPATIBLE\nWith the optional GPS Receiver GP-E2 attached to the hot shoe or the digital terminal, the EOS Rebel SL1 can record location, including latitude, longitude and altitude, and has the ability to track the trajectory of movement with its logging function. An electric compass records the camera's orientation during each shot, and world time information is recorded through GPS syncing.\n\nJPEG RESIZING\nTo create images suitable for sharing by email or online, the EOS Rebel SL1 can resize JPEG files, in-camera, of varying pixels (aspect ratio cannot be changed, only the image size can be decreased) while leaving the original image untouched.\n\nPHOTOBOOK SET-UP\nPhotographers can share their images in book form with the EOS Rebel SL1's convenient Photobook Set-up feature. Users can easily choose specific images, images in a folder and even all images, then specify their sequence and layout. The results can be printed in book form with ease.\n\nIMAGE RATING\nTo help organize images recorded to the camera's storage, the EOS Rebel SL1 makes it simple to rate individual images from one star to five. Therefore, image browsing, printing and slide shows can be based upon those ratings.\n\nCROPPING\nEliminating the need to post-process in the computer, photographers can easily crop their photos right in the EOS Rebel SL1. Perfect for direct connection to a printer, or in situations when it wasn't possible to zoom in enough with a zoom lens, cropping is a viable solution thanks to the camera's excellent 18.0-megapixel resolution. Users can choose vertical or horizontal images, and 3:2, 4:3, 16:9, even 1:1 aspect ratios.",
