      "text": "This vest is amazing! Just as good as a brand name but a fraction of the cost. The collar comes up around the back of the neck and does a great job keeping you warm in cool weather. The front inside and outside pockets are conveniently located and the outside pockets are zippered for added security. The vest isn't bulky and so far no issues with losing the down feathers. One thing to note is these run large. I originally ordered an XL but had to return it for a large. I am 6'3\" 250 and wear a 38\" waist pants. I would advise ordering a size down unless you like your clothes super baggy.",

      "text": "My husband loves this vest. I bought the hooded long sleeve version for women and love mine. My only request is for Amazon to source better shell fabric, because eventually, with regular wear and washing, the down feathers start coming through the fabric. And YES! I'd pay $5 more for both items if Amazon upgraded the fabric!",

      "text": "I bought a black version of the vest in Feb 2018, I love it, I went back to purchase another one, but a few things have changed. They only make small and large, no more XL, M, etc. why? I bought XL and it fits perfectly. Also, I loved the black, why doesn't it exist anymore? Amazon now seems to focus on the puffer vest with nylon filling (which is similar to northface, patagonia etc. the national brands rarely have down. That vest still has all the sizes and colors but the down vest no longer exists as it used to. Too bad!!",

      "text": "The Mrs and I have been wearing these for a year now - good product but the mens runs large. Even with a thick hoodie underneath it is just a tab bit too large. The quality appears good - minor issues with zipper sticking or snagging detract from a higher score. One time the zipper stuck with the outer shell and took me 30 minutes to work out gently trying not tear the it. For reference only I have a Eddie Bauer down vest that I have not had any issues with. The Mrs vest fits more accurately but same zipper issues.",

Pros: cost, packs down small, repuffs with short shaking, fit is comfortable, arm holes allow for movement with little heat loss, deep pockets. Cons: no waist drawstring, no tall sizes, zipper pulls small if wearing gloves. Would recommend and would buy again.",

He typically likes name brands but I couldn't bring myself to buy this same vest for more than double the amount just to have a name brand on the outside. Turns out he loves it! It is thin like the name brand ones but keeps him so warm. Everytime he wears it, he says how much he likes it. The only negative is that little feathers stick to his shirts from the inside of the vest.",

I have not noticed any stray threads and the zipper seams to be of high quality. I love the outer pockets and inside pockets, they are nice and deep. I have not washed them yet so I can't say how they will hold up afterwards.",
