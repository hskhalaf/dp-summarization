This is because it has a ribbing structure which is not on the 6 and for that reason, it makes the shoe taut and hence the squeeze. Try one size up. the blistering phenomenon disappeared after bedding in. Its a very smart shoe. I have under 100km on Prophecy 6, however i naturally prefer the 7. Its awesome. The high visibility safety features are so advanced that there is nothing like them on the market. They glow in low light in a very cool way. awesome for that feature.",

So if you like to sit around for 30 min after every run picking tiny rocks out of your shoes, this is the shoe for you! Luckily, I was about to buy new crosstrainer/knockaround shoes anyway, so, instead of returning them, these will become my most expensive casual shoes ever!
