Also, you don\u2019t have to turn the sound all the way up to hear it loud and clear. My only word of caution is if it comes in a bigger size, if you have a fro like me, get the biggest available size or get your hair braided, lol. The pic is of my teenage son wearing them. Fits an average head circumference perfectly. I love these and for that price I might buy a few more.",

He\u2019s 6\u2019 and not a huge guy but this was definitely made for a slim framed individual other than that it\u2019s unique and worth the price. I wouldn\u2019t recommend for anyone who wear a size Large or above.",
