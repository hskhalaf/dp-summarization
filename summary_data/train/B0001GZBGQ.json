If she puts it in the refrigerator, it is too cold. This little wine cooler solves the problem. You can leave wine out at room temperature and, 5 minutes before you want a glass, put the bottle in the wine cooler. The wine is now at a perfect temperature. When you are done, you twist the bottom, remove the liner, put it in the freezer and let it cool down again. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product wholeheartedly.",

Not only will it bring down the temperature of red wine from room temp to proper serving temperature, but I've found that it actually brings down the temperature of pre-chilled whites to almost freezing! There's sometimes ice crystals on the outside of the bottle. I ended up buying two of these for times when I entertain guests. Can't recommend this highly enough.",

As cold as the wine is it will remain at the same constant temperature during an entire meal. So far it has passed the one hour test. The only minor difficulty in in removing the bottle from the cooling container. the chilling panel hugs the bottle so tighly it is a little difficult removing it. But it is probably because of this design that it is so effective in keeping the bottle of wine so cold. It is ideal for white wines.",

There is no ice/water dripping all over the place. The insert (very compact) stays in the freezer until needed. It is very easy to insert into the cooler. We love it !!!! Another advantage is that if your white wine is not cold enough, just put it into this wine cooler and within 5 minutes it is just right for drinking. We can't say enough about this item. Highly recommended!!!!",

Although it will accept the wider wine bottles, it's impossible to slide them out of the cooler, which means you need to pour the wine with the cooler attached. Does look good on the table.",

It holds a reusable Rapid Ice cooling element that can chill a bottle within 5 minutes and keep it cool for hours. Simply place the Prestige wine cooler in the freezer, take it out, and insert your wine bottle for quick chilling--no ice, no water, no wet label to fall off, and no wasted space in your refrigerator. The ice pack takes six hours to chill, so it is best to leave that in the freezer ahead of time.",
