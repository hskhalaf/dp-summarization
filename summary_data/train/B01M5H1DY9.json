To deal with the issue of the tubing falling out when trying to assemble, I just used a bit of duct tape to hold the joints together. Pretty much followed the instructions - not hard. The stakes it comes with are lame, so ordered some spiral dog tie-out stakes. I live in a gross part of Sacramento, so do not care that this looks janky as it will keep my truck in the shade. Hope it lasts, but for the price point it seems decent.",

The poles are both bigger & thicker than the last carport we had.",

Good quality and I love the color it matches the siding on the house. I was concerned about my Chevy traverse fitting under it, and it did with no problem. Can probably get my sons 2017 Chevy Sierra under it. I will let you know how it holds up in the Michigan winters.",
