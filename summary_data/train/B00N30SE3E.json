      "text": "I bought this flat iron because it appeared to be similar to one that I currently have, FHI Heat. So far I've used this flat iron twice since I purchased it. On my first use I wasn't impressed. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. The sides of the flat iron pulled at my hair. I also found that I had to use a high heat setting to get my desired results. I found this odd because my hair isn't coarse my any means. I am natural and have been for about 4-5 years so I assume this attribute to why I had to use a high heat setting. Otherwise I'm a satisfied customer.",

For only $40, this was a very good buy. Update: I've had this flat iron for a while now. Still works good, still happy with my purchase.",
