If you need a very light duty one handed clamp, one that doesn't need to clamp overly tight, then OK but don't expect much. I have nearly 80 clamps in my shop. I won't be buying more of these.",

I used one as a third hand to hold my bicycle brakes together while I adjusted them and their applications in woodworking are only limited by your imagination.

The clamp has thick rubber teeth, the tightening/locking mechanism is smooth.. just pump the grip and it tightens flawlessly. Releasing is just as smooth, a separate handle press and the device loosens just enough to unlock but not too much that the grip comes completely off whatever you are clamping.",
