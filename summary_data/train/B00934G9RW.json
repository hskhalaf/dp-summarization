I bought a less expensive vivora ball and after trying multiple times to inflate it to full size with no success, I just sent it back. It shouldn't be that difficult. This one took 10 minutes to set up and inflate (using an air mattress pump for most of the air, then finishing off with hand pump to adjust comfort). It's worth noting that the hand pump that came with this is of very high quality! Overall, amazing purchase. Couldn't be happier.",

NO wheels is another minus, was aware of this when I bought the product but realized how inconvenient it is only after using. Great idea though, wish it was as good to use as it looks.",

You get the fabric, a smaller exercise ball you insert and then blow up. You can adjust for comfort. Easy to fit under desk when not in use and doesn't roll away. Also look like pac-man ghosts so that is kind of fun. More modern look for sure in general with certain colors. Have no issues so far with construction.",
