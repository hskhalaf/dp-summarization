I tried it once and never used it again -- It didn't roll easily, which I suppose could be a \"design feature\", but the biggest negative was that it made annoying noises when rolling. I went back to this simple device. If it ever breaks, I'll buy another one.",

The wheel rolls smoothly with your movement and the grip of the handles is pretty good.

There is nothing to keep the wheels in the center. The actual rod is kuch longer than the picture and there is a lot of space for the wheels to move around while using it. Hence, it\u2019s not stable as the wheels \u201c slide out\u201d while rolling. It didn\u2019t come with set up instructions so cannot confirm if the design included anything for the wheels to stay in place. It still works but Due to the instability, makes it much less Functional and less fun. Hope the makers read this and do something about it.",

Assembly makes tying your shoes seem difficult in comparison. Comes with a short paper on proper form during exercises. In case Google is not your friend.",

I plan to use gloves or wrap grips with bicycle tape. Can't give you advice about using them, but would advise to check a few YT videos for proper form, start out slow, very slow...",

I can definitely get a good workout, do doubts there. And there is a lot of variety to the core workout I can get, unlike doing crunches or planks. The construction is simple, but after a couple months of regular use it is still perfectly solid with no issues. It works on carpets and on wood floors. I have no complaints at all.",

I am working up to that after a month now and my waistline is beginning to slim down. A great Amazon deal for 12 bucks!",

Using this product seemed to strain my back unnecessarily without providing the type of ab workout I was looking for. I would call it fairly ineffective, even after I watched several how to videos in the proper use of this piece of equipment. I ended up throwing it out since I found simply laying down on the couch, throwing my legs over the armrest and doing crunches/sit-ups from that position provided a more rigorous and effective workout while saving my back the strain of using this product.",

I didn't realize it before I bought it, but this ab wheel hurts my back. I think it's because my ab muscles aren't strong enough, so this might be a good piece of equipment to someone who already has stronger abs and wants to keep them tight. Maybe not good for very beginners like myself.",
