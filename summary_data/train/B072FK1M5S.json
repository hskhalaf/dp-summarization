I didn't have arm rests to finagle and it opens and closes so easily. The bag holds the chair easily and doesn't feel like you can never get it to fit correctly. If I needed a reason to buy more I would! A very satisfying and happy purchase.",

It's worth not having the cup holder just because the design is so stinking comfy. I've kept it on the back porch for the last 6 months to sit in all the time. Which is a bad idea, fyi, due to the humidity in FL it now is developing tiny mildew spots on it. But I don't blame the company for that, I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did out there without any damage. The only downside is the price.",
