      "text": "My husband and I purchased the Guava Lotus Bassinet and Crib for our baby as we are in the process of trying to move and wanted something compact and easy to travel with (as opposed to a a traditional crib). The fitted sheets for sale on the Guava Family website were 1)Way too expensive and 2)Unavailable for purchase for a long time. After seeing a review on another Kushies Organic Jersey Sheet Set, I decided to purchase this because I wanted sheets in a slightly darker color. This fits the bassinet mattress PERFECTLY and is so soft! It also helps that it's about half the price of the organic sheets on the Guava Family website. Definitely recommend this product!",
