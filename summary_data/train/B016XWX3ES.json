The lamp says only 40w, but it's been working just fine with the led 60w. Led doesn't get hot, so there is no chance in burning the lamp shade. The lamp is the perfect size and you can adjust how tall it is and paint the shape how you want it (up and down) The only thing I don't like is that the cord is not white.",

Today I finally went to Lowe\u2019s to find a tool to fix it. I discovered one of the holes was not big enough for the screw. Two gentlemen who work at Lowe\u2019s explained the problem. The hole was made bigger and the screw was stripped of an unnecessary object on the screw. Lowe\u2019s put it together for me. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t return it to Amazon. I love the lamp and I love Lowes for helping me.",
