Read another review where the guy ran into a problem with the cable going through the triangle behind the bottom bracket, so he just notched it out. Figured thats what i would do! However, on my roadie the space was too small unfortunately. I filed it down to the point of almost going into the hole in the mounting bracket, and it was still a no go (bolt is just too big). So, don't want to downgrade the product-just didn't work for my application (but on normal cruiser/hybrid type bike you will be good to go)",

Had to cut three times to get the prefect length for the wife's bike. I worked fine, but after we added a basket to the handle bars, it changed the balance of the bike and was prone to falling over if lightly bumped. I ended up changing this kickstand out for an adjustable model with a larger foot and it works just fine.",

This is a great kickstand... installation took less than a minute and it's locked on tight; there's no play or wobble once you screw it down. Deploys easily, then bumps back up to the frame with minimal effort and stays in place again until you move it. The leg required no cutting to fit my adult Diamondback XE, and the black fits the color scheme nicely. NOTE: Mine came with the rubber foot INCLUDED... and judging by several of the other reviews, I'm not alone. (Though even if it didn't, I probably wouldn't order one separately as I don't think it's necessary.)",

The pre-marked increments/cut lines are a great help. Super easy. If in doubt, cut bigger than you need then adjust. File the cut end to deburr if you want. I didn't have to cut at all for the Marins; they are sized perfectly at 285. There doesn't appear to be any issue with the plate interfering with the cable on the Marins. For the Koen I cut to 205 mm. I probably could have cut to 200 for more lean but it works as is so no need.",

The kickstand made by Greenfield can be purchased in differing lengths. Also, it only takes a vice and a hacksaw to cut to desired length to create the stable lean angle for your bike. Fitment to frame was perfect and the kickstand retracts quickly to nestle up secure against the rear wheel frame member. Price point was very good. Saved me the hourly labor and higher price for a \"Raleigh\" part which is fine with me.",

Only downside is that it isn't adjustable, but I truthfully don't see why you need that level of precision on a kickstand. If it's too high, you can always cut some off the tip. Highly recommend.",
