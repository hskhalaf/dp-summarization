I think most of the reviews who say they don't stick, honestly, just aren't doing it right. There's no way for these things not to work if the conditions are correct. A little bit of oil or lotion may help, but don't use too much!! Fyi- If you leave it in one spot, it will leave a hickey, so keep it moving, or just do it for little bits at a time. Also, probably not good to use on thin, sensitive, old-person skin!",
