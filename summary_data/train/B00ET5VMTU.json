A new charger is like $75, this gives you two batteries and a drill to go along with the charger for another $20. I have Ryobi green ones for on the road or in locations where theft is an issue. The dewalts seem to float away easy if you don't keep an eye on them. These impacts and drills pound in the screws and will drill holes in 4x4s all day long.",

The simplicity in attaching a bit is helpful and the ability to accurately adjust the speed of the drill is helpful when you're trying to get it juuust right. It does what it's supposed to do and it does it very well. Two batteries included is a real nice bonus.",

      "text": "Can't beat price. Uses AAA batteries instead of AA. Letters/symbols on keys are 'stickers' on as opposed to printed. Biggest difference in original iMac/apple keyboard...bluetooth disconnects from the keyboard rather quickly when idle and then takes a few seconds to reconnect again when you are ready to type. The original keyboard stays connected to bluetooth indefinitely. I would guess this 'disconnect' saves battery life greatly. If you are used to performance of original keyboard this takes some getting used to.",

Most small projects so far I haven't even had to switch batteries which is really impressive. It's funny going from a 18v nicad to 20v lithium sure makes a huge difference. The only reason I upgraded after all these years cause my 18v hit the ground and broke in half right where the trigger and switch forward/reverse is. Kinda sucked! This was a nice upgrade for sure!",

It has since been completed. I would highly recommend this drill set for anybody who needs something reliable that would last all day.",
