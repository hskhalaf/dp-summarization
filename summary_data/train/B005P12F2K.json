Not one dent, bump or scratch. It was locked with keys, mounting screws and shelf/drawer inside. Manuel with code was inside box with safe. I love it. It meets all my needs. My only complaint's are the handle is plastic and the shelf/drawer isn't very sturdy. It has 3 purposes. To literally lock into the safe via lock and key, store things internally, and act as a shelf. If you're wanting a go box, I'd recommend a chest instead. But other than that I'm satisfied. Great safe for the price.",

NO ONE is going to carry it out by themselves. I also can't see it being lost in a fire or the contents inside. Only thing is, the key can't be removed with it in lock. I have one from years ago and you can remove the key after unlocking it, you just have to push the button to relock. With this one you have to push the button with key in it, then remove the key. I'm just a little picky.",
