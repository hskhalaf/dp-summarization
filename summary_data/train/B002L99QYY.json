Over all, this dummy has helped us advanced in our training and I will be buying another one when/if this one dies. So far, it has been used very frequently and shows no damage so maybe it's more likely that we'll lose it..",

I will add that I HIGHLY recommend the full-sized retrievers for labradors. Best of luck in the field and on the water!",

If you want to implement something to get a better grip for throwing the dummy father, then use a 1/2 inch PVC cap at HD. It costs $0.50. Drill a hole in it. Run the rope through it. Put a washer on the inside. Tie a knot. It works wonderfully.",

The power throw ball for the rope is helpful when you want to get further distance out of your throws. It's silly that they don't just put them on to begin with. I'd definitely recommend this product.",

Encourages a proper pick up and hold while discouraging the shaking of birds. Dokken Dead Fowl Trainers float even when punctured and training scents may be injected directly into the body for added realism.",
