This holds several cases of cans or bottles and looks much nicer than the plastic coolers. It does wobble a little when even just partially filled and rolling it but seems sturdy enough otherwise.",

Bottom line if you want something impractical, but that looks good this is your guy.

Especially considering the high probability the next cooler also has dents. I feel like I should receive a credit of some sort for future purchases.",
