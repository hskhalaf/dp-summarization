According to ZeroWater's very friendly & sympathetic customer service rep, with the high TDS content in my water, each ZeroWater filter will give me about 8 gallons of wonderfully clean-tasting water. It's far cheaper for me to buy Walmart purified water (which has 006 TDS, btw) and pour it into my filterless $45 23-cup ZeroWater container than it is to buy filters. Can't fault ZeroWater--much.

      "text": "Zero water is an intensely filtered water purification home system that we wont live without! The included tester keeps us on top of when we need to change out the filter. We've used that same tester when visiting friends who bragged about their whole house water filtration system ...we bought along some Zero water and did a particulate test..they were in disbelief as their water was well over 220 ppm and our water was ZERO. Cant beat the crisp, clean taste..and weve NEVER found any black mold inside the filtered water tank. Save the olanet and stop killing your back dragging in case adter case of bottled water. Its not good for so many reasons. Go ZERO..be happy!",

      "text": "Hands down the best tasting water from a pitcher ever. I live in a region with a lot of mountains and our water usually tasted like minerals. Even from the fridge filtered water. This pitcher makes my water taste soft and it tests at 3. I have had this for 3 weeks now and it is still testing at 6. I am beyond thrilled with this pitcher. Our household consumption is relatively low, as there are only two of us. I figure we will have to replace the filter about once a month. This equates to about $10 a month if I buy the 6 pack of filters. 110% worth it!",

The emailed me back apologized for the problem and asked for my address so they could ship me a new one no questions asked. I received a new one today and it works perfectly. I was so amazed by their customer service. I wholeheartedly support Zero Water. Great product and great company.",
