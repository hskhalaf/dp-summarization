      "text": "Bought this for my daughter. She loves it! It has a power cord but also has a slot for 4 x AAA batteries so she can take it on the go or out of the bathroom if someone else needs in. The power cord isn't very long but again because of the battery operation that isn't an issue. The amount of light emitted is perfect for makeup she says. It's not harsh but is good no matter what amount of light surrounds you. There is a x2 and a x3 magnification on one side that is a bit awkward but easy enough to get used to.",

This means I have to use the battery powered option or my mirror wouldn't light up at all. And honestly, the lights just dont shine as brightly using the battery function.",

It made it difficult for her to use. Overall love it. If it was permanently in her room I would probably look into something else.",

I was not to happy that the box could\u2019ve been rained on and was not \u201chanded directly to a resident\u201d",
