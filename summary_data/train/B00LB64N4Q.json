After one day of walking around the city, the spot where my soles touched the shoe are starting to rub off painfully. I'm not sure if the leather is wearing out already, or if it's just breaking the shoe in, but it hard to wear them for even half a day. I'm pretty disappointed. Such a shame they were so cute with dress shirts.",
