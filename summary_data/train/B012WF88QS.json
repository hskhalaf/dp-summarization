It doesn't look so bad in the picture but IRL it's really far off, like flat paint instead of the glossy deep ceramic look of the photos.

But I really so no reason that a well-designed kettle in this price range should not be double-wall. In addition, my previous kettles heated their full pots in 2 minutes or less, not the 4 minutes this one takes.

      "text": "This kettle is replacing a Cuisinart that failed after I ran a little of water on the outside of the pot. It seems the lever assembly is very sensitive and a little water seems to cause a little corrosion and disables the on/off switch. This kettle has the same system so I am very careful to turn the water on only after the faucet is over the opening. There is no plastic smell as I've had with other kettles (even those which were virtually solid stainless.) We are very happy with it and hope it lasts.",
