There was also a small chrome crimp pin that broke off from somewhere and was found in the lower wheel chamber. There is no way to re-seat the bearing cover which leaves the bearings exposed to every piece of dust and debris created during cutting. I also haven't had the best experience trying to get this resolved as well.",

He had trouble getting the blade off and was never able to get a new one on, in part due to the top wheel wobbling so much. He called WEN tech support but they were unable to help. There were no local support techs in the Phoenix area. He brought it to an experienced woodworking store that sells bandsaws, and they were unable install a new blade and commented on the strange wobbly upper wheel. He would have had to disassemble it and pay for return shipping. He decided to write it off as a loss. Buyer beware.",

      "text": "The bandsaw looks much nicer than it actually is. Everything is made from thin, flimsy aluminum. Tolerances are terrible. It took 10 minutes just to get the blade off because of the way the mast is designed with a narrow slot. It took another 15 minutes of messing around with the wheel tilt to get the new blade to stay on the wheel. When it is running, it sounds like the blade is rubbing in several places. The blade wanders all over and the table top won't stay perpendicular to the blade. Of course, the table top is a flimsy, thin piece of crappy aluminum as well so what do you expect? All in all, a total waste of money.",

My primary use is for rough cutting parts to be finished with a flush trim router bit, and it certainly does that well. Out of curiosity I tried resawing some ~6x8x24 blocks of oak. It got the job done well enough to move the parts over to the planer, but really it's not something I'd frequently require from this machine. If large resawing projects are your application you might be better off saving up for a more expensive machine.",

The fence is effective although the scale is a bit useless and I might be weird but I don't understand the point of a miter gauge for a bandsaw however one is included (a very basic one) bottom line, if you're a hobbyist or just getting started, this is the droid you're looking for.",

I first cut some 1\" oak and it handled it with ease. I then grabbed a 1x6 piece of oak and ripped it on the 6\" depth and it cut superb, straight and no blade drift. I was more than happy with the outcome. In the end, this bandsaw is a no brainer if you're looking in the 10\" size category.",

After additional 90 minutes to correct lower guide, using grinder and some patience to properly adjust upper guide I made perfect cuts. Since then \u2013 tools work great! After over 100 hours of intensive use I have not found any weaknesses in materials or principal design, no broken knobs reported by other reviewers.

I read another review which the person complained of seized up bearings and apparently Wen doesn't sell them any longer. WEN should advise customers on what to buy if they no longer stand by their product. I believe the bearings they outfit in this band saw should have been of a quality that is more sealed or basically better quality. I have other WEN products unfortunately, and frankly the buck will stop here.",

The way it is it shines on the work from the back and right into eyes of the user. If you can avoid the light the intense reflection of the table makes it very hart d use. However if the light was on the front of the machine it would shine onto the work but away from the user. This would make the work light much more effective",

It works ok if you put in a lot of hours adjusting everything, including having to add things to make adjustments. I would have sent it back but didn't' seem to be any benchtop saw much better, you get what you pay for!",

I changed out the wood blade for a metal cutting blade, it will cut metal, but very SLOWLY, not sure if it is powered enough for this, but I think if I take it slow, it will cut the metal I need it to. I would buy it again, good price for a good product.",

I am using it on a work table and not the stand that it came with. I read a lot of reviews on this and other saws and felt this was the best for my needs and am very pleased.",

Others have correctly commented about the need to spend considerable time and adjusting to get the blade and guides correctly aligned. ALL of the bearings must be checked and adjusted before use.
