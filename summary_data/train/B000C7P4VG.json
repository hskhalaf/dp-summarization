      "text": "Seventh Generation was bought by Unilever last year. Unilever is on the list of companies that tests on animals. As a long time vegan who seeks cruelty free, vegan products and companies, it is sad to see a company like Seventh Generation bought by a company like Unilever. It is deceptive of them to list their products as \"not tested on animals\". Maybe the Seventh Generation line isn't, but the fact that it is under the umbrella of Unilever opens the door for them to do just that, test Seventh Generation products on animals, and people will not know. I will not purchase Seventh Generation anymore.",

It's so frustrating, not to mention, such a waste to have to double bag everytime. We will not be buying these again, but somehow need to find a way to use all 12 boxes. Suggestions???",

I've done some searching though and finding a 20 gallon trash bag is a challenge. The only thing suitable I could find was a trash compactor bag. If anybody can recommend a trash bag for 20 gallon cans, please feel free to chime in with a comment. Thanks",
