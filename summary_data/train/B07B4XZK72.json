So in my case while in the closed position a small wind gust opened the umbrella, another gust took the open umbrella and bent the pole also separated the top pole at the tilt mechanism. This is now garbage from a small thunderstorm, only had it for 3 weeks, have bought a bungee to secure the one that remains. I have had others that had no problem like this.",

      "text": "As a general rule, we try to shut the patio umbrella whenever a storm's threatening but we've been surprised a couple times this season & haven't been home when big rains have popped up. It's a testimony to how sturdy this umbrella is that it still looks brand new & works perfectly! The color hasn't faded, the mechanisms are smooth & it's held up surprisingly well to some nasty weather so I'd say, all in all, it's been a Very positive experience.",

The second umbrella lasted three uses then the button (plastic) to tilt came completely out. When I was trying to see if i could fix it one of the extension bars broke.

After further reading the reviews, I thought I\u2019d better not take my chances. I went to cancel my order and they declined ( it hadn\u2019t even shipped). I really hope the umbrella looks like they have advertised, doesn\u2019t break or turn dingy after a month, or I\u2019m going to sock it to them with a bad review. I have them a 3 star rating because I\u2019m on the fence about this one. To be continued...",
