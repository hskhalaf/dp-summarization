All is good again although manually reprogramming this thing is a pain in the rear. Wish there was a way to import and export the programming. Fortunately for me, the old one still worked well enough to transfer all my custom button programmings.",

Yes it does recognize my very old stereo system (circa 1990) and my very old television (circa 1995). However, in many cases the only control it provides is to turn the equipment on and off, or to turn the volume up and down. On my old stereo for example, I could not turn the bass on and off. I have a much newer stereo which has pre-programmed sound effects (like Jazz, R&B, Rock, Pop, Latin etc) and the remote does not provide an option to switch between these different sound effects.",

So we took a chance with this remote. I took off a star just because there is a steep learning curve with this remote. It was easy to set up but once you get it going some of the most important buttons are the smallest (making it hard to get used to). I use the fast forward button the most but it is hidden and I would spend about 30 seconds staring at the remote trying to find the button. Otherwise, I really like the remote and the \"favorites\" button. I would recommend.",

The onscreen prompts make it super easy to set up and it's got gobs of memory and programmability. The macro function is the best: very easy to use and works like a charm. And the on board code library and access to it is as easy as pie. Gone are the days where you had to enter in numbers from a chart and hope you punched them in right. And, of course, the learning function and button editing function allow you to customize screens to your heart's delight: activity based or component based, you're in charge.",

The most notable assets for me are: 1) good solid feel and heft; 2) amazingly huge preloaded database of device remote codes; 3) ability to create and store powerful, complex macros to manage multiple devices with one button; 4) well designed buttons and ergonomics; 5) great bang-for-the-buck.

Everything is there for TV, pre-amp and amp, DVD/CD, Apple TV, etc. I would happily buy again. My old Universal remote is going to the bedroom with the old system--it still works after 7+ years.",

Using 4AA batteries allows the highest IR strentgh of any remote I've used so the remote does not have to be pointed at the device. I like the look and button layout but it takes a few days to get used to the narrow arrow key buttons.",

Basically, this remote Did Not accomplish the level of use/simplicity that I was looking for & not because of features but because of the screen size being too tiny and the details being too \"layered\" within. For the rest of the \"family\" to use this, there was no gain over what we already had in place with another programable remote.",

    "title": "URC R50 Digital Universal Remote Control for up to 18 Components (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Control up to 18 components with NO internet or PC needed\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nURC-R50 UNIVERSAL REMOTE: SOPHISTICATED, PROFESSIONAL-LEVEL HOME THEATER CONTROL\nHaving an advanced home theater system can be a great experience. High definition movies and sound, and all your favorite music and TV shows. But the more advanced the system, the more difficult you may be finding it to navigate between all your high-definition sources like your Blu-ray player or cable set-top box. Are you ready to give up the stack of remotes in your living room for a simple single solution that gives you professional-level control of your home theater?\n\nThe powerful yet affordable consumer line of universal remotes from Universal Remote Control puts control of your home theater at your fingertips. No need for complicated setups or expensive complete systems--the URC-R50 lets you spend less time wrestling to control your home theater, and more time enjoying it.\n\n\n\nChoose from a wide variety of logos for your favorite channels\n\nURC Consumer remote controls: helping you control the experience, one component at a time.\n\nREPLACE UP TO 18 REMOTES WITH ONE URC-R50\nPerfect for the advanced DIY, the URC-R50 replaces up to eighteen individual remote controls and offers a customizable color LCD screen, complete with device and TV channel icons, and brightly backlit buttons. URC's Digital R50 works with thousands of home theater produces--even iPod docks--and has simple \"Wizard\" based set-up options. You'll be able to easily setup your control system so that any member of the family can operate it. No PC or complicated programming is required.\n\nExperience home entertainment like never before with the URC-R50.\n\nSIMPLIFY CONTROLLING YOUR HOME THEATER WITH MACROS\nIn addition to being a great replacement for up to 18 remote controls, the URC-R50 delivers much more. MacroPower is a very useful way to make a lot of things happen with one button push. For example, in most home theaters, to watch television, the user must turn on the TV, then turn on the Cable Box or the Satellite Receiver, then turn on the Surround Sound system for sound. Instead of pressing all of those buttons one at a time, MacroPower enables you to turn on all of these components, in the sequence you want, with one button push.\n\nThe R50 uses MacroPower to allow you turn on your TV, cable box, DVD player and surround sound system all at the same time with the press of one button. The R50 even allows you the option of hiding screens you aren't using and editing text on every LCD button for maximum customization. Have a surround sound system? Use the \"Copy and Paste\" feature to access your receiver's volume while viewing any device control screen.\n\nThe URC-R50 also comes with eight reserved pages to program up to forty-eight favorite channels, complete with station logos.\n\n\n\nReplace up to 18 remotes with the URC-R50\n\nSIMPLESOUND TOTAL SYSTEM VOLUME\nWith SimpleSound, the Volume and Mute buttons always control the sound regardless of what screen is displayed, even those that do not have their own built-in volume control such as TiVO and DVD players. This is set up by using Copy and Paste to copy the commands from your TV or Audio system to the Volume and Mute buttons on all of your other devices. So no matter what, there are no hassles when you quickly need to reduce or mute sound for a phone call or doorbell.\n\nCHANNEL CONTROL \"PUNCH THROUGH\"\nThis \"Punch Through\" enables you to program the R50 remote so that either the Cable or TV Channel Controls (CHANNEL UP, DOWN, LAST, CHANNEL NUMBERS 0-9, +10 and ENTER) will also operate in other component modes on the remote control.\n\nTRANSPORT CONTROL \"PUNCH THROUGH\"\nThis \"Punch Through\" enables you to program the URC-R50 so that DVD or DVR Transport Controls (PLAY, STOP, FF, REW, PAUSE, SKIP and RECORD) will also operate in other component modes on the remote control.\n\nOSD (ON-SCREEN DISPLAY) CONTROL \"PUNCH THROUGH\"\nThis \"Punch Through\" enables you to program the URC-R50 so that CBL or DVD OSD Controls (MENU, GUIDE, INFO, EXIT, SEL and 4 Cursor Controls) will also operate in other component modes on the remote control.\n\nLEARNING MODE\nThis feature will allow you to literally teach the URC-R50 commands from other remote controls; when the remote is in learning mode, you can line the two remotes facing each other and transfer commands with just a few buttons presses. Press any button on the R50 remote that you want to teach a command to. For example, if you want to teach the MUTE button on the R50 remote the TV Mute command from the other remote, first press the MUTE button on the R50 remote and the TV component button LED light will blink once indicating that the R50 remote is ready to learn the command. This way, your remote is never obsolete--the URC-R50 grows with your home theater.\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING ABOUT URC-R50\n\"The URC R50 is one of the easiest remotes we've ever attempted set up...especially for the non-technically inclined. The packaging includes a one-sheet guide to help you get started, but you really don't even need that. Why? An intuitive setup wizard is ready to take you through the simple steps to get your gear up and running and consolidate your remote controls.\"\n--Krissy Rushing, Digital Trends\n\n\"URC Digital R50's successful combination of good design and easy programmability makes it a good alternative to Logitech Harmony universal remotes.\"\n--John Falcone, CNET\n\n\"The R50's comfortable ergonomics and bright color screen make it competitive with the higher priced [Logitech] Harmony remotes, and, while it may take a few extra steps, it can accomplish the same kind of intelligent and unified system control that you find on even the most expensive competitive remotes.\"\n--Chris Boylan, Big Picture Big Sound\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n * Learning Capability: Up to 1,500 Buttons\n * Macro Capability: 1,500 Macro buttons (up to 255 steps each)\n * Non-Volatile Flash Memory: 32 MBs\n * IR Range (Line-of-Sight via Infrared): 30 - 50 feet\n * Unit Dimensions (W x H x D): 2.3\" x 8.9\" x 1.1\"\n * Unit Weight: 0.55 lbs (with batteries)\n * Gross Unit Weight in Package: 0.9 lbs\n * Power: AA Alkaline x 4 (Included)\n * Warranty: One year including parts & labor\n\n\n\nWHICH URC REMOTE IS RIGHT FOR YOU?",
