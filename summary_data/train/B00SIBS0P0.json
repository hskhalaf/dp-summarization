They are Not easy on the grass/ yard , but I Don't Care about that...the mower weighs 500# and I don't want to be pulling or pushing it around, I just want it to GO !!! So far they show no wear/damage of any kind... I'm Very Happy with them !!!!",

I'm not a tire expert, but I was under the impression that as long as the numbers on the sidewalk match, the tire would be the right size. Since it's just for my garden,and seems to hold air for a low price, I'm giving it 4 stars.",
