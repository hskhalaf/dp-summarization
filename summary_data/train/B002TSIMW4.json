Oh, and don't be intimidated by all the videos with beautiful journals, boasting calligraphy and artsy doodles. I CANNOT DRAW ! But people think I'm artsy just cause the dots help guide your handwriting and whatnot. Give it a try!",

      "text": "I purchased this notebook and a Clever Fox notebook. I had planned on using the leuchtturm1917 for bullet journaling, but after beginning to use it, the ghosting was horrible. I switched to the Clever Fox because I can use my same pens, highlighters, and watercolor markers without the annoying ghosting. Though I like the leuchtturm1917, it ended up not working for me. I'm sure it is perfect for other uses. I was honestly surprised by the thin paper. I think it will work well with my pencils, but even regular pen markings were annoyingly visible through the paper.",

The whole reason I got a bullet journal with so many pages was to actually use them, not to have to glue them together to make the ghosting less obvious. I'd suggest trying the Artist Loft notebooks from Michael's with the 120 gsm pages. Much better as far as ghosting goes",

Next time I might get a bujo that is 8x11 instead of a 5X8. The bottom binding came dented/damaged. I\u2019ve seen that this happens a lot with packaging and shipping. Should of just bought in person at a Barnes and noble and inspected it before I bought. The return takes away $5 from my purchase so I didn\u2019t want to return it and lose $5. Oh well. Won\u2019t but again though. But will do trick for now",

So far I've purchased 3, a college-ruled lined one with 249 pages, a dotted one with 126 pages, and the one here, a numbered 249-page dotted version and by far my favorite.
