There are a few different levels, different karts, and different challenges to overcome in this game. If you are a Mario Kart fan and own a 2ds or a 3ds, I would highly recommend this game.",

It struck a great balance between casual players and hardcore players, and I love this title for it. Mario Kart 8 went overboard with the casual experience, alienating a lot of competitive players with its worsened drifting mechanics. Nintendo representatives, if you're reading this, I implore you to bring the next Mario Kart closer to this. Casual AND hardcore gamers can both enjoy a balanced engine like this.",

There are different courses, different characters to play with, different motorcycles and karts to choose from. Some of the characters and vehicles need to be unlocked. Like all things Mario, there are many different challenges to keep things interesting.",

His favorite part is seeing all of the unlocked karts and characters that didn't make it onto MarioKart8. I think MarioKart is one of those games that will always translate better on a tv screen rather than on a handheld device.",

I can play it on the bus, subway, walking(not crossing roads though, beware) and killing time because a challenge takes abt 3 mins to 6 mins(Grand Prix). ALL the courses are BEAUTIFUL. Some are redesigned and some are new. Love all the new courses! and how we can use our own characters to play in the game! ^^ Cute racing game. Wont regret the money spent on this.",

Love that they finally took out that stupid lighting that you had to pass on to another player from Mario Kart Wii and the love the levels that go on until the end and you just don't repeat laps. The glider is a lot of fun too! Underwater is ok but luckily there aren't a lot of those parts in the game. Highly recommended.",

I bought it for my son's 4th B-day, he still a bit young to manage the controls on the Nintendo 3DS XL but will grow into this game in no time. Highly recommend it.. although nothing to compare to as this is first game purchase for the console.",

The new 3DS sequel, Mario Kart 7, retains all the intense racing craziness, while adding new and interesting ideas to the mix, such as gliding through the air, and racing underwater. Tons of new, obscure characters(some odd choices by Nintendo), new items, new innovative tracks, and online racing(although the game has very modest online capabilities,) make this MK7 a solid choice for a 3DS title. The 3D graphics are nice, and add little flair to the visuals. Although the game feels VERY familiar, its still very fun.",
