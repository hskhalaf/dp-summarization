In the winter you must remove the inner tube or if ice forms it will crack the tube. Or it did for me. These gauges last a long time and give a very precise measurement. Recommended but I also recommend you join CoCoRaHS as it is a great volunteer project, especially for a fun family project and extremely easy and educational.",

To get the most accurate readings make sure you put up this rain gauge in an open area away from buildings, trees etc. That way you won't have anything obstructing of funneling the rain into the gauge. It will also measure snow just follow the instructions that are included with the gauge.",

However, I was tired of having to constantly replace cheap rain gauges that did not hold up well. I don't think I am going to be disappointed. The plastic of the large outer container must be 1/4\" thick or so! The inner container is more like the thickness of the rain gauges you would purchase at your hardware store. It works well, and I expect to be using it for a long time!",

There are some cool digital rain gauges out there but the beauty of this one is it keeps the most accurate totals, requires no batteries and is totally weather proof. I love it. Bought one from my brother and father as well, and they both love them.",

If you're just a casual or infrequent observer there are gauges that you can easily read at a distance or electronic gauges.

A great tool for teaching kids about weather, keeping track of rainfall amounts to water your lawn, and everything in between.\n\nEasily and accurately monitor rainfall, snow, sleet and hail amounts with the Stratus Rain Gauge, a precision weather instrument built to United States Weather Bureau specifications. Official weather observers around the country rely on these standards for accurate weather reporting. Constructed of heavy-duty, UV resistant polycarbonate, this rain gauge will stand up to years of rough weather and full sun without fading or corroding.\n\nA funnel top on the rain gauge catches rain and delivers it to a one-inch measuring tube, while the extra-large outer cylinder captures rain volumes over one inch up to 11 inches, and can be detached to measure snow, hail, or sleet. The Stratus is accurate to 1/100th of an inch.\n\nInstalling the rain gauge on a post (away from buildings and trees) is easy with its exclusive \"Quick Connect\" bracket, which lets you quickly remove the cylinder for easy measurement or cleaning (and there are no metal parts to rust).",
