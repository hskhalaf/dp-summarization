I steam baby carrots until fork tender and love whole red potatoes likewise. I steam frozen tamales and love artichokes steamed till the leafs pull off easily too. Though it says you can put in an oven I tend to think this would eventually deteriorate the handles and besides, Why? Dishwasher safe thought I simply swish in hot soapy water and rinse and drain. P.S. Just remember to use on the right size of your stove burner if you have a glass top stove on med/low heat. Any pan is only as good as the care we give them.",

After reading the description I was confident that it was high-quality stainless steel which was a must. \"Another pleasant surprise is that it is lightweight and easy to use. I wasn't sure about the handles on both sides of the pot but find they actually help with handling. The steamer is roomy and much better than the steamer basket I once used to insert in my pot. I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. By the way, the pot was available at another store for just about the same price without the steamer. Thank you for a well-designed product.",

This steamer is made so well that it distributed the heat even after I forgot, first time, to add water before turning on the heat, without burning red or catching fire. I contacted Chef's Star to see if the steamer was still safe to use. He said yes, and advised to purchase Bar Keepers Friend from Amazon to help clean up the discoloration. I highly recommend this steamer.",

Except for this major, and possibly dangerous, design flaw, this is a great steamer. I contacted customer service and they took care of the problem to my satisfaction! The moral here is to make sure the flames from a gas burner do not go up the sides of the lower pot.",
