I contacted Amazon support and they refunded \u00a320 so I could get one separately. Once again Amazon customer support has come up trumps, that's why I bought through them. Well done Amazon, but please correct the details!",

The battery is better than expected but it takes a long time to charge. The stand is superb you can hang/angle it anywhere. The software is a joke you basically have to navigate away from anything to do with Lenovo. Screen is good. It barely works with sky go but other tv providers works well. Difficult to get a decent cover. Overall I like it huge screen, great projector, quick proccesor. I would recommend it as a second tablet but complements not replaces my iPad.",
