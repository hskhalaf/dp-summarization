It has an objectionable persistent odor. Can smell it all day intermittently. The only way to reduce it is to apply a unscented moisturizer subsequently. Note to Manufacturer: please make this UNscented and odorLESS. 3. The product should have less DHDA (dihydroxyacetone) in it because even when use sparingly the tan is too intense. I'd continue using it and re-purchase it only if that earthy smell were eliminated. Hence the one star rating. Clinique Self-tanning is about half the price, has no odor, and produces the proper tan intensity.",

It smells way less than other self tanners (that smell once it develops is there, but much less than other brands). It dries quickly, which is nice; it doesn't have an oily residue either. Also, products that are cruelty free are the only ones I'm willing to use. So, thanks for making such a great product that delivers on color, and is safe for people and animals.

Then wash hands well and use a microfiber mitt to buff all over and spread what's there in a thin film over knees and ankles. This keeps it from getting too dark and prevents streaks. Lastly I use the mitt to smooth a little tanner over wrists and backs of hands to avoid a harsh line on wrists.",

Using the mit and following instructions, the cream can be evenly distributed for a natural warm color. I found it was important to allow time for the product to dry and absorb for best results. The creaminess of this product may lead to applying too much and having a sticky outcome, so I would caution first time users to be conservative with amounts until accustomed to it. The only time I had any negative reaction to the scent was when I used too much by accident and it took longer to absorb.",

Seriously maintains a tan and starts one all over when the real one inevitably fades away. Applies easily and does not streak. Light scent, not that cloying self-tanner odor. Lasts for three to four days before another application is needed. I find the color to be compatible with my skin tone and amps up a healthy look.",

I am quite pale and have parts of my body that are incapable of tanning in the sun (chest and abdominals) but this product, after 2 applications, made my entire body a nice smooth caramel color. And you have control over how dark you get based on how often you reapply. As far as price it is a little expensive but it does not take very much to cover your body and so I would guess that one bottle would last an average sized person 3-6 months which makes the cost sound quite worth it considering there really isn\u2019t any other better option for getting tan!",

      "text": "This is great stuff. It has a pleasing smell - not like some others I've tried. Works great on your face. You don't have to use a glove to apply. Just make sure to wash your hands and wrists well. I have some white dots where my skin has lost pigment. Those turn brown like freckles with this product. (no fault of the product - just an observation). One application is great for a base. You can put it on 2 or 3 days in a row and get pretty tan. It is best to exfoliate before you apply it. It lasts several days.",
