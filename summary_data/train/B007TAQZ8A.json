It does NOT hold a Dyson dryer upright and since the nozzles are only magnetic the dryer will be on the floor within a few minutes of hanging it. Perhaps it would be great for standard hairdryers, but it just did not work for me. Also, it sticks off the wall way too much and looks oversized and tacky in my bathroom.",
