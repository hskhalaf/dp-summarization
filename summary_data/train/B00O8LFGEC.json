I don't know why they didn't give it the same handles as the other pieces; that would have made this a really nice set. As it is though; I'm not willing to go fishing around in a 270 degree steamy environment to find some thin wires that are barely attached to the pot. (one of the wires came unattached when I removed it from the box originally). Plus the lid doesn't seem to seat well because it gets caught on the stupid wires. Really bad design of an otherwise well made piece of cookware.",
