Easy to operate & easy to change tanks out no tools needed.",

Instructions are well written. Without having a tank door it\u2019s cumbersome for one person to change the tanks. Would be nice if the cover had a latch to hold it up. Use some quality metric wrenches for much easier assembly rather than the included cheap one. Well packed but takes about an hour to assemble. Note: Get a silicone pad to place under the tank to prevent rust and scratches. A towel just gets wet quickly.",

Also, a big plus is the customer service from the manufacturer. We had a small problem after using the unit for several times but after contacting the customer service the problem was solved very quickly. We highly recommend the product that is very reasonable priced, of very good quality and as I sad comes with excellent customer service if you ever run into any problems.",

We have a large wooden deck and it really puts out a great amount of heat...have just used it for the lounging portion ( so only on low) have no doubt it would heat the entire deck.
