I don't typically purchase modem-router combos, as I like the flexibility in maintaining and updating my own devices; but I read the reviews, and optimistically hoped that I'd select a device that would work, as some have experienced no issues. This unit functioned properly for approximately six full operational days before the bugs in the firmware kicked in - probably assisted by some hardware failures as well. Who knows. Tech community consensus is that the issues are primarily the firmware, which is, understandably in this use case, supplied by the ISP; which is why I tend to not purchase all in one solutions. Worth noting, when the device ran properly, it was everything as advertised. RIP NETGEAR",
