      "text": "My son is still growing and goes through cleats more often than I'd like. Two pairs per year at the current rate, with only a few months of play time in the local league (spring and fall). Trying to balance his adult-sized shoes with less expensive prices is a must for us. These weren't expensive, but they arestylish in terms of their design and functional for playing on turf and grass fields. His friends have all asked where he got them because they are \"cool\" and he's very proud. I'm happy because they fit well and didn't break the bank.",

I can\u2019t say that they would be great and hold up if you were a player, but I purchased these to wear while coaching. They are a little stiff, but I\u2019m sure they will break in. Only been wearing two weeks so I can\u2019t testify to the longevity of the exterior either. Overall they work without breaking the bank.",

If you are looking for a pr to wear a couple days a week, they would probably be fine, but if your son is on the high school soccer team, I would not recommend.",

He loves the color and the comfort and he plays hard in these cleats. Not once have they started to come apart or buckle under the pressure :) Very pleased. Will be purchasing again in the future.",
