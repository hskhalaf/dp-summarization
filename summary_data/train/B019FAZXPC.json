I purchased these shoes in April 2017 and the soles are badly worn - way down into the softer material beneath the sole. I've worn these shoes, on average, perhaps 3x per week. In other words, they've only lasted, at most, 117 or so wearings. Is that typical for hiking shoes?",

He usually wears about a 13.5 so ordered a 14 and he says it's a perfect fit, true to size, etc. Comfortable shoe, good quality, and no an obnoxious color pattern.
