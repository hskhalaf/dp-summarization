I sprayed this with multiple coats of Kiwi heavy water repellent and while not waterproof, it does stay dry in light showers. Any prolonged exposure to heavier rain, and water will seep through. I carry a hair over 60 lbs of gear in this bag on a daily basis, and have used it for 3 months now with no signs of wear. I would buy it again!",

Both sides have the zipper cover and both sides have multiple pockets. This was not real clear to me in the description. Lots of room in the middle for multimeter, wire nuts, wire staples, and the like. For me a little smaller version of this would be perfect.",

I also have a set of red 12 volt cordless tools and I can fit the jigsaw, hackzall, the impact and the drill gun inside it at once. It is phenomenal so far. If there's any complaint, I will recommend upgrading the shoulder strap because the one supplied gave out rather quickly.

Solid bag and have really enjoyed it. My only thing is that there is no tape holder so I ended up cutting mine off an only one and used electrical tape to tape it to a part on the bag. It\u2019s held up so far and completes the bag for me",

Not so big as to be difficult to handle but plenty of space with lots of pockets and organizers. * I love the straps that keep the zippered outer panels from completely falling down. * Seems super well made and heavy duty with strong rivets, seams, and shoulder strap. Cons: Non yet.",

Only reason not 5 stars is mine was shipped without the shoulder strap and due to Amazon\u2019s system I can\u2019t seem to ask for a shoulder strap without returning the whole bag. But the bag is good enough I don\u2019t want to wait for a replacement.",

Loaded up as I keep it the bag is far too heavy to carry around the city, but the organization is excellent and I drive a good amount of the time so it is usually in the trunk. This is now my mobile tool set, if I will be walking around I grab the essentials and toss them in a go bag. The material can take a beating with no tears so far, the handles are very strong, the pockets are endless, I am just very happy with this purchase. My intern is less happy when he has to carry it but I am willing to make that sacrifice.",

Although I have only had it a short time, it appears to be holding up quite well. The heavy duty stitching in key stress areas makes me believe that I will be using this tool bag for many years to come. I also love the multiple storage areas on both sides of the bag and the large interior area is perfect for storing my drill and larger accessories. I highly recommend it!",

Will be replacing those with something a little more heavy duty. Great buy. Would recommend to anyone wanting to organize their tools in an easy to use tool bag.",

They really need a 16\" version that's a tad narrower and shorter (same proportions, basically). Either that, or put wheels on this thing. There are no other bags like this in a 16\" size, except for one, that I won't mention because it's been discontinued and I need to buy it first before they run out of stock. ;)",
