Now that I have this brown nubby rock, I don't have to buy anything else. Just soak your feet and rub them with the pumice stone to remove dead skin. Be careful not to rub too hard or you could chafe your skin. Follow up with a good, natural oil or cream as an emollient.",

A friend of mine told me how awesome pumice stones are so I decided to try this one after reading the reviews. I am very pleased! Instant results in terms of smoothing out my skin. The calluses will take awhile to disappear, but they are definitely smoother, and I'm confident with regular use, they will go away too.",
