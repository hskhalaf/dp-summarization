Tip: don't pull the sock all the way onto the device. Keep it bunched at the end, up until the toe of the sock. As you pull up on the ropes, it easily pulls the sock over your foot and up the leg.",

So far, I've used it only with low \"no show\" socklets and regular socks (haven't tried it with hosiery-like knee highs for more formal wear.). It works just as the photos and accompanying brochure show. My one concern is that the tube over which you stretch out the socks and into which you put your foot is really large (I do not have small feet; wear women's 9.5 shoes...), and I hope that socks are not too stretched out when I use it. If there were a smaller size, I would have purchased that.",

Once there, it took so much force to get my foot to slide further and pull the sock off the device (which was very tight) that it hurt. I never successfully got a sock on using this. After about 3-4 days I was able to bend enough that I could put socks on without my wife helping or this device. It was useless.",
