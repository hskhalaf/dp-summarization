The one problem I had was that the cutouts on the box were ever so slightly too small in several areas to permit assembly. This where the wooden tabs go into the slots. I took a file to the openings and just removed a tiny amount from the opening until I could press the tab in. Since it is plywood, too much force might cause it to crack or delaminate; in my case, they wouldn't fit. Now that it is together, it is a great box!",
