Sellers will just reply saying to contact the manufacturer, and Steam support is too painfully slow to deal with.

The exp system is done well as the upgrades really make the game more enjoyable and upgrading weapons adds lots of cool effects. Blunt Weapons + Tesla Mod == FUN FUN FUN",

    "description": "Platform:PCMANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION\n\n\nIf you've been dreaming about paradise, we know a place where you can make those dreams come true--the Island of Banoi. Just off the coast of Papua New Guinea, located south of the Equator and just north of Australia.\n\n\n\nThe Island of Banoi Dead Island combines first-person action with a heavy focus on melee combat \nHordes of different festering zombies await players around every cornerDead Island is inspired by classic zombie movies\nA PARADISE TO DIE FOR\nUntil very recently much of the island was wild and primitive and totally untouched by the modern world. Even though the capital, Moresby, was founded by Australian settlers in 1895, many places deep in the interior still have never been seen by western eyes.\n\nAs a guest of the Royal Palms Resort, the player's stay was supposed to be a dream holiday; a luxurious getaway to the beautiful beaches of a tropical paradise. But faced with the reality of a zombie apocalypse, there is only one thing left to do: Survive.\n\nThis is Dead Island... a paradise to die for.\n\nTERROR. VIOLENCE. MADNESS.\nTerror. Violence. Madness. Bedlam. A holiday paradise gone mad. A tropical island turns into total chaos after a mysterious zombie outbreak. Cut off from the rest of the world, the player\u2019s only chance to survive is to fight to the death and find a way to escape from the island.\n\nDead Island combines first-person action with a heavy focus on melee combat, character development and customisation of a vast array of weapons. All of these gameplay features are presented in a dark story inspired by classic zombie movies with a gritty and engrossing campaign that can be played with up to four players in co-op mode.\n\nSet in an open world tropical island, hordes of different festering zombies await players around every corner while they embark on a variety of thrilling missions through the holiday resort. With firearms and ammunition being scarce the player must rely on utilising found items as weapons for self-defence and fight off zombie hordes in intense melee combat. A diverse range of items can be collected and will later serve to transform the player\u2019s ordinary makeshift weapons into serious instruments of destruction.\n\nIn addition to satisfying even the most bloodthirsty action fan\u2019s fantasy, Dead Island also features role-playing elements which allow the player to develop one of the game\u2019s unique character classes according to their preferences, all the while learning new skills and fresh tactics during their journey through the perilous environments of the island. What\u2019s more, anytime during a game up to four players can seamlessly join together and experience the intense combat and immersive story with cooperative gameplay.\n\nWith the all-new Chrome Engine 5 powering Dead Island, the game will use the latest installment of Techland\u2019s acclaimed proprietary game engine, allowing the player to experience the tropical island paradise in graphical splendour with diverse environments like lush forests and detailed city environments.",
