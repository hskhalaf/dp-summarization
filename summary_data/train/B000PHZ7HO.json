This is also good if you are looking for an exfoliate. This helps break apart dead skin cells. My family and I have been using this product for quite some time now and continue to repurchase.",

Its heavily fragranced which really isn't great for your skin, and the glycolic content is too low for the price as well. Not to mention the very cheap packaging. I stopped using it 2 days ago and my skin is already clearing back up. I really wanted to love this but I returned it!",

It was counterproductive. I have also developed hormonal acne in my late 20's and have been on a witch hunt to reinvent my bathroom products. This is now a staple!! It makes my face feel extremely clean and balanced. I ordered the big bottle, and will continue to do so. This stuff is goldennnn!!",
