I prefer an over the ear type, because the ear buds have never worked well for me. But, I want a lightweight pair, with great sound. And up until now, I wasn't able to find a pair for under $20 that could deliver. And these are delivering. The sound quality is really really good for a pair of headphones that cost less than most of my music. They adjust easily, fit well over my ears, and stay in place during walking and light aerobics. For the price, I'm truly happy",

BUT - they simply didn't last. I don't think she was too hard on them - what suddenly stopped working was that the integrated volume control 'lost' about 70% of it's volume. The slider still works, but the LOUDEST setting on the slider is like a murmur/whisper - it can barely be heard. I'd really like to give these a higher rating, but we were disappointed they didn't last at least a year.",

I have now listened for over 6 hrs from Rock to Jazz, Country to Classics, and they have not disappointed with ZERO distortion even at high volumes. One small thing that I really like on the cord is a 'slider volume' control (see photo) for instant level control. I handily recommend these headphones for their nice quality and audio.",

Easy to adjust but the plastic is lightweight so I would not pull too hard. I have never used the built in microphone since I am generally using them for classical music to mute the constant chatter in the cubicle jungle. A good investment and since they are large and easy to spot, no one has yet walked away with them.",

      "text": "For the price, these are pretty good headphones. I like the mic and volume control. However, they definitely hurt my ears and head after more than 40-60 minutes of use. I have to take breaks while flying, for instance - I can't listen to something through an entire flight. I also sometimes have difficulty getting the sound to come through - when I plug them into my computer's audio jack I have to wiggle it around a bit to get the sound. But, hey: the price is really good!",

The sound quality is decent for the price, the microphone is great (better than my $160 Bluetooth headphones' mic), there is a volume slider/play-pause control (which works with Siri) and the headphones overall are indeed portable. However, the round part that contains the speakers does NOT rotate and the cushions are somewhat stiff, meaning that there is mediocre noise cancellation at best. I am honestly relieved I had a coupon to subsidize half my purchase.",

I had to use a butter knife to pry the black ring off but it turned out to be a simple fix. I really like these earphones because they are economical and lightweight and is perfect for me other than the issue with the earpads. I am glad that Jelly Comb was able to help me fix it!",
