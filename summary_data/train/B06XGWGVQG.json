Someone posted on here that it turns off after 5 minutes of inactivity: that is true BUT it turns back on automatically when the media you are playing resumes. So if you pause Netflix for 10 minutes, come back and resume, the Soundbar will automatically turn back on, and it happens instantaneously. I use the HMDI ARC port to connect to my TV; highly recommended! Samsung never disappoints me, except when it's phones blow up, but we past that y'all\ud83d\udc4c",

My only issue is I have it mounted to the Samsung soundbar wall mount that goes under the TV and it's very heavy. I really like the sound bar though",

    "description": "Style:3.0 SoundbarThe Samsung 3.0 Sound+ Premium Soundbar HW-MS650/ZA with Built-In Subwoofer delivers room-filling, home theater sound without the need for a separate subwoofer. Designed with streamlined wires and an elegant easy mount option, Sound+ becomes one with your TV and brings your entire cinematic experience together like never before. The 450-watt HW-MS650/ZA delivers all-around perfect sound, no matter where you are in the room, thanks to Samsung\u2019s wide range tweeter. Distortion Cancelling technology predicts and cancels out distortion before it happens. Multi-speaker control increases the power and depth of bass by precisely coordinating the movement of each speaker for richer, more detailed bass. Enjoy your soundbar hands-free using Alexa voice control to make your music come alive with your voice. For added multiroom wireless functionality, you can connect your soundbar to your Samsung TV with ease and without the clutter of wires via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. For gamers, Game Mode Pro offers a unique setting that boosts game sound effects for an immersive gaming experience. Home theater enthusiasts will appreciate the 4K pass-through option with HDR compatibility, allowing you to pass-through high definition audio with pristine quality matching that of your UHD HDR video. The soundbar is wireless surround sound ready with the addition of an optional Wireless Surround Kit (sold separately) to expand your soundbar and subwoofer into a multi-channel home theater system. Note: If the unit doesn\u2019t receive an audio signal from the TV for 5 minutes, it will power down. This is not a functional issue.",
