The reason why 4 stars is because amazon handed off the clubs to usps and that's what caused the late delay despite it supposed to be next day or two day shipping, can't remember which one. The clubs were delivered approximately 5-7 days late. If you don't need them right away definitely recommend buying these clubs.
