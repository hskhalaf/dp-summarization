When I boiled water (I tried regular water from the faucet and filtered water) it leaves a film all around the inside of the whole pot. Yes, the noodles did mostly slide out, but about a quarter of them stayed inside and I needed a spoon to empty the rest. As far as noodles go, a regular pot will do even a little more than this one. In a regular pot, only about 3 or 4 noodles stay in. I was really hoping for the \"non-stick\" portion.",

You have to let the water drain first. I've also found that it doesn't cook as well as a thicker pan that I also purchased. So maybe the thicker material cooks better on Induction Ovens. Strange.",
