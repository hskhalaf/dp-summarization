That said, it comes with no instructions, but the guidance at acme.co.uk is enough to get you making noise within a half hour. After that, you\u2019re constrained only by the dexterity of your imagination and your tongue. I can\u2019t say how dogs respond to it, but I can whistle \u201cMy Country \u2018Tis of Thee\u201d (GSTQ) Dogs aside, I think this could be useful in a noisy environment where you need to signal more expressively than the usual fixed pitch whistle affords.",

It might be easier for someone who already knows how to whistle, but I didn't so I was starting from scratch. I watched YouTube videos on how to use it but they didn't really help at all. In the end I just had to keep working with it until I figured it out. The effort was well worth it because the range of tones allows for a wide variety of cues for your dog and at a good distance.",

It appears that the steel cutout has a sort of rivet that has grease trapped in the tiny crevice.

Once you have enough experience to play it, it's wonderful. I wouldn't recommend YouTube for learning to play this. It's full of amateurs. The best way to learn is by jamming this thing in your mouth and trial and error.",
