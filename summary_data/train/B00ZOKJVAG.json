The directions say you might need to rub a damp cloth over the glass to get static adhesion but never once did we ever need to do that. And soooo much better than using those little rubber suction cups that rapidly deteriorate from direct exposure to UV in sunlight.",

No suction cups that fall down, no frustration with needing to roll down a window and not wanting to have to readjust the shade. I simply love them. Great value is just an added bonus with four included. (And the great little pouch makes them perfect to stick in the glovebox when not in use!)",

But if you twist them a half turn and fold the two sides into each other ... the last step is turn each outer edge in opposite directions and they will reduce right down to fitting in the handy pouch. There is a video that clearly describes how to affix them to your windows that was helpful.\u201c",

I have tinted windows, probably medium to dark tint, and both types of shades were a problem. I also didn't think about how the combination of sunglasses can also add to the vision impairment. I don't take enough road trips to make it worthwhile taking up space in the car for storage. The shades did do a good job of staying on the windows.",

The only advice I have is to pay extra attention to your side view mirrors & don't make quick lane changes because you get used to seeing them in your peripheral vision & sometimes there is also a light colored car along side you on Multiple lane highways. I do not use them while just driving around town because of this distraction. But Well worth the $$$$ & We will not travel on Highways without them.",

My only issue is that I live in Phoenix AZ and the summers get up to 115. On hot days at 110 so far the ones in direct sun won't stick after being parked for an hour. Not too bad for the cost, but wished they held on in the hot sun a little better.",

The not as dark one is a little better but still pretty tough to see through. It also doesn\u2019t really keep the sun off my babies. They do stick very well but overall I am very disappointed in this product.",
