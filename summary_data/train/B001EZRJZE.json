I would not recommend this product. Even before it died, the quality of the audio and video was worthless away from home. The only decent quality I could get was in my own house when I did not have to go over the internet. I know there are technical requirements for use over the internet, but I found that all the places I tried it got the same result, poor quality. So unless you have high bandwidth on both the sending and receiving ends, don't expect HD type results.",

The PRO HD and support of Slingbox technical has been one nightmare I wish I had passed on.Not only gettting the units to work has been an act of frustration but even atempting to purchase the extended warranty has been an act of futility .I would never go through this again.I will forego TV watching first.",

Slingbox support is just awful, they would not offer any help until I could fax in my invoice from amazon to show proof of purchase to get the short 90 day \"complimentary\" support. That being said, once everything is configured, the slingbox works great! The mobile app for android is awesome, but cost an additional $29.99. This sadly is really worth the extra cost because having mobile tv anywhere at anytime is a nice reward.",

The only problem is that it doesn't work very well in 3G networks - 4G and wifi work flawlessly.",

I called warranty service, and they will replace it with either a new or used unit. I have to say that the prospect of getting a used replacement unit is not very comforting. If a new unit fails within 4 months, how long should I expect that my next unit (possibly used) will last? It would be my view that they should either (i) replace the broken machine with a new one; and/or (ii) offer to extend the warranty for a year (especially if they send me a used unit). I hope that someone is paying attention.",

In the states, I am able to watch my tv while traveling. I would recommend it highly.",
