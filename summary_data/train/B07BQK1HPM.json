The one strap is supportive enough for a large chest, and the backside offers solid coverage, without aging you :) Also, and MOST importantly, the suit is lined with something magical, that makes your tummy look amazing (even after 2 babies)!

The shoulder was a little tight but after wearing it a few times I didn\u2019t notice it anymore. The 12 fit great but I felt little tummy support which is why I kept the 10 instead. I ordered the black floral and a dark green solid and found the floral much more flattering than I thought it would be. I love this suit and will keep my eye on it yearly for more colors/patterns!",

If I had gotten my normal size the fit would have been off. The rouging in the front makes your tummy look flat and the bottom has great coverage. The top also keeps the girls in. I would totally recommend this to anyone. I have gotten lots of compliments too. I'm thinking about getting another.",

The booty cut came up a little too high on the thigh/legs to make it fit. I think this suit would have fit perfectly if I were about 2-3\" shorter. :( Going to have to find a longer torso suit.",

      "text": "This swimsuit is gorgeous! The style is flattering, the color is vibrant, and the fabric is thick and excellent quality. My only complaint is that it runs a little small in the torso. I ordered one size up from my normal and while it will work, I think 2 sizes up would have been more comfortable. Overall, though, I feel like this swimsuit checks all the boxes for me, and I definitely recommend it.",
