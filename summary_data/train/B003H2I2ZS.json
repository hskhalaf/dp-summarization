If it would not have been that problem I would have kept the chair. I let it air out for a week thinking it would be okay and threw the Box away. Remember must return Amazon products in a box.

It is kind of sticky, and you have to go back and forth a bit to get it how you want it. It is not as comfortable as I had hoped.",

      "text": "Arrived before it said it would. Went together pretty easy if you didn't have a two year old and two dogs helping you. Comfortable yet there could be more padding in the seat area. You can feel the motorized things thru the fabric and if they don't stop in a convenient place it makes for uncomfortable sitting. Other than that it is a great chair.",

It is pretty involved to put the furniture together. Be warned, the foot rest doesn't make the greatest additional seat due to the rounded massage pieces you can feel. If that isn't your intention, you won't have any issues.",

I would not recommend this item for larger individuals im about 170 and it is comfortable for me but if you weughed much more the padding probably wouldn't be ideal. I dont really use the massage features but i do enjoy the heater on my lower back. The massage features seem more like just vibrating not really like a true massaging chair. For me this was perfect I just needed a chair that wasn't to nice due to a fair amount of construction in my new home.",

After 3 months the padding flattened so much that it does not cushion the back bar of the chair which sticks out (I am 5'5, 140 lbs and use the chair approx 5 hours a night) I have to use pillows on it to sit otherwise its very uncomfortable. The stool's bolts' holes were about an inch off from the correct spot to be drilled so I had to drill the holes myself.",

We did have to retighten the base a couple times but besides that, still happy with the purchase.",
