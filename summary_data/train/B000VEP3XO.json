I installed without reading any instructions; just need to turn both units on, increase the volume on the receiving unit and hit a not particularly obvious \"connect\" button on the receiving unit.",

      "text": "Interference is a constant concern -- loud static/pops after only a few minutes of use. The connection between the transmitter and receiver often fails to establish after repeated resets, or turns off after a minute of use. The distribution of sound is erratic and unbalanced. It seems not to properly interpret DTS and Dolby stereo encoding. Not since initial setup have I been able to watch an entire movie without disconnection, extremely loud interference, inconsistent sound levels, or just deciding to turn it off because it was so disruptive. Sonus appears to provide a workable and affordable alternative at much higher fidelity and quality.",
