It appears Salomon must of had a QA/QC problem with their adhesives as the sole detached for the uppers. I will give them another chance and order another pair with the thought their QA/QC was off the day the defective pair was made. Very disappointed and surprised such a proven manufacturer of quality shoes allowed this batch to be shipped to the consumers.",

Can't use a heavy weight sock. They look good too, for what's it worth. I'd use these for wet Summer hikes, but perhaps would find maybe a lighter Gore-tex shoe for the Summer as these are lightly insulated, which we wouldn't really need for the Summer.",

Hot while working indoors and the size is a little tighter than most shoes but not to the point to were it's too uncomfortable. I would get a half of size larger next time and seems most other reviews agree. Easy lacing up and removing witch is a plus. Half a size bigger and a cooler day outside and it would be the perfect shoe :) \"Excellent cool wet/dry weather hiking shoe!\"",
