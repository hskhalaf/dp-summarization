      "text": "This camera was bought as an upgrade for my old dsc-w55. The specs seemed good at 14 mp and 7x zoom. I didn't really want the panoramic feature but it seemed an interesting feature. First thing you notice is that the construction is cheap and plasticky. It is light, but in a bad way. It's also very slow; many times I missed the shot I was going for because the time between pressing the button and a picture being taken is so long. Add to that a strange mechanical noise that the camera makes while adjusting (which is constant in video mode) and you have a BAD camera. I will never buy sony again.",

CONS 1) During video recording, the zooming mechanism creates a sound that then becomes part of the video. BEWARE!!! If you are planning to record videos of yourself talking, avoid this camera. The place that you are video recording has to have a lot of noise so the zooming mechanism sound won't come out in the video.",

There's also awe-inspiring 243-degree sweep panorama mode and 720p HD movies. For displaying pictures in breathtaking HD, use the built-in HDMI output.I cetainly recommend this camera to everyone.",

Stick with the sony DSC w330. it is sleek, lightweight and gets quick pictures with long battery life. The quality of the pictures is not getting any better. I have 8 out of every 10 shots that is out of focus. I have to request my objects to keep still otherwise, picture will be blurred when processed. This will soon be a piece of junk in my closet.",

Since when is a camera sold without a memory card? Even a sample memory card which allows only a few photos would be a great thing. As it is, I have been sick & can't get out to purchase a memory stick so I have no idea if the camera even works. I will be glad to revise the review at such time when I can actually use the camera.",

    "title": "Sony DSC-W370 14.1MP Digital Camera with 7x Wide Angle Zoom with Optical Steady Shot Image Stabilization and 3.0 inch LCD (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverThe DSC-W370 captures breathtaking panoramic images with Sweep Panorama mode. SteadyShot\u2122 Image Stabilization reduces blur while a large 3.0\u201d LCD screen makes taking and reviewing images easy. Plus, iAuto mode makes capturing scenes in a variety of elements a breeze and 720p Movie and HDMI\u2122 output make recording and playing back HD videos is a snap.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Cyber-shot DSC-W370 captures breathtaking panoramic images with Sweep Panorama mode. SteadyShot Image Stabilization reduces blur while a large 3.0-inch LCD screen makes taking and reviewing images easy. Plus, iAuto mode makes capturing scenes in a variety of elements a breeze and 720p Movie and HDMI output make recording and playing back HD videos is a snap. \n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-W370 Highlights \n\n14.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor\nA powerful 14.1-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 14.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19-inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. \n\n\n\nThe DSC-W370 features a 3-inch LCD Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 7x Optical Zoom\nThe professional-quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 7x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for great outdoor, sports, and travel photos. \n\n3.0-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\nGenerous 3.0-inch (230K pixels) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight. \n\nSelf-Portrait Timer\nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture. \n\nSweep Panorama mode\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra-wide options, the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 243 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep. \n\n\n\nHD MP4 Movie Mode\nMP4 is a popular format for high definition video that compresses the size of your audio and video, making your media files small enough to easily transfer to your compatible PC or Mac. MP4 is also highly compatible with the Web, so you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo or video-sharing Web sites like Photobucket or YouTube. (Compatible PC with internet capability required). \n\nIntelligent Auto (iAuto) mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, and faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clearer images, faces with more natural skin tone, and less blur. By incorporating advanced features such as Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, iAuto mode lets you take advantage of the latest Sony Cyber-shot technology without leaving auto mode. Whether you're shooting landscapes, capturing a beautiful flower, or taking pictures at an in-door birthday party or wedding shower, iAuto mode will optimize your camera's settings to help ensure you come away with a great shot. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape, and Macro. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. \n\nAnti-blink Function\nIt's frustrating to think you've captured that perfect shot, only to review it later and discover one of your subjects blinked just as you pressed the shutter. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nFace Detection helps focus on the subject Face Detection technology\nSony's Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. \n\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. \n\nScene modes\nThe DSC-W370 features 10 convenient scene modes: High Sensitivity, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Soft Snap, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Fireworks, Gourmet, Pet. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\nPHOTOMUSIC\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish). Select from pre-loaded tracks on the camera or transfer your own from your compatible computer (sold separately). \n\nViewing modes\nFind your photos using the simple folder or calendar viewing modes. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions \n\n\n\nPhotoTV HD\nBring your photos to life and enjoy highly detailed, high definition images with PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTVs. PhotoTV HD fine tunes settings on your PhotoTV HD enabled BRAVIA HDTV, such as sharpness, gradation, and color to display images that look more like printed images. \n\nLithium-ion battery\nIncluded lithium-ion battery provides added convenience with longer lasting power than alkaline batteries. \n\nMedia card slot \nFor convenient storage and sharing of your images, the DSC-W370 accepts Memory Stick Duo/Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo media (sold separately). \n\nSD Card Functionality\nSony SD memory cards are the perfect solution for storing and sharing your digital content such as high-quality photos, videos, music, and more. \n\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.02\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites. \n\nIncludes Sony PMBP (Picture Motion Browser Portable) software\nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable software the DSC-W370 makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites without the need for any additional software or install.",
