The cloth-surfaced toy feels like it's packed with catnip from end to end, quite a difference from smaller toys that are mostly stuffing (or the cheap ones that only have a catnip pouch). If you've never seen a catnip-loving cat react to a fresh, intense new catnip toy (like this one) coming out of the wrapper with a burst of aroma, you owe it to yourself and kitty alike. This isn't the cheapest toy, but even just my black cat's (pictured) first ten minutes with this banana was worth the price. Recommended.",

      "text": "I woke up this morning, having forgotten to open a package that got delivered the day before. I put it in the house on a table before going to bed. The cats opened the box themselves. I saw this when I went into my office (I work from home). The banana was still in the plastic package, but with holes all over. I threw the banana outside the office and Sweet Pea (a.k.a. Sweepy) starting bunny-kicking it. Then Sam decided he wanted a hit, and they play-fought for it. Our other cat, a Mackerel Orange Tabby, was already sacked out on the bed. Cats have a great sense of smell.",

I'm very particular about his toys and these are Made in USA and filled with potent 100% organic catnip inside natural cotton fabric with safe naturally derived dyes. Personally I like the bananas the best because he sometimes falls asleep with them under his chin and they are the perfect shape for a kitty chin rest.",

The only caveat is for some reason, our Golden Retriever thinks it is for him so we put it back in the zip-loc bag it came in and give it to her the next day.",
