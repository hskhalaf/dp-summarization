Resetting both devices is a very temporary fix. Customer support is nice, but not useful in resolving the technical issues. I was told this was a known issue but given no resolution. I hope they figure this out because I really like the concept. I hope to update with good news!",

However, I think it's rather silly having to pay both TiVo and Netflix to watch streamed shows. Additionally, TiVo should offer some sort of \"household\" subscription model, for those with multiple OTA DVR devices, in one location. Cable companies have long offered this sort of billing option. TiVo charges you the full subscription, for each DVR, in a single household.",
