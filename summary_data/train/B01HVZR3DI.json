I've used it to finish pork chops, pork loin, various cuts of beef (including roasts) as well as salmon. Although it takes a few extra minutes to finish a large cut of meat - the end result is worth the patience. Best part - I can do this inside my kitchen and not smoke up the entire house, unlike when finishing steaks on a cast-iron skillet.",
