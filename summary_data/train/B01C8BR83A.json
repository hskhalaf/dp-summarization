I have been against miralax- we've tried prunes, flax, high fiber diet with plenty of water and nothing helped. He was holding poop in, bleeding- traumatized everytime he had to go. Awful for everyone. We have been using this for almost two weeks and what a difference!! If you are at your wits end and thinking of miralax- try this first",

None of the natural remedies worked (prunes, etc) and she would regularly go for 10 days without pooping. This would only come to an end after 3 days of Miralax and then 4 FULL DIAPERS back to back. So sad and frustrating to deal with. Well.. my trouble are over, people! One packet of this in her morning water bottle today and she pooped right after lunch! (What?! So shocked!) While this isn\u2019t the all natural remedy I was hoping for, I\u2019ll definitely take it over the Miralax any day!",
