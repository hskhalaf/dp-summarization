If you are replacing a sink, make sure it fits the existing cutout. If the cabinet allows, you may be able to install a larger sink by expanding the cutout. If your are planning on undermounting your sink, you need to measure your cabinet from inside edge to inside edge and subtract 3 to 4 inches from its overall size. This measurement is the largest sink that will fit into that sink base.",

No, this sink has a stainless strainer basket that's 2.5\" wide and 1.75\" deep, which really makes a difference in the water flow through the drain. The old style clogs too fast, but not this one. And it's super easy to empty and clean. These are good sinks.",

My only complaint is the sink does not slant to the middle so the water doesn't run towards the drain. Thus, I have to scoop the food/water in the sink with my hand towards the drain. But overall very good purchase for the money!! Thumbs up!",
