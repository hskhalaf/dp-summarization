      "text": "In a market dominated by ever-more-powerful phones and electronics, simplicity is a definite plus. And, while just about any smartphone can do the job of any MP3 player, having a dedicated MP3 player definitely simplifies what you need to have with you, say, at the gym. SanDisk's Sansa player series is an excellent MP3 player, at an excellent price, and with a form factor roughly 1/6th that of my smartphone, making it far easier to carry and maintain while doing weightlifting at the gym. I have this MP3 player attached to the brim of a boonie hat, with some basic earbuds wove through the loops around the base of the boonie hat for cord management.",

Will never lose the orange player in my purse either! Would highly recommend it! Excellent sound quality and value for the price.",

As a matter of fact, I tried to install the Rhapsody disc...and got it stuck in my disc-drive,forcing me to have the disc-drive replaced. I have contacted SanDisk and asked them to remove the Rhapsody disc from future packaging. Ignore the Rhapsody disc and everything will be fine !!!!",

This makes the Clip Zip very frustrating to use. 2. It sometimes (okay, lots of times) skips forward multiple songs from just one keypress. Sometimes, skipping forward does nothing at all. 3. The sansa updater software is incredibly annoying. It pops up a lot, has all sorts of pointless warnings, and won't close. I have to go into task manager to manually kill its process. I also own a Clip+, and that Clip+ is far superior. I still use the Clip+, never the Clip Zip.",

Hers has lasted a number of years (she has a previous version) and survived a few drops well. She power walks with the clip and it stays on well. Dad also loves the durability, the simplicity of the interface, and the small size for travel. I purchased for around $35 and have found them an incredible value for the price.

You quickly will understand why. Basically unless you are an electronics technician, or just someone who loves to work with soldering,mini-screwdrivers and such, you will soon find the the ONLY choice you will have is to replace the Sansa Clip.

No need to fiddle with annoying programs just to use it, either--drag and drop works great. However, the blue is not very...blue. It's almost a purpleish blue. But, hey...it's a great player. So who cares? I love this thing. It also happens to charge with the same kind of USB cord that my phone uses.... So it's easier to keep up with! Bonus! (It's a very easy-to-find size.)",

This is within 4 months of owning both devices. When my Sansa was working, it was a champ and was a great little device.

Pros: Small Lightweight Cheap (but you get what you pay for) Bottom Line: I bought an iPod because I wasn't happy with this MP3 Player. Kind of a waste of money. I use it as my backup, but not my main one. I bought it because the literature said the battery life lasts 15 hours. I did not find this to be true.",

The EQ is a nice touch and isn't overly technical. Audio quality is great, Sandisk has employed great DAC's for quite a while.

That problem has been described many times here in these reviews. I figured that if I sent it back, I'd get another loose connecting player, so I fixed it. I simply used a rubberband to tighten the ear phones to the earphone jack. A side benefit is that the rubberband also protects the open usb port from dust and dirt. Problem fixed. I'm enjoying my 4th audio book. So far, so good. If that jack wasn't so poorly made, I'd give the player a 5* rating (for audio books).",

      "text": "Though this product says that it is compatible with Audible audiobooks and Mac, what the product description fails to tell you is that you cannot transfer Audible books to this device from a Mac. Apparently you can transfer audiobooks to an MP3 player using iTunes (onto an iPod) or using Audible's proprietary software, which works exclusively on Windows. It's a small, but important detail, especially since I bought this product for the sole purpose of listening to audiobooks.",

The FM antenna is in the ear-bud wire. Only one ear-bud works (great sound) but not worth my time to send it back. I would like a \"loop\" on it for use with a lanyard or safety strap as it is very small and easily misplaced on my desk and in my purse.",

The controls are fairly intuitive and the print is large enough to be a help. So far, the only drawbacks have been that mp3s ripped from two of our cds wouldn't play on it - though they play on the computer and on my iPod (all the others worked) - and the need to change a default setting so it wouldn't rename folders according to some arcane idea of its own. The instructions to change from auto to MSC mode are easy to Google :)",

I am kinda embarrassed that I recommended this player to my friend because after I purchased his mine broke within a few months. Then a few months after my friend having his it also broke. Both would come on but do nothing. Mine amazon kindly replaced because it was still under the return time. Unfortunately my friend is out his money because his broke right after.",

      "text": "The SanDisk Sansa Clip music player (plays all kinds of file types) is a compact (~1.5 X 3 inch) masterpiece! Navigation on the bright little screen is well-thought-out and intuitive. Battery life is truly ~ five hours or more - depending on play volume, I suppose. Loading the SanDisk was fun. You can either load out of Media Player, or - when you plug in the player via the supplied USB connector, a whole import utility loads up and provides for import options. In short, this is a product that works well-beyond your expectations. And this price here at Amazon is fabulous!",

Unfortunately it was no longer eligible for a return through the vendor BUT it was returnable through the manufacturer... The thing is after they replaced it I had issues with the replacement. The replacement would turn off by itself during my moderate workouts, and then the auxiliary headphone jack had a shortage in it. It wasn't my headphones because I used three different sets.",

I found listening to audiobooks on the kindle very clumsy and awkward. I discovered this Sansa clip player based on a recommendation made by another audiobook enthusiast. Very nice form factor, simple to use, great bargain for its price. Battery doesn't last as long as the kindle, about 2-3 hrs of play time, but expected given its form factor. Also I couldn't get my audibles windows app software to transfer my audio files over, but Win 7 MS media player had no problems. Audible.com needs to update their ancient windows app, it's really outdated.",
