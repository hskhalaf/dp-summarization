The quality of the garment is fine but like most 'one-size-fits-most' items, being taller means it won't fit. I'm 6'2\" and ~180lbs and the Large size I got is way too wide but not long enough. One other issue is that, unlike most onesies, this doesn't button all the way down. So if you have to use the restroom you basically have to take it completely off. Good costume/joke item but not something you'd want to comfortably lounge around in.",
