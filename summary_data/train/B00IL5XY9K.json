It would be better to spring for a used older version from Ebay or a garage sale than to buy a new, cheapo version. Maybe they want to nudge you to get the turntable edition (which is very handy), since it is so much more expensive.",

I elected to save my hard-earned dollars & buy the $14 model here. I couldn't be happier. Board is reasonable quality; wood letters are sunken & embossed; plastic shelves are reasonable quality.

I'm a bit spastic when it comes to board games and if you even bump the board you'll have letters all over the place. So if you're like me, get the other version.",
