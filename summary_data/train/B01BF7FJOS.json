I purchased 2 first one was missing strand of beads here and there, 2nd shade missing lots of strands of beads some missing 2 strands right next to one another which made a gap in 4 different places. Mess to unpack I had styrofoam everywhere the bags had opened up and made a big mess. They are large and beautiful! Would buy again!",
