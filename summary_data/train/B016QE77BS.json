The size 11 fits great in length. It doesn't rub my ankles. But the connection where the sides connect to the toe is oddly tight. I wouldn't recommend these at all for someone with a wide ball/toe pad (?) and definitely not with bunions or any other toe issues at the widest part of the foot. I don't have any foot problems so I still wear them and they aren't too uncomfortable. I would just expect more from a soft sneaker made of essentially a sweatshirt.",

    "title": "Reebok Women's Skyscape Runaround 2.0 Walking Shoe",
    "description": "If you need a simple shoe to keep you comfortable all day, this Reebok skyscape runaround 2.0 is a good fit. The upper material is soft and shapes to your foot. The 3D ultralite bottom is super cushiony and lightweight. Plus, this shoe is completely washable.\n\nReebok was founded for one of the best reasons possible: athletes wanted to run faster. So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them. By 1895, he was in business making shoes by hand for top runners; and before long his fledgling company, J.W. Foster and Sons, developed an international clientele of distinguished athletes.",
