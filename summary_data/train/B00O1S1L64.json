Otherwise, they're comfortable for even extended training sessions, are easy to don and doff, and have held up well after 10 weeks of heavy, several times a week training.",

They are light, they are created and coated well with great materials, they a comfortable, they do not obstruct movement in any way and they not only cover the shin but also the sides of the leg. However, I have to give them 4 stars because the bottom wrap scratches your ankle skin pretty badly when sparring. I DO recommend these shingguards if you have the money for them but my advice is not to wear them without ankle guards/protectors or your skin will be damaged badly when sparring. Other than that these shinguards are high quality stuff.",

I do not bruise anymore on my shins nor are the sore after a session....But two faults of these shin guards is they slide to the side when I kick and I have to constantly tug them back into place before I can kick again and the bottom strap that goes around your upper ankle rubs really bad against the strap and I have serious friction burn from it. The straps also tend to unvelcro themselves from time to time",
