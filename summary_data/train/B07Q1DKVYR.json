      "title": "Good unit",
      "text": "Easy to set up. The physical attachment allows for placement options and holds tight. Account set up is multiple steps but not too bad. Pairs quickly and easily. Touch screen is about the same as most GPS units- occasional issues with responsiveness but nothing terrible. There is interference between my car Bluetooth and the unit. If the TomTom is on there are regular skips in car audio.",
