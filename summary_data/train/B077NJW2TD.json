The problem with most wedges is, if someone isn't aware one is in place they try to close the door and can actually break the door by pulling too hard -- these are \"squishy\" and have some give, preventing this issue entirely. The little holders are a great idea, the door stop is always on the back of the door, ready to be used when needed.",

Storing them on the back of the door when not in use is a really great feature. My wife loves the fact that they aren't in the way while vacuuming and sweeping.

In this time when the spread of COVID-19 is a big concern, it makes sense to have the door open while students file in and out so they don't all have to touch the handle. I also like that these rubber stops are precisely engineered and much less likely to chip off the veneer of the door than wood wedges.",
