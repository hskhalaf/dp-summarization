For overall audio these are great, but for situational awareness these have been giving me trouble. I'm sure experiences may vary but that has been mine so far. I'm stuck in plat right now.",

I don't chat a lot online so I don't know about the mic. I finally noticed the rubber on the plug that attaches to the controller is starting to crack. It still works, but I have wrapped in electrical tape. Just last month I used the crack as a reason to purchase the Hyperx cloud alpha and they feel even better and have an inline volume control. I didn't need them, but I really like them.",

They work well for listening to music on also. My one and only complaint is that I wish they could get louder. But the noise cancellation is surprisingly good. Definitely recommend for gaming and general entertainment purposes.",

I came to this headset from cheap Turtle-beach headphones that broke after no more than six months. This headset, while not perfect, is a much better value for me and I love it Problems-- After about 1 and a half years, the microphone stopped working. After 2 years, the right side would randomly cut out unless I twisted the cord just right These problems are small to me, especially for a relatively cheap set of headphones. They are durable as frig, they feel nice, and they're simple.",

As far as I can tell, the audio quality is great, sounds are crisp and powerful in the low and high ends. The chord comes with an adaptor and is a high quality rope like material. The mic is detachable and the ear pads are big and comfortable. I previously owned a Razer Kraken Pro V2 before this and I definitely like this headset a bit more!",

You guys should know by now thats a must for a gaming headset To give a little credit I would say the braided cable is a good selling point but then again, way too short. The build quality is awesome and it doesn't feels cheap. I will request a return option as the sound is not good, the lack of volume control COMPLETELY kills the whole deal and the cable is way to short.",

Incredibly comfortable, mic quality is pretty good, noise cancellation is surprisingly good, sound quality is probably the best I've heard at this price range. Of course, the sound and mic quality would be much better with a good set of headphones and a good mic, but that usually comes at a much higher price-tag. For the price, these things can't be beat.",
