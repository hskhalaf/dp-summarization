For me these are very neutral and compared to other similar priced IEMs I like the detail in the mid and top ends. The fit with the foam buds is flush and very comfortable in my ears for long listening. Treat with respect and hopefully you will get as much enjoyment as I have from these IEMs.",

However I have only used this for 1-2 months and the connectivity of the braided cable is already breaking up, and that's just for normal usage while walking. Quite disappointed with that as the reason of purchasing Westone was that my last earphone (Westone 1), had amazing sound and also very durable. The connectivity only begun to break after 2 years of almost daily usage, and hence why I purchased the Westone W10.",

While it certainly lacks the bass (it did tighten after 48 hours of playback music), it's definitely an amazing pair of earphones. Westone earphones have never failed to impress. I think it's my third pair (an upgrade from a more basic pair). The noise canceling bit is good as well. I use them at work and even at very low volumes, it does block out all the noise despite having an open concept office with fairly noisy colleagues. So definitely good for both quality of music for all purposes.",

The build quality of my Shure SE215s is significantly better and puts these W30s to shame. Of course, my Campfire Audio Vegas are better still. Why anyone would waste money on imitations IEMs such as these is unclear. A total waste of time and money.",

Overall I would have given it a 4 or 5 out of 5 however, one of the cables included in my package was defective and loose on the left side. It does not stick to the earphones properly and keeps disconnecting. Still considering if I should get a refund since I really like the product as a whole.",
