Which is why I chose this particular product, as it has a rectangular adhesive strip which is more then double what I saw on other products, and the clip itself is also light yet made of a rigid metal. I waited a few months before reviewing as I wanted to see if the adhesive would indeed stay adhered to my dash. No issues, and it continues to work great for my phone.",

Would recommend for that clean look because it's not bulky or splashed with a big ugly logo. Very understated.",
