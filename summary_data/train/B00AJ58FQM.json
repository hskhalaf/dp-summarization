It is hard for me to stir. I bought a 3 pack so I open all 3 jars at once, put them in my mixer and within a couple of minutes, it's perfect. Then I put 1 in the frig and 2 in the freezer for later. I don't think it spreads as easy as peanut butter but it is thicker since it doesn't have added ingredients. I usually just eat spoonfuls out of the jar so spreadability isn't a problem for me.

MUCH fresher with zero dried out areas on the bottom. I think this just might be the best value in Almond Butter now. I add a minuscule amount of Hain Sea Salt with iodine, which is also available here on Amazon. Thank you, Amazon! Thank you, Zinke Orchards! Placing another order now.",

It also has the consistency one would expect of a 100% almond product \u2014 very thick. Almonds are very dense. With grinding them down, one would expect the result to be very thick. Most jars of Zinke almond butter need to be stirred up when opened, but that is a small price to pay for a fresh, nutritious, and tasty product.

      "text": "I have enjoyed Zinke Orchards Almond Butter for the past 20 years; perhaps longer. This almond butter tastes like fresh roasted almonds. Other brands I have tasted just don't have the fresh and pure roasted almond flavor that Zinke Orchards Almond Butter does. Thank you Zinke Orchards. And thank you for working with Amazon.com. It makes it so much easier to keep this almond butter on hand.",
