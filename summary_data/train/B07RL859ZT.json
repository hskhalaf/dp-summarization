The major lack is wireless charging but with a thin case and an \"add on\" wireless charger this can be overcome. Cut a slot in the case and then plug the USB connector in as shown in picture. One then has to use a wireless method for getting pictures off the device as the USB socket is taken up. Really should be 5 star rating given the price but I am being mean because of the fiddling about to get it to work as I like.",
