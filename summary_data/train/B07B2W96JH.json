That said, I would suggest to the manufacturer that instead of including a ridiculous amount of accessories, to put some more effort into the camera. It's better the buyer be responsible to getting their own accessories than wasting so much plastic for a junk product.",

I was also impressed on the ease of setting up the camera app which allowed me to easily control the camera. I haven't been able to test out the waterproof feature yet but the casing looks very capable so I'm anxious to try it out. This unit also comes with tons of adapters that I haven't been able to determine how I want to use them yet but can connect this camera to about anything. For this price point this is a great addition to my other cameras!",

The one complaint I have (hence the rating) is that the waterproof case clasp is designed poorly and failed after only two uses. The case itself seems sturdy enough and the buttons all work appropriately but the small metal tab attached to the clasp failed. You can buy a replacement waterproof box for around 10$ so I might do that or maybe just go ahead and get the GO PRO.",

If you lock it down so the application only has access when the app is running, the app simply won't run, and will tell you to re-enable the permissions.

He loves the remote to be able to start recording. We didn't want to spend a ton of money on a go pro and now he loves it so much he wants more. Only thing he couldn't figure out was how to get it to record with voice as it wasn't set up. However I figured it out in about 30 seconds. You have to change the settings with the buttons on the camera itself. Really like that this one came with batteries and charger as most don't.",

I bought it also because I thought about using the remote control feature to take pictures but I'm not going to use it for pictures, only for video. I read other reviews so I knew battery life was not the best, not an issue with that. Each small battery lasts enough for me.",

I was disappointed with the case breaking but with this kind of customer service, it is worthy of a 5 star. Video is decent but struggles in low light. Biggest problem is the plastic on the waterproof housing (and non-waterproof housing) cracked and has rendered the device useless since it cannot be mounted in it's case anymore. Purchased just over a year ago and in the process of contacting customer service. We'll see how this goes.",

Some of the buttons are in odd places which makes is awkward to take photos without pushing other buttons. It is a very basic camera. Overall, I am happy with it.",
