For the smallest whisk, that caused all of the metal wires/tines fell out. The mid-sized whisk is still hanging on, but barely. Each time I use it, I have to push the handle back on, but it doesn\u2019t go back on all the way. I love Amazon and have been happy with most AmazonBasics products I\u2019ve purchased, but maybe hand-wash these. I wouldn\u2019t purchase these again.",

      "text": "The whisk seems well constructed. However, the unique shape of the handle actually feels uncomfortable in my hand. It felt awkward holding these whisks with a light grip for quick, rapid whisking (think of holding these like holding a pencil, doesn't work). For heavy-duty whisking where you need a solid overhand or underhand grip, these whisk handles are ideal. That said, the texture of the handle feels nice. If these whisks were made with straight handle instead, I will most likely keep them and use them a lot. Unfortunately, I disliked them the moment I held them in my hand and wanted to return them rather than suffer countless inevitable hand cramps.",
