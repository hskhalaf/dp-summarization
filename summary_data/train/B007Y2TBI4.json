I was worried about some types reviewed as hard plastic as noisy but that\u2019s not an issue with these. Planning on getting another set to have a few more tumbling around.

I am not sure how they do it, but somehow they actually help dry the clothes.

As most know, small loads don't dry well, as the clothes get bunched up against the edge of the dryer drum and just get spun around in the same place, without actually tumbling. That requires much longer drying time and the clothes come out all wrinkled. These balls bounce around, constantly knocking pieces of clothes out of this \"stuck\" position and forcing them to tumble. This results in faster drying time and significantly fewer/smaller wrinkles (almost none). Totally worth it. Will update this review if they ever split in half as others have mentioned.",
