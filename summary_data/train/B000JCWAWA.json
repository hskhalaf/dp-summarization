      "text": "These wear out. All treat bags wear out. If you use them day-in and day-out, you need to plan to replace your working bag every 4-6 months. This is my experience, based on 10 years of serious training with Border Collies, at least two hours a day. If you want the hinges to last longer, put vaseline, or a little vegetable oil, on them once a week--this keeps the bag opening and closing smoothly and helps the hinges last. But you will still need to buy a new one every six months or so.",

This bag is what I wore for months while he learned his basic commands. I had poop bags, chapstick, house key, clicker, dry treats, and wet treats in this bag. TIP: Use a small ziplock bag inside the large pocket for wet snacks like deli meat and cheese. It prevents the bag from getting wet and gross. Also: end runs from your grocery store deli counter can be diced up into teeny crumbles fro training and are a MUCH safer choice than prepackaged treats. Salami and cheese are my dogs currency.",

It attaches nicely to a belt (or you can use the belt strap that comes with it) leaving your hands free to manage the leash and work on hand signals. The metal frame at the top expands the pouch to make getting access to treats so much easier during training, and the extra front pouch is convenient for storing poo bags or a clicker. We lost our first one and I used a different kind that was smaller and that didn't have the structural support that this one had. Now that we have another puppy and are back in training classes, I ordered a second one of these.",

The different pockets within the pouch make it easy to separate treats if you desire. For us, we keep the higher value meat treats in a different area when we are working on things like \"drop it\" and \"leave it.\" It makes it very simple to offer the less exciting dry kibble/treat mix as the initial offering then reward with the more alluring treat. The waist band has a lot of range which makes it great for human puppy parents of all sizes. I would absolutely buy this again.",
