Seems to have everything I want with the ability to control with my iPhone via Airplay and remote app. If you're having issues it is most likely user error or a setting that needs to be tweaked on your TV, network or streaming device. My favorite features are that it automatically turns on when I airplay to it and the ability to easily switch between ATV, Chromecast, etc. It'd earn 5-stars if it had a built-in digital TV converter as there's no co-axial option for me to plug antennae cable into. Otherwise it has been great!",

I can't even turn the sound up all the way, I get about 75% and it's super loud, crisp, and clear!

The Yamaha AV Controller App works with Apple\u00ae and Android\u2122 devices and provides simple yet powerful network control. Enjoy your new receiver with CINEMA DSP 3D, which offers an enveloping home theater experience.

With included futuristic technologies like Ultra HD (4K) pass-through and ECO mode, the RX-V575 puts the power in your hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nTOTAL PURITY CONCEPT FOR THE FINEST SOUND QUALITY\nThe Total Purity Concept, which Yamaha has been cultivating for many years, encompasses high drive amp technology, high purity pre-amplification, anti-vibration technology and independent pure power supplies. All models have a fully discrete power amplifier that helps to minimize distortion. They also adopt independent pure power supplies, allowing dedicated power supplies for the analog and digital circuitry to prevent digital noise from affecting analog circuitry. The anti-vibration heatsinks are designed to suppress vibration from transistors and sound pressure. Independent power supplies for the DACs are designed to further eliminate noise on certain models. Down to every detail, these AV receivers are designed with full emphasis on the highest possible sound quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a larger imageEXTENSIVE AUDIO CODEC AND FORMAT SUPPORT\nThis AV receiver is compatible with many audio formats such as Dolby\u00ae TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio\u2122. They are also compatible with FLAC/WAV 192 kHz playback. You will enjoy excellent Blu-ray Disc\u2122 sound quality and other types of high resolution sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCRETE AMP CONFIGURATION FOR HIGH SOUND QUALITY\nThis AV receiver was designed with a strong focus on achieving exceptionally high sound clarity. It employs a discrete amp configuration and a low jitter PLL circuit, which contribute to its excellent audio performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a larger imageULTRA HD (4K) PASS-THROUGH FOR NEXT GENERATION SUPER HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES\nThis AV receiver provides advanced HDMI features including Ultra HD (4K) pass-through. Ultra HD (4K) refers to four times the resolution of a 1080p display. While not yet available, Ultra HD (4K) displays and sources are sure to become popular in the future. This receiver is capable of passing the Ultra HD (4K) data from the source to the display for image clarity far beyond present standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI\u00ae WITH 3D AND AUDIO RETURN CHANNEL\n3D means the receiver can handle 3D signal data. The Audio Return Channel function enables data to be sent and received via the same HDMI cable so you can hear the sound from the TV via a single HDMI cable with no need for an extra optical cable.\n\n\n\n\n\nZONE B OUTPUT PROVIDES 2-CHANNEL SOUND IN A SECOND ROOM\nZone B output capability allows the receiver to send 2-channel sound to a second zone, so the main zone now has 5-channel output. This means that users can enjoy stereo sound in a second room. The same source will play in both zones (cannot use two sources).\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE FOR ONE-TOUCH START\nPressing a SCENE button powers on the AV receiver and selects the input source and DSP mode. You can reset the buttons for different sources by selecting a source and DSP mode then pressing a SCENE button for more than three seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI CEC FOR EASY OPERATION\nAnother benefit of HDMI is the availability of CEC functionality. When the unit is connected to a CEC compatible TV, it will turn on and off together with the TV and you can use the TV remote to control the volume. CEC also provides advanced functionality with other components. For example, you can use the receiver's remote unit to control player functions like skip and stop.\n\n*All connected devices must be HDMI CEC compatible. Some CEC compatible TVs/players may not work.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a larger imageNETWORK FUNCTIONS\nThis AV receiver provides a variety of network functions that enable you to access more sources and also enhance operation. You can connect the receiver to a PC to enjoy Internet radio, Pandora\u00ae and operate your system via WebBrowser Control.

This makes it easy to enjoy music from your mobile devices or computer on your home theater system. You can use view metadata such as song title, artist name as well as album art* via the AV receiver's on-screen display.\n\n*Some models don't support album art display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAV CONTROLLER APP FOR EASY, CONVENIENT OPERATION\nThis AV receiver lets you use the Yamaha AV Controller App that is downloadable from the iTunes App Store or Google Play to control power on/off and volume, select input and DSP modes and operate other functions from an iPhone\u00ae or Android devices.

HD Audio format decoding lets you enjoy HD Audio sources. Virtual Presence Speaker delivers 3-dimensional sound without actual use of presence speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPRESSED MUSIC ENHANCER\nWhen music is encoded into a digitally compressed format like MP3, the frequency response suffers. Yamaha's Compressed Music Enhancer employs sophisticated digital signal processing using exclusive algorithms to restore what was lost, so the music always sounds the way it should.\n\n\n\n\n\nADAPTIVE DRC (DYNAMIC RANGE CONTROL)\nAdaptive DRC automatically adjusts the dynamic range of the sound according to the volume level. This ensures that you hear clear dialogue and vocals and all sound effects at comfortable levels. There is no need to adjust the volume level as you listen; everything from whispers to big explosions will be heard clearly and comfortably at the same volume setting. It also tones down loud TV commercials and is ideal for low-volume, late-night listening when you do not want to disturb others.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for a larger imageSUBWOOFER TRIM FOR IMPROVED SOUND IMAGING\nThe Subwoofer Trim Control enhances the low frequencies by avoiding overlap with the front speaker output.
