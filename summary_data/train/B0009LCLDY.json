(no, not my foot :-). The right shoe is just poorly made. Since I had worn them, I felt I couldn't return. I will be much more careful next time. Will examine closely upon arrival. You should do the same.",

Mephisto lasts are great for my feet. I am a firm Mephisto consumer, having purchased my first pair of \"walking shoes\" 30 years ago (and several pairs of walking shoes, cap toes, boat shoes, sandals & GoreTex boots since). The shoes are well constructed, provide good rough service over time, and can be re-soled through the mail. Recommended.",

I'm sure this is an anomalous situation and doesn't reflect the general quality of Mephisto shoes. However, it did happen. Amazon response was extraordinary, volunteered to take back these shoes and replace them, even sent a URL to create a shipping doc. Just great.",
