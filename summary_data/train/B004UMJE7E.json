Been buying it ever since (over 3 years now) because it's such high quality, but first time buying on Amazon. This bag was nice and pliable, easy to break or tear into pieces. I've bought some bags locally that were way too tough and very difficult to break and it didn't look like it was easy to chew either. I have small dogs so they need smaller pieces. Will buy again ... unless you raise the prices like crazy so please don't do that.",
