I couldn't even move the string when it was set to 70lbs. I had to crank it down a few turns. I'm going with the SAS Scorpii 55 # compound bow instead. sorry. good luck.",

You will need to buy a release, i also suggest buying the following; sights, arrow rest, and a quiver. With that set up, you will be on your way to becoming a competent archer.",
