I even bought their fuel to make sure the oil ratio was perfect! Good luck getting someone from the company to help you! You can only email or message them and maybe they will get back to you in a few days if you're lucky! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one!! I have folded it in half so it fits into the garbage pail better. That's where it belongs!!!!!!!!",

My unit will not start unless I pull the throttle trigger. I do not know if my unit is one of, but I would hope that Husqvarna addresses this situation. All of the above being stated, this unit, so far, is far superior to the Ryobi it replaces. Relatively light weight. Once I studied the cartoon closely, I decided that I like the way the trimmer line is loaded to the unit. One needs to be sure that the cartoon explaining the loading feature is clearly understood.",
