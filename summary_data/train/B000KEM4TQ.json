I wanted to disassemble (it appears you can) and drill some holes in the plastic base to avert this....But I couldn't pull the glass out.

It does not but it does sweat and leave water on the table beneath it. Solution: just set it on a few towel. Good product. Would buy again or recommend.",

You just dump the grounds in the trash, rinse the rest out, and bam it's good to go. I bought my dad the same exact french press and he also loves it. He uses it more than his expresso machine at this point.",

On the other hand the screen has lasted much longer than I expected. It works well, but if you get grounds between the beaker and plastic base, you have to take it apart. There was a LOT of spring in this plastic handle. In about a dozen disassembly/assembly cleaning, the beaker broke. It was cheaper to buy another complete press than a new beaker. The new one is exactly the same, but takes much less effort to assemble.",

I got out the parts from the Mr. Coffee and that part is actually metal and it was a perfect fit. Originally I thought these were all basically the same but found out NOT.

The 3-part stainless steel plunger has a fine mesh filter, which allows for a premium extraction of your coffee's aromatic oils and subtle flavors.
