      "text": "Bought these to cut up a 16' steel garage door into smaller chunks that would fit in my vehicle for recycling. I took it apart first, so there wasn't anything much deeper than 1\" cut. Used my 30-year-old Craftsman saw, not worm-drive. Did a good job with a steady feed, it only slowed down when I got a bind in the kerf. Took about an hour to take everything apart and cut it up. Used up about 1/2 of one blade. Wore long sleeves and eye protection, sparks were flying. I got about the same amount for the scrap as I did buying the blades, which is an argument for a bigger vehicle, I guess.",

The blades did well and lasted about as long as I would have expected.",

They are extremely loud but leave a very clean cut. These are attached to a basic skill saw I purchased from Home Depot. Wear glasses!",
