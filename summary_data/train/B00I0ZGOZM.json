We have hard water where I am and there was a ton of crud and calcium build-up that the old valve started to leak. When I saw this kit came with the same adapter I spent the extra $20 on a dual shut-off valve that has a 1/4-in OD compression fitting. It is a SharkBite I was able to pick it up at my local hardware store (Part# SBDS123814Z). Much cleaner install and I also picked up a T for $2. There was enough line in this kit to run to the fridge.",

The I notice the sound of water running in the sink but the water wasn't on. I called the company and we went through some simple trouble shooting steps and determined the tank had become faulty. They suggested that I leave the water off and they would ship me a new tank. I just recently got the new tank but haven't yet installed. They were quick to provide help and most friendly. I would recommend this product and company.",

It is also good as a rare rince on cactus, suculents, and anything that you want to rinse of salts. I change the filters as directed. So far about $30 a year and well worth it.
