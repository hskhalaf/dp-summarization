I tried placing it everywhere. Inside the house, on my window I got 13 channels I wouldn't watch much, if ever. When I put it outside I got 3 more channels but it look awful out there and I don't know how it would hold up. Give it a try. You may end up with 50 channels. For $20.00, it's worth it a shot.",

Some channels were clearly very high quality (HD) and a couple appeared normal definition TV,experienced no pixelating at all - this was mounted on interior wall and I will try on a window next as recommended.",
