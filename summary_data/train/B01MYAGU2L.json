Nowhere does it mention anything about a 3 oz. bottle. That, or I must have missed something. It's in small, plastic IKEA bag, which seems odd to me. Honestly I'm really surprised anyone would actually send this tiny bottle out for $24.30, which is what I paid. Definitely returning it..",

Also the scent AFTER you get out of the shower doesn't really stay on. 25.00 is alot for a bottle of body wash in my opinion but I splurged just to try this. Yes I like it but do I love it? Nah...will I be ordering again? Nah just not worth 25.00 to me. Maybeeee 15.00? Definitely not almost 30.00 bc of tax and stuff so yah idk that's just my opinion",

It makes my skin so soft and leaves it smelling fantastic for LONG time after using. It\u2019s not cheap but a bottle lasts awhile, you don\u2019t need much for a full creamy lather. It\u2019s also awesome as a shave gel! The cap is a little annoying, but I deal with it because it\u2019s a fantastic product. I just find it a little hard to flip open and snap close with one hand. If you like the scent of the Bum Bum Cream, you\u2019ll love this body wash just as much. Highly recommend it!",

I LOVE the smell of this (Sephora carries this line if you'd like to smell it in person before purchasing online) and it does linger for quite some time after a shower. I will say that this has smelled more like the lotion when I have shaken the bottle, but overall this is a great product. It lathers very nicely and it also does not take a ton of product to get a lather, so you could make this last quite some time.",

It just makes your skin super soft. There are people selling this for insane amounts of money. Just buy it from Sephora or Amazon directly.",
