The last one wore out, the rubber wheels that move the cards into the shuffler wore out. Construction is of thin plastic and needs to be handled carefully. She complains the spring lever used to start the shuffling is difficult to press down. After inspecting the lever it appears to be made of flexible plastic which allows the lever to be pressed down to activate the switch. I believe this will get easier over time and eventually wear out. If I could find a more durable shuffler at a reasonable cost I would buy it.",

After using it 6-8 times for our card games, it doesn't work on the left side at all. Tried new batteries even though they should have been still good. My husband looked at the gears and the rubber bands but can't come to a solution to make it work again. If it worked, it would be awesome for our games. Now it's too late to replace it unless Amazon decides to make a good faith judgement.",

      "text": "Springs for the battery connection are too long and bend over when you put the batteries in. Takes 4 C batteries. If you are patient and have a nail file or a knife to press the springs down while you try to work the batteries in then it works. Shuffles quickly without being a straight 1 left, 1 right melding so that after a couple shuffles the cards are well mixed. But it should not take more that a minute (several minutes) and a tool to put 4 batteries in. Hope they last a long time.",

The friend had to unscrew the darn thing and he did fix it but we are afraid to that. If he can fix ours for us, we'll keep it, if not we'll be returning. These work great when they work but perhaps the company should make sure they work prior to allowing them to be shipped. Need more quality control it seems. Thanks Carol House",
