I was sure they were just stuck in the box or wrapping or something and after checking several times \u2014 nope, just simply not here. Will be returning. What a pain.",

It sits out about 4\" from the glass but is still within the recessed area, so it's nearly invisible while still creating a barrier that the cats can't get behind. The legs make it very sturdy, and it's solid. I had no issues with damages or bad shipping, all in all this was exactly what I wanted.",
