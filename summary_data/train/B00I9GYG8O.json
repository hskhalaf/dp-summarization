Why would I want focus to be on the tree in the distance rather than what is right in front of the lens? If i can get it to focus the photos are soft and grainy. Maybe is would be a good camera for video but since I don\u2019t shoot video that is irrelevant. What a waste of money.",

I'm running a Nikon manual lens without problems. The jello effect is quite noticeable on fast pans while filming 4k, so you'll have to film around it by filming slow pans and avoid fast jerky movement, sorry Michael Bay this camera isn't for you. Kubrick? Yes. This is a killer 1080p video making machine, shoot in 4k, downscale to 1080p, color correct to your heart's content and publish!",

      "text": "Using the GH-4 inside the Underwater Housing by Nauticam. The Video in 2.7 K was amazing and The 4k was also good. 1080 allowed me to shoot at 96 frames and that was also fun. Needs Underwater lights to be sharp. Just want make sure for anyone out there thinks you can take the gh4 underwater without a housing YOU CAN'T. The GH4 is not a waterproof camera but if you insert it into the Nauticam Housing it is waterproof. Do not submerge the camera with out first putting it into a housing!",

I was upset that I didn't receive the camera, but that's not the worst part, when I went to return the item they refused to accept the return, because the camera wasn't in the box, even though I talked to an Amazon rep before I mailed it back. So be warned, if you get this through Amazon you might not get a camera, but they most certainly will charge you 1700+ for a battery",
