For some reason when I ordered the spoons as a \"3 pack\" I was sent three separate three packs of 3...was only charged the normal $4 so I'm not complaining just noting for others. We also have the forks and those came in a 3pk too - 3 forks in one package, just as expected. Very easy for my toddler to hold and manipulate and I like that you get three (kitchen, diaper bag, spare). The spoons have deep enough bowls that you can hold a good amount (some spoons very much fail here).",

Also, my son is able to grasp it comfortably well between his little fingers as he tries to feed self. Dislike- it holds food stain on rubber on the back, that protruded part that rests on surface. Doesn't matter what I use, it just won't return to the original color. Apart from that, I would recommend without reservations.",

I'd almost call it a rounded fork without prongs with how it's shaped. Using it to feed our 1 year old, he often pushed the food over the back and up the handle rather than getting it into his mouth. Even our preschooler was guilty of that a few times. There's very little dip in the middle to hold liquids like watery soup broths, so anything that's watery will be extremely messy. For things with a more pudding or oatmeal consistency, they're great. But it also depends on how sloppy your kids are.",

The spoon is very shallow so these are useless with liquid like soups or broths. I really wish they\u2019d be little narrow and deep so babies can eat without spilling or not fitting into their tiny mouths.",

I do think sometimes that they are a little too big since they can hold so much, but the trade off is that a decent amount actually makes it to his mouth because the spoon is so large. We're still in the transition phase from the really small toddler spoon to these spoons, but my son is really starting to get the hang of using these spoons. Overall I am happy with these spoons and I think they will work well at helping him to eventually transition to adult spoons.",

The handle is a very good size for toddler hands, is easy to control, and is a good length too. It is somewhat soft, soft enough to bite and make a mark. The 'bowl' of the spoon holds a good amount of food for a toddler's mouth. I would highly recommend this type of silverware for toddlers.",
