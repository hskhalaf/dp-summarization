However it is the right size for a small tablet or can be cut out slightly for use with large cell phone. Upgraded review to 4 stars due to the exceptional customer service I received from Powerextra ( Thank You Zoe). Will update with photos soon to show the modifications I have done to make this a great sun shade for your DJI remote.",

Cutting that also cuts the thread holding the strip on. The back is also very \"floppy\" - when it's on the remote, the sides sag down almost 1/2\" - the only thing stopping the sag is the USB connection - so most the weight of the shade is on the jack. Never a good idea. The construction is basically a thin vinyl coating on one side, flock on the other, and thin cardboard between those.",
