The sound is crisp and clear, the picture ranging from poor quality to great quality original filming remains that way but with a high quality appearance. New Blu-ray viewing is stunning. Older good quality movies such as earliest Disney movies that are not Blu-ray are sharp with deeper colors and great sound. Movies that I had taped then transferred to DVD play beautifully, again depending on the original quality.",

Owner's manual quick start instructions were simple to understand. I have had this player for about a month and watch at least one movie a week, DVD or Blu-ray. Just a great, basic disc player. I particularly enjoy the availiablity of the SD memory stick feature. The player recognizes the stick immediately and in a few seconds I am watching my photos on the TV screen. Thanks, Amazon and Panasonic!",

While some disks are scratched beyond all hope, some will play only in better quality players. I have seen two scratched rental DVDs that fail in this player (Panasonic BD45) but still play in our kids XBox 360. And that is with the most recent firmware update. Other than that, it is a great player at a very good price. It has handled all of the Blu-Ray disks we've tried very well.",

The only burp is that it seems to be sensitive to the electric baseboard heaters that are installed in my family room. The interference rendors the unit unwatchable and unlistenable. However, with the heaters off and with a blanket and an extra pair of socks on our feet the unit works very well. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the remote is cool. The limited functionality of the Blu-ray DVD Player is perfect for our needs because the TV includes the bells & whistles.",

Returning is inconvenient, so I gave to my son, who doesn't do streaming. He gave me the model that does and I love it. Usually buy Samsung products, but this was one of Amazon's incredible prices, so I didn't read the reviews or would have read it didn't. Sorry took so long to correct and even sorrier that some people, under the guise of discussion, have to personally attack.",

I called tech support, and talked with them for half an hour only for them to say my tv might not be compatible, so I returned it. So if you have a Proscan tv, I'd be careful.",

      "text": "This review is for the Panasonic DMP BD45 Blu Ray player. Beware that this DVD player is NOT compatible with Westinghouse brand TVs which is why I am giving it only one star. Although the player is reasonably, even attractively, priced, it is unreal to me that a world-renowned electronics manufacturer would sell a product that is incompatible with a certain brand of TV--especially one as well known as Westinghouse. FYI: The error code I receive when I attempt to hook up the player to the TV is \"U73\".",

    "title": "Panasonic DMP-BD45 Ultrafast-Booting Blu-ray Disc Player (Black)",
    "description": "Out of the upcoming Blu-Ray players from Panasonic, the Panasonic DMP-BD45 is the entry-level product and is the most basic model. The player has full 1080p functionality and also up-converts 480i/p and 720p formats up to 1080p. The player has also been designed and manufactured to be as power efficient and environmentally friendly as possible: it uses less power while in use, and while in standby, than previous models and has been sized smaller to save on materials. Panasonic also included PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus technology with the BD45 to recreate the same image quality that is found in original films. Up-converter - 480/720p to 1080p Audio - 5.1 compatible\n\nAMAZON.COM\nStart watching your favorite High-Definition movies almost instantly with the Panasonic DMP-BD45 Blu-ray Disc player, which features an ultra-fast 2-second boot time. It also includes a Secure Digital (SD) memory card slot, making it easy for you to view and share both digital still images and HD video recorded with an HD camcorder in the AVCHD format. \n\nOther features include compatibility with a wide variety of disc formats (including standard DVD movie discs), PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus video processing technology (learn more), Energy Star certification, and Panasonic's VIERA Link function--allowing you to operate multiple audio/video components using a single remote via HDMI. Additionally, Panasonic's lineup of 2010 BD Players are designed to reduce power consumption and also feature a slimmer, more efficient design to reduce packaging waste.\n\n \n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n * High-quality image processing via PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus technology \n * VIERA Link utilizes HDMI to enable control all VIERA Link combatable products with one remote. \n * SD memory card slot enables you to play your photos and movies taken with digital cameras and camcorders by just sliding in an SD memory card into the SD slot. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nBD Player, remote control (with batteries), power cord, operating instructions\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n\nDISC/MEDIA COMPATIBILITY\n \n\nLEARN MORE\n\n\n\nEXPERIENCE MOVIES LIKE NEVER BEFORE\nThe DMP-BD45 employs the PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus. Developed in collaboration with Panasonic Hollywood Laboratory, this high image processing technology reproduces clear, vivid colors that are faithful to the original film. Panasonic's Blu-ray Disc players employ high precision 4:4:4 signal technology, which working in tandem with PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus processes each pixel of the Blu-ray Disc video signal in the horizontal direction to compliment vertical direction processing. P4HD (Pixel Precision Progressive Processing for HD) is another technology that contributes to the superior picture quality of the Blu-ray players. P4HD processes more than 15 billion pixels per second and applies the optimal processing to every pixel.\n\nPanasonic's Blu-ray Disc players further utilize 16-level motion detection to categorize the image motion of each pixel into one of 16 levels; diagonal processing to detect diagonals and correct the pixels accordingly; 1080p up-conversion to up-convert content recorded in the 480i/p or 720p format to 1080p.\n\nThis Blu-ray Disc player also provides 1080/24p output, reproducing cinema images from a Blu-ray Disc and DVD in their original 24p form with no need for conversion--enabling you to enjoy cinema images in the same format used in cinema with a 1080/24p-compatible TV.",
