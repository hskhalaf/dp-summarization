There seemed to be a bit of noise leakage from the cups, so even with ANC on, it wasn't killing every external noise. I returned them and I suggest looking towards a more expensive pair of headphones. I am convinced you cannot have a good set of wireless ANC cans at this price. There are too many little things that need to be right! I would love to see them take the creativity required to make a pair of wireless ANC headphones @ $100 and build an industry changing set @ $200.",

Not sure why these things are still so expensive. In order to use your BackBeat Pro 2 on PCs, you'll need a Bluetooth dongle. You can use a generic BT4.x+ USB dongle or you can use the Plantronics BT600. To pair the BBP2 with BT600, do the following: Power on computer, log into Windows (no one cares about Macs) Insert the BT600 in an open USB slot Use a paperclip to press the pin hole LIGHTLY (see picture) until the BT600 flashes red/blue Turn on the BBP2 into pairing mode Wait for the paring successful message Enjoy!",

If you're trying to determine which of the expensive brands these headphones are comparable to, I'd say they're more like Beats than Bose.

I have pretty big ears so this might be a problem for everyone but the FIT IS ABSOLUTELY UNWEARABLE for more than an hour at max. It pressed on your years and my ear lobes get noticably red after an hour listening.....it's not fun. I don't hate many electronics product I've bought but I sure hate these. The sound quality is better then my $50 ath-m20x but that's not setting a very high bar. Skip these if you care for noice cancellation or glitch free software or a comfortable wear.",

I would prefer to turn them off and I can control the music manually. Lastly, when using them as a head set on phone calls the quality is terrible, the people on the other side can\u2019t hear me.

The auto pause function is bad, sometimes it randomly pauses out of no where (when i slightly turned my head). This ruined the experience for me *Updated* Got a replacement but the issues persist nonetheless. Though an usb dongle solved the issue for me.",
