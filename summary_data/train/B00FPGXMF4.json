I finally settled on 3 sets of these shelves. I'm experimenting with different configurations, the attached photo is my favorite so far. (3 sets together). Bonus: when I move, I can put them in a different arrangement as needed. A friend helped me to put these together. The first set took about 35 min. By the time we got to the 3rd set, we got them together in 20 min. They are simple enough that one person could put them together.",

We have two bulldogs that constantly shed and I wanted something very modern but functional for our lifestyle (vacuuming everyday). We went to Home Depot purchased the brackets to mount it, and my husband went to work building it! From previous reviews, I wouldn't use the wood glue because you might get confused putting the unit together, so best advice is to just wait on the glue. Good luck! We love it!",

The only reason I did not give it 5 Stars is that since the pieces are independent of each other and the finish is so smooth, they slide around a bit when they are in the horizontal position. I'm sure a small piece of rubber would stop this and might be a good idea to include in the packaging. They do include straps to drill into the wall in order to avoid \"tipping\", but that was not an option as my piece is away from the wall.",

It took my husband and I (and we are NOT generally handy people) about 45 minutes to assemble both shelves. We spent more time trying all the different configuration options to decide which one looked best in our room than we did putting the shelves together. I'm extremely pleased so far!",
