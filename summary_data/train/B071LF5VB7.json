It holds temperature well enough that it actually lowers the temperature of cans and bottles even if they're already cold. After taking out of the freezer, your first 2 or 3 drinks will be more frosty than taking them straight from the fridge or cooler.",

It works well for both cans and bottles. Some cans fit better than others though. For example, Budweiser cans are a bit tight because they are a little shorter and wider than most, while Coors light cans are taller and narrow. They all fit bit the collar might screw on harder for some.",
