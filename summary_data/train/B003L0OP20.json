The lid inside and the area on the kettle adjacent to lid accumulated quite a bit of rust in 6 months. I'm not sure why, as I had several stovetop kettles before and none of them rusted like that (even the cheap chinese noname kettle I had for a while). Maybe it has something to do with the design, because the lid leaves scratches in the kettle body when removed or placed back.",

I like the handle that moves off to the side for ease of filling. But it is the thinnest stainless steel! It is so light, it feels as if it's aluminum. The rivet attachments are cheap-looking and ugly. I cannot review how it works for heating water, as I'm returning it immediately. Not recommended whatsoever, especially at that cost.",

I wanted something that looked nice. Have always had expensive copper simplex kettles, but I'm nervous about the interior wearing down and I'm sick of polishing the exterior. This was a big leap of faith for me. That being said, there's nothing I don't like about this .... whistle works great and is a high pitched squeal that really gets your attention. Easy to fill and pour. Matches my stainless steel appliances nicely. Just wish they offered a smaller version, but it's a keeper.",

The clip that opens the spout looks safe enough but once you flip it open to pour, it rests against the handle of the tea pot. It is a very snug fit and impossible to close with your fingers, especially when it is hot. The only way to close the spout is to use a towel to protect your hands. The clip design does not allow for easy closure. It forces you to reach under the open, hot clip to close the spout cover The clip is stiff and does not return easily. I've used it several times and am going to request a return.",

We use it to make tea and heat water for oatmeal. It warms up the water fast and lets you know it is ready with the whistling sound that is loud enough to hear upstairs but not annoyingly loud (if that makes sense). It washes quickly and I love how you can move the handle to the side to fill it with water. Plus, it is so beautiful, you can leave it out on stove as it adds beauty to your kitchen. I definitely would recommend this to anyone!",

Yes, it's handle is ergonomic and it is stainless steel, so it's easy to clean, BUT those qualities are irrelevant if its spout is so poorly designed as to shoot scalding liquid out of it when you attempt to pour yourself a cup of tea? You cannot control the water flow due to the design of the spout, so as you pour water jets out onto the hand holding the cup you're trying to fill with water. This then causes you to drop it instinctively, causing more scalding spills. Just a really terrible kettle!",

      "text": "This is a horrible product. The bottom of the kettle is the same gauge metal as the sides and top which makes it flimsy. The handle is designed as such to make the pouting awkward. The top is near row which makes the inside nearly impossible to clean. The whistle is so faint that I cannot hear it. But the WORST design flaw is that when I pour the water, the spout is too narrow and the water \u201chiccups\u201d out of the spout and spews scalding water EVERYWHERE. Don\u2019t buy!",

The whistling spout lid has the same silicone so you can quickly and easily open and close it. The whistle is very efficient! The handle for the lid is some sort of plastic but it does not go through the metal, therefore is never in contact with the water in any way! I might have hesitated buying this tea kettle had I known about the lid handle not being silicone, but honestly after using it I wouldn't trade it in for any other!",

I would definitely recommend this kettle.",
