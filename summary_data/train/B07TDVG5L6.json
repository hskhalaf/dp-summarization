Plants transfer well from AeroGarden to pots. However on my second garden the light went out, support is not available by phone and has not responded to my email requests. So while I love the Garden when working, I now have well over $400 invested in one successful herb garden with no communication from the manufacturer to resolve the issue. In reading other one star reviews I now see customer service for faulty product is an ongoing issue.",

While this product is very simple to use and the odd germinate quite quickly, I can\u2019t get past how bright the lights are. I have this in my kitchen on a counter and once my lettuce is ready for harvest, I\u2019ll need to find a different room in my house to place this so that the light is not so disruptive.",

The basil (3 pods) is dominant in terms of prolific growth, followed by the chives. The mint (which in an outdoor garden is an aggressive plant) seems cowed by the other seedlings, and the thyme is rather timid, too.",
