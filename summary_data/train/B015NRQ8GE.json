Instead of drilling directly into the screen we used these screws with bands( from Home Depot) to keep pinned in. We also used cable ties for the corners to keep it from swaying back and forth from our little 1 year old shaker. This isn't budging.",

No tools, no assembly required \u2014 just open the box and set it up. The screen adds a nice depth to the face of the fireplace and \u201cdisappears\u201d when you start a fire. This screen is a great bargain for the price and was listed on one website as a top ten item based upon quality of workmanship, appearance and price. I believe it has ea4ned that distinction across the board.",

I needed something to fit well as she is a great jumper and will open cupboards and other things with her paws!

No room for her to jump over heavy enough she can't move it easily but I can and looks great with the rest of the room. Very happy and no more dirty foot prints, Yay \ud83d\ude04",
