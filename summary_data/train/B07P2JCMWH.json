      "text": "I have loved Pix Star frames over the years (had purchased around 10 so far). But this new model is designed so poorly it boggles the mind. You can no longer hang these horizontally on the wall. Indeed, they have mounting holes on the back - but they are three inches off center so there is no way to use them!! There is simply no excuse for such poor design defects. The previous generation had perfect mounting holes and screws in the back, perfectly aligned for both vertical and horizontal hanging. This \"new\" generation seemingly placed the hols in random spots ensuring there is no way to properly hang them! This is just a design flaw plain and simple.",

I went to the pix-star website to enter the serial number, but when I did, it said the ID was already registered and wouldn't let me do anything from there.

To remedy that, I purchased a nice frame and cut out the back so that I could set the digital frame inside the nice frame. (See picture)",

The only reason for the low two star rating is that the frame can only be used in a limited way with popular external photo web sites including Facebook, Instagram, and Google Photo, because of limitations imposed by these external sites. While this is not the fault of the manufacturer, I do feel the description on Amazon should inform prospective customers of these limitations. Again, other than these limitations, this is a fine product. Minor tip: replace the stock batteries on the remote. It works much better with better batteries.",

      "text": "I did my research and this was supposed to be one of the best on the market. Have to say I was disappointed in the quality of the screen/image. It definitely is nowhere near the quality you'd see on a tablet or laptop screen. I was planning to buy more if I loved it, but I do not. It's ok but for the price I would've expected higher quality screen. 5-10 years ago I'd think the screen looks pretty standard for such a device. But today it seems somewhat outdated. When you look at the quality of screen/image you get with a $49 Kindle Fire, it just seems somewhat disappointing to have your photos shown on this.",

Very easy to set up, posts the pictures automatically, and motion detection is a great thing, doesn\u2019t disturb her if she is resting. Her and her friends spend hours watching all the pictures. Has several settings as to how fast the pictures scroll, so with it on a slow (15 seconds per picture) she is able to really look at them. I have all the kids, grandkids sending pictures regularly, so she can see how they are all growing, and what they are up to.",

Filled with extras but those are just too much for my parents to operate (internet radio, viewing options...). They are happy with just seeing the pictures appear in the frame.",

Because they rotate on the frame, I don't worry if it's a great pic. We've also sent gifs. She says this is the best present I've ever bought her.
