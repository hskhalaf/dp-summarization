They're waterproof too, which my old pair sadly wasn't anymore after years of trekking and lack of care. I hope to keep these for another decade plus! I wear eight in pretty much all shoewear. This wasn't an exemption. My feet are a-typical though, running narrow except for my stupid genetic bunions (thanks mom, my grandmother, and great-grandmother). Feet don't slide around, but have space to spread in case of inevitable swelling.",

      "text": "I bought these boots shortly before a weeklong back country canoe and hiking trip in Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario, after realizing that my old boots weren't up for the trip. I didn't have a lot of time to break them in, but as it happened, I really didn't need to. The boots fit great, were super comfortable, no hot spots. The longest day was an eight hour hike over a lot of rugged, wet and muddy mountain terrain. The boots felt great all day, kept my feet dry, and provided excellent traction. I see a lot of trips in my future wearing these. They're awesome.",

      "text": "I wear an 8. I initially got a half size bigger (8.5) based on some other reviews. I tried them on with some hiking socks, but they were a little big. I didn't want my foot moving around too much and cause blisters, so I went through the easy return process. I got the second pair shipped immediately and had 30 days to return the first pair with no additional charge. They are a little clunky, but I think it is just because I am used to a hiking shoe.",

      "text": "It's okay for normal socks, but it's too small if you want to wear winter-weight socks. It's not as bad in length as it is in width, so if you have a wide foot, I'd suggest looking at a different boot. I ordered my size, but I replaced it with a size up after discovering they were too small while on the trail. Other than that, it performs well. Minimal breaking in necessary, and there weren't any hot spots out of the box.",
