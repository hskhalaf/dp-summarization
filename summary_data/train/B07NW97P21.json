      "text": "the reason the value for money is 4 stars is because you can get much cheaper versions but its still 4 stars for the oc factor that comes with it also runs super cool in vr without me having to even crank the fan speed past 55 stays around 50 degrees and its a pretty nice card to go with my rainbow rgb on white and black case aesthetic so all in all recommended buy (when the price is around 300 no more maybe less).",

Quite and cool, never gone over 62\u00b0while gaming,40\u00b0idle...fan start spinning after around 58\u00b0... If you stuck between getting this or other cheaper model i suggest don't waste your money on them and buy this without hesitation.. And if you stuck between this and 2060 make sure go for high end quality 2060 otherwise you end up with a noisy and hot gpu",

I downloaded MSi Mystic Light but it didn't seem to actually install, so I still can't control the lights, but I just haven't tried hard enough to make it work, since I've left that changing colour by itself and my other parts are synced with Asus Aura. I'm sure you'll be able to do it fine; I just haven't put the effort into finding how to do it.",
