The software can be a little tricky, technically speaking, but it does allow you to chose all sorts of pedal and cabinet options - pre-amp or post-amp as well and then save your choices into custom presets. Not as small as a lot of the personal-sized amps, but plenty small for a practice amp; relatively light weight too (for its size). Whether you want a classic sound or a overdriven death metal sound, you'll find this one to be fairly versatile. Of all the amps that I have barrowed or bought, this has quickly become my favorite.",

First and most disappointing is that Fender has discontinued support for Fuse software but is still using it in their advertising and has no suggestion that a replacement is in the works. Next is that the factory presets don\u2019t sound much like any effects you might hear on recordings. I have yet the work with customizing my own presets and w/o Fuse it may be a bit of a challenge. One tip, to play w/o effects, press the tap button while turning it on and the removes the presets which lets you use your effects pedals.",

      "text": "It was a Christmas present for my husband and he loved it! It sounds amazing and was a cheap, but great deal. The sound quality is way beyond what you would expect from an amp at this price. It comes with software that you can use to alter the sound as well as a place to plug your MP3 player to play along with songs from your playlists. As a person who did not know anything about amps this was a great value at an affordable price.",

I just love having it and other amps have been off since this one arrived. Small enough to take around for open mics without as much worry if something happens to it compared to a larger classic tube amp.",

The software seems pretty sophisticated. Apparently it can mimic any amp ever made and you can download music packs and effects. I wish they made a cellphone app for it, then he wouldn't have to keep it by his computer all the time.",
