Both of them where like this. Called the company and they do answer the phone and will warranty up to 90 days but require more prework than Amazon so returning and getting something else.",

Funny enough, once the kids were asleep, we adults had our crack at it and I think it's the gift that keeps on giving. I would completely recommend this item. Well worth the price (which isn't bad itself).",
