The drawstring it certainly a plus .When you pull the elastic cord it stays tight and is easy to adjust as you push the little button. The cap also has a really cute diva like picture on the back which makes it nice if you want to keep your cap hanging handy in the bathroom. They even provided a \"stick on\" wall hook !",
