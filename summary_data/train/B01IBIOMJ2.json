I will never trust ordering banza online again, which is unfortunate as I love this product. This is absolutely disgusting and I would like a refund.",

I tried the spaghetti and linguine version before without much success. The shells, rigatoni, penne, etc have all worked great!

My husband is usually very picky about all dairy/pasta/meat substitutes, and will devour this pasta without any complaints!",

Substitutes well for any pasta dish you might make with normal pasta. Texture is a bit grainier feeling than eating regular pasta, and it's definitely noticeable when cooking as you can see it breaking down a bit, but not enough of a difference to be a huge turn off. Flavor is a bit different as well, but again not enough to matter unless you're eating it on it's own with no sauce. As a healthier (well, relative to normal pasta) I'd highly recommend this as a go to substitute",

I love the texture, shape options, and the fact that I feel healthier when eating it compared to regular pasta. If you are still deciding whether or not to give it a try, this is a no brainer \u2014 go for it! You\u2019ll be very happy.",

It cooks to a very nice consistency - almost identical to regular pasta - and tastes great sauteed with kale or spinach, a meat of choice, and a spicy italian sauce. I don't have any allergies or intolerances but I do have friends that do and its nice to be able to share the same dish when we have them over! Keep up the good work Banza!",
