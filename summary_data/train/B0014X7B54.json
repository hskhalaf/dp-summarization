Took me about 30 mins tops removing old one and putting this in. Had I known before just how quiter this is, I would have boughten this a long time ago whether my old one burned out or not.

I bought this unit primary because I was hoping it would be less suceptible to rusting but only time will tell. (I cannot evalute that point for many years (hopefully))",

Stainless grinding chamber + composite body = corrosion resistant. We also like the removable splash guard on the EZ install model. Finally, the cord and plug are already installed, making this essentially plug-n-play. No more wrestling with 3 bolt mounts or wiring. Insinkerator has been 'resting on their laurels' for decades... Waste King is the new baseline for disposals with superior value. This is brand new install as of January 3, 2017, so I'll report back and update this review if any 'issues' arise... hopefully not.",

It may not be as loud (DB) but it does have a rumble. Almost like it's off balance. And there is nothing lodged in it. It's also much bigger than my other one and hangs lower.
