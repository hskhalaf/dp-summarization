When I offered the chews to them there was NO hesitation, they gobbled them down. Now every morning while I make my coffee they sit and wait for their Skin and Coat chew.",

The cat\u2019s dandruff disappeared immediately but the surprise was that my big dogs both started shedding a lot less! Their coats look luxurious. Plus they all think it\u2019s a treat. One note is they say to give 4 a day to dogs this size but 2 is plenty.",
