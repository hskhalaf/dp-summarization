      "text": "I researched every mah jongg set i found online before purchasing this one. For the money this one has it all: clearly printed tiles, a covered box for tiles, racks with pushers, with plenty of extra flowers, jokers, and blanks to replace any you might misplace, all in a sturdy travel case. A note to the first time adult mah jongg set purchaser: Skip the $20. to $40. travel set and buy this one. It'll save you in the long run; if you like the game enough to purchase a set, you've got the bug and will want a \"real\" set in the near future. This set is more travel ready than the cardboard box set!",

      "text": "The tiles on this set feel very heavy, have a lovely finish, and very, very clear markings. The racks are very ordinary but work fine. The dice are tiny (as in most sets) and the case is a sturdy and pretty aluminum. It is not too heavy. The only possible objection that someone (not me) might have is that the trays for storing the tiles are thin plastic. Mine have not cracked or broken but they are clearly weak. It is probable that they were so designed to avoid adding weight to the set. All the weight is in the right place - the beautiful tiles!",
