He loves to travel with me in the car, but he also has a bad habit of hopping between the front and back seats, which isn't safe and is probably illegal. So I bought this harness, along with a tether that attaches and clicks into the seat belt holder, because he means everything to me, and his safety was paramount. this is going to be perfect for our outings. He might not like it at first, because he's used to getting his way. But he'll adjust, and I'll stop worrying. Thank you EzyDog for the great design and functionality. You've definitely solved my problem.",

At the same time that it restrains her it still allows for her to move comfofortably but safely in the back seat. TAKE NOTE - I have a Honda Accord and at first it looked like it wouldn't click in, but you just have to push it in a little further. It unclicks without a problem when you want it removed. Otherwise it stays in place to safely tether the dog.",

He pulls hard when at first we get out of the van because he has to wait until I get my wheelchair ready and it's strong enough to hold him from shooting out of the car. Very well worth the buy!",
