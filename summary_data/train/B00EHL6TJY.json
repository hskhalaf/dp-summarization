Additionally, it has some nice little features that allow it to be configured for large items and gives you a place for like large knives or spatulas. I think my only complaint would be that there isn't a way to not have a dry cycle.",

The cleaning cycle is very quiet and does a great job of cleaning (even silverware is sparkling and no food stains). Awesome for cleaning and very easy. Just use the manual button and don't forget to open the water valve (turn on the faucet)... I would buy again Definitely !!!",

Second machine works like a charm! Saves space and has configurations for light, regular and heavy wash cycles. Dishes come out spotless (assuming you use Jet Dry or similar rinse agent)! My only gripe is that the dish separators (little vertical arms holding dishes in a row) are a bit close together which means bowls are a bit difficult to fit in any efficient manner, but that is not a big deal since the unit does not use much water per cycle.",

Our faucet adapter fits standard size Aerator openings for both the male and female connections. The sizes: Male 15/16\"\"; Female 55/64\"\". As long as your faucet has a removable Aerator they should be able to connect the faucet adapter. For a standard faucet head with a side/detached sprayer: While attached to the standard faucet, some detached sprayers will have water start coming out of them due to the line pressure. This is from the design of those faucets to redirect the water pressure from the main faucet head to the side sprayer. If you have a side sprayer, you will most likely need to install a water line that is separated from the sprayer.\"",
