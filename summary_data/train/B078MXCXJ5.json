First off the unit is fully adjustable, it fits with the case and the pop socket on the back attached. The lip to keep the watch from sliding down is an improvement over other designs, the cable management is awesome. Another big plus. It all comes apart an stores flat for travel. (Unlike other designs) Reassembly is very easy, My wife loves this product. Now I will order one for myself.",

Easy to install and break down, compact and small enough to pack on a business or vacation trip. Has some weight to it, preventing movement, like the size of the stand too. Cant think of anything wrong with this stand. Stop looking for any other stand, believe me this is it. Very pleased with this purchase and would recomend this product to a friend or family. This product gets 5/5 rating!",

Original review: Bought for traveling spouse but problem is you have to hook up all your cords separately. Would have loved A product that had built in cords that consolidated to one plug. Not practiCal for traveling person unless you have extra lighting cords you can have hooked up At all times.",

I think I'll be using this stand for many years to come. Just as importantly, Amy got back to me within 24 hours to solve my problems. There was a small plastic bag with two screws, one plug, and one cable management tie. See attached photo. I'm really pleased with my charging stand.",

I knew that after reading but at this price point you're approaching stands that include the plugs for phone or multi-Qi surfaces for charging wirelessly. Secondly - the machining on the pathways for the wire is not finished well. It has several sharp edges that will cut away at the charging cables as you install, even at the risk of reducing insulation and exposing wire. I drew blood during installation of one of my cables - it's that sharp. Once it's setup - it's a really handy all-in-one charging point for the nightstand/desk/etc.. Attractive, compact and sturdy.",
