It's a beautiful design, however it's awkward to hold and pour. plastic and rubber part are hard to secure as well, if you have arthritis or hand issues you will have problems getting that on and off properly. It's annoying to pour too, no spills or anything like that, just very clunky and wide where you're suppose to grip. It's functional, for sure, just wouldn't re-buy this particular model. I have many Bodum items, from coffee to tea and I have to say this is my least favorite. I'd pass if I were you.",

I think the water goes through the filter way too fast not allowing it to grasp the taste of the coffee and you end up wasting a lot of coffee just to get that strong taste of the coffee.

The spout is just a tiny little thing and doesn't go all the way down to the middle which in turn does not allow the system to breathe through the paper filter, causing it to \u201cspit\u201d coffee all over!

      "text": "Broke within 4 days of recieving. The Bodum broke when knocked over (not dropped) and when the top struck the counter it shattered. Pretty dissapointed. We've had an older pour-over that broke, but only after a year. The weight of the bottom double wall doesn't do the top single layer any favors in case of accidents. Love pour over coffee, it tastes amazing, but there's really no reason to pay extra money for a double layer if they are so prone to damage. I relize knocking it over is my own fault; but I'm leaning towards calling this a design flaw. Side note: Did not include a filter even though its pictured with one. Also dissapointing.",

Pour the boiling water over the grounds just to coat them and let it bloom for 45 seconds. Pour the rest of the water over and wait 2-3 minutes for it the drip through. 10/10 would recommend.",

I've had to change the brewing process to produce better tasting coffee. What I've been doing it just boiling water on the stove, adding grinds and letting it steep for 5 or 10 minutes, and then pouring it over into the bodum pot, letting the grinds filter out in the process. It's an extra step but I don't really mind it if I get my coffee in the end, I just wish it could regularly produce a more bold tasting coffee.",

The only flaw in my opinion is the filter area on top is too small to make a full pot at once.

It brews too quickly, it doesn't sit there long enough to slowly drip and get flavor. It's way too watery. I even tried using a coffee filter along with the reusable filter. The filter is too porous, it would work best if there was only a small hole at the bottom",

It is nice to enjoy black coffee because it\u2019s not so dense (and therefore bitter) that you would need cream or milk. It also is fun to watch dripping into the beaker flask thing. Glad I bought this and the price didn\u2019t hurt me for trying something out for the first time. The mesh filter is super easy to clean and I use it bare without any paper filters, as I believe was intended. Good.",
