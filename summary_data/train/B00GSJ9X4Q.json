I wrote a short synopsis on how to get it done over on reddit:  It includes the documentation from WD as well as some tweaks. Would definitely do this on any machine that you want to get applications launched quickly but want to keep the overall price down and still have ample storage. Another good configuration is if you don't need tons of space, put the whole install on the SSD and use the HDD as your Time Machine drive!",

The HDD portion only spins at 5200rpm but over all it is actually faster than most at that speed. The drive itself comes with a section locked. If you are using this for an upgrade like I did you can only really move over to the 120gb partition. Then the WD software will unlock the rest of the drive.

Downside: Drives are shipped \"locked\" so you can't access the 1Tb storage until it's \"unlocked\" when running a Windows operating system on the SSD using their unlocking key/application. Very frustrating. Install Windows or clone an image to the 120Gb SSD and then unlock and then copy storage over. Makes it a two step process if you're coming from a 1Tb SATA drive.",

    "description": "WD BLACK\u00b2 DUAL DRIVE (120 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD) \u2013 THE MUST HAVE SOLUTION FOR YOUR SINGLE-BAY PC.\nIntroducing the WD Black\u00b2 dual drive, the world's first 2.5-inch dual drive storage solution. WD Black\u00b2 is the fusion of a fully accessible solid-state drive for your operating system and a generous capacity hard drive for personal data and large files.\n\nThe power of two.\nWD has redefined the PC with the next big thing in ultra-fast performance storage. Introducing WD Black\u00b2, the world's first 2.5-inch dual drive storage solution. The WD Black\u00b2 dual drive is a completely new approach in a compromised solid-state and hybrid storage market. Finally you can have the speed of an SSD that you want and the capacity of a hard drive that you need in your notebook or all-in-one PC.\n\nInspired by you.\nYour requests to make the notebook and all-in-one PC experience better, faster and more dynamic have been heard. We took the challenge and made it our mission to design a storage solution that delivers the ultimate experience. The WD Black\u00b2 dual drive solves your storage limitations and adds true high-performance SSD speed to your PC. The WD Black\u00b2 dual drive is the drive you were waiting for, inspired by and created specifically for enthusiasts like you.\n\nProfessional performance.\nWD Black\u00b2 is built by fusing two world-class storage devices together into one dual drive to create the ultimate experience for notebooks and all-in-one PCs. Boot up faster to your operating system with the speed of SSD at your fingertips. WD Black\u00b2 features innovative 20nm NAND flash with remarkable power efficiency that is poised to redefine what is possible in the storage industry.\n\nFEATURES\nShift_Technology - WD Black\u00b2 Shift_Technology is race-ready from the starting line with enhanced firmware and improved algorithms for faster performance and data management.\n\nWD Black\u00b2 Shift_Technology allows you to migrate larger data files to the hard drive and provides your SSD with less system drag, which increases the overall endurance and mileage of the SSD. With less caching involved, there's less time waiting and more time enjoying the things you love to do most.\n\nShift_Technology Features include:\n\n * 20nm architecture with quad channel NAND processing for increased speed and performance\n * WD customized controller built for increased efficiency of data management per cell resulting in less drag on your PC\n * Improved drive integrity with 8 GB of space for provisioning to help protect and improve SSD reliability\n\nReduce SSD wear and tear - SSD performance can degrade when total capacities are reached or after a finite number of writes have been reached, which is a major concern for SSD users. We built our dual drive solution to curb these problems. With our WD Black\u00b2, you can move your larger data or write-intensive applications onto the 1 TB hard drive, ultimately extending the life of the SSD and maintaining optimal performance across the dual drive. \n\nFor the Creative Pro - Now you can load your OS, photo and video editing programs on the SSD and save all of your capacity-heavy RAW photo and video files to the 1 TB HDD. Keep it all local and readily available on your notebook or all-in-one PC without slowing system performance.\n\nFor the Gamer inside you - Turn your dual-purpose notebook or all-in-one PC into the high-performance gaming machine of your dreams. The dual drive's fully accessible SSD allows you to place your OS and favorite game software directly on the SSD which results in faster boot times and smoother game play while still having separate storage capacity available for your work and personal files..\n\nFinesse of perfection - WD Black\u00b2 combines the shock and vibration resistance of SSD with the proven technology of the HDD for one truly agile and highly reliable dual drive storage solution. Advanced firmware and intelligent algorithms assist in heightened performance, resulting in cooler temperatures with nearly inaudible operation.\n\nYou take the control - With WD Black\u00b2 the decision is yours. Safer than using an SSD as your only primary storage device, now you are enabled to save your data on the 1 TB hard drive, or split data between both. Take full control and manage the location of your personal data. We recommend viewing the installation videos to understand the best option for your upgrade, whether it be clean installation, cloning or data migration.\n\nSoftware Download Required - WD Black\u00b2 Dual Drive ships as a full kit with a web key, quick install guide, USB to SATA transfer cable, and warranty information. Software download and internet connection are required for installation. Please watch our how to install videos and choose whether you would like to perform a fresh installation or a cloning installation for your dual drive.\n\nKit contents: \n\n * WD Black\u00b2 Dual Drive\n * Quick Install Guide\n * SATA to USB Cable (For software download)\n * USB Web Key (For software download)\n * Warranty Guide\n\n\n\nSystem requirements: \n\n * WD Supplied software required.
