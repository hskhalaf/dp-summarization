The really neat thing is you can charge your GoPro wirelessly. They really makes it very convenient and simple to do. I usually just set the camera down and it\u2019s fully charged within a couple hours. While it does have a bit of a station footprint, the look is very sleek and ergonomically designed. I love my GoPro and this charger really pulls everything together nicely. I really think GoPro should provide this type of solution with the camera.",
