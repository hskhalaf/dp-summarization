I am very disappointed this wasn't mentioned in the listing and didn't come across in any reviews - had I been aware of that I would not have ordered. Instead, tried a diluted solution of white vinegar to clean then applied a product called Emuaid. That quickly eradicated my pup's yeast / bacterial ear infection in just a few days.",
