I wear ladies size 7.5 shoe and the mediums fit me well, inconsistent with the on-line size chart (7.5 is equivalent to size 38). My daughter wears size 9 to 9.5 shoe and she is comfortable in the size large sock. My son wears men's shoe size 8 to 9 and was comfortable in the size large sock.",

There was about 3\" minimum of snow on the ground and i was in water above my ankles several times during the night. When i put my hand inside the sock it kind of reminds me of a wetsuit so im not sure i would wear them without a sock liner.",
