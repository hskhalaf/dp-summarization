The shoes kinda look like an 85 year old man should be using them to shuffle around town and pick up his meds, however they do perform as described. Its a weird looking tennis shoe with a steel toe. The horizontal white stripe that is pictured is blue on the shoes that arrived wich is dissapointing but at this point i welcome any further awkwardness that this shoe can offer. I almost wish they had velcro straps. The fit is a touch big but like i said earlier, they are work shoes and theyre more comfortable than boots.",

I'm not to concerned though because they still fit very well with no slippage. Another thing i've noticed is the back arch support on the shoe where in concaves in can dig at your ankles if you wear low cut socks.",

Nonetheless I'm very happy with the purchase. Didn't feel the need to return them. I am flat footed so I got some insoles for extra comfort. If I do purchase again I may try to get them wide style or maybe a half a size bigger to give my toes some wiggle room.",
