However, the unit leaks like a freaking sieve. It leaks out from under the swivel on top and it leaks out the bottom as well and it's not due to a poor installation by me. I figure I can fix it so I haven't sent it back but it is disappointing as far as the quality. Update: I wish I had sent it back. Stupid thing still leaks and now I'm learning that artificially alkalized water may not be so good for you after all. Do your research.",

I\u2019m including pictures of the machine in the highest alkaline setting (9.5) as well as in the strongest acidic setting (5.0) so you can see for yourself. Also a note comes with your machine offering free filters if you leave a 5 star review. Sending my machine back and looking elsewhere.",
