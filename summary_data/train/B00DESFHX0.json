I bought another antenna to improve its portability while leaving the rather long cord coiled up. The provided antenna needs to be fully extended to work reliably.",

Install took me about 15 Mins because I didn't know where i wanted to put the magnet antenna. The device itself is super easy to use and you can easily change stations or add to favorites.
