I reordered more tapes. The keyboard is large and easy to type. It has label and print display. I saved my labels in a file for easy retrieval later on. I'm very happy to own this product. The 24 mm tape has up to 7 lines of text. The 18 mm tape has up to 5 lines of text. I love the font, symbol, and frame settings. It has a minimum of 6 point font size to 48 point.

Both have colored banding on the display that moves as you move your viewing angle. The image shows an example -- but when viewed with the naked eye the colored banding (known technically as moire\u0301 patterns) is vertical. The iPhone see those as diagonal bands. Either way, the ever-shifting colored bands are nausea inducing. Either I have a two bad units (which I doubt) or Brother has a serious technical problem with the colored displays. I've been a loyal Brother P-Touch fan since the first units were introduced, so I'm sad to see what appears to be a mistake like this.",

The Brother software works flawlessly (so far) on my 64bit Windows 7 computer. * As primarily a Linux user I (and other Linux users) can only wish for full Linux support for such great devices!!!

If the user is resourceful, he can use all those one inch pieces of discarded tape for other things; but, that doesn't diminish the fact that Brother is purposefully punishing the customer for Brother's own greedy profit.

In this P-Touch, there is an additional post for a hole that is not present in the TZ tapes. So, my TZ tapes are useless here. If I knew that going in, I could have made an informed choice.
