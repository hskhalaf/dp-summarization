I gave these out as Christmas gifts to my kids along with my meatloaf recipe....",

However, the inner pan is hard to get out of the outer pan - it's a design flaw and my only complaint. and yes, it's dishwasher safe, but for nonstick to last the longest, you'll want to handwash it and never ever ever use cooking spray. That's why my old Anolon pans lasted so long and retained their nonstick even though they got scratched a few years back.",

The meatloaf cooks evenly and the grease falls through the slots of the insert. Meatloaf cooks with crunchy edges too!! Cleanup is easy which is a big plus! Thank you!!",
