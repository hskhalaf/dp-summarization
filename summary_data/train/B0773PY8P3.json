If you watch old reruns of Hogan's Heroes, it is Col Hogan's jacket. I really like the liner with the 48 star American flag. Some complained about the leather smell but I think it is typical of any new leather jacket. It is certainly not a strong smell. Since it's leather and therefore a good windbreaker, I find it comfortable down to the mid 30s. Highly recommended. Great value for the price.",

I think you can see that pretty quickly if you have experience with pleather goods. Although I expected a leather jacket, I will keep this as a vegan substitute. I will admit it had people guessing.",

It is not discolored like many other distressed jackets are, so if that is your expectation the weathered jacket is a uniformly shaded dark brown. The zipper and snaps work effectively and the detail to authenticity is very good. I am pleased with this selection.",

Planning to add a couple of patches to make it look more authentic as a pilot's jacket. Got my fingers crossed I don't mess it up.",

I have had jackets in the past say they are XL, but are either way tight, or way baggy. This one is neither of those. IF you use the chart with correct measurement, you should get a great fit.

The chest is big enough for a little wiggle room and it fits great with a sweater underneath. Warm enough for the New York City winter as long you\u2019ve got layers.",

It is not soft leather but not too stiff and rough either.",

This jacket is well made, with soft, evenly tanned leather. Quality stitching and soft comfortable liner. I would agree that for us tall folks, the XLT could have a little longer sleeves, but I am kind of used to that by now. If you are looking for a nice leather jacket of this style and don't want to spend a lot, this is a great buy and a safe bet.",

At six feet, 210 lbs. and yes, a bit of a belly, this Large jacket fit perfectly, even reaching comfortably around my gut, which has been fading, as I've lost a little over 40 lbs. the past year. I'm sure this jacket will fit even better with another 20 lbs. gone from around my mid-section.",

No mark whatsoever.... so that passes the first durability test. Nice jacket, good price. Great Service from seller. Had initally ordered the jacket in black, but changed my mind. I sent amessage to the seller: Luxury Lane, and they responded promptly, made the chage and sent the jacket in brown as I requested. Very good packaging too. Durable box, Jacket pressed flat, sealed in plastic. Would do business with them again.",
