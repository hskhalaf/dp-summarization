This is a better looking product than I found at the local big box because of the heavy green glass, the copper colored metal upper base and the strong looking metal hanger.",

When I tilted the feeder just slightly, I could see the juice start to come up through the holes. It was evident that it had been slowly leaking on top as there was dried juice around every feeder port. I love the widemouth jar as it's easy to clean but that's it.",

The Vintage hummingbird feeder features a glass nectar bottle and durable metal basin cap with five integrated perch stations and red flower feeding ports to attract more hummingbirds. With a 20 ounce nectar capacity, the Vintage provides plenty of nectar to keep hummingbirds happy and coming back for more! Its wide bottle opening and detachable flat base make filling easy and cleaning a breeze. When cleaning your hummingbird feeder, do not put your feeder in the dishwasher, as the high temperatures can permanently damage the feeder parts. Most expert sources discourage dishwashing because it may not fully disinfect any avian diseases. Additionally, dishwashers could strip the paint off painted glass components or ruin the finish on metal components and it voids the warranty.",
