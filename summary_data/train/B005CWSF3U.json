Now it won't take incoming or make outgoing calls, even though it powers up, and the company is not returning my calls. It is a great idea--big buttons, loud speaker, it reads the numbers as you punch them in! BUT if it won't work, it is a huge waste of time. Also, may I ask why oh WHY the user manual is printed in tiny print? Hello? Anyone there?",

This is the best phone she has ever used. Voices come over loud and clear, ringtone is loud and the size of phone and numbers are perfect, plus all of the other features not found elsewhere.",

For the first 6-9 months worked fine although it had intermittent charging issues. This finally escalated to its death. By the end it was only holding the charge occasionally which didn't fit the bill for an \"emergency\" phone. I tried different chargers, changed the battery (x2), and even reset it all to no avail. If you are looking for a short term disposable phone by all means buy it. If you need a phone for a child, senior or other person that would require reliability keep looking.",

I opted for the unlocked version for better coverage in my more rural local, but if snapfon's cellular service has coverage in your area I would recommend buying the locked version of this snapfon EZ TWO instead (~$20-30 cheaper) and go with the snapfon cellular plan.",

This is the first one that he has felt comfortable with and uses regularly. It is sturdy and has just the right number of features like stored numbers, emergency number dialing. Now if I can figure out how I get him not to call me at 5AM it would be perfect for me also! He loves the phone, and I found it a great value for the price.",

Its 2015, the phone should have a little more memory for that or, because it supports external micro sd card, it should allow to save contacts on the sd card thus giving unlimited entries. This was a Christmas gift for my grandpa & he's over the years, amassed quite a long address book. Trying to sort & filter those addresses so that they don't exceed the 250mark is so much work for him it is just easier & convenient if he doesn't have to worry about that.",
