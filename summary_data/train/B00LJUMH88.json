This is because I AM a busty gal. Well the guy was good. If I were to get a 2x it would of been extremely to big. I did have to take two of my strings to keep the vest inclosed because again my boobs are big but it worked out perfectly. I love the fringe pieces tht came for the boots. Overall great fit and great costume. Also I'm 5'11 so lengtg was great for me with my heel boots",

So I did was another reviewer said and wore black legging pants underneath which I think looked great. The only complaints I would have is the leather parts were very wrinkled from packaging so I did my best to iron them out (the tags say do not iron btw). One side of the vest had jagged cuts. And I had to use safety pins to hold the vest otherwise it would fall to the sides. But I won 1st place at my work contest so I'd say it's a great buy!",

All of my customers loved my costume that they all HAD to take a picture with me. I have no complaints about this costume!!",

It's rather short, barely mid-thigh. I tied some of the fringes in the front together as another reviewer suggested to keep the attached vest closed.

I am 5'4\" and a dress size 8 and the M/L fit perfectly. I did add a safety pin to the front to keep the vest in good position. The boot covers also add a great touch. This is so worth the price and more. So glad I got it.",
