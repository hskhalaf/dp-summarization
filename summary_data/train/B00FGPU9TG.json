The material on the inside of the bag did not feel very soft and the sleeping bag was extremely hard to roll up and get back in the bag, making it not so kid friendly at all. For what it is, it's fine though.",

Mom review: the zipper is very easy for a child to be able to handle, and I really like the fact that the zipper doesn't 'tangle' when opening or closing the sleeping bag. I also really like how easily it rolls up for storage. Overall a great sleeping bag for a 5 year old!",

The only negative which is not really a negative is that the glow in the dark bugs printed on the outside do not really glow. I mean if you turn off the lights you can see them very very faintly but I would not really consider it glowing. So Glow should be taken out of the description, kind of false advertising when people are expecting a real glow.",

One has to be extremely careful not to rip the wrong seem, or use too much force, which is VERY hard to do as the expansion seems are sitting right on top of the actual seem holding the bag together. This was dissapointing but not a huge deal for me as the sleeping bag also has tie straps for storage and transportation. I hope to add a more thorough review after my daughter uses it for the first time.",

Overall, a very nice quality and very warm sleeping bag!",

The sleeping bags arrived before Xmas (Yay!) and were a hit with all the kids. The sleepers are beautiful, they're durable and well-made. The kids especially liked that they were reversible and each bag came with a carrying cover! I highly recommend these Coleman sleeping bags and would order again!!",
