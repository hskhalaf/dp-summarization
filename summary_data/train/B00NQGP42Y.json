The phone, although it came with fast delivery, was very smashed, which was upsetting. However, everything worked fine with it and paying to get the screen repaired will still total it to less than an iPhone actually cost. Just bear in mind that when you buy this you run the risk of receiving a very smashed phone. I am still not happy with the state it arrived in.",
