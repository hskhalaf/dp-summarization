Unfortunately we chose to under-mount the sink....our mistake.....Hopefully this info will save others the pain and dissatisfaction.",

I wanted a stainless sink but my wife won out on this black one to replace our dated bar sink. It looks spectacular with a nickel faucet. We have hard water and so far the sink does not collect water stains. Installation was easy and I highly recommend this sink which has an outstanding price/value.",

When I am done doing dishes, I just use my dish brush with dish liquid and brush it down, and rinse it off. No special cleaners needed. With my old sink, a pan or something would be in there and block the sink from draining. That is impossible with this sink because of the drain being off to the side and the way the sink gently slopes to it.",
