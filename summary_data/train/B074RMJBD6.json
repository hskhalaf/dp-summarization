It\u2019s awkward to use and will only work with larger pieces of bread. My daughter is delighted with the shapes. She didn\u2019t eat her sandwiches before for lunch and now she does. So that\u2019s a plus. Using them is frustrating because the cuts make it difficult to keep the sandwich together and not mess up the shape. I tell you what regular cookie cutters are way easier to use and I know that now.",
