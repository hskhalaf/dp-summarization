The rubber is super sticky, tuff, the shoes strong (you can feel the support), the tips is precise and offers great control, and they're pretty comfortable too. They're technical enough to not hold you back as you learn the basics and get more daring. I don't know what else to say other than they're great and that I've heard a lot of climbers say the same thing.",

I can't usually wear the shoes longer than just on the route I climb. The straps allow quick and easy on/off and ability to tighten shoes wonderfully. I like the color but a little more dull than I expected them to be. The rubber is fantastic and I feel very comfortable on small foot holds.",

Mind you, these aren't a super aggressive climbing shoe, which I like as a beginner, but definitely made all the difference and worked amazing right off the bat. I have kind of wide feet, but despite that these fit snug and not too tight. I'll probably be buying another pair of these in the near future.",
