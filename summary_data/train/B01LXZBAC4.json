I highly recommend. I also added some lights to attach to the back hole that illuminates the set for some evening fun. (SOLOMONE CAVALLI Set of 2 Cornhole Night Light...) You can't stick them in the corn hole, but in the vertically sitting hole that props the face at an angle is a perfect fit and still lights up your game.",

I watched the video review how to fold and it was not hard at all to just follow the instruction. I wish it came with more bean bags but it's okay. The bag is awesome too. I love this thing.

I LOVE that it is collapsible, as I've only seen wood / plastic versions, and we do NOT have room to store those things! However, I'm certain the seller is collecting an exorbitant margin, as the materials are definitely not expensive, and the markup is clearly based on the collapse-ability of the product. SO, you have to decide if it's worth it to YOU. Were it not for this party, I would not have paid this much for this product.",

I found this corn hole game on Amazon and thought what is the worst they can do with a bean bag.
