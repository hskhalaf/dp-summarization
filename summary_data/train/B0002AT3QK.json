Also, you have to be willing to pick up just one to three poops at a time because even if it's not full picking up a third or fourth poop will push out previously scooped up poops. If you have a large dog like I do this works well but you're only going to get one poop at a time. Works great on grass but not on pea gravel potty stations.",

Unfortunately the tines of the rake were a little too far between and the small dogs turds often fell through the tines. So I dont recommend this produt if you have a small dog. However, the biggest reason I gave this product only 2 stars is because the tines bend easily and started breaking off with only a few months of use. Not impressed. Should have \"splurged\" on a higher quality scoop.",

Our kids play on that lawn, and I feel confident that they are not stepping in pieces (or, sorry, smears) left behind.",

I walk over to the sidewalk and push the wire against the concrete to straighten them back. Not a huge deal but definitely removes one star.

As an update, the last time I bought the larger size. The bigger one is much more substantial and will most likely last much longer. P.S. Buy the grass version.
