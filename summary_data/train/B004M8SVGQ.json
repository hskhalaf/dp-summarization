      "text": "I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos taken with the camera for the cost of the camera. I expected a lot more from a NIKON product. Usually NIKON provides superior quality.. but this was just a big disappointment. The camera is easy to use and portable.. but the picture quality is just poor. The photos were grainy and lacked any vibrancy. I expected crystal clear, stunning photos. I did not keep this camera. I can not recommend this particular NIKON device and would suggest you seek for an alternative at this price point.",

It takes low light pictures that turn out great. The sport mode is just the ticket for taking pictures of birds in flight, I took one of a dolphin leaping out of the water I couldn't have captured otherwise. I want to purchase a DSLR however I plan on continuing using this one in the field as I'm not afraid to get it wet or dirty. Since Nikon has it upgraded several times the price has dropped dramatically. So it is very affordable.",

This camera ended up being perfect. I took some amazing pics.... in less than 3 months I took over 1000 pictures. I especially loved the Continuous Sport function... takes 8-15 rapid fire pictures.... great for capturing motion... especially cool motion like a Muay Thai fight or a tiger running through a pool of water to pounce another tiger. I cannot think of any cons... good camera and easy to use. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",

I don't blame the L120 for being out of focus or for not using the flash but I feel like I am trying to hack or debug it even after reviewing the instructions.

The zoom is very good and the wide angle is great for interior photos of homes. It locks on focus fairly quickly, though not as quick as a dSLR; good enough for what I do. The only issue I have is that it doesn't do well with sunlight glare. I wish Nikon would make an optional \"hood\" for it. I also have to set the exposure one click on the + side since picture tend to come out just a smidgen too dark. Other than that I'd definitely recommend this camera.",

I took a photo of a painting when the room was completely blacked out (dark) and with flash the photo came out clear as day.

LCD quality is amazing, and the zoom is wonderful for this camera. It's a comfortable hold and isn't too awkward. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend it for the shutter-happy (not necessarily for the advanced though) :)",

    "description": "Get closer than ever to your active family with the powerful, affordable Nikon Coolpix L120 Your images will zoom to the next level with its 21x optical Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens. \n\nZoom in on a high powered camera at an easy to handle price. \n\nGreat photos and superb HD movies begin with Nikon's high power 21x wide-angle optical Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens. This powerful zoom lens, with a 25-525mm range equivalent, closes the distance between you and your subjects. Capture your son firing off the game-winning lacrosse shot or your daughter's first ride on a two wheeler. Whether it's a panoramic shot of the entire family on a favorite sledding hill, or a photo of your children playing in the backyard, you'll shoot effortlessly and accurately with the Coolpix L120. \n\nIf you're new to photography, no worries, this camera has intelligent features to help you out. Five-way VR Image Stabilization uses sensor shift to minimize the effects of camera shake, virtually eliminating blurred images. Trick-or-treating with the kids? The Coolpix L120 has a high ISO speed up to 6400 to capture fast moving or low-light scenarios. \n\nOne-touch HD movie recording puts friends and family in motion. \n\nAs photo keeper of family memories, you can rely on the Coolpix L120 to capture great still images that you can print and save. But a band concert without sound is incomplete and a 60-yard touchdown drive without the fleet-footed runs isn't as exciting. That's where the Coolpix L120's advanced One-Touch HD Movie recording capabilities come in. With the push of a button you'll instantly be shooting 720p HD movies in full stereo. While shooting you can activate the camera's zoom function to capture tight shots and close ups. And when you're ready to share your movies with family and friends, you can use in-camera playback or the convenient HDMI output for simple hookup to an HDTV or computer. \n\nShoot snowboarders, Frisbee throwers and T-ball players with a single, versatile",
