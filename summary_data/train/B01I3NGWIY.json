      "text": "I love IKEA for almost any usage. I saw this storage cart in a design magazine and bought two of them, one in the reddish-brown color and one in black. I use one in my bathroom for towels and storage canisters and one in my bedroom/office to hold supplies. They are industrial chic, roomy, and portable. Do note that if you are near an IKEA brick and mortar store, you can save quite a bit by just going there and buying it directly (close to half the cost at Amazon).",
