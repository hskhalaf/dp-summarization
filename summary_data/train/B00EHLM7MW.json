Now that we are aware of this, it's not a huge deal, but the first few times we ran it we thought it was broken.",

But after I removed the box and packaging (that was in great shape) I removed the plastic bag from the dishwasher and the inside of it was wet. The outside one the dishwasher was wet with a gritty substance on it. I opened the door to the dishwasher and the inside was wet also along with a small dent on the inside of the door. I'm baffled how this could have happened because packaging was dry and perfect. But the darn thing works, for now anyways",

The only real draw back is you need to truly have a place to put it or it is in the way and you need to remember that , although most dishwashers take 2 hours, this machine ties up your kitchen water faucet for 2 hours. Still and all, I am glad I purchased it.",

Our faucet adapter fits standard size Aerator openings for both the male and female connections. The sizes: Male 15/16\"\"; Female 55/64\"\". As long as your faucet has a removable Aerator they should be able to connect the faucet adapter. For a standard faucet head with a side/detached sprayer: While attached to the standard faucet, some detached sprayers will have water start coming out of them due to the line pressure. This is from the design of those faucets to redirect the water pressure from the main faucet head to the side sprayer. If you have a side sprayer, you will most likely need to install a water line that is separated from the sprayer.\"",
