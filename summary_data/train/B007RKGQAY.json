The length and toe box was fine but the wrap around the top of the foot at the base of the tongue was so tight it was painful. Even without any of the laces in! I feel like whoever stitched this pair must have screwed up. I don\u2019t want to order a larger size because then my foot would be swimming forward, back and side to side. Damn covid and not being able to try on in person first!!",

The lack of arch support almost feels like you're walking around barefoot--it hurts your feet after awhile. The only thing I don't like about these shoes are that the sides are pretty stiff. When you walk around they don't flex very easily and the sides just kind of press against your feet. Other than the stiffness, these are great shoes.",
