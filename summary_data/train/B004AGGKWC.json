      "text": "OK, I know- most users probably do not care that the two-pin engagement mechanism is always loose on the shaft. It has a ball bearing spring that allows the engaging pins to be raised and lowered so that you can thread in the spigot before engaging the pins-yet, the pins , threads, and need-to-clock for pin engagement cause the clearances needed fit to be sloppy engagement, and are not secure enough to keep it from wobbling when engaged. The threads are loose as well. I would have preferred a simple lock nut over this overengineered \"quick Change junk\". Now, my 4 1/8\" hole is actually 4 and 3/16\".",

      "text": "I like the heavy duty feel of it. But the motion of the outside pin part depends on tiny set screw to function. I haven't used it much and it's been sitting around for a few years. Now the pin part doesn't slide up and down as easily. Since this is not cheap, I'm wondering how long this will last. I hope it lasts at least through wiring of one house. The pilot drill is also about 2\" from the holder. Not long enough for few tall hole saws. Generous 3.5\" would be appreciated.",
