A major factor in my decision to buy was the other reviews stating that this is a good intermediate instrument, such as for use in a pit orchestra. As flute is my second instrument, I'd have to agree. My main instrument, I've invested a lot more in. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a good instrument that won't break the bank, this piece comes in a gorgeous red velvety case and padded overcast, with a cleaning rod, Gemeinhardt warranty and care instructions, and an anti tarnish strip. Most importantly, the extra length facilitates high notes, you have the b footnote, the advanced open-holed style, the beautiful silver, and quality of a Gemeinhardt.",

Its sound quality is amazing and the keys are really nice and it feels nice to play. It did take some getting used to because I was used to playing a closed hole flutebut it does come with key plugs which every week I just took one out and not I play with out them. But overall I love this flute so much and I highly recommend it.",

I am sure a lot of it is her competitive nature and the fact she practices everyday but having a better instrument never hurts. In my opinion well worth the price. If she makes top band in high school she gets the pearl though and can use this one for marching.",
