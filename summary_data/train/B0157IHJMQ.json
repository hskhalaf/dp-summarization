Now I think it's a good product, and customer service is just unbelievable. Taking one star off though, for the defects in the original drone - 5 stars would go to product, for which I'd not have to be in touch with customer service.",

If you're having trouble with yours, just read the manual (it's written better than most of the Chinese translated imports), and do what it says. Those complaining about it here seem to have some unrealistic expectations. Highly recommended for beginners or experienced pilots. I'm very pleased with mine.

This is the only item I can recall having actually returned on Amazon. I don't know how widespread this problem is, but in case this is more than an isolated incident, I felt it was my responsibility to write a review.",

Also, the drone size itself would fit in the palm of 2 hands. The remote control is much larger than the drone itself. Flying-wise it has good speed and height.",

Also, be cautious of flying it outside because the propellers come off easily and are nearly impossible to find in the grass. Have fun!",

I received this HS 170 to practice with since I crashed/destroyed the large drone my family game me last year. This mini is not only light weight, but out of the eight used, it responded the best to it's controller and was the easiest to operate. Two of the mid sized ones (different manufacturer) used by my adult sons broke within three flight segments and they reportedly cost twice as much money. The Syma X5C also responded well to its controller and was easy to operate/learn on.",
