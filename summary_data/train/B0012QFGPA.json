I don't know if that makes that much of a difference when wet or not. Something to consider before buying. Due to space restrictions (1.5\"), I also had to get another brand for outside the shower that had a smaller mounting footprint. It works fine but the Franklin Brass one is so much nicer, better quality and was actually cheaper. It just needs a 3\" mounting area, 1.5\" too big. Also bought the 12\" version. This review applies to that one also.Same product, different size.",
