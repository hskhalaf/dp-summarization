It\u2019s one thing to have stationary weapons on a toy, but these shoot little tiny LEGO pieces at a surprising speed. My son is 4.5 and I hate to sound like my mother, but these seem dangerous. If not for that and the crushed box, it would easily get 5 stars from me. That\u2019s said, I\u2019d still recommend for the Star Wars lover.",

The projectiles should be larger making finding them easier. The instructions were a little tougher than usual to follow but, not impossible. It had several odd extra pieces which made me almost go through the entire build to see if I had missed steps. Yet, only contained 2 replacement projectiles. The Chewy character is fantastic with his bow. Almost worth the price alone.",

Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \"fly it\". Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only.",
