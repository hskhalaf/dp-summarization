      "text": "I got a pair of these mounted on my Stubby front bumper and wow.. they really do a great job of throwing light down the road. They do have some flare on the side but these throw 3-4 times farther than my JK headlights on high beam, and I am being VERY conservative. I also bought a pair of 144 watt 4 inch square pods for my windshield mounts, These were supposed to be spot beams.. Nope. They are triple the power of the lights in my review and do nothing but light up the moths and attach bugs. Im returning the 4 inchers and going for 2 more of these. Love these lights!",

Mine has developed condensation after a crazy blizzard we had about a week after I installed them. Not a deal breaker, just use some silicone and you'll be happy with them.",

They're extremely bright and have a good spread, and for the price they outdid my expectations for sure. They look good too! The only downside so far is that the red is starting to fade from the sun. My car is kept outside, and I've had them on for about three months now. I'll most likely end up disassembling them and repainted the red part (being careful of seals, of course.) I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for offroad lights for their ride!",

I have four of these on my jeep\u2019s Roof rack and I lit up an entire acre lot. There\u2019s a little wind noise but not much. The only downside is I wish the mounting bracket was smaller or more flush. These lights are more of a focused flood instead of a focused spot, which I think is actually better. Who needs a tiny spot that lights up 5\u2019 wide 300ft away. I\u2019d rather have this light that lights up 40\u2019 wide at 150\u2019 away. Great buy for the money.",
