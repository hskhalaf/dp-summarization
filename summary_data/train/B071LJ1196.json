Taking only one pill was effective for a few days, then I had to bump it up to two because it wasn't producing a bowel movement like it had the first few days. Cleans you out that's for sure, just make sure you drink enough water.",

I took 2 pills the first two nights and like the instructions said In a 24 hour period I\u2019ve had 4 stools and I already feel better! I do have mild stomach cramping and bubbling right before I have to go but it\u2019s nothing unbearable.

      "text": "When Looking for a product, I look through the reviews/read the product info. and then decide to purchase or continue looking. I purchased this product based on the reviews and this really the only cleanse with five stars and great reviews. What I am going to do for future posters, is a one day post, a seven day post and a 15 day post. The information on this product is based on super strength cleanse and colon detox plus weight loss. I just received the product today and will start on Monday. I will start with five stars because I received the correct product and it was fast shipment, as I go through my days, I will adjust accordingly.",

It wont hurt your stomach but will still work. Also, be aware you will use the restroom frequently!",

So I will up my rating to a 5 star.",

I almost gave up on the product because at first it appeared to be doing nothing, but, at this time, I am thinking that the severe constipation and hemorrhoids are either totally eliminated or almost totally eliminated. I hope to have a CT scan soon to see the progress. I would highly recommend that you all advise that multiple treatments are required for severe cases of constipation and hemorrhoids: there are probably many who need to know this.",
