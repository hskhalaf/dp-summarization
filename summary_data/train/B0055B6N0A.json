I've had the unit for little over a month and it's making a clicking noise that is becoming louder and louder. The insert is already built into my fireplace, so if I need to replace it, I will have to rip away the molding. This is very disappointing. Will be calling customer service today,",

I ended up purchasing a $20 small, industrial unit that puts out a ton of heat and kept this unit to add ambiance to my home during the dark, depressing winter months. Everyone loves it who sees it. However, if you're looking to warm your home, this isn't it. It couldn't even warm my living room -- and my place isn't that big.",

This unit works great, and the fire and logs look pretty realistic, as well. I love that it has a remote and timer function. The heater blower is a bit loud though. Overall, I'm more than pleased!",
