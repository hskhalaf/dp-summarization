But otherwise it\u2019s really nice. Sturdy clay with a really pretty design. The bowl is glazed on the inside so it\u2019s smooth and easier to clean. It is a bit deep so I placed some river rocks in a little pile on one edge so that small birds, bees and butterflies have a place to land without feeling like they\u2019ll drown in a deep pool. I really enjoy it and recommend it!",

Kudos to the makers. I do see the price went up a lot recently, but really can't blame them. My birds love it and I always get compliments. Easy to clean, deep enough for good bird baths without evaporating to nothing during the day.",

I get so much enjoyment watching robins and other beautiful birds bathing in this birdbath or just drinking from it. It came to me fast and packed very well. It was in two pieces that was so simple to assemble. Once you assemble the birdbath it is very sturdy and ready to go. Just follow the instructions and you will have a birdbath that that will last for ever. it is great quality!!!",

This was a little disconcerting, but the maker must have a reason for this. This bird bath is beautiful!",

The last one I had the top was held on by a little wooden rod, at least this one looks like plastic....we\u2019ll see how it holds up. This is my second and final purchase of this item.

We have a fountain with a pump that just bubbles in the front yard and crows drink from it and finches bathe in it. I hope that the addition of the solar fountain will attract the birds to use it.
