      "verdict": "The Arc\u2019teryx Norvan LD GTX is explicitly designed for extended trail runs across different types of weather or trail conditions. Users mostly praise the shoe for its lightweight construction, and functional support. The shoe\u2019s outsole is also commended for its versatile grip on technical trails. If anything, it\u2019s just that some Norvan LD GTX shoes were manufactured with less waterproofing capabilities that were noted by some users. Other than that, this trail running shoe\u00a0from Arc\u2019Teryx has received positive reviews for its overall excellent running performance, especially on challenging trails.",

        "A number of users note that the shoe\u2019s single-layer mesh upper is lightweight and air-permeable",
        "Most of the wearers say that the shoe\u2019s GORE-TEX\u00ae feature delivers reliable waterproof performance",
