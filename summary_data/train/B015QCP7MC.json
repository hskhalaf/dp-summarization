I ended up purchasing a pair directly from Steve Madden, and when compared side by side, the shoes were COMPLETELY different. The most obvious difference being the quality of the shoe. The materials, stitching, labels, structure, fit, packaging, and padding are all obviously different when compared side by side.The shoes are not even made in the same country. I would recommend purchasing shoes directly from the source, because the differences were too vast for me to ignore.",
