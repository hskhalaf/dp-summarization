Also appears the wheel failure was caused by a poor quality weld joint. The cart is made of steel and rusts when placed in a damp or humid environment. My advice to anyone considering purchasing this item is to keep it indoors and dry. Other than the broken wheel and rust, the cart functions and works as advertised. Seller should list the cart as \"for indoor use only.\"",

They don't hold up to heavy use. They become loose as the threads become stripped. There is no way to tighten them when this happens. After tracking down the proper support number (the one listed on Amazon is wrong), I ordered replacement wheels. The manufacturer sent a new set, no charge. Those also wore out. This can be very frustrating as the wheels tend to fail at the wrong time, like when you're carrying something like food on the cart. Because of this, I can't recommend.",

Now, though, I'm going to need to spray paint the whole thing cause the joints on the shelves are rusting too. I understand weather is tough on products but this is not a carefree outdoor product.

If you do, it will slide to the other side unless it is heavy enough to pop the metal down flat. I would say to buy something else if ou are looking for a bar cart, but I\u2019d you are using it for serving, planting, holding or storing things, I would say it\u2019s pretty useful.",
