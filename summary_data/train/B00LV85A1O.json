A little on the narrow side, but in truth, real tennis shoes are designed for lateral support, so they tend to be a bit more snug in width than a more relaxed sneaker. No complaints here. Excellent price for a classic/retro tennis shoe.",

The body of the shoe appears solid and I believe the glue etc., will hold and give me a couple years of light tennis activity. Once I return to a more streneous level of play I will surely need to upgrade, but again I got these for under $40 so no complaints. If I paid closer to $70 the review might be different. Good look, and I'll look ready for prime-time with the matching Men's Cat Patch Fit Cap, lol.",
