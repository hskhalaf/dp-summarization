I have super thick hair with natural ringlets. It usually takes multiple passes to get my hair soft and smooth. This one does a good job b/c it closes properly down on the hair and doesn't leave my hair looking crimped. The hair also doesn't get caught under the blades and rip out of my head like my last straightener. I haven't used the $200 one that is comparable with this one but I am super picky and this is a good straightener!!",

      "text": "This straightener is amazing! I personally use it for curling my hair and I love the way it looks. I find my curls to be more textured/ voluminous with this as opposed to my other straightener. There is a locking mechanism which is awesome, especially if you are traveling or have kids! (Can never be too careful!) Also, I really like how you can adjust the temperature with the \u201cdial\u201d by essentially twisting the base. It\u2019s very user friendly/ fool proof. If you\u2019re looking for an easy tool to use to BOTH straighten or curl your hair, look no further.",

I loved that it came with a comb and 2 hair clips to help in straightening. The fact that it came with its own pouch for safe-keeping was adorable. I tend to not straighten my hair like I used to due to hear damage, but I felt good using the straightener with a heat protectant. The next day, my hair still looks great and pretty healthy. I will definitely recommend this hair straightener! Thank you!",

I like the look of the flat iron and the grip, which is very important for me since I have to hold it for a long time to straighten my hair. It came with 2 hair clips as well so yay!",

It doesn't snag or pull my hair and it stays at the heat I put it at so I don't worry about it frying my hair. Ive only used it a few times so far but I already know it's my new favorite and I totally recommend!",
