The fabric is worn in a way that looks like rubbing or friction, this is very surprising after having this seat for a week and not to mention my kid has only taken 2 trips in it. I am very disappointed, I paid over $300 dollars for this seat and expected a better quality. For how much they charge you would think that they would put better quality fabric on their carseats. It would be nice for this to get rectified...",

The belt extension mechanism (click tight button) was difficult to operate from the beginning and then finally broke at an opportune time when moving the seat between cars. The communication with Britax customer service was pretty straightforward, and after sending pictures of the broken button and explanation of the issue, we were sent a new seat. The new seat has been working fine, though still a bit heavy for me. I wish it came with a cupholder built in like some other car seats.",

The seat is a litle bulky anyway and in the winter months when there are extra clothes to contend with too, another two inches of strap would be most helpful. Aside from this relatively minor issue, I feel totally safe with my baby in this seat. Would still recommend for purchase, but buyer be informed. Installation was super easy too. Really like the ease and simplicity of that.",

We still really struggled so called customer service. They gave us some suggestions, which have helped. In hindsight, it's not ideal for a newborn but we'll persist with it as he's growing so fast now.",

And it has a steal frame so it's one of the SAFEST on the market! Our daughter use to cry when she had to go in her infant seat- and shed cry when we were on the road. It was miserable for everyone. Now, she just hangs out and is along for the ride. It's a little expensive but definitely worth it! And because it's a reliable and well known brand you could resell it once your done with it.",
