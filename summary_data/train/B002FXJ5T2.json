So, i had to incur an extra expense, by buying the self-adhesive photo squares to ensure that the photos would stay in place. Additionally, the horizontal (left to right) pockets are open-ended; Despite the pocket flaws, i kept the album because finding a durable photo album to hold 500 photos was exhausting.",

It worked out perfectly for the photos that I chose to include. It does have an interesting smell when brand-new, but that goes away with time. I only wish that the album had different cover choices. The pages are very strong and the plastic does not rip like in other albums. If you were looking for a high-capacity photo album, I suggest you purchase this one.",
