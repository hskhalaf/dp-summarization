      "text": "The hi hats sound fine and are definitely fine for most musical styles. The crash, however, has a shallow cartoonish sound that I can only imagine would fit in a high school garage rock band. It produces a horribly distracting tone and is useless for me. This is partly due to the fact that it's a smaller crash (14\", compared to say a 16\" crash), but the sound should still not be THIS poor. The splash is just a smaller and more cartoonish version of the crash; I assume they're just giving those away because they're so niche. All in all, you get what you pay for.",
