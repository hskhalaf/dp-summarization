Best Buys is selling the XE521QAB-K02US which has a metal top, metal keyboard deck and a plastic bottom. It weight 2.93 lbs and has a 30 Watt Hours battery. Amazon is selling the XE520QAB-K02US which has a plastic top, plastic keyboard deck and a plastic bottom. It weight 2.98 lbs and has a 39 Watt Hours battery. I own the latter. I like the extra 30% battery life. I do the find keyboard wrist rest a bit uncomfortable since the plastic edge is not rounded like the metal version.",

In order to get a warranty from Samsung, I have to send the charger and laptop back to them. Since I have been using the laptop daily this is a big inconvenience. I'll end up just buying a new charger myself, but I'll definitely avoid Samsung in the future with these types of warranty policies.",

The one from Amazon still works wonderfully (crosses fingers). I replaced my much loved Samsung with an Asus C434. It doesn't have some of the features; only 1920x1080 vs 1900x1200 which I had liked. No built in stylus. However, none of that really matters if it is going to disintegrate in a few months. Yes, I know, this really should be a one star review.",
