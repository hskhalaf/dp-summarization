I think this is an ideal cpu for like 90% of people :) I have overclocked it to 3.8 with 1.38 and for sure it can go 3.9. Very nice cpu. Very fast system. I am shocked. For the price it is a bargain. You have to buy it. For me it is a placeholder for Ryzen 3000 1000000 cores :) tomorrow we will know the details :) just buy this little bastard ! :)",
