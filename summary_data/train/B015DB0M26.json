Guess you could say the product worked not only worked to deter our new critter from re-use of the spot, but our use of the entire room, too. Update: Vendor contacted me to offer full refund, and say they were working to reduce intense scent (as also noted by other customers).",

The initial smell after using it is a bit strong, so if you have folks at home with sensitive noses, asthma etc. (like us) then you'll want to put a fan on and leave a window open until it has dried and aired out a bit. But as far as ridding my home office of cat urine odor--I rate it an A Plus!! I had tried other stuff--vinegar, \"natural\" cleanser with tea tree oil, carpet foam spray--none of that worked. In fact the vinegar made it worse--smelled sour. My wife says I used too much--she's probably right. Anyway, this spray got rid of all that smell. I'm very pleased with the results.",

      "GET RID OF STAINS OLD AND NEW: Our formula is professional strength, triple action and contains Bio-Enzymes along with helpful bacteria to effectively neutralize odors and get rid of the toughest stains. The Bio-enzymes break up the tiny particles of the stain which is then consumed by the bacteria. Once the waste material is gone, the bacteria die.
