I wouldn't push the envelope by wiggling around a lot, but on a flat surface, is comfortable and stable . When you need to sit down a minute, it's a godsend. I bought this model, because I will attach a small (removable) strap through the handle to carry this on one shoulder when I travel or tour. It also has substantial rubber stoppers, where other models have plastic stoppers.",

Additionally, the hand grip appears to be more for carrying rather than for walking. Recommendation: change the handle grip and also make the upper portion adjustable for better height placement of the grip.",

I will add a strap to carry it with me over the shoulder since I do not require a cane to walk most times. UPDATE I have used this seat several times since purchase. Indeed, it has been a lifesaver. I really need to add the strap however, just for convenience sake!",

It is much steadier that way and the handle gives you something to lean on and helps you stand up and get off of it! It's not that heavy or bulky either and it works great as a cane when folded. Very happy with it.",
