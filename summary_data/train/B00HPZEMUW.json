We add water because I guess it tastes better- it's how he liked his old food as well, and he's getting older.

He's down to 70# now 8 mos later.... which might be a little too much weight loss. Heh, we'll increase or maybe mix it with wet stuff or half and half with regular?

      "text": "My bassets do well on Hill's Science Diet. I've used the Light formula for several years and trimmed 8-10 pounds off my chow hounds. They love the taste, so I tried the Perfect Weight formula now that their weight is where it should be. This variety was a more expensive than the light formula $33 as opposed to $26 on Prime), but what I didn't realize until later is that the bag is also 2 1/2 pounds lighter. I've gone back to the Light variety, still a great product but far less expensive.",
