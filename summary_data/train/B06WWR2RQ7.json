      "text": "My 4 month old absolutely loves this toy! She can grab it easily and loves popping it in her mouth. Just use regular warm water and soap to wash it... I learned the hard way when I dipped it in some boiling water with her other teether that can be boiled for 5 min for sterilizing. The little knobs started to shrivel/melt. So that was my fault. I wasn't thinking as her other teethers can be boiled. I'd purchase again. She enjoys it! All the pretty colors and rattling sound.",

I\u2019ve never had any issues with any of her other teething toys until now. This toy totally melted in the boil and it was only in there for a few seconds. Over all the toy is great for sensory play, but now the plastic is misshapen and a little sharp on parts so I\u2019m worried about her putting it in her mouth.",
