When I use it I still will have very small remnants of eye makeup (mascara or eyeliner) but for the most part it takes like 98% of make-up off. I just use a little lotion or coconut oil to remove the last bits of eye makeup. It does have to be soaked to work really well, and I did wash mine by hand the first time before using it. But it even takes off full face WATERPROOF make-up!!!! Call Herminone Granger, because she wants her magic make up eraser back.",

It requires much more rubbing to get waterproof mascara off and caused more irritation. I could get the same results from a washcloth in my linen closet.",

I haven\u2019t broken out at all since switching over to MUE (it\u2019s been about 6 months now). All I do is throw it in the wash each week and it\u2019s good as new again.
