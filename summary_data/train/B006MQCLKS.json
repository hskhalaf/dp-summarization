It rained all weekend and puddles of water got between the tarp and the floor. The water impregnated the material and after around 10 hours started coming through the floor. My clothes got wet and I was miserable and had to buy a hotel room. DO NOT BUY THIS TENT. Get a regular tent with a water impervious floor. Eureka has no business making tents if it doesn't know that floors have to be waterproof. DO NOT BUY.",

Technically this tent (and any other tent) is rated for 4 people, will sleep 4 people, BUT WOULD BE VERY CRAMPED and much too crowded if you had to spend the day inside due to rain, especially if you wanted to include some camping furniture inside. At a minimum, I'd suggest a \"6-8 person tent\" for 3-4 people! I bought my first (of several) Eureka tents over 40 years ago, and the quality is still there. I especially like the heigh so I can stand up and the oversized windows for summer ventilation. i would buy this (or the larger version) again!",

The poles are so sturdy and it held up in a few heavy rainstorms. The windows are perfect! There is a large window for views on each side and we enjoyed waking up and unzipping them to see the amazing views (the dogs loved it too). This would also work well as a \u201cshade tent\u201d for a table and chairs to keep the mosquitos away. Great purchase!",

Small issues in design is the door zippers are at the bottom, not two way zippers, hard to bend to get the lower one. No pockets or storage lower than say 6 ft in this 7 ft tall tent, which has been a real issue. Over all a good tent but I do wish I'd researched my purchase more. Okay with my purchase.",
