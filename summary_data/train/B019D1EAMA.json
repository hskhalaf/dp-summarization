But there were those who didn\u2019t like the quality of the tread because it wore off too quickly on them, and the fit wasn\u2019t as agreeable to others. Still, this neutral shoe became a popular choice among neutral runners.",

      "text": "If you liked the vazee 2090 (like I did), unfortunately new balance killed it. It basically splintered into two shoes: The Pace and the FuelCell. The FuelCell is a performance, lightweight shoe, that usually starts to bug my arches/feet if I run in it too often, as it really doesn't have a lot of the support/cushioning needed. The Pace on the other hand is more of an everyday trainer and which lacks some of the presonsive of the fuelcell. So if you are looking for an everyday trainer similar to the 2090, this is your guy. If you are looking for performance, go for the fuelcell.",

I saw these, and they were half the price then on eBay. The price fluctuated a lot, and when they came down to $70, I jumped On them. They look great, and are very nicely made. The one thing I can\u2019t get over is how light they are. I\u2019m not a runner, so I never really had running sneakers before, but they feel like they are barely on my feet. As they break in more, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get even more comfortable. They will be perfect for my upcoming trip to Disney.",

    "description": "New Balance MPACEV2 Running Shoes Hold tight, the Vazee Pace v2 is here to enhance your ride even further. Still a go-to for both Team NB and casual runners alike, version 2 boasts an impressive podular forefoot for responsiveness. 2-tone knit mesh and textile overlays complete the design, bringing high fashion to high performance. Two-Tone Mesh Upper Mesh and synthetic uppers will encase each foot in breathable comfort. Perforates in the fabric at the forefoot increase airflow; creating a better, healthier environment for your feet to thrive in. The open design allows for natural toe splay at toe-off, keeping each and every one of your strides smooth and organic. The bootie construction features for a seamless, sock-like fit; because we recognise how rubbing and blisters can ruin your day. No-sew synthetic overlays wrap the midfoot securely, reducing in-shoe slippage for an easy, distraction-free ride. REVlite Midsole REVlite resides underfoot for durable and responsive cushioning, whilst maintaining that lightweight and aggressive, race-ready feel. 30% lighter than its competitors, REVlite will spare your joints as you strike down hard and fast onto unforgiving track surfaces, without compromising its feather weight. The midsole's bounce-back properties mean that superfluous use of muscle power is reduced; diminishing fatigue and keeping you energised for longer. Blown rubber fortifies the REVlite, upping durability to leave you with a plush and permanent shoe. Blown Rubber Outsole A blown rubber outsole completes the shoe, infusing every stride with extra cushion and flexible grip. Choose the Vazee Pace v2, for lightweight speed and supple comfort.",
