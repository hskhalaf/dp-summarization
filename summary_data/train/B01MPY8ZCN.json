After taking quite a few tumbles in the snow while skiing these got wet on the inside, but unless you're rolling in the snow like I was, you will probably be fine. They got wet on only 1 out of 4 ski days. The weather was around 10 degrees F and these were perfect. They were actually too warm for my hands outside of skiing, but that may be because my hands tend to get clammy easily. Would definitely recommend.",

While they are not waterproof, my hands did not get wet from them being in and out of the snow that day. I used them for 2 days of skiing - less than 10 hours. I was only on intermediate trails and was not doing any extreme activity with these gloves on. After two days, they were already ripping and frayed at the edges. And one of the hooks ripped off, too. See the attached pictures. I would not recommend these gloves.",
