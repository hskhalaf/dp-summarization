Everyone is surprised when I tell them it is plastic, because it looks like it is made of natural fiber. The colors are very bright, and the design is great. I needed a large rug that was waterproof, and that wouldn't trap debris as it is on my front porch. It is easy to sweep, and a really nice piece of design to add to my porch. Great purchase!",

Durable, doesn't absorb moisture, plus the dog loves to lay on it. When I'm ready to hit the road, just give it a good shake, roll it up, bungee it, and slide it under the bed and out of the way. No fading or fraying. Great purchase!",

Would absolutely recommend.",

No mildew and this mat has been through many storms and floods. This year (after 4 years) she was going to order another one because she thought it was fading slightly from the sun exposure. She pulled it up and realized the back was vibrant and looked new. She flipped it over and is good for years to come.....no mildew, discoloration or signs of water damage. I'm loving this purchase and truly makes a big difference on my porch. Loving Amazon!",

    "title": "Mad Mats Oriental Turkish Indoor/Outdoor Floor Mat, 6 by 9-Feet, Aqua",
    "description": "Come with us to the kasbah on our best selling Turkish patterned rugs. Mariachi Imports bold sense of color has infused this classic rug design with a renewed boldness, making them as beautiful in your outdoor space as in. Mad Mats are made from 100% recycled plastic, are UV protected and fade-proof, and come with our one-year color guarantee. Because our rugs are handmade, pattern, color and size may vary slightly.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMad Mats' patterns are intricately woven. Multi-colored threads are woven in much the same fashion as real flat weave wool rugs. The result is a warmth and depth of color usually only available to the interior rug market. Most outdoor plastic mats on the market today are made from a combination of virgin polypropylene (PPL) and polystyrene. Mad Mats' plastic is completely different. First, our polypropylene is recycled from used soda bottles, milk bottles, packing, etc. We use only the highest grade of this recycled PPL. Then we combine it with state of the art conditioners and U.V. inhibitors to produce soft, resilient colorfast threads. Our soft tubular threads don't absorb dirt or stains of any kind. Leaves, debris, and food spills are easily rinsed away with a garden hose. They are truly carefree! This is a major advantage of Mad Mats. Most outdoor rugs are a dense weave of spun poly thread. They hold moisture for days which then gets tracked into the house. Grass, food, and dirt seep into the fiber where they remain until the rug is pulled up and washed, dried, and put back in place. YUCK! Mad Mats breathe. They don't trap water so they won't mildew and they won't rot wooden decks. Water goes right through them and evaporates right back out of them. Walking on Mad Mats the morning after a rainy night will leave your feet dry enough to walk right into the house. You put it down and that's it! All Mariachi products are produced under fair trade conditions. We do not work with factories that employ children or produce environmentally harmful waste.",
