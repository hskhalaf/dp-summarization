Once I researched the other brand of nutritional drinks, I knew I needed to find another option. I went with the Orgain kids formula because it was lower in protein which grandma digest better and it had the best taste. Grandma loves the taste and drinks the shake down in about 20 minutes. I know in the hospital grandma has refused the other brand of drinks because of how they tasted and made her feel. I am so happy to have a much better alternative to the other brand of nutritional drinks.",

To make it edible I\u2019m going to have to add it to a smoothie or something which is much less convenient. For the price of twelve of these I can\u2019t just let them go to waste, but I will not purchase this again.",
