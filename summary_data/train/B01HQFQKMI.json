We washed it twice since owning the comforter. Yesterday was the second time we washed it and I noticed a hole with the comforter filling coming out. Each time this comforter was washed, it was washed by itself and on delicates. Pretty bummed out that I will need to purchase a new comforter after paying basically $40 for this comforter and it already started to fall apart after 3 months with no usuage by any people.",

I probably wouldn't have spent what I did on a flat comforter. Just be aware when you buy this, that is what your getting. Otherwise, I was impressed with how big it was. Usually any comfoorterr on my cal king bed is really short. This one is very generous in size.",

      "text": "The product I received does not look like the picture. The squares are completely different and it is far from luxury. The picture shows large squres and on mine it is outlined and then has small squares. It\u2019s paper thin material and ripped in 4-5 sections just from me opening up the package. It\u2019s very thin and light weight, feels like something from Walmart. I think the product was switched since it does not look like the picture shown or like other pictures from buyers with 4+ stars.",
