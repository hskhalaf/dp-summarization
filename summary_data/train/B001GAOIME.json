Pro tip: According to what I've read from reputable sources, the % of DEET determines how LONG it will keep mosquitoes from biting, NOT how EFFECTIVE it is at keeping them from biting. If you expect only short exposure periods, you can by products containing less DEET and save a considerable amount of money over higher percentage products. Spending an hour in the back yard? Lower percentage DEET. Spending hours out camping? Higher percentage DEET.",
