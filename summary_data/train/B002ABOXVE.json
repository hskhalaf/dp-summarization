I recommend you order at least a half size larger than you need and perhaps even a full size. Other than that the shoes are good looking and of high quality.

As with any ballroom shoe, they are meant to fit snugly at first so the leather can stretch and conform to your feet as they are broken in over time. You can speed the process along by folding them forward and back and beating the soles, just as you would work a new baseball cap. Also you will need to roughen up the suede bottoms with a steel shoe brush to maintain the proper floor grip and keep the soles from getting slippery. Great low cost dance shoes.",

    "title": "Capezio Men's SD103 Social Dance Shoe",
    "description": "Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes. The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance. Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.",
