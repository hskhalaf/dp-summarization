I have run in saucony two marathons and this was my third, the shoes are great but I have never felt the pain in my joints with the previous saucony. Over all they are great for work.",

They are lightweight but reasonably stiff sole makes you feel like you are getting a lot of support with a neutral minimal drop shoe. Felt great on the first run. I would consider these to be a good high mileage shoe, I am going to use them for my current training and October marathon",

I'm a big guy, 6', 220 lbs, who works out 3-4 days weekly which includes jogging on a track, sidewalk, or trail. My feet are supported nicely through the arch, the heel, and snug but comfortable through the toe box. I typically purchase Nikes and Under Armour however these shoes have converted me to a Saucony fan. They are my first pair of Saucony's and not only do they feel amazing, they look really sharp and I have received several compliments about my shoes. They definitely stand out! Oh yeah...........THE PRICE!!! What a great price!",

Utilizing midfoot hugging stretch components, the heel and forefoot of the shoe are able to flex and move with the Foot delivering a secure yet more natural feeling fit and ride. The Comfortlite Sockliner ensures a highly responsive feel underfoot, while also providing support to the arch and reduce peak pressure in forefoot. An advanced midsole engineered using POWERGRID absorbs a disperses impact shock and distributes pressure. The unique lightweight ultra premium cushioning foam integrated with GRID technology creates a system that effectively centres the foot and ounce for ounce delivers a smoother more rebound filled ride. SRC delivers durable and consistent shock absorption in the heel crashpad to assist with the reduction of torque and allow for a clean heel strike and transition into the midfoot while running. Ensuring the longevity of the shoes support and cushioning a second density medial post adds that extra support for consistent responsiveness mile after mile A supremely lightweight yet durable outsole rubber enhances the existing attributes of the shoe. Engineered using IBR+ technology, when compared to standard blown rubber the outsole delivers higher cushioning properties at 33% lighter.
