Haven't tried anything hardcore graphics wise yet, but the games I am playing are smooth and with no issues (lag, stuttering, etc). Came with keyboard and mouse, but the mouse I wouldn't recommend using (pretty cheap plastic thing that just lights up and looks cool; I have a simple wireless mouse that performs better). Overall this pc is well worth it at a great price. Plus with how the motherboard is set up by amd, you can always upgrade to a later model cpu in the ryzen series. Lighting effects are pretty cool and it's super quiet. Love this rig!",

Also, the keyboard is 100% junk. It will pipe character input randomly. So, once you get this box do not use the keyboard. Again, it is pure junk. I have bought two of these boxes and each keyboard was junk with inputting random pipes. If you don't know what a character pipe is do a quick google for Bash Scripting Pipping.

Having no idea what one should spend on a machine like this, I'm still VERY happy with this purchase. I had no idea how slow my last (4 year old) PC was until now. LOVE IT! PS: Monitor NOT included but the packaging was top notch and got a tote, keyboard and mouse, too!",

So far, he can play any game he's installed smoothly: Rainbow Six Siege, Day Z, CS:GO, Insurgency Sandstorm, Left for Dead 2...and more. I was super impressed with the keyboard that comes with it---the keys are elevated and springy, great for gaming---and equally impressive was the remote-controlled fan and lighting, such a neat feature to 'show-off' to friends and family! Finally, I loved how easy it was to setup--we literally had it up-and-running in about 5-10 minutes on Christmas morning. Will definitely purchase from Skytech gaming again in the future.",

Their support email team did send an email back to me within 24 hours advising there was a button somewhere that will also control the fans. I have not yet heard back but I only just followed up. So far everything works for the mid level gaming that I want and I would definitely look to this company for other systems.",

Absolutely worth the price if you are not interested in building a computer yourself 3. The manufacturer cut costs in all the correct places so that your gaming experience is the focus",
