But I still got a product that is usable so am not expecting any compensation or anything like that. This ended up being like a clear nail polish. It doesn't work as obviously as the serum does, it's hard to say if it makes anything grow faster but I have also not been applying it as often as other reviewers. If you are looking for the gooey gel that you just rub on your nails, make sure you get the one that says \"SERUM\" on the BOTTLE TOO, not just in the amazon title.",

However, research suggests nails don't absorb nutrients or strengther, anyway. Oral vitamens probably work much better for nail growth and strength.",
