Thirty + years ago, I wore 5lb weights, but now the one pounders will do what I want and worse come to worse, I'll put two of them around my one ankle to strengthen the one leg that's lagging behind. The quality is excellent and they are very sturdy. The Velcro straps are generous in length and clasp securely. I would recommend them to anyone. (This is not a paid endorsement and I don't receive any monetary gains from my review. I feel it's important to support good products like these.)",

They are a little bulky, but for 15lb weights, no more than I would expect. Quality seems very good. Worth the money!",
