      "text": "I've used several Hydor heaters in my aquariums over the years and I haven't had a single issue with them. When purchasing heaters it's important to not skimp, especially because a heater malfunction can end up KO'ing all your hard work in your aquarium. This heater has been performing wonderfully so far and I'm very pleased with how consistent it keeps the temperature of my aquarium. It's very easy to secure to your hoses as well, I've had no leaks with just the built in cuffs that clamp onto the hoses. If you are on the fence about getting an in-line heater then pull the trigger, you won't be disappointed!",

I noticed this after my other thermometer read 72 instead of 78. I had to turn this heater up to 84 to get it to kick on again. Thankfully its plugged into the thermometer outlet which will feed or cut power to the heater (which was only intended as a safety layer). I'll be super bummed if it gets so inaccurate that it never turns on though.",

The instructions say vertical mount only so after adding soft bends for tubing it takes up quite a bit of space. I don\u2019t have it connected to a large tank so it doesn\u2019t work very hard. That might prevent over heating but at one point I accidentally turned it up to 88 degrees. It was able to heat the water but barely turned off. There are no fish yet so no harm done.

Yes, it's clumsy and bulky is demanding on positioning, but it did free up the aquarium and has kept it warm. For a fantastic 5 months, after which it just stopped heating... Good think the controller has warned me up and I could put another heater in. Paying this price for a think that can't last even a year (with all the right maintenance) - nah, thank you.",

It is slightly louder than my previous in tank heater. This one is not in an enclosed space. It isn't loud enough to bother me or I would try wrapping it with some insulation.",
