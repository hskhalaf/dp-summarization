I ended up buying a Huggies container at Target (that closes) and am just refilling the container with half of a pkg at a time (all that can fit) so they don\u2019t dry out. Then I tape closed the other 1/2 of the pkg. until it\u2019s ready for refilling. Otherwise the product itself is fine.",

Although a little inconvenient and pricier, I will just purchase from the store. I was looking forward to the convenience of having it on subscription. I hope Huggies/Amazon finds out what could be the culprit of that found odor since the wipes are unscented.",

In my opinion, Huggies wipes are better for use with newborns and babies up to 6 months because they have very runny stools, particularly if they're completely breastfed. Huggies wipes worked perfectly, with the right amount of moistness to clean the mess. I found that using Pampers with my newborn was more messy than using Huggies because Pamper wipes were often too moist, and using very moist wipes to wipe runny stools off a baby's bum would get very messy and left the bum wet and prone to diaper rash.",

They're tough, just moist enough to take most caked on substances off, without soaking something, and there is no scent with very little residue/cleaning agents.

For cleaning babies, they are great because they sooth skin and are soft, but they still get the really sticky stuff off!",

My baby has had allergic rashes in response to other wipes but has not had rashes with the combination of these wipes, max strength desitin, and pampers swaddlers. I recommend these wipes to others! I give 4 stars and not 5 because I would prefer smaller refill packages when buying in bulk (so one can go in the diaper bag) and the wipes tend to tear about one out 5 wipes I use (likely due to the high water content, so I do understand).",

Pampers rewards let you scan the product which is 1000 times better. That's why I kicked a star off because i like the product and would love to use the rewards \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "We have been using these wipes almost exclusively from the birth of my son in Jan of 2015. We love them. They are thick and moist, and clean up messes well. We have tried other brands (shower gifts and very good deals) and keep coming back to these. I have a tub in the nursery, a clutch in the diaper bag and one of the stand-up small tubs in the kitchen/living room; the refill concept is perfect for us.",

These value packs are no different and offer both quality and they are offered at a reasonable price. What more could a mother ask for? Well maybe wipes that don't rip in the middle of a hectic diaper change... needless to say a diaper that rips in the middle of a poopy diaper is less than ideal. So if they could be slightly more durable that would be the only improvement I could ever ask for!",

Now I have a whole box I can't use and STILL have to buy more wipes. At least the daycare can use this donation of wipes.:(",
