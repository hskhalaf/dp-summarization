She is on the brink of reading, but not quite there yet, and is able to navigate and play this game with very little guidance. Having her hand(s) over part of the tiles when pressing the 'run' button seems to be her most frequent obstacle, for which the app doesn't offer a lot of guidance, but it's nudges for everything else seem to be spot on. I'm impressed with the design and experience they have built for this game.",

You have to move the characters using codes and then collect strawberries. Later on you use your strawberries to build things in your virtual village. The longer the code the more points you get for strawberries collected. You have to collect a certain amount of strawberries to advance to the next level.
