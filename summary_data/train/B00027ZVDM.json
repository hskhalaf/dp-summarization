The best thing about this food though, is that it doesn't have the rank smell that can sometimes accompany snacks for the hermit crabs, and so it makes it easy, and painless to pour and to change when needed. I would buy this again for sure",

I mix a variety of foods in a zip lock bag, squeeze the air out, and use a rolling pin to crush the foods into a chunky powder. When I crush and mix a couple of foods together it goes a lot farther than the larger pellet form, and they continue to get a well balanced diet. I will treat them with fresh fruit and vegetables also.",
