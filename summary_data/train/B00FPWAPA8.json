My only suggestion for people using it is to make sure you use flour to dust the stone in the pizza-maker before you put the dough down, and put the dough down before you put on toppings. Making the pizza on counter and then trying to move it to the pizza had some very messy results.",

The crust cooks at the same pace as the top, so you don't have to pre-cook the crust like I had to on my pizza stones. It is easy to clean, and comes with a nice split pizza-tray to help load and unload. It's electric powered so it can be used inside, I love mine!",

Although due to the variations in pizzas one must use experience as a guide to proper cooking times. The overall construction does not approach the sturdiness of others made with a cast aluminum body but considering the purpose for which this unit is made the construction should be sound enough to last many years. I really like this unit and recommend it over others costing much more.",
