      "text": "I needed a small-ish day pack to take into Walt Disney World. This was perfect. Not too big (even full, it fit nicely into the \"locker\" compartments on Mission Space), but very roomy. I'm not a fan of bags that have lots and lots of pockets -- this is simplicity itself with just the front zipper pocket and the main space with a laptop sleeve. I wouldn't call this rugged enough for camping or heavy duty use, but for a stylish day bag it was just right.",

    "description": "The sleek and simple 365, 21-liter backpack has everything you need and nothing you don't. The roomy main compartment features a non-padded laptop sleeve that fits most 15\u201d laptops. The zippered front compartment holds all your smaller items. The 365 is ideal for everyday use thanks to padded shoulder straps and a durable padded bottom panel. This unisex pack is offered in numerous colors and patterns. Includes a limited lifetime warranty.\n\nCare Instructions:\nAdventures are messy. If your Dakine bag gets dirty, we recommend hand washing with mild soap (like Nikwax Tech Wash), cold water and a soft bristle brush. If hand washing is not going to do the trick, use a front loader washing machine. To ensure your backpack doesn't get tangled, place inside a pillowcase or mesh bag before washing. Always use cold water, mild soap and run on a gentle cycle. Never bleach your pack. Hang to dry in a warm but shady place, ensuring both inside and out are dry before storing.",
