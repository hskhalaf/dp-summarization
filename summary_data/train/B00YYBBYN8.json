The water isn't coming through the spout, but something around the spout. Before they both started leaking I loved the built in carabiner. I loved the easy way to open it and the fact that it had a straw. Now I just hate them.",

The soft mouth peace is supper nice and feels good too. Drinks very comfy. Cons: after some time the seal is not the best. So if it's not standing up right it leaks. It's annoying but it drips very slowly so it's still very usable. Conclusion: the clip is so convenient I think it's worth the inconvenience of the dripping. Plus it's just comfortable to use because of the straw. Would not spend over $15, at $12 good, I wish it was $7 I would be very content.",

That being said, my cup holders are bigger than normal and I am not bothered by the noise. Love this bottle! I got 3 more to give as Xmas gifts",

      "text": "This is my second of these bottles I ordered as a back up in case my first breaks! I LOVE them! The size is perfect as I drink a ton of water a day, the spout is gray to have as a nursing mom, I don't always have 2 hands to open the lid of a bottle, so the button flip spout is perfect. I do notice it'll leak a little if the bottle is full and gets tipped over. If it's at least a quarter empty it won't leak though.",
