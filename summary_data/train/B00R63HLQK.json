And the yellow cushion helps a lot, one complaint from the other 2 potties was that after a few minutes the hard plastic was difficult to sit on... not this potty!",

      "text": "This is a really cute potty, but we have two complaints. It's a little flimsy compared to the other one we have. And it's way too small!! Now, my son is big, but I don't see how any boy could manage this thing. Plus the foam cushion comes off. I found my daughter trying to put it over her head as a hat...yuck. It even easily comes off when my son sits on it. They should have Velcro or something to stick it down. Big disappointment. My son won't use it.",
