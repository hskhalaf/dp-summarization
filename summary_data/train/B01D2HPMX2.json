      "text": "This bathing suit is a waste of money. The cups come bent and twisted so much that removing them through the provided hole is the only way to get it on. There isn\u2019t enough fabric in the cups and it offers no support whatsoever. Not only is the halter style tie annoying flimsy, the elastic around the back slides down every time you move. If you have a very small chest and plan on not doing anything in the bath in suit other than stand still it might be ok but this was a huge waste of money and I wish I didn\u2019t buy it",

It shows the good stuff and hides most of the bad. I don't like the removable cups that shift around if you have to adjust the suit at all once it's on. I might have to sew in the cups and sew the halter straps criss-cross. The elastic that keeps the back up is tight feeling. Some of this is a result of the suit cut for a taller (average height) person but I think the design needs a few upgrades.",

If your very full figured below get the same size you normally do if your like me with more petite lower half and all boobs and tummy up top then size down",

I have been wearing panties under it for swimming. #2, the foam cups in the top shift while swimming and end up at the top of the bra area, folded or bunched up. I had to remove them for swimming. The suit is very heavy as well but it is double lined for a non see through advantage. I love the colors too.",
