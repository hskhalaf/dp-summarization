We replaced the ice once in a week of use vs every two days. That's a huge difference.",

Built in bottle opener and tie downs straps also get used all the time. Only area of improvement would be the handle. It only extends straight out and does not extend upwards at all.

I've been using them side by side for a couple of weeks and the Coleman keeps ice longer than the expensive Pelican (even when following the manufacturers instructions). I've requested to return the pelican, but the seller doesn't pay for the return shipping (and this thing weighs a lot) and charges up to 50% to restock! I wish I hadn't wasted my money or trusted this seller!",

The cooler is heavy to roll around,so I guess I just have to bite the bullet and use it as a seat,I didn't tell my friends the price. Can't trust all the reviews I read.",
