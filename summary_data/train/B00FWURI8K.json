But overall it's been working almost 24x7 and no problems whatsoever till now. I would recommend it because it's affordable and very easy to install and use with the basic functions. I've also connected my IP camera to it and it notifies by email me when movement is detected, as some kind of alarm. The DSM web interface is very intuitive also and you can configure many things from there.",

I tried one's from Buffalo and others without a lot of success. From a hardware perspective, Synology is very robust. If you are going to be sync'ing a lot of data over the internet, I wouldn't recommend their sync tools though. I need to sync about 2TB, and the tools they have just aren't sophisticated enough for me. Problems with error checking, bandwidth control, pausing sync, etc. I use GoodSync to sync...and, that works amazing.",

I uploaded something like 50gb of photos and this really took days to finish processing. During that time it was difficult to use. Otherwise, it is an excellent solution and I may get another from the same brand.",

Installation of the drive in the Diskstation, software installation and uploading of files to the network drive went smoothly on my desktop running Windows 7. However, access to the uploaded files on the network using other household PCs was problematic and there is no instruction manual. Help with setup of the network configuration and troubleshooting is minimal. For that reason I would not recommend it to anyone who is not thoroughly savvy in network software and the terminology thereof.",

When a new CVE (security vulnerability) comes up I will see an update from Synology within a few weeks. They are dedicated to their products and that should I ever need a larger device I would ONLY buy Synology. I use this device as my storage (of course), mail server, VPN server, media server and it has never let me down.",
