      "text": "What I received was just a bag of the powdered mix with no scoop, not the canister as shown. The bag I received would most likely be used in its entirety to make up a cooler full of gatorade such as sports teams use at events. This is not what is pictured or described, and not what I wanted (or ordered!) or expected for use at home. Pretty aggravating. Had to split up the powder in a couple canning jars and fortunately, still had a scoop from our last canister to use for measuring. I will not buy from this seller again.",

I mostly run to not be a fat ass, so more carbs at the end that aren't something awesome like ice cream was a bummer - negligible in the end, but still not what I thought was coming my way when I ordered.",
