I bought this when the university I was attending implemented a policy requiring students to pay per page printed. I did the math, and with ink and paper, I projected I would break even on the cost of purchasing this to print at home within three semesters. That was undergrad; I'm halfway through a Ph.D. and my partner went back to school too, and the printer is still doing a great job. It's definitely cheaper to print at home, even in color, than to pay what our current universities charge to print.",

Real, but not terrible annoyances. The print quality is excellent, and it is a lot faster than the older machine it replaces. I would recommend it for home/home office use.

It uses way too much ink just booting. The Media Card slots worked very well, both to print form the printer, and to read the cards over the network. The interface was relatively intuitive and overall it was a solid printer. It was simply wasteful of ink and it's printing quality degraded quickly after about a year or so.",

The noise factor is a little more than average, not really bad but it is more than we expected.

The installation instructions are seriously lacking in clarity when installing on a Windows 7 system. I had to call HP to get help. Concerning the HP support group, they were great!! The tech spent an hour on the phone making sure that the installation was complete and the printer functioning properly. I'm not that technically adept but I can read and comprehend well written instructions. HP can do a better job with their 'Getting Started\" guide.",

The printer broke down exactly 2 month after the warranty expired I called HP customer service and they offered to give me a support over the phone for $20 fee!! that support didn't do much cause the printer still showed an error msg, so I just spent another $20 on a non working printer. Their next best solution is ? \"we will give you a $20 credit toward a new HP printer.\" GREAT!!! the price they offered to give me the printer for was actually $100 more expansive than the price on AMAZON.com. besides why would you buy another HP printer ever again ??? Worst customer service ever!!!",
