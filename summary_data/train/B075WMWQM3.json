      "text": "Pro: The case for the Apple watch arrived quickly and on inspection seems like a great idea. The installation was simple and fairly easy, I liked the idea that my watch screen was protected. Con: If you exercise or work outside it will build up condensation under the case when you sweat or if it is raining. It almost seems as if it attracts moisture under the case. I don't know how long it would take to dry out again on its own, because I removed it and dried off my watch. The repeated task of taking it off, drying it out, and reinstalling isn't worth the protection.",

You have to take the bands of the watch off every time you need to remove this cover.

It's already averted a couple catastrophes -- one drop, one spraying with dishwater -- and yet it hasn't interfered with her use of her iWatch, including having conversations. Audio and visual are easy to hear and see. No downsides!",
