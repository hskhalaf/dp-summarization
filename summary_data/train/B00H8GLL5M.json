All of these problems cause the engine to overwork and almost Stall on my lawn.

      "text": "I have used this mower twice now and It does not run right, changed the gas and the oil, mowed or tried to mow my flat small lawn that is dry and all I can say is that it took patience to get the job done. I have it set on the highest setting and pushing slow the engine sputters and quits very easy. The electric start works good as have to use often. I didn't want to get the CA emissions was afraid it would cut down on power but this is ridiculous. Just found out nearest repair place is 60 miles away so sorry have to have repair after using twice.",

This bag doesn't fit right. There's a lot that falls out when removing it. It's not a deal breaker but it prevents my opinion from giving it a 5-star review. I'd recommend it for the value but know that it either mulches or bags the clippings (with only a rear discharge) and there will be several handfuls of clippings you'll have to pick up after removing the bag.",
