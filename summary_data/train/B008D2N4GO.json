I could not believe my whole book fit inside the purse, there is sooooo much room in it, even though it is soo small!!!! it doesn't smell like mildew at all, but it does smell like genuine leather. this is a 10/10 buy and I would definitely purchase it again!",

I already had one this size but it did not have all the pockets and slots for organizing like this one does (and my old one was cheap material). I was skeptical about it being leather but it looks and smells like genuine leather (so it will last longer than my cheaply made DESIGNER purse) and I paid a lot less for it. So yes I would recommend this purse- just keep in mind it is not a big hand bag but a little purse with lots of organizational space.",
