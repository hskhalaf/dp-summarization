Ran TV, 4 box fans, large refrigerator, a few lamps and wireless router in addition to phone chargers etc. I was out of power for 3 days and ran it constant on 7 gallons of fuel. I never exceeded 40% capacity. Would strongly recommend this to anyone needing a backup generator for the home or camping. Super quiet compared to others.",

The replacement when started sent gas everywhere inside the case. It was not evident where it was coming from, but continued leaking until all the gas in the unit leaked out. The disappointment was how Generac responded with the issues on two brand new generators. They informed us to take them to a repair shop, which quoted multi weeks repair times. Amazon made everything right though.",

VERY quiet , even under load i was impressed .. didn't give it 5 stars because none of my gages worked when it got here , i had to undo the front panel and connect the wires myself after calling they're customer service, that's annoying ..HOPE they're quality control is better than that on the parts that matter ...only time will tell how sturdy these are really , its only been released for 5 months now....so far tho i am impressed .... wasn't about to pay 1K for the Honda A friend has one.",

    "description": "Style:iQ2000Generac\u2019s iQ2000 is the ideal generator for powering your desired loads in a variety of outdoor environments, including parks, campsites, backyard parties and tailgating events. Third-party testing has proven the iQ2000 to be quieter than its competitors*, which allows users to provide power to their desired loads without disturbing those around them. The generator can be connected to a variety of sensitive appliances, including electronics, as its digital inverter module converts the raw power it produces from DC to AC power. Best of all, the iQ2000 is easy to use and boasts innovative features not found on any other inverter generator in the industry. While the unit\u2019s Start, Run and Stop functions can be manually set via the iQ2000\u2019s PowerDial, users can toggle between Turbo, Standard and Economy modes through the use of a simple switch to reduce noise and fuel consumption rates based on load requirements. When items requiring higher power outputs are connected to the generator, Turbo mode should be utilized. For loads requiring minimal power output, switching to Economy mode is recommended; Standard mode should be utilized for all intermediate load requirements. To accommodate larger load requirements, the iQ2000 is also parallel capable. Users can nearly double the power output available to their desired loads by connecting two generators through the use of an optional Parallel Kit. In regards to product feedback, the unit\u2019s dashboard bestows LED displays that can be utilized to continuously monitor the generator\u2019s operating status. While the unit is running, users can verify how much time they have left before refueling is required by referring to the run-time remaining display, and the PowerBar constantly specifies wattage produced by the generator at all times. Other innovative status indicators include low fuel, low oil, overload and overheating alerts. *Based on independent lab tests using ISO 9614 to measure sound power levels vs. Honda EU2000i. Fuel Type: Gasoline",
