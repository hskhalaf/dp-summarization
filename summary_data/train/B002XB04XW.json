At home he had a similar \"pillow\" and having one at school has helped him sleep, which for a college student is very important! It was a little too fuzzy for him on the top side, so he turned it upside down and now it is perfect. Thanks for an easy solution to the sleep issue!",

The colors of light brown for the body and dark brown for the ears makes the puppy more realistic than the other colored Pillow Pet puppies that are blue, green, pink, etc. I prefer the look of the \"Snuggly puppy\" and so does my child, who was so excited to receive this as a present. I would definitely purchase this type of Pillow Pet again in a heart beat. As for washing, when the Pillow Pet is dirty, make sure to read the directions on the label.",
