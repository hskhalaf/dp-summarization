I didn't want to spend lots of time returning the grinder and waiting for a replacement, so I found a site that sold replacement parts and ordered a new lid. No more spewed flour and I'm really pleased. I think this grinder was a returned product that was sent out to unsuspecting me.",

Lots of flour on the counter and everything sitting on the counter. But it grinds those wheat berries in seconds! It's very fast - which is why I bought it. I can adjust to its jumping, but I could not adjust to the first mill I purchased which took forever to grind two cups of wheat.",

The mill is loud (I guess that's why they rebranded from \"Whisper Mill\"), but I've never seen a mill that wasn't. It appears well-made and supposedly has a high-end electric motor. It mills the 500g for my bread in less than 20 seconds. The only setting is the grain coarseness.",
