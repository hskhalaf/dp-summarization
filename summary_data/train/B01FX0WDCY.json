The fridge is in a room that is consistently ~72\u00b0F, the unit is not enclosed, and it is far from the wall. It is not overstuffed at all, and this is after days of not adding anything warm or taking anything out. I measured internal temperature of jelly after days of equilibration with a very precise thermapen, and it is at 43\u00b0F. This is unacceptable.",

(Because they will freeze if they touch it.) Take a lid from one of those plastic shoebox storage containers and simply slide it behind the shelves!! (Top facing you) it will create air pocket between the back wall and your food.",
