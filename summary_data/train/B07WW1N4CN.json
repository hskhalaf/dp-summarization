      "text": "I ordered this egg maker to replace my old one that wore out. I have to say this one isn't that good. It takes forever to get an egg done in this and seems like it only heats on the bottom plate. My old egg maker cooked much faster AND cooked both sides. Disappointed, but I do like the color and that's about it. UPDATE: ok so now after maybe 2 months the egg maker completely crapped out. No heat, nothing. My advice; buy a different brand because these aren't very good.",
