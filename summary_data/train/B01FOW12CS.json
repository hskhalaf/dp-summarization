The flax seed blends in right away. This product has a nice, almost nutty flavor if it tastes like anything at all. The packaging is great. The bag is stiff and sits upright on the shelf of the fridge. Note, it's important to keep it in the fridge for freshness once it's opened. I would absolutely purchase from this brand again. It's a great deal and tastes delicious!",

So far good. I\u2019m only 1 week in to using this product. I will say, that since then my hormonal acne has been under control more.",

If you intend to use it as a straight fiber supplement by mixing in water, it is a little on the flaky side, and a portion will sink to the bottom of the glass (need to continue to stir). Viva doesn't recommend it in water anyways, but that's how I'm taking it, alternating between this and psyllium husk powder.",
