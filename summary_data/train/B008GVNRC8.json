The headphones fold which is good for storage. They have a bit more weight than the sync which I actually like. As for the sound it seems to have a bit more bass than the Sync but the Sync has a tad bit more clarity. Overall I'm very pleased with these no charging required just plug into your music device and go. Great looks to.",
