Came with a ton of extra sand bags (got the 60lb) that I have no clue where they would fit on this. Biggest problem I have is that it doesn't strap down tight enough for me in the shoulders or waist straps. Both are too long to have it fit right. Considering taking it to a tailor to have them adjust it for me. All the weight is on your shoulders, and no pockets for carrying anything if your pouches are full.",

So now I have to wait another week because someone was paying too little attention or someone was too lazy to put these two parts that I needed to actually use it. Very very unhappy with this purchase. *i will update when I actually get to use it",

Full 40 weight distribution is fine for walk/jog/hike. Easy to put together. Good quality, solid fabric and stitching. I bought this to train for the Bataan Memorial Death March and a special teams school. So far, it's exactly what I was looking for.",

The straps pretty much fell apart (the seams tear loose) within the first couple of months. This is due to the stress of the belt-strap stitching contacting the velcro on the belt. If you choose this vest, then a weight-lifting belt or regular belt is a good substitute.",
