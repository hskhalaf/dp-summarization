Problem appears when the internal storage reaches 100% - the phone fails to properly use SD card internal storage. Return if you still can. Storage says it's only 21% full but \"Storage space is running out. Some system functions may not work.\". Motorola's second level tech support says the software isn't working. Apparently the mods Amazon made to force their software from being removed broke the file management for the Moto G7 :-(",

Moto could have easily become the best not only in the league but could have flaunted with big 3 too. A little more RAM and a 670 processor (very minimum) could have been better. Size of the phone has gone bigger from G6. It should have gone the other-way around. They could have cut some cost by either maintaining the same size as G6 or Pixel phone size. Used that budget for RAM and processor. I love this phone, great work by Moto, but I still will return it due to its size & RAM. I don't think you'd repent buying this phone!",

Thought this would be perfect, except it doesn't work. Phone is not unlocked and can't be used to access the internet. Wasted a few very precious hours dealing with AT&T (very helpful) and Amazon (CLUELESS) tech support. Can return the phone for free but will have to pay shipping to return the case. All in all a very frustrating experience and I highly recommend you do not buy anything listed as unlocked on Amazon as there clearly is no testing process in place and they don't value your time.",

      "text": "Motorola doesn't honor their warranty. Or at least Amazon doesn't. I bought this phone last yr. The speaker went out and the only way people can hear me is if I put it on speaker. This happened before my screen cracked. They won't give me a new phone. Screen cracking isn't part of their warranty. I've BEEN a Motorola fan for YEARS. I always bragged on them. Until now. Slimy business practice. Don't advertise US warranty if you're NOT going to honor it. You'll be lucky I give you my money for a Moto One Zoom at $350 or a G8 Power when it releases. Let us pre-order already.",

With light use battery goes for 4 days, heavy use 2 days. Has enough power processing wise to do what I need. Screen is nothing to write home about but still looks nice. Finger print reader on the back is a great touch. I would definitely recommend this phone.",

Battery life is insane, I have yet to get close to running out of battery. It does everything that my Galaxies did except the the screen and the camera. The screen is no big deal, but the camera is the main drawback of these phones. I dont really use mine much but that is the only negative as far as I am concerned...",

Pros: Battery life,a decent camera,low price,larger screen,SD card slot,finger print sensor,fast battery charge,Republic cell compatible. Cons: Would like to be able to move more Apps to the sd card It's not a high tech performance phone but for the price you can't go wrong.I would buy again!",
