Machine won't last a year before it burns out from the way it wobbles. See video. I have a SKIL 1/2\" drill and a SKIL circular saw that I have had for over 30 years which is why I bought this grinder, the difference is they were made in Japan and this cheap grinder is just more Chinese junk. Sad that SKIL would hang their name on such inferior junky merchandise.",

I mounted this on a piece of wood and then screwed the piece of wood into my bench for temporary use. I've only used it twice, but it works great. I then take out the two screws and put it away. The rest works fairly well, but it seems like if it was adjustable and I could set an angle to it, then I might get better sharpening. That being said, I tried to be as steady as I can and I'm happy with the results.",

While the old one was off the bench I learned it wasn't broken at all. I put the wire brush wheel back on but left off the guard. Works great. I don't need the guard anyway when cleaning up rusting metal . Many of the older grinders never had wheel guards anyway. WONDERFUL GRINDER for the old man's workshop. Best deal on Amazon. Chuck",

      "text": "Used it few times. Runs quite and no vibrations either. I use it only occassionally to sharpen tools, and works pretty good. It would have been much more useful if the grinding wheels were more apart so that we could use larger work pieces. Some minor assembly required which is a bit confusing for the beginner with the enclosed instructions. Manufacturer could gave done better job on that part.",
