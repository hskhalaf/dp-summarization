It comes with a travel bag so you can take it places so you would have to take it apart for travel. After the 2nd use it cracked in a few places purely from pulling the pieces apart from each other. It is now, after 2 uses, being held together by glue and duct tape and we cannot take it apart anymore. I could see maybe over time this occurring but it was literally right away. Disappointed to say the least.",

Everything is very durable and the balls are just perfect consistency. Not hard like gold balls but not so soft you can step on them and they will break. They are filled with some type of sand. Also included is a zip carrying bag, which I thought was great! prefect to put out of the way in storage. I would really recommend this game, it's such a great way to get the whole family involved.",

I am going to contact the seller, but haven't yet so I'll update this once I get a response. The good: this product is light weight and it comes with pieces to steak into the ground so the ladder doesn't fall over. The bad: if you're playing on concrete, there's no where to steak this too and it falls, a lot!",
