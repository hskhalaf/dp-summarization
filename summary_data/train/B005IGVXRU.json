      "text": "The video quality is really grainy in low light, which is to be expected with most cameras of this price range. The main reason for my return was the fact that it didn't even last 1 hour before running out of battery. It only records up to 30 minutes, and doesn't continue recording. (you have to start another recording after 30 minutes) I thought that I could keep a charging cord plugged into the camera so as not to run out of battery, but found that it would shut off completely, so it could charge. It's great for taking photos, but not an ideal video camera",

When taking pictures in low light WITH THE FLASH ON half the pictures come out completely our of focus (not blurry from low light, but completely out of focus) and I have to take the picture again. Usually on the second try it comes out perfect, but its a pain. I returned the camera because of this and got another one, but it still happens with the replacement camera. In daylight, pictures come out beautifully.",

Have not tried out recording videos yet, but then I didn't buy it for that anyway. This is an ideal camera for a novice who just wants something compact and easy to use out of the box that takes good photos. 16mp and 10x zoom for a Nikon this small and under $200 is a good deal.",
