Its much lighter density, but its fun for how ever long it will last before she has thrown it around so much it is all vacuumed up.",

It feels more like wet beach sand. It also stick a bit to cloths and hands but in my opinion it's easy to clean. Perfect option for outdoor sandbox. I would recommend it for outdoor rather than indoor use. For use at home I purchased kinetic sand from diffrent producer that sticks more together.",

The container with cover that came with the set was handy for keeping it dry and clean or we would have had to makeshift a container to seal it up. They played for 90 minutes!! Yes, some landed on the floor, but we contained 98% of it. Will continue to buy this one.",

I probably would have figured it out if i had read the description a little better, but oh well. Still acceptable.",

My son loves sand though so it didn\u2019t bother him. In the future we will just buy the kinetic sand brand that we\u2019ve grown to know and love to avoid the hand tinting issue.",

The sand itself has a very unique feel to it, and it lives up to the promise of not drying out and not working. Many imaginative things can be made with this, I am excited to order more colors for her to create.",

We keep it in plastic ware to keep it clean and usable. Definitely not a toy for the kids room. Little bits can fall off but are easily retrieved, although hair and other junk will stick to it. I like the little molds that came with it, super fancy and a bonus. Overall, we are quite happy with the quality and value, as well as hours of fun this has given us already.",
