Just barely bought a new Canon camera and didn't have a memory card, so decided to go with this one because of the amount of space for the low price! Definitely what I was looking for. This memory card holds a ton of pictures - that can be taken in super high quality, plus holds a lot of highly quality videos as well. Great speeds, excellent write-ability. When I want to take the pictures/videos off of the memory card, I just plug it into the computer/laptop and I am able to remove the files super easily. Highly recommend this memory card!",

There were also inconsistent reviews as to whether is the write speed was decent or not. So I pulled the trigger and bought one...hard to beat $18 for 128GB.

Since this SD is a Class 10 SDHC there shouldn't be any issues with quick transfers and HD video. It's waterproof, temperature-proof, X-ray proof, magnet-proof, and shockproof. So there shouldn't be any fear of loosing the data stored on it. Most importantly it comes with a 10yr warranty!!!",

It helps to have some mechanical aptitude as film requires careful placement within and under guide tabs. Also, there is a feature that allows you to move the video frame so that the film image is properly centered in the resulting video and that process sometimes has to be re-done depending on the film. Most of the resulting digital video is at a FAST speed, up to 2x the proper speed and this is something that has to be fixed with a video editor, such as Windows Movie Editor.",

I also like that while they are very securely packaged to make sure they survive the trip they are NOT over packaged. You don't get plastic inside plastic inside more plastic. Like a Scandisk card itself the packaging is reasonable and reliable.",

Just make sure you format the SD card before using it in a camera, just in case. 32GB is the perfect size to get as a beginner photographer/videographer. I do not suggest getting an SD card bigger than 64GB because if you store all of your stuff on there and the card breaks, you basically have no chance of getting any of the things back. That is why it is better to have multiple smaller size SD cards then 1 big one.",
