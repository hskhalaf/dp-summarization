One for testing the Eye AF for adapted Canon glass (I have an old by reliable 5DMark II and plenty of L glass) on fstoppers.com and another one that offered suggestions for setting up your camera on colbybrownphotography.com. The only downside right now is the cost of Sony glass (GM) that I would like to own.",

This full-frame camera is somewhat larger than my previous two cameras, but the features and resolution make the small fraction of a pound, and the need to use a slightly larger carrying case well worth it. The battery is larger and has a much greater capacity, so much less risk of running out of juice while touring and taking lots of photos. Still a good idea to get a spare battery. (note: The smaller batteries from the other Sony cameras won't fit this unit).",

      "text": "Upgraded from a A7sii and must say it was worth the upgrade. Was never a big fan of auto focus until I bought this camera. The joystick makes it easy to pin point where I want my focus area to be and it's just dead on accurate. I mainly bought this because I shoot mostly for my business on remodeling projects that we complete. So the pixel shift option has some in real handy. I am able to get large format quality out of these images. It's absolutely amazing.",

Yes it is $1200 more but the 42mp is real mvp. I have a full control of my composition and crop whatever/whenever i want and still get stellar crisp images. Color improves as well. Highly recommended!",

First of all, its not as small as people make mirrorless out to be. Certainly larger than my APS-C Canon. Huge upgrade from APS-C to full frame and none the less at 42 MP. The auto focus is great. Love the various focus modes and the beautiful colors. Also great for astro photography. See attached pics.",

A glass protector plate is essential. The image quality and usability are stellar. And the viewfinder looks great. For image review, for example showing pictures to others after taking them, looking through the viewfinder is needed. This kind of freaks people out, because many are hesitant to look through the finder or be responsible for holding an expensive, and heavy, camera.",

The package came with only tape across the top, not the sides so the box was partially open, and little padding to keep from sliding around in the box. Happy with the camera, but needs to be packaged better for shipping. The A7RIII works well with my a6000 lenses. Expect that lenses and accessories will be noticably more expensive that the same items from Canon, from a battery grip, to telephoto extnenders, to lenses.",
