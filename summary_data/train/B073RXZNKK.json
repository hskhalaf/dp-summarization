As one might imagine lockboxes are critical to vacation rentals and guests so it's important that they work as expected. The company was very good about replacing the first broken one but there are now FOUR more. Let's see if the company responds about a bad batch or two...if NOT...I 'd recommend others and include myself on looking for other options!",
