Water builds up, and it has a tank at the bottom to capture the water, but tank is difficult to empty. You have to lift the entire unit up, which is pretty heavy, then tilt it, to pour the water out. They should have located the water tank and valve three inches higher. Who ever engineered it was not detail oriented.",
