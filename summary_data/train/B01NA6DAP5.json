Took it out on my paddleboard in mid-50\u2019s weather with mid-50\u2019s water and didn\u2019t feel any effects from the splash of the cold water on my legs. I ordered an XL because the L was too hard to pull on and, with the heat coming off my legs, I was worried they would become to restrictive and be too difficult to move, thus causing me to fall. I\u2019m an average size woman, 5\u20197\u201d and 150-155.",

They are marked 90% neoprene, 10% nylon and feel more like straight-up nylon. No way they are 3mm thick. The fit was off - baggy around the knees, likely to accommodate the less-stretchy fabric - which would affect the cold water performance. I would not trust these in cold water at all.",

Very fast delivery. I will purchase this label again but wish they would give better guidance on sizing/fit for us newbies.",
