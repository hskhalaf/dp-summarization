Pretty much pulls itself down the sheet, you just have to keep it lined up which isn't difficult. I wouldn't recommend getting this to cut anything other than straight lines. A little bit of ugly curves isn't a big deal, but it's not going to cut perfect circles. It also removes about 1/4\" strip of metal as it cuts, so don't plan on turning a 4x10 into 2 exact 4x5's.",

It took a bit to get it started, but once the entire cutting head is on the material it goes very quickly. As others have said, this is for straight lines, it will NOT turn. I don't know how long the tool will last, but I imagine it will last a lifetime for how often I need to use it.",
