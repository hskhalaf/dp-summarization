As reported by others, running the setup program in administrator mode enabled the adjustments to be set. So far, I haven't been able to get the acceleration to work. EDIT: Seller immediately responded with url to new driver. Unfortunately, it did not fix my lack of acceleration. The seller then offered a refund and sent a postage paid label.

And it keeps happenings, once every minute (sometimes less, sometimes more).

The only down side I have had is the dedicated 'Fire/Snipe' button failed mainly because I use it so much.

It does have one problem that prevents its use as a gaming mouse over Logitech alternatives. The software for macro creation overwrites all other user input (from the mouse) during the duration. If left click were to be held while a button was being pressed by a macro, left-click would stop being registered during macro behavior but then will be registered again, having left-click pressed again. This prevents its use as a gaming mouse with macro functionality handily. Decent hardware; godawful software.",

      "text": "Great mouse for MMOs. Looks amazing feels of high quality. I was very surprised especially for the price this is probably the best budget mouse I've felt. I put this up against the razer Naga (2014) and I'm not going to lie in done cases I preferred this mouse. The only complaints I have is that's it's a little too smooth. The paint finish on this mouse looks really good but when you play with it it's a little slick. Second is that the 12 programmable buttons on the side don't feel as great as the razer Nega but this was to be expected. Overall great mouse for the price.",

      "text": "After reading many positive reviews I decided to purchase this mouse and I haven't regretted it. Pros: Buttons, buttons and more buttons. So many options!!!! Love the appearance and lights. The multi-colored braided cord makes it stand out from other corded mice that I've had in the past and I hope it ensures extra durability. Adjustable weights! Fairly ergonomic, though I wish there was a space for my pinky finger. Cons: Even though I didn't like the rough texture of the mouse at first, I hoped I would end up adjusting to it. 13 days later and I still like it at all.",

Also love how the side buttons are tilted to allow for easier recognition as to where your fingers are located on the button grid. And the nice grippy surface is a nice touch, if a bit strange for some reason. EDIT: A few months later and it is still working just fine, not a single problem and I use it daily for gaming. Still cheaper than the Naga, sale makes it half the price. So very worth it, buy it because you wont be disappointed.",

Probably going to buy a second one for the price. If it lasts longer than two years without having left/middle click start to wear out, I think I found a winner. Otherwise, it wasn't a fortune spent and lost. $30 is how much it should cost for a decent MMO mouse. Cheers.",

Make a model without the side button's and I'm in, otherwise avoid at all costs. UPDATE!!! I am updating my review to 5 stars.

I have small hands and this fits great, very comfortable - I really like the extra finger groove so the grip feels very natural.
