The box is made with thick layers of dense foam that are glued together. The foam is great and has maintained its shape and density. At the beginning of the year, the layers separated. This has made the box almost useless as it is now too unstable to jump on unless you are using it at its shortest level. Even then you have to be careful. The outside covering has stood up well, though. I hope I can find some way to bind the layers back together without breaking down the foam.",

It has already saved my shins and knees a few times when you get tired during the end of a workout, and inevitably miss a jump. With the softer padding, I'm able to jump with confidence and not worry about gashing up shins on a metal or wooden box. Very happy with the purchase.",

When I researched buying one, I found it too expensive. Then I had the opportunity to borrow a Foam Plyometric Box Jump box during quarantine and loved it. This was better priced (although still more than I had hope to spend) and easy to carry. The box is great for jumping on and leaning on for exercise. I am a 55 year old women who loves to work out. I can jump the 20 inch height. Get the heart rate up, works the legs, hips and core.",
