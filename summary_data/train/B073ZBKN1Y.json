My husband started using it immediately, and told me to buy two more, he was confiscating the first one. I bought a 2nd for myself for gardening, and finally got to use it, for the first time I can get down on my knees and easily get back up with his product. He was right. I'll be ordering a 3rd one for indoor use! I'm so excited to be able to get up and down easily. I'll be buying them for gifts for friends as well.",

The ability to convert to a seat is simple: just turn it upside down! As an aside, the tool bag that comes with it is useful and can be used when kneeling or sitting.",

It gives us the support we need to get up from weeding, planting, etc. Pretty comfortable on the knees, too! I'd highly recommend this product. Actually, I never have used it as a seat (as shown in picture!). Got two this year, and after 2 years of continuous work, the kneeler pad started to disintegrate. I did affix something else to it for another year. Had I taken care of it and returned it to the gardening shed after every use, the foam kneeler pad wouldn't have become so 'weathered' from the seasons.",

The magic is when you flip the device over and use it as a \"kneeler.\" If you have bad knees like I do, the extensions that were the legs before you flipped it become a braces to help you stand up using your arms.",
