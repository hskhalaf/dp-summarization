The worse part tho is how they fade so rapid, the gum the canvas - everything. I got 2 pairs one for \"fun\" and one for... weddings and interviews {?} and even the less worn pair looked dog eared and \"loved\" after a few weeks. IDK i cant say much else other than i pretty much live in these shoes. They are what they are. But I wish they would drop the price point - its canvas and gum.... not Gold and Frankincense",

Keep in mind that these shoes have very little to no arch support. I personally removed the OEM sole and use a thin more-supportive sole out of another pair of shoes. There is very little room for a thicker aftermarket sole like this one:  I highly recommend this insole for almost every shoe, except this one. To conclude, they look outstanding, but people with wide feet will need to make minor adjustments for full-day use. Get some!",

    "description": "MANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION\nMarch 16, 1966, on 704E Broadway street in Anaheim, California, Paul Van Doren and three other partners opened their first ever store and the Vans dream was born. The Van Doren Rubber Company was unique in that it manufactured shoes for sale directly to the public. On that first morning, 12 customers purchased shoes which were made that day and ready for pick-up in the afternoon, the Vans #44 deck shoes, which are now known as the Authentic, were launched. These classic Vans combined canvas uppers with thick-bottomed vulcanised soles \u2013 a distinctive style that became the signature look of the company. From this starting point over 40 years ago, Vans has risen to become a worldwide dominant force in the footwear and action sports markets, making it the brand of choice for the contemporary consumer seeking action sport and lifestyle footwear.",
