      "text": "I bought this for my wife and she loves it. I put it together and that was a piece of cake. She is 5' and absolutely loves it. She walks and runs and it meets her needs. It has the height adjustment with the adjustment of the legs up or down. This is a well made treadmill, not all the bells and whistles but you get a good, durable machine for a great price. You can't beat it for the price, I've looked. If you want fancy this is not for you, if you want effective and affordable, it's a great buy",

It is sturdy, and works well. I am very happy with it and use it for running and walking.",

The belt is absolute garbage too, and it just feels flimsy. Overall I shouldn't have been cheap and will never buy anything from Wesco again.
