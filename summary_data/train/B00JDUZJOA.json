The only negative is I wish the foot platform piece extended another 6\u2019ish inches. Only my heels rest on the platform while sitting. That said, I killed 2 deer in 3 days, within 15 yards, from the same tree using this stand. The climbing aspect of it let me get 25/30\u2019 feet off the ground and the deer about walked under me. Both were about 125/130lbs and I was still able to drag them out while wearing the Treestand like a backpack. Lightweight, extremely mobile. Awesome.",

It's very comfortable. Takes a couple times practicing to get the hang of it. Carrying straps aren't great but I started packing it on my Kuiu hiking back and it was not bad once I was using the pack frame rather than the backpack style straps for the stand itself. In terms of all day comfort 100%, not terribly heavy and simple enough I could be efficient and independent!",

Other than those few things, which were easily taken care of, I would give this stand an A+. For around $300 per unit the quality could definitely be improved.",

Another observation, it's a bit bulkier on my back than a hang-on stand but is about the same weight. Not much difference in the amount of noise it makes getting setup.",

It's not complicated to set-up at all, but with something that could be so dangerous if improperly used, I read the manual. The instructions for initial setup are not clear whatsoever.

      "text": "Great overall treestand, but assembly instructions were minimal. That being said, once it was together it worked well. The rubber around the cables make strapping to the tree silent during twilight. Very comfortable seat. The stirrups help tremendously climbing up and down from trees. I would recommend upgrading the back straps if you dont want to wrestle the climber on your back. Definitely a good buy. Always teather your upper and lower pieces! Wear your harness, dont be a statistic.",
