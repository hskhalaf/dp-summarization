The bits specifically state for metal and I was a little suspicious they may not work but for only $14 for a set of 6 it was worth the risk. I used the 16.5 mm to make counter sink for 1/4 screws. I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to drill 4 countersinks with reasonable effort to get the depth I needed. I used a battery powered 20V drill at a lower speed. The #14 flat head screw seated perfectly in the countersink.",
