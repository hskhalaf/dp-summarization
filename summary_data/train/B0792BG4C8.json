December 2018 I answered a phone call in a hot tub and failed to secure the headphone jack. The phone shut off and wouldn't turn back on. I ordered a replacement (same phone). About a week later I tried turning on the water damaged one and BOOM that bad MFer had come straight back to life and is going strong one year later. Best part is that since I have two now I only have to charge my phone/s like once a week",

I had the unfortunate honor of testing both the water/dust proofing depth and drop rating all in one day, and it passed both with flying colors. I have not even needed to use the included battery pack, or the earbuds, but glad I have them in reserve. The camera's low light quality is acceptable, but nothing to brag about.",

I use my wife's iphone for family pictures. Pictures are good enough for most situations. You're not paying a thousand dollars for this phone, remember. I dropped the cat 41 in the swimming pool. Under water only 30 seconds. All is well. If the phone is to be used underwater there is a setting change to make. Great phone for one who works outside, drops there phone (A LOT), and just needs a rugged phone.",
