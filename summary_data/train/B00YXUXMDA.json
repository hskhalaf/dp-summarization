It is held on by Velcro, which makes for easy install but my almost 10 month old started to rip it off of his crib. Since it\u2019s breathable it\u2019s up for debate how dangerous it may be once it is no longer secure. However, I\u2019m not taking any chances and I\u2019m going to take it down and look for a replacement.",

      "text": "Our baby is 10 months old and she decided chewing on furniture while teething was a good thing. As a parent, I disagreed. I researched crib rail covers on Amazon. I was tempted to buy the version by Trend Lab because it had so many reviews. But I was drawn to something about this one by BreathableBaby. And I feel I made the right choice! The quality of the piece is excellent! I also love how easy it was able to put on the crib\u2014just velcro the sides together. It was nice to not have ties to deal with. My one wish is for the company to make shorter ones for the side rails of the crib.",
