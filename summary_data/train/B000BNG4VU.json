Also the smell is awesome, it's like a refreshing sweet smell that lasts surprisingly long after you apply it, it gets bonus points for that in my book.",

Admittedly, I'd been spoiled after using the Laura Mercier translucent powder for years, however, I wanted to find a similar product that wouldn't break the bank. I like this powder. It is very soft and finely milled. Easy to apply and doesn't look cakey. It is surprisingly quite fragrant -- reminds me of a baby powder scent, which I could do without. It also has a very slight whitefish color to it that can be visible if not blended in nicely. Overall, it is a decent product.",

The scent, the way it makes everything \"stay put\" (eye brow pencil even!) and love that it's so translucent no one knows it's there. In a nutshell, I'm pleasantly surprised and pleased \"to the max\"! I highly recommend this to anyone who has never used a translucent powder before.",

      "text": "I've been looking for a product to reduce creasing with my makeup, and this 98% works for me! I say 98% because this is my first time ever using a translucent powder, so there is still a little trial and error in application and such (operator error?). I used the baking technique and was very pleased with the results. The lines are still visible, but they aren't exaggerated anymore. I'm hoping that the lines will be even less visible as my personal technique improves! I definitely recommend this product!",
