The blades are sharp and I thought it would be great. But unless you have nice grass with no weeds, you should probably stay away from this one. We live in the country and have dandelions and other weeds. I didn\u2019t think they would be a problem, but for some reason the lawn mower won\u2019t cut them. It just bends them over and sort of flattens them. I tried going over them several times with no luck. I\u2019m so disappointed.",

Laying it out on a bench makes it easier, still. It is sharp enough to cut paper easily. Not too light, or too heavy, making it sturdy but not difficult for this 70 year old to push (if you mow your lawn regularly). Good exercise and good for the environment, which I like. If you're on the fence about getting a manual push mower, I'd say go for it.",

Because of the reason above you need to go up hills 2 times at-least. Overall I kept this. It works well for the most part but the hill part really hurts.

However, it is definitely a small yard mower. A really big yard would take a while. Worth noting: It only cuts forward; you cannot pull it backwards over a spot to hit it again. You must approach the area you want to cut from the front.",

I'm thankful that I only have a small patch of grass in the backyard.

HOwever, you really need to determine if your lawn is appropriate for this type of mower. Your lawn has to LEVEL, not lumpy or uneven because this mower will not mow evenly if your lawn is not fairly flat and you won't be happy with it. It is a great alternative for small lawns and environmentally friendly and quiet!!",
