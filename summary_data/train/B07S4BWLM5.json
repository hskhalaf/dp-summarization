My wife can converse with a Spanish person with a satisfactory degree of spontaneity. Highly recommend.",

This device removed this communication barrier for us and this has made their visit so much more comfortable and fun. I use it to translate my English to Spanish and they use it translate from Spanish to English. Its easy to use, reliable and makes communicating in other languages fun. I recommend this product to anyone needing to overcome the problems that communication barriers create.",
