You can kayak, you can paddle board, whatever you need for the moment, you can do it. Sometimes situations change in the Terrain gets tough, sit down and Kayak. You should get the perception life jacket with this unit, it has a cut out part on the back for the seats so it's really nice. And addition, the highlife kayak paddle switch from a paddleboard paddle to a kayak paddle on demand, it's the most amazing Kayak I own and I own 3.",

I paid a good chunk of cash for this board, and it should not be damaged. UPDATE: Changed my review from two to four stars. I received a scratch & Dent discount for the damage.
