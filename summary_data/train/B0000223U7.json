Even though this one is little oversize, it is light enough, comes with multiple nozzles and keeps the heat at the right point.",

    "description": "Industrial performance with consumer appeal. Auto shut-off light for safety, reliability, and extended life. Dual heater for 40-percent more glue output. Temperature switch for high and low temperature glue applications. On/Off light and protected nozzle for added safety. Soft, comfort grip, non-slip trigger action.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Stanley Glue-Pro DualMelt Glue Gun is ideal for repairs, wood projects, light manufacturing, and model work. It features dual heaters for high capacity, delivering consistent glue flow at 40 percent more glue output. Its covered nozzle prevents burns during use. Other features include an automatic shutoff mechanism; a comfort-grip handle; and a high/low temperature adjustment. The glue gun comes with an extension nozzle, a spreader nozzle, and 18 sticks of assorted glue.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Stanley Works, originally a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain, Connecticut; was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Frederick\u2019s cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become it\u2019s famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products. Today, more than ever, Stanley continues to be an industry leader in tool innovation.
