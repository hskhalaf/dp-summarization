I have my travel trailer stored in a relative's yard and when we visit it's just being at home. The Sewer Solution with the 20ft extension worked great. My sewer clean-out is above ground about 4 inches but that wasn't a problem for the Sewer Solution. I highly recommend the Sewer Solution and I can now throw away my 'stinky slinky'. I was worried about the long 30ft run from my trailer to the clean-out, but SS worked like a charm, the best investment I have made in a long time.",

I'll call Valterra and see what they are willing to do to rectify the situation. Until then it remains 2 stars.",
