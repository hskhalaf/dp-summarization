      "text": "My son is a big ass kid. Way bigger than everyone else playing flag. Height and weight wise. He's not some chunk but he's definitely BIG. The belts fit him well with room to grow. I was very happy with this since a lot of things for his age don't for him. He wears size 12/14 I think and they fit. So if you have a bigger boy, rest assured these will fit. The flags themselves are of really good quality as well. They are of a thicker plastic and are very durable. They've survived a whole season through games and practices and not one has ripped or torn. This included the flag belt keeper pieces as well.",

The item arrived in a draw string nylon bag, and not the nice rectangular bad shown in the photo. It was inside an Amazon warehouse clear bag. It would have been nice to give the present in the bag shown in the picture. So if you're buying as a gift for a kid, also go buy a nice gift box. Otherwise it looks like an open item or part of something else.",

Ever since then i have been very satisfied with this product. Have used it multiple games with kids and young adults, so far havent had one rip on me. Great for the price. Pros: Sturdy, Easy to use, wrap around belt with flags attached by velcro so they come off invidually. Price Cons: none at this moment.",

I also love the fact that this product ships with 3 flags instead of the 2 that most others ship with.

While the belts are the same type of material and clasp, the kids love that they are black material not white. No idea why. As for me, I think the flags are thicker material and hang straighter. Also, the competitor tightly folds their flags for shipping whereas the trained product is folded in half which made them more usable right away. I'd recommend this product.",

So far we like the flags and the quality is much better than what we can buy at the large box stores.
