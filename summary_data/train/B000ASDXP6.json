The only reason I didn't give it a 5th star is because it's a pain to assemble by yourself. Still definitely worth getting but if you can recruit a someone to help just by holding rails in place while lining up and tightening nuts and bolts it will make things MUCH easier.",

My suggestion (because if properly assembled, this rack is quite strong and space saving) is that when tightening the bolts, only tighten them enough to hold it together, then tweak all the pieces so it is level, then tighten the bolts all the way. Otherwise, you'll be like me, tightening/adjusting/untightening/readjusting for 2+ hours. I eventually gave up when the last bolt was too big to fit the nut, I set it aside where it still sits, all misshapen and heavy in the corner of my living room, waiting until I can get the right pieces from Home Depot.",
