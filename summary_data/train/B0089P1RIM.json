Unfortunately I bought this after talking to Verizon about remaining on my plan, they lied as I was unable to keep my present unlimited plan, even though I was told at the Verizon store my plan was still unlimited. So be careful, If you have an unlimited 3G plan, keep it. This is the wrong device then. I am however keeping the device, as the price of data goes down, who knows maybe I can use it.",

I was able to set up separate account with MIFI separate no contract 5G data for $50 bucks and no contract. A little more expensive than Walmart brand MIFI, but time is money and I cannot afford break in signal! Worth the money!",

      "text": "This would really be a great product if Verizons prepaid plans weren't so ridiculous. $15 only gives you 250mb of data then it jumps straight to $60 for 3GB and the only other plan is $90 for 10GB. Plus the product doesnt come with a sim card so you have to buy that extra from them as well. The products price was a good buy though and I kinda see why. It also arrived earlier then planned too.",
