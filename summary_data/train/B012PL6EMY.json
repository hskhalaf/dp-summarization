I am not sure if some bad batch got mixed in there, but mine is working well with Nikon D5600. I can do burst shots, 4K video recording, etc. without any issue. Only downside is that reading may take a bit sometimes after burst shots, but they are all there. I don't really review photos as much on the LCD panel, so it doesn't bother me. However, you may want something with faster read/write if you do. For money's worth, I like it. I'll update the review after using it for a while and compare with some other brands.",
