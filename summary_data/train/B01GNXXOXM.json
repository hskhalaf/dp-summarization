It is under warranty but everything is so much more complicated now because of the pandemic. Anyway I ordered this little mini fridge so I could have at least some refrigeration. It arrived a day ahead of schedule.I live on the seventh floor and I am an older woman. I am grateful Amazon delivered it to my doorstep. It is so light I was able to move it into the kitchen myself. Very appreciative.",

      "text": "This item was great for all of 3 days after setup. It gets nice and cold and can hold a bunch of drinks. BUT, giant BUT....it doesn't matter if the door won't stay closed. After stock it up and opening and closing a few times, the door stops staying closed and opens after about 5 seconds. This results in the whole thing defrosting and getting water everywhere. Will be calling Danby regarding warranty. Really disappointed. Was going to buy a second one for use in workshop.",
