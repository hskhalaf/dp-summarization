It made perfect joints after tuning the bit height and the depth gauge on the jig itself. I wouldnt want to use this without a router table though. If you want something that will work well and not break the bank, this is the way to go. If I could change one thing, it would be the bit. Bit will need replacing sooner than later after doing a lot of joints in red oak.",

The only problem with the product is its manual, just throw it away since it lacks the logic and sequential thinking and go to Youtube and you will find at least three or four video explaining 90% of its use and the remaining 10% you will figure out while you are using that jig. The four stars because of the confusing manual but it is good product and comes at affordable price compared to others.",

I've attached a photo of the issue. If you buy this, due to poor quality control, check for squareness in all dimensions, even the metal may be warped.
