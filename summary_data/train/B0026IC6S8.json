It took several minutes to carefully extracate it from the latch without breaking even more strings. Not sure if this was previously used and returned as new or just carelessly packed. We haven't tuned it yet and will update our review on the actual violin later. At this point, I am concerned. *****No bridge included with the violin.",

The bow isn't really a high quality bow, but I don't think any beginner violin will have one. It's not a bad bow by any means, just don't expect a real fancy one. I bought this violin because it was highly recommended on a website as being the best beginner violin, and I can see why. I'm currently taking lessons and it sounds great. I recommend buying different rosin, because the kind this comes with is hard to use. Please don't buy some $30 piece of junk, it probably won't last a day.",

While focusing primarily on quality and value to meet a specific price point, the new SV-130 Cremona Premier Novice Series violin was developed. It is important for a student to get fast results with a first instrument. In order for that to happen, the string height and tension has to be such that it is not painful to play, and likewise, the body has to be sufficiently resonant that it produces a rich and satisfying tone. The Cremona SV-130 satisfies both of these requirements. Whether the student is in the earliest stages of the learning process, or well on the way to more advanced training, these violins will perform well beyond the expectation. Now ships with high quality D'Addario Prelude strings. Includes bow and plush-lined case. Available in 1/4 through 4/4 sizes (select from dropdown menu).",
