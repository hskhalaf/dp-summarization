Led's are super bright and provide good lighting in the darkest of places. Well worth the $. 1 dislike was the need for a special memory card. The memory cards I had laying around would not work and it does not come with one. Which is another draw back...for the price it should include memory card. You don't need to the memory card to use this scope, only to save pictures. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would def buy again",
