      "verdict": "On its 34th iteration, the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus has kept most of the features of the previous version, only updating the features of the upper. Like its predecessors, the Pegasus 34 has a level of durability and comfort that provides an incredible support and allows great foot control. This version still employs the signature cushioning of the Pegasus line, which is great for road-running. With most users commending its improved flexibility and breathability, the Pegasus 34 is designed to impress neutral runners undertaking tough roads.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of the users commented that the Pegasus 34 is extremely comfortable",
        "A lot of buyers have observed that the shoe is lightweight yet durable",
        "Some mentioned that the shoe is good to go right out of the box, and that did not require breaking in",
        "The Pegasus 34\u2019s responsive nature was also commended by many of its testers",
        "With numerous color choices, many users found the Pegasus 34 to be stylish",
        "There were several opinions on how the shoe fits: a lot of users mentioned it is true to size, and others were impressed with the more focused fit and the support it provides",
        "The shoe gives a smooth ride and it feels fast, according to some",
        "One user said the Pegasus 34 reduced their knee and calf discomforts",
        "Even more breathable than the previous version, as noticed by numerous runners",
        "The shoe allows for great foot control with its awesome traction, based on the observation of one user"

      "cons": [
        "Some runners mentioned that the Pegasus 34 has irregular padding and puts uneven pressure on their foot",
        "More than a handful of users commented that the laces were difficult to adjust, and another said they caused some discomfort on the top of his foot",
        "A couple of users said that the Pegasus 34 had poor durability and that it had the tendency to break apart quickly",
        "There were some buyers who were not impressed by the cushioning of the Pegasus 34"

After about 550km a part of the tread at the back and bottom of the heel has come off one of them, but perhaps this is reasonable wear and it is not enough to notice when running. They only lose a star because other decent shoes are more competitively priced. But I would buy these again and likely will have more zoom pegasus in the future.",
