Unfortunately she only got to use it a couple of times before the answer pen stopped working. (It re gisters all answers as wrong answers now, even when you choose the correct one.) This renders the whole thing pretty useless. Unfortunately I am unable to return it as the deadline to return has passed. (I bought it at the beginning of October to use on a trip we took in November, so we didn't discover the defect until it was too late.)",

I have nothing positive to say about Hot Dots Jr. If the item was smart and could \"read\" to the kids to let them know why a selection was wrong that would be better. The way it's designed, it can falsely indicate that the child gave the wrong answer when they did not and it lets them think they answered correctly when they have only partially answered. Crap!!",

She loves doing the different activity cards. WE also like that it involves her favorite book character with something educational. She has always been advanced for her age and we have trouble finding things that challenge her but that are still doable and this was the perfect solution for us. She likes that she feels independent doing it (we still have to read her the directions on the cards). We will probably look into getting more hot dot products for her in the future.",
