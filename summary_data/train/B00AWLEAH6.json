Updated: Beyond the discomfort in wearing and it constantly falling off, the earphones have fallen apart, part by part. First it started with a bend in the wire. And within a day the skin there tore. Although it works the bend cannot be fixed because the wires somehow expanded more than the fabric. Next, the left ear stops working abruptly now and then. Of course I know that is indication that the life of these earphones are coming to an end. So really. Don't waste your money.",

I had one of the cords start to pull out of the earbud after about a year. Some super glue fixed that problem, but it really shouldn't have been one in the first place at this price point. If you want more isolation, there are foam tips you can buy to replace the rubber ones that come with the headphones and they offer a lot of sound absorption. I highly recommend them if you want isolation so you don't have to listen to your coworkers but keep the volume reasonable.",

Finally started to lose a bit of sound on one side after a bit over 2 years of daily, heavy use. Even so, still no fraying or wear on the braided cord or exposed wires near the jack or buds.

Save you forty bucks and buy something cheap for $8 that probably render your music better.",

I'm quite happy with my purchase - sound-wise they sound about the same to me as my XBA-4s, which is quite awesome. Lots of detail and clarity. Pros - Great sound quality - Good variety of bud attachments (I especially like the sort of double-ball ones) - Very lightweight Cons - Feel a bit fragile - No microphone or volume control",

These heaphones are definitely more neutral than the SE-215s. Overall the sound is definitely of the same quality, even if the sound signature isn't the same. These are much more comfortable then the 215s, though, and are easier to listen to for long periods. I can't comment on durability, since I haven't had these long.",

Cons: After 3 months, left side began to cut out and plastic cable housing separated from right earbud shortly after. Thoughts: HifiMan's website is lacking to say the least. I followed what little information they had on returns for replacement but after emailing them several times its been 3 weeks and I still have not heard back from customer service. This is all a shame because I really did enjoy the headphones while they worked, for this price I expected better quality and better customer service but I was let down on both counts.
