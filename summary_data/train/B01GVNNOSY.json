I had to cut 3cm deep sections from the internal drive bay to allow it to fit. One other nice feature is the ability to change the led colour to suit your tower. I found the default drivers had not enabled this feature in the supplied software (Firestorm) but a bit of googling soon turned up the correct one to install (if you want it any colour other than the default pale blue).",

Performance wise it certainly performs, bought it primarily to play Elite Dangerous which i now run fully maxed out with 2.0 supersampling and i'm getting 130 fps. Star Wars Battlefront is around the 200 fps mark with everything on. I love this card, not cheap, but then you get a lot for your money, plus the build quality is superb",

I haven't benched the thing yet but I can imagine it having no problem with thermals due to those bulky radiating fins.",

Or maybe it was 17,000, can't remember, either or. It's quiet as a mouse too, unless you want to switch on manual fan control and blast it to 100%. Cools it down well too. I haven't put it to the test on modern games yet, but DDDA and Insurgency have been constant above 120fps (dips in DDDA though, but never below 80). With G-Sync I imagine that's not a problem, but I have a Freesync monitor because I'm dumb. Easily took the longest to ship.",

      "text": "Nothing much to be said about this card that can't already be seen in numerous reviews and benchmarks. This card is great, perhaps the best value / performance on the higher end spectrum right now. For 1080p gaming this card can handle pretty much everything you throw at it with maxed out settings. Some of the games I tested were GTA V, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Witcher 3 and Far Cry Primal. Had no issues whatsoever running these games.",

      "text": "Mine had a rumbling noise with the fans when they dropped below 40%, didn't seem right for something which cost over \u00a3400. Refunded it, card is great and worked fine. But i didn't like the rumbling sound, may have just been my card. Ended up getting a different 1070 which works great. Other than that the card is very big so be aware it wont fit in smaller cases.",
