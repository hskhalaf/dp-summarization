She loves and says it helps her get comfortable at night. It is pretty big though. We have a king size bed, and this pillow takes up half of the bed, but if it helps her sleep, i'll continue to sleep on my 1/4 of the bed lol.",

I waited the recommended 48 hours for it to \"fluff\" and even tried to fluff it myself but it's hasn't helped much. So I would just keep in mind if your trying to order this, it's going to come vacuum sealed.",
