Also when it\u2019s plugged in, if you turn the lights off it makes this weird electric whining sound which doesn\u2019t stop till you turn the lights back on or unplug it.

CD/Buetooth has worked perfect for me so I am thinking the older ones had some issues. FM radio is very sensitive-picks up lots of stations clearly as long as the wired antennae is positioned correctly. A very nice jukebox radio player.",

Would of been better if they would of put in out put Jack's on the back to hook in external speakers, but unfortunately this doesn't offer this. But for the price it's not bad at all. Just dont expect amazing sound, this will not offer that.",
