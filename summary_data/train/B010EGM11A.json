I hiked over 25 miles in these, half of that with a 50 lb pack on. I didn't get one blister and my feet were great the entire trip. I constantly got them wet crossing the river on the hike and they still felt great. My friend got a different brand and got very bad blisters. Highly recommend.",

Someone on the design team really dropped the ball by putting heavy gauge nylon stitching at the top of the heel cup. The shoes were also much more narrow than any other sandle or shoe that I have bought from olukai. At least the foot bed was still comfortable.
