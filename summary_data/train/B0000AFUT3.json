The plastic is cheap and mine had a crack in it after day 2. It is bulky so I do not know about traveling with it and how it would fare. But at least I can see to put my mascara on.",

      "text": "That's right, the color of this is the palest of lavendars, obvious when I put it next to my white bathroom wall. Not as solid as my old Norelco Satin. This one uses filters for the different light settings rather than different brightnesses of light. The angle adjuster in the back is flimsy and awkward when folded. The mirrors are good. The light is not even - good on the sides, not so good in the center. A little drawer would have been nice (the Norelco had one). Like the Norelco, you cannot change the bulbs when they burn out.",

    "description": "Jerdon Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror with 5x Magnification, White Finish\n\nAMAZON.COM\nHigh magnification, versatile illumination, and multi-angle viewing make this tri-fold mirror from Jerdon a virtual cockpit of makeup application. Structured for panoramic viewing, the mirror features two adjustable side panels, plus a center section with regular reflection on one side and 5X magnification on the other. Two bars of fluorescent lighting offer cool, glare-free illumination, and the color-correct light menu lights your face for day or evening, the office or home. A built-in outlet accommodates curling irons and roller sets, while an adjustable backstand offers 11 angles to work from. The entire unit folds up flat for storage. \n\n Though the mirror does not feel as substantial as the company's all-metal models, it does roll several features into one compact model. In addition, the reflection is consistently clear, and the side panels stay put where you place them. Fully extended, the mirror measures 19 by 12 inches. Jerdon includes a one-year warranty. --Emily Bedard",
