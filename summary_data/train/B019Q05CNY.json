I will say it amuses me to see folks complaining that they mounted the device on a shotgun, and it won\u2019t hold zero. If you need a laser for a shotgun, understand that you\u2019ll need to spend a bit more than $28 to handle the recoil.",

      "text": "This is not a bad product. Seems sturdy enough. The laser is amazing. The bracket however leaves a little to be desired. It doesn't completely flush on my picatinny rail. It took a lot to tighten it so that it wouldn't move. The horizontal and lateral adjustments for site are nice. The pressure switch doesn't click on or off. You must keep it depressed for the light to sustain. Everything does seem well-made though for the money. After I sighted it in,it did allow me to hit my target.",

      "text": "If you are buying this from Amazon it is worth the gamble, but the one I received looked used and the pressure pad barely worked. The laser was bright and if the pressure pad worked I may have been willing to keep it a while longer but I am just not a big fan of buying something new and opening it up and it looking used. The laser looks solid and if the package and pressure pad was a little better and it didn't look used this would be perfect, but in the condition I received it in I would not put it on my AR or even attempt to use it at the range.",

I'm not but it included it all n a nice little box,that in itself is sturdy and useful for anything (i know i know, but seriously its a good box). The unit is tough as nails, It has fallen several times with no problems, no lens changes etc. Quite frankly ive used the scope but not with a weapon, so i cant review the clamps etc.",

The dang Grackles have started amassing in our trees, screaming their love cries of misery, clacking and creaking like the unlocked barn door in a horror film. Their call is not the lark of spring but the nails-on-chalkboard of insomnia. I lasered the crud outta one male and all he did was turn his head away to continue his joyful cries of despair. Anyone have any non-shooting suggestions on how to get rid of grackles and not the other birds?",

However the velcro supplied to mount the remote activation pad is worthless. The glue remains on the backing plastic and then does not stick onto the pad or stock. Had to buy quality velcro from the hardware store to the on/off sensor. Lately the mount on the picitinny rail loosens up necsesitating re-adjustment.",

It's got a nice heavy build, so if you happen to drop this and even step on it, it's good to go. It's also perfectly bright! Any time I'm showing people at a star party where the telescope's pointed, they all know exactly where they're looking in the sky. The beam is solid enough and reaches for days. I can't speak to this as a rifle or pistol laser, but for astronomy, it's great!",

Took the battery cover off and all of the inside fell out. Very disappointing. Will return it.",
