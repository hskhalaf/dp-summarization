Fairly easy to use, and the steam feels incredibly nice on my skin, there is absolutely no irritation or the steam being \"too hot\", in my opinion it was just the perfect temperature. The instructions were easy to follow upon setting it up and I was able to do a facial for myself in no time! (: Highly recommend this product~!",
