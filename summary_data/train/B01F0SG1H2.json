You can remove the \"intro\" sound when you plug it on or when it starts with the \"on\" key (if it's hard wired).

      "text": "Works very well, often from much further out than one would expect. Sometimes I wonder if it is actually detecting properly though, sometimes down my regular routes it will detect a laser repeatedly when most other times it won't. I do wish it could be quieter on volume 1/9 or use less intense light notification at night. It is sort of difficult to adjust the settings depending on what you're changing. Altogether though I would absolutely recommend it to friends and family, once you take the time to read the instructions and understand how to manipulate it according to your needs, it works phenomenoly well. It's definitely saved my ass a number of times, especially with the POP technology.",

    "title": "Whistler CR88 High Performance Laser Radar Detector: 360 Degree Protection and Bilingual Voice Alerts,Black",
    "description": "Style:CR88The Whistler CR88 laser radar detector is a high performance, professional grade dash model which detects all radar guns used today with total band protection, including X-band, K-band, Superwide Ka-band, and laser. Total laser detection identifies Laser Atlanta Stealth mode, Laser Ally, and the new LTI Truspeed S. It delivers 360 degrees of complete perimeter protection, detecting signals from the front, sides, and rear. Features Radar Signature ID (RSID) which is a Ka-band radar identifier that displays Ka 33.8, 34.0, 34.3, 34.7, or 35.5 when detecting these common Ka speed radar systems. Laser Signature ID (LSID) indicates the Pulses Per Second (PPS) transmitted by speed laser or other forms of laser sources. The POP Mode detection is an advanced speed detection capability that responds to brief bursts of radar. Traffic Flow Signal Rejection (TFSR) helps eliminate alerts from radar based traffic flow sensors and the 4 XK and 4 Ka filter modes reduce false alerts caused from other radar detectors. The low emission design makes it difficult to be detected by VG-2 and other radar detector detectors. This laser radar detector includes real voice alerts and an OLED text display that shows alerts and signal strength, as well as many others, such as Stay Alert, vehicle battery saver, 3 city modes, highway mode, and alert priority that make this a feature rich detector. Measures 4.93\" L x 3.12\" W x 1.31\" H, and includes the radar detector, a 12V power cord, hardware kit, windshield bracket kit, and a user guide.",
