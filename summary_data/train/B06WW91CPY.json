I bought these for my wife 8 months ago because she always got distracted from her grad school studying while I was chatting over the headset with my friends while playing video games in the next room. These help her stay focused by cancelling out my blabbering. Not a life changing set of headphones, but good enough, and at a fair price.",

They are pretty great! they do noise cancel fairly well 8/10 compared to my boyfriends bose silent 35's they are comfortable 8/10 again compared to my the bose. I think its because of the material used for the headphones. but honestly for the price you can't beat it. bass is 8/10 could hit harder.",

I tried on multiple devices, and it's a problem with this hardware, not the device. It had been a little over two months before I tried using the microphone (had bought this for flights), and the support warranty is only two months, so no option or info for contacting the seller (not even in the instruction manual). One might say that I should have tested every feature as soon as I received it--perhaps, but since everything else worked fine I did not test the mic until I actually needed it later.",

I've run down the charge more than once because I cannot easily turn on or off. I really like that it comes with a carrying case, and that the headphones fold. Unlike other wireless headphones, you can use these when there is no charge as they come with a cord, so if it is not charged, you can plug the cord into the headphone and then into your device. .",
