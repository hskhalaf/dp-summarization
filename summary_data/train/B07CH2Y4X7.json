The socks seem to be made really well but I will continue my review on a future date after I have used them. I used them at Havasu Falls where the water is around 70 degrees and the socks did what they were supposed to, they kept my feet from going numb.",

The neoprene material is tough, and despite walking over rocks and coral, the socks didn't get cut up one bit. I also put my fins on over them when I went snorkeling, and had no problems with the fit. The socks were very easy to clean just by running them through water and dried in no time at all, ready to use again. I wear a size 11 1/2 shoe and ordered size XXL and they fit perfectly.",

It can become especially a big problem during low tide when you walk far. We also went to some areas with corals and they are very sharp. Definitely recommend.

I have a water shoes as well, but didn't like to swim with shoes on my feet; swimming and wearing my water socks felt like swimming bare-feet and I loved it! Additionally, socks dried very fast and seem to be a good quality.",

Am not sure if this was from the rowing or walking to my car on a rougher surface weekly. But they lasted 5-6 months in great shape until this weekend. Really bummed.",
