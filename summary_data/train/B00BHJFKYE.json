So I bought this putter. As soon as I opened the package, it was apparent that this putter was of average quality (at best) and it just didn't feel right in my hands. A little too light, not balanced quite right? If you're serious about your game, I'd suggest spending at least twice as much as this putter costs and for a brand more associated with quality golf equipment. If your a very occasional player - a few times a year, or less - this will probably do you fine.",
