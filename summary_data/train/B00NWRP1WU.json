      "title": "Excellent chalk bag!!!",
      "text": "What a great product!!! Back in the day, when using chalk for lifting, it would be a very messy ordeal. With the Two Ogres chalk bag it is so much cleaner and handy! Very simply reach into the bag, squeeze the chalk ball a few times, do the other hand, and your ready to do your lift!!! Instead of using straps, chalk helps tremendously with heavy lifts such as deadlifts. However I personally like to use chalk when doing all lifts. It helps me \u201cfeel\u201d the bar. It not only gives you better grip, but it gives you more control. I liked this bag so much, I bought one for my sons in AZ!!!! I highly recommend this bag!!!",

      "text": "This chalk bag was great for the first 4 months or so. Now my butt looks like someone has been snorting cocaine off it for the last hour. The way the shell of this bag is woven makes it prone to wear that eventually leads to tiny chalk poofs all over your backside while climbing. Every time the bag bumps you, another chalk mark. This bag is cheaper than other bags on amazon and unfortunately I was fooled by the good reviews. I'm not tough on my chalk bags by any means, but it shouldn't be puffing chalk dust out holes in the sides after 6 months. Do not buy, get something with a stronger shell.",

There's less spillage when I have less loose chalk and a full chalk ball, but otherwise it gets everywhere.",

If you're just top roping, then there's a hoop you can hook it onto your harness. The small zippered pocket can't hold much since it's super narrow/tight (good for keys maybe)",

Mine had a couple of \"loose threads\" around the zipper area too. But really I'm not bummed because I won't be heading up anything crazy anytime soon. All in all if this is your first bag, or you just need a bunch of cost-effective chalk bags I would recommend this one. As the name implies its just the \"Essential-Z\".",

Minus one star because the belt loops are far too small for an actual tool belt, so I improvised and have attached it with a carabiner.",

The side pocket fits my car key, bouldering membership card, drivers license, credit card and some cash with ease. The drawstring to close it works great, as I rarely find any chalk finding its way out. The interior is super soft and I had no issues at all attaching this to my belt while climbing.",

I bought the bag solely to take to the gym, for weightlifting, not rock climbing, and I do not regret the purchase, but I can't very well speak for the durability.

    "description": "Back in 2011, when we designed our first chalk bag with a Zippered Pocket, it was an innovation. We wanted you to keep your mind not on your belongings, but on your climbing route, knowing your ID, ring, key are safe with you at all times. Nowadays seeing more and more brands include pockets in their designs, it seems to be contagious, or as they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. \n\nCompared to our earlier models, the Essential-Z chalk bag from two Ogres comes with an enhanced closing to prevent chalk from spilling. Larger size to accommodate big hands. Stiff rim to ensure the bag stays open. Slim belt buckle, so that it's easier to wear on top of a harness. Made with durable materials to withstand every day contact with rough surfaces. Designed as a rock climbing chalk bag, can also be used as a weight lifting or gymnastics chalk bag.\n\n100% warranty covers all manufacturer defects in materials and workmanship for a period of (1) year from the original date of purchase. Designed in California. \n\n**Be aware of copycats! two Ogres has been designing chalk bags with signature pockets and linings since 2011. All our designs are original. You may see replicates of our designs under different brand names. When making a buying decision, keep in mind that we invest heavily in designing, ensuring quality and testing of our products.
