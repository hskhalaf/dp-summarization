I feel like I got more than what I paid for since I'm able to play Dark Souls 3 with good graphics. It's a cheap Monitor but it's worth if if you're just using it to play games at your desk. Just incase you guys don't know, It has 1 HDMI Input Port 1 VGA Input Port 1 DVI Input Port I recommend this TV for anyone with a low budget looking for a good monitor.",

I called customer service, they sent me a new one, and I haven't had any issues since! It's a great monitor, not sure what was up with the first one.",

I\u2019m a very casual gamer and this does exactly what I wanted it to. Love the compact size and will be getting a wall mount for it. If I ever need an upgrade I for sure will find something from Sceptre. I\u2019m very impressed with the quality for so cheap!",
