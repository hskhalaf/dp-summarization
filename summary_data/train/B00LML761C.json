      "text": "Great deal on a cast iron tub that literally all visitors to my home comment on and instantly want, so I know it will be a great selling point someday. Great quality and beautiful chrome accents! Even the plumber and remodeling contractor wanted to know where I got it. This tub has made my master bath my favorite room in the house. We had a tight spot for our tub replacement and this tub barely fit. I'm 5'5\" and 125 lbs, and it's the perfect size for me to relax in. Anyone over 5'10\" & 165 lbs might prefer a longer/wider tub. BTW it is VERY heavy and needs 3-4 people to move for installation.",

One other positive that I didn't think of when I decided to buy a cast iron tub, you use less hot water and it stays the same temp the entire bath.",

Hope I can find somebody who'll buy this tub at a discount while I have to find a new tub.",
