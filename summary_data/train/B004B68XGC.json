The compressor works fine but the other stuff that comes with it is cheap crap. If you can purchase just the compressor and go elsewhere for all the other stuff I would recommend it.",

When the hose is attached to a tire, the compressor starts and runs until the connecton is removed then the compressor once again stops. The included gauge has a large easy to read dial and matched a calibrated gauge within one pound.

One of the things I was not expecting is that when you are not actively pumping up, the pump stops so it's not always running. I debated between the 400 & the 450 due to the duty cycle, but I think the 400 flows more air and therefore pumps up more quickly. I'm happy I did get the 400.",

The compressor built into my RV will get up to around 105 but is harder to get to pump them to the 110 or 115. This is much easier and faster. Nice to have one for my car and trailers now.",

Plus I don't have to wait for the compressor to cycle up again to put air in. A little costly, but worth it!",
