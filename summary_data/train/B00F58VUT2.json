I would have liked slightly snug fit covers but these will work fine too...i am actually able to use the smallest one for both 18-55 and 50-200 lens. You can use the largest pouch for upto 400 mm lens. I know i can fit in Sigma 400mm lens in it. Didn't try other brands though but looks like it will fit fine. Again, quality is good and it should last for atleast 4-5 years in my opinion!!",

You have to really squeeze it in there, and you wouldn't want to put it into the next larger pouch, as that pouch would be much too big. That being said, the pouches provide decent cushion/protection for the lens and the clip on the pouches allow me to attach them to my belt loops on my pants for easy access.",
