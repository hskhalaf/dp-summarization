Yes, there are a few features that take some practice to master the use of, but as with any new electronic device, it helps to read the owners manual prior to using the camera. I'm leaving this review after reading a number of reviews with common complaints that I have seen on other camera reviews. Most tend to be user mistakes that could easily been corected by a little reading.",

Today I was on a job, turned the camera on and noticed the LCD screen was cracked. I chatted with Amazon, who connected me with the manufacturer. I was told the warranty had expired and I would have to pay for repair and shipping! Talk about NO customer service!!!! On a good note, the Amazon Rep provided me with a one-time exception of a full refund. At least Amazon gets it! Kudos to Amazon for doing the right thing.",

Good picture quality, good battery life, easy to use and it's nice to have a rechargeable battery built in instead of always changing batteries. and it has a screen on the front that let's you take perfect profile pictures.. I have 2 baby nieces and with the animation feature, you are able to have a little animation video on the front lcd to help draw attention from little kids to the camera. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to buy a new camera. Believe me, you will not regret it. Pros: Bright display, Inexpensive, Lightweight, Realistic color, dual view, multiple features no cons!",

This camera is extremely easy to use and the LCD in the front is a terrific idea. My wife and I often travel alone and I take pictures of us from an outstretched arm. The front LCD makes it easy to frame the shot. Movies look great on my 55\" LCD TV. Another good feature is \"smart auto\"--no more messing with settings--the camera decides what is best and, so far, it has seldom been wrong. Night shots take a fair amount of time to process but the pictures are wonderful. At $99 this thing is a steal!",

They gave me the best customer service I've had in a long time! I can't say enough about how great they were to me. I would definitely make many purchases from this company. Amazing!",

It seems that most of my pictures were me with one other person with my arm stretched out taking the picture; so at least now I can make sure it is centered. As far as I know there is no other camera like it available from what I could find. I think it is a great idea and more companies should follow suit. All cell phones have front facing cameras now, why not regular cameras?",

The only fault(so far) I have is with the back LCD. I smudges easily, i.e. fingerprints are retained even after wiping with a soft cloth. I guess one would have to also get screen protector to prevent the smudges.",

Thanks to HD Movie, you can also use the PL120 to shoot high-definition video. Digital image stabilization creates clear, blur-free photos, while Smart Auto 2.0 optimizes settings for pictures and video in any lighting.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Samsung PL120 DualView 14.2-Megapixel Digital Camera features LCD viewfinders on both the front and rear of the camera, making it easy for you to take great self-portraits as well as set up your other shots clearly. Thanks to HD Movie, you can also use the PL120 to shoot high-definition video. Digital image stabilization creates clear, blur-free photos, while Smart Auto 2.0 optimizes settings for pictures and video in any lighting. \n\n\n\nPL120 DualView Digital Camera (Black)\nAt a Glance: * 14.2-megapixel digital camera and 5x optical zoom for high-quality images\n * 1.5-inch front LCD screen lets you take great self-portraits\n * Shoots high-definition video in 1,280-by-720-pixel resolution\n * Digital image stabilization creates clear, blur-free photos and video\n * Smart Auto feature analyzes composition elements to create the perfect shot\n * One-year limited warranty on parts and labor\n\n\nFeatures LCD viewfinders on front and back of camera for perfectly framed shots. View larger.\nBeauty Shot feature automatically removes imperfections for flawless portraits. View larger.Digital Image Stabilization for Sharp Images and Video\nMake sure the only motion in your videos is intentional. Digital image stabilization automatically compensates for unwanted camcorder movement by realigning each electronic image, frame by frame, with steady results. The Samsung PL120 allows you to record movies in the palm of your hand. With HD Movie, you can capture video in 1,280-by-720-pixel resolution at 30 frames per second. \n\nFront and Back LCD Viewfinders\nWith the PL120, it's easier than ever to put yourself in the shot. In addition to the 2.7-inch viewfinder on the rear of the camera, there is an additional 1.5-inch LCD screen on front. This allows you to quickly line up self-portraits or join a friend or loved one for a perfectly-framed two-person photo. \n\nSmart Auto 2.0 Creates the Perfect Shot\nUsing Smart Auto 2.0, the Samsung PL120 captures the perfect shot by analyzing key composition elements and selecting from 17 different photo and 4 different movie modes. \n\nUsing its face/smile/blink-detection feature, the Samsung PL120 detects and adjusts the lighting on up to nine different faces at a time. The camera will automatically shoot the subjects when they laugh or smile, and prohibit the shot from happening if anyone's eyes are closed. \n\nAdvanced Effects for Your Photos with Smart Filter\nThe Samsung PL120 offers Smart Filter, a collection of lens effects that give your still shots an artistic edge. They include a miniature filter, which miniaturizes everything in your picture; a vignetting filter, which delivers a striking compositional contrast; and a fish-eye filter, which zooms in to give your subject a cool, distorted look. \n\nThe camera's Beauty Shot feature automatically removes dark circles, facial blemishes, and imperfections to create great portraits. It's like having a makeup artist in your camera. A 1.5-inch front LCD screen makes it even easier to take great self-portraits. \n\nProduct and Warranty Information\nThe Samsung PL120 is equipped with a 26mm Samsung lens, a 5x optical zoom, a 2.7-inch LCD screen, and a 1.5-inch front LCD screen. The camera measures 2.15 by 3.7 by 0.74 inches (H x W x D) and weighs 0.24 pounds. \n\nThe Samsung PL120 is backed by a one-year limited warranty on parts and labor. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nCamera, AC adapter/USB cable, rechargeable battery, wrist strap, user manual CD-ROM, and quick start manual.",
