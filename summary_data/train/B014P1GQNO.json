The good thing is that, amidst all the things that babies cause you to anxiously accumulate, this bag takes up no room as it stuffs into a tiny pocket that's a part of the bag. The zipper on my overnight bag has started to break and so now I'm considering getting one of these simple, super compactible bags for me.",

Just throw this bag in your suitcase and fill it up later. It compresses into itself in a very simple and intuitive way. The only real downside is, it has a certain chemical smell that isn't what you want to get on your clothes, and the fabric is so thin that it's likely to wear out sooner than a heavier duty duffle. Both of those are reasonable compromises given the price and convenience, however.",

The built-in pocket worked nicely to hold small things to access during the flying-portion of the trip (phone charger, ticket paperwork, pen, etc), and the duffle was very easy to stow back into the pocket during the motorcycle-portion of the trip.

I'm not sure you want to be carrying bricks in it, but should hold up with normal items. Perfect for overnight stays, gym, going to the cabin, beach or whatever. I would buy again.",
