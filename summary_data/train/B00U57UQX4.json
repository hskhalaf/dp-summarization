      "text": "These are good looking headphones with a contemporary Appearance. I liked the color scheme, designed to look good while being worn. They provide significant ambient noise isolation. They have a musical sound, not transparent in terms of sound reproduction but more of a \u201cbeats\u201c type of sound; fat, warm and bottom heavy. I would say these headphones are a direct competitor of beats in terms of appearance and sound quality at a much lower price. Five star are given because I couldn\u2019t think of a reason to take any stars away.",

I love the removable cord because sometimes I just don't feel like taking the headphones off but the cord gets caught. And as an artist, these have withstood just about every messy thing from clay, plaint, glue, etc... so they're very easy to clean for me. I've always loved skullcandy and these don't disappoint, although they're not really studio headphones as I'd hoped. But I do get complaints about how loud they are occasionally",

I do have a hearing issue (tinnitus, mine sounds like a call of duty 4 flashbang screech all the time) so I know my hearing is not the best, but these headphones sound awesome for their price range. Specifically, the bass.. The bass is not too heavy or powerful, but I feel just right. The mids are very alive and the highs are sharp. Overall, these are great headphones at a great price. Try them, they last me all day without head/ear fatigue.",

Treated with care, I expect these headphones to last at least six to twelve months without breaking. Just be careful not to drop them. However, I should note that the headphones do become minorly uncomfortable after a period of time. In addition, they are not sound-proof. Compared to my previous headphones, I've noticed people are able to hear noise from only two feet away at a moderate volume. This is the perfect cheap headphones to purchase, but I do recommend saving up for something that offers greater quality and experience.",

With all of that being said, the construction is on the light side, exposed wiring to the ear cups, plastic cups, and a metal band. For me, this is no issue but I would be concerned if these headphones were to be frequently used in a commute or put into a bag. If something snags that wiring, it's going to rip out.

I have had them for a little over 4 months now and I think they are awesome. They are comfortable when wearing for a few hours back to back, and I love the sound, possibly more than the Hesh 2's I had. Overall, they feel solid, sound solid, and are great headphones for under 50$.",
