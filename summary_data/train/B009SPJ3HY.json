I have not even installed this product yet or activated any product key (not provided by the way), yet I am unable to get a refund of this purchase. This was $99 wasted as this will now go unused.

Unless you have some crazy macros, I'd really suggest LibreOffice which can handle excel files just fine. Plus, it's FREE. I install it on all my client's computers by default, there's rarely a compelling reason to buy any Microsoft Office product.",

      "text": "I really like a lot of the new features in Excel 2013. There are some really nice chart upgrades, which is sweet because I do that a lot for the business where I work. Flash fill is exciting to preview, but I only occasionally have found a use for it, but for someone who has to build a lot of lists of names it would be a God send. I highly recommend you try Excel 2013.",
