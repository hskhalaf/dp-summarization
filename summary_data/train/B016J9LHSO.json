Well worth the cost. The battery lasts me about 12 hours unplugged. I typically run 6-8 tabs online, and am constantly streaming music from YouTube, since it's only downside (as many others agree) it doesn't have a sufficient/capable MP3 player/music playing ability -yet. But I'm typically optimistic. (Still worth the cost).",
