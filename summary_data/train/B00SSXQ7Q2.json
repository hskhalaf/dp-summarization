Some might feel it is too slow, but once I got into a rhythm, it was fine. I scanned over 100 photos in an afternoon, although I didn't time myself and I took some breaks. Most of the scans are great and will work for my purpose of geneology. If you are looking for something simple, this is your model. If you are looking for super high quality scans, this is not your model.",

The scanner bar is no longer perpendicular (odd angle) which doesn't look right. i think it got stuck on the cheap ribbon inside. Based on other reviews, i think i need to try the cannon to see if the h/w is sturdier. i don't want a replacement that breaks in 1-6 months... Glad this one busted on the first try.

If kept plugged into the computer, you always hear it power on and move to reset every time the computer wakes up. When I unplug it between uses, it sometimes has difficulty waking up. May have to unplug and try again or even restart the computer to get it to work. Serves the purpose, but I prefer our HP all-in-one.",

I wasn't happy with the document scans I did, it cut off the margins of the document. I went to use it today to scan another document and it won't turn on at all. I've disconnected it and connected it several times. I tried to get assistance on the website and all it did was confirm the warranty and not offer any further assistance.",

They never talk about multi-page documents in any of the help system or user manual, so I'm left trying every button to see what might work. Perhaps if I wanted a color scanner for photos this would be useful. That's not my goal. As a document scanner it's a bust. 4/28/2017 Update: Epson says \"don't use this with a USB 3.0 port\".

I like that the USB connection is also the power source so I don't have to have the charger plugged into the wall, so fewer cords to deal with. It scans the pics very nicely, very clear, although I do notice a very slight change in color, the copy is a tiny bit darker, it loses some of the light effect. Otherwise it's a great scanner.",

And just one tip - don't be annoyed if the scanner doesn't wake up when you start your computer - just unplug the USB and then plug it back in. Great product!!!",

It is really no more noisy than any other scanner and, depending on the resolution, no slower than any other. All the power is provided by the USB and there is no power Brick to deal with. This makes it very portable. 5 stars for the quality and the price, combined!",

The optic jammed at an angle, pictured, and would not work any further. Aside from the obvious point of it not working, it feels like a flimsy product. It weighs almost nothing (which in some cases could be a pro, but not here), and any moving parts felt just moments away from giving up and detatching. Needless to say, it has been returned.",
