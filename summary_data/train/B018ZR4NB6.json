      "text": "Nice cycling shoes but these did not fit. I ordered per the mfr's. suggested sizing guide and I barely squeezed into them. Granted, I do have a slightly irregular foot but have never had to wear anything other than a normal width shoe, athletic or formal in style. I returned them within a day and was charged a re-stocking fee of around $7.00-8.00. Would be noce to know of re-stocking fees at the point of purchase. This has become more the norm and has me re-thinking buying on Amazon forward going. Sure, free 2-day shipping and returning.... until the re-stocking fee message pops up.",

However, I was and am not happy that there is no lateral cleat adjustment ,only forward and backwards. In a $175.00 shoe that is not good. Also, the carbon injected sole is not as stiff as i prefer. Venting is superb. would i buy again? NO.",

If it fits your foot right, this is a great shoe. Also, replaceable heel bumpers would be nice.",

Front width a bit narrow for wide (read EE and above) feet and the toe case is quite low. Cleat position is a fraction too far forward to give enough adjustment options but OK. They loosen up with use although I still have to ride with little tension in the adjuster. They look good though and for some that will be all that's needed.",
