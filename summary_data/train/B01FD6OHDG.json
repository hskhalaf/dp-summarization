      "text": "I guess I got a bad batch of bags. When I first used the bags, I thought they were good until the second day. They were not sealed properly. It seems like every other few bags are not sealed properly. I've wasted about 16-24 oz of milk using these bags. I'm exclusively pumping, so it's very disappointing to come across bags that aren't sealed well. I am working very hard to provide milk for my child, and the last thing I need is added stress from bags not being sealed at the bottom. I've contacted customer service. I will update when I receive their response. These bags could be great with my quality control!",

However, the measurement lines are not accurate no matter how I try to adjust the bag (not a huge deal since you can label the volume on the bag). Also, many of the bags do not open when I tear off the perforated part and I have to use scissors to open the top of the bag, which is a little inconvenient. Overall a good product though and I am not unhappy with them. They serve their purpose well in that they store breastmilk securely without leaking!",

Okay so the measurements on the bag are 100% INaccurate but who cares! You pump into your bottles and write your measurements from there. Each bag holds up to 8 ounces but I only store a maximum of 5oz in each bag because that's the size of my bottle-feeds. These bags seal like Fort Knox and stay leak-proof. Every drop of milk that I put in, stays in. They freeze perfectly fine to keep my milk fresh. Any product that helps make the breastfeeding and pumping process easier gets my vote. Mommy's Precious for the win!",

The bags easily hold 8oz of milk (sometimes I even have 9 in there), they close easily, and I flatten them with a milk storage drawer. I am so glad I found them because it was annoying pumping as much extra milk as I was in the beginning before she was eating more and having to put it into smaller bags.",

The measuring is slightly off but not much. I use my bottles to measure out the correct oz. wide mouth when pouring in and pouring out milk. You get more bags for a great price!

I stored over 2000oz with these new bags and Ive only had 1 or 2 leak! Absolutely amazing!

The speck moved when the bag moved so it's not dry to the plastic, it would have come out in the milk if I had not seen it before using the bag. Disappointing, I liked these bags until now - look closely before you use to store your liquid gold!!!",

There is a part to tear off of the top that guarantees nothing sneaks into the bags before you are ready to use them. I've used them in the refrigerator and freezer and haven't had any problems so far. I can't think of any improvements at this time. I plan on ordering them again.",

The bags are extremely difficult to open and they end up breaking around the zip lock in the process making them useless. I\u2019ve had multiple people try to open them in case it was just me and same thing. I am honestly very disappointed and will be going back to Lasinoh Bags next time.",
