The outside box looked a bit cheap, but the binoculars themselves are not. They have some weight to them and the optics seem very good. I decided my boys would not be using them for toy binoculars and need to be more responsible with them.",

Obviously not the greatest magnifying qualities but what do you expect for a kids set? She liked them and they didn't end up in the bottom of the toy box (yet) so if she's happy, I'm happy. Edit: that\u2019s been last fall and she\u2019s still using them! That\u2019s a Win in my grandma arsenal!",
