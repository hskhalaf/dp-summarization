Hard to believe but the old one gave out at three years and two months. The corner seam gave out.You can NOT patch the corner seam. Other than that I love the bed.",

Most comfortable mattress I have owned by far, nothing comes close. It's so good I have trouble leaving it in the morning. The only downside is the unavoidable smell of vinyl, but I used to work at a pool company so it doesn't me that much.",
