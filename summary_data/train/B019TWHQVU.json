Compared to other travel rods, these win hands down for quality of graphite and eyes and reel seat. The cork handles are of excellent quality. They fit in my suit case easily for travel to go Bass fishing on Table Rock or casting for ocean critters in Oahu. These are the best Travel rods with the worst name ! :>)",
