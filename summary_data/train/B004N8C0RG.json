I let him look at all the different patterns on the Amazon listing and choose his favorite to buy. When it got here, he couldn't wait to wear his backpack! For our trip, we let him stock it with his favorite toys and snacks for the flight. It's durable, high quality material and I know it will last and he'll be able to use it in preschool too. It is designed well for a small toddler to be able to wear it all the way up to an older young child. Great product!",

Sadly, we can\u2019t use it for school because a standard piece of paper doesn\u2019t fit. I assumed when I bought a 12\u201d backpack, that the inside would hold something 12\u201d. Not so! An 8.5x11 sheet of paper comes out with dog-eared corners at the top. It will be fine for toys and snack on road trips or park trips, but not suitable for school.",

It is not large enough to put a standard notebook or folder into without bending the edges of the folder so if this is necessary you may want to purchase the next size up. The backpack is very sturdy and seams seem to be reinforced. It's very easy to clean as well.",

About 2 months ago the strap that you hang the pack up with started to rip. I contacted Wildkin and their customer service was excellent. They said they have a 1 year warranty and would replace my bag for free, no need to send the old one back. The replacement bag was on back order so they allowed me to choose any bag as a replacement. I had the bag less than 1 week from my original contact. Excellent customer service!!!",

Fits what he thinks he needs to bring along (toys) and then some (juice box, snacks). Fabric and seams are thick and durable and the zippers are sturdy (so far). I picked this one because my son loves trains and tractors. It is smaller than a conventional backpack, but for a toddler it is a good size. I would recommend.",

This will work well for him to carry his toys and books when we travel, as well. The only negative I see is when my son drags the backpack on the ground outside, the fabric around the piping on the edges was very easily ripped. It's a cosmetic thing - the pack is still holding together nicely but the front bottom edge looks frayed after not much use.",

It is a little too small for a regular sized folder so when he starts school we may need to get him a new one, but to carry around his toys and a change of clothes it's perfect. Love the drink holder on the side also.",
