      "text": "It's been a great power supply so far. I haven't had any issues besides the horribly strong plastic smell that it is emitting from the unit. I got the 1000w power supply so it shouldn't be burning up. I'm way under the total output. I don't know why the smell won't go away. It makes my entire house smell like strong plastic. I thought it would go away after a couple weeks but It's STILL HERE!",
