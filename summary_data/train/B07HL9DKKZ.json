I wouldn\u2019t recommend using the plate grabber with a heavy plate. Our dish set is pretty heavy, but it works fine for our children\u2019s plates (much lighter). The only complaint t I have is the steam basket sitting on the bottom/not leaving room for water to bring the pot to pressure, but this can be remidied by either placing it on top of the egg tray, or putting a bit of tin foil underneath. Overal, it\u2019s a great set!",
