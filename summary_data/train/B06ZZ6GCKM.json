I was comfortable with the price, the parts, and the quality. Once I got it all set up it was a no brainer. This was an awesome decision. Expertly packaged, wire management on-point, good mix of hardware, and a awesome looking case.",

To top it off the keyboard went out very quickly to where it won't work. Very disappointed overall and have already began changing out parts.

So, it's off to the store to buy external devices to add to this machine to make it truly useful. Operationally, the computer seems fine so far, but we've only had it for a week, so time will tell.",
