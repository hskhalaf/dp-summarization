Great alternative to those expensive and wasteful disposable pads - I have a senior (15 yr) old chihuahua who is having a little bit of a hard time \"holding it in\" if I have to leave him alone more than 2 hours to go shopping or something. I hated the thought of contributing to landfill with disposable pads, and the plastic dog potties with the fake grass tend to stink really bad after a while (in my experience), plus I didn't want something he would feel inclined to use while I'm home. These washable pads are perfect, well made, easy to fold up and hide away, and he took to it first day. Great product!",

The only reason I gave it a four and not a five is because I can't tell when the dog has used them just by looking. I have to actually smell it. I have another extra large one that is white and although I find it disgusting that I can see where the dog has peed on it, at least I know right away when to remove it. I find they clean up well and no leaking through. Definitely a great financial investment and it has saved my hard wood floors.",

It saved us so much money in the fact that we could wash it instead of throwing it away and buying pack after pack of disposables. (Not to mention, we didn't have to take out even more garbage due to this.) The only reason we stopped using it is because the puppy finally chewed them up, despite constant training. He just really loved how they felt in his mouth. No fault of the product. Very good product.",
