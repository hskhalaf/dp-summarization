      "text": "This Epson Workforce WF7720 has been the worst printer we have ever purchased! We purchased this printer in March 2018. I was very impressed at first, even though it was big and noisy. However, after about a year problems incurred. I was on phone with tech support for over an hour once about a setup issue, with no resolution and was told to call google for support. It was not a Google issue. Seems there has been one problem after another and now we are left with very expensive ink cartridges we cannot use. Please dont waste your money!",

I had to download the driver package from their web site to get everything set up properly. The touch pad on the machine is poor at best. The pull out control panel is not stable and moves when the touch pad is used. Keys on the touch pad must be pressed, or jabbed, 4, 5 or 6 times to get a response. Very frustrating and difficult to use. The next time I need a multi-function printer for my home business, I will look at something other than Epson.",
