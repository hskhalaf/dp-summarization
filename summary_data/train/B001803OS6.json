      "text": "I have a number of Omron products, mostly Blood Pressure Monitors, which I've checked vs my Dr's measurements and are accurate. This product gave me an accurate weight but a BF% of ~28% after several measurements. The high end machine at the gym I work out at gives me b/w 14 & 16% consistently (including today) and 28% would also put me well overweight, which I'm not by any stretch. The other measurements (& fact I have a legitimate 6-pack and am relatively muscular) illustrate the fact clearly it's way off. I suspect that the formula based on age, height, weight calculates averages (I'm 43, 5'9 & 190lbs) & drives more of the \"measurement\" than the actual measuring aspect.",

The scale's results were identical on weight and BMR to the Bodpod, and within 0.3% on body fat.

They know how much the bar weighs... you mean they can't compensate for that weight? Worse (for the physicists out there), the bar is *spring*-connected... the taller you are, the more you *lift* the bar (and thus *add weight*!). Just brain-dead! Okay, so the measurements are helpful... but I have to question a company missing this obvious problem... and the fact that my nutritionist has the exact same scale and gets different numbers (fraction-3 pounds different). Will try to find a more reliable scale myself.",

For example, I think it reads high on bodyfat percentages, but once you have a baseline, I think it's accurate for the CHANGE of bodyfat. Also throw the \"body age\" number out the window, it says I'm 80 years old! lol! WHAT??? And I'm very fit! Maybe it knows something I don't?? But overall a great scale.",
