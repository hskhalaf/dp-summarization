My first attempt at rice pudding produced a mixture that would probably successfully plaster an exterior wall. Now I get it, and feel comfortable cooking many things. A good safety feature is the inner lid that prevents bits of beans or rice from clogging the pressure hole. So I feel confident that it won't explode.",

I only have 2 burners on my stove (and a grill) so I didn't want one for the stove. This is easy to use, easy to clean. It's amazing how lesser cuts of meat can become so tender so quickly. The front panel is clear and simple to understand. Would suggest double checking the position of the steam vent, however. I have not lined it up correctly and so the food did not pressurize. Now that I am used to it, it's no big deal. Love the non-stick interior, too! This machine is only second to my crockpot!",

The new one is only 6qt in size and it doesn't allow us to put in the same amount of meat to feed our family of six. We hear rumors that QVC is going to sell an 8qt version this fall. The Denis pressure cooker is 8qt but is has terrible reviews from people that purchased it.",

    "title": "Cuisinart CPC-600 6 Quart 1000 Watt Electric Pressure Cooker (Stainless Steel)",
    "description": "Size:6-Quart| Style Name:2018\n\nCOOK FASTER, EAT HEALTHIER!\n Reduce time spent in the kitchen preparing meals with the help of this 6-quart electric pressure cooker--it cuts cooking times up to 70-percent when compared to traditional stovetop cooking methods. The unit traps steam inside, which builds up pressure to create hotter temperatures, and its tight seal locks in heat, moisture, and flavor, as well as vitamins and minerals for exceptionally healthy, great-tasting meals like soup, chili, and other one-dish entrees. It also works well for cheesecake and custard, because dessert should never be left off the menu. The unit's push-button controls and easy-to-read digital display eliminate guesswork, while its precision digital thermostat regulates temperatures. Choose from preprogrammed settings for high- or low-pressure cooking, browning, simmering, sauteing, and warming. For safety, the cooker must be fully locked for pressure to build, and it will remain locked until the pressure inside drops to zero. Other highlights include a 99-minute timer with an LED countdown display, cool-touch side handles, and a nonstick cooking pot that cleans up easily by hand or in the dishwasher. A dishwasher-safe trivet also comes included. Housed in brushed stainless steel, the 1000-watt pressure cooker measures 12-1/5 by 12-1/5 by 13-1/5 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. \n\n You're about to experience a better, faster, and healthier way of cooking. Your Cuisinart Electric Pressure Cooker seals in steam to cook hotter and faster, and it seals in nutrients as well. Cook in less water and experience textures and tastes that are simply sensational. Features easy touch-button settings, a countdown timer, and a cooking pot big enough for a pot roast with all the fixings. Enjoy! \n\nPRESSURE COOKER SETTINGS\n\u2022 Low Pressure\n\n\u2022 High Pressure\n\n\u2022 Browning \u2013 This preset temperature allows cooking over high heat, without the lid, before pressure cooking. Browning foods in a small amount of fat in this way seals the outer surfaces of meats and vegetables, producing a visually appealing, flavorful exterior with a moist, tender interior. \n\n\u2022 Saut\u00e9 \u2013 The preset temperature, done prior to pressure cooking with lid removed, allows you to quickly soften vegetables in a small amount of fat or liquid without browning, and to cook items such as rice (Arborio, brown, Carnaroli, white, etc.) for pilafs and risottos. \n\n\u2022 Simmer \u2013 This preset temperature allows you to cook liquids at a lower temperature. It is primarily used to finish cooking some items, i.e. to add ingredients to a risotto, sauce, or stew or to continue cooking process to achieve preferred texture. \n\n\u2022 Keep Warm \u2013 Holds and keeps cooked food warm for up to 12 hours. Automatic Keep Warm Feature: When LED display reaches, the pressure cooker automatically shifts to Keep Warm temperature. The Keep Warm light will turn on and unit will beep to indicate cooking is complete. \n\nPRODUCT FEATURES\n \u2022 6-quart capacity\n\u2022 Fingerprint-proof brushed stainless steel housing\n\u2022 Digital thermostat\n\u2022 Push button control for cooking options and programmed settings\n\u2022 99-minute time and LED countdown display \n\u2022 Cool-touch side handles\n\u2022 Nonstick cooking pot\n\u2022 Trivet included (dishwasher safe)\n\u2022 Dishwasher-safe cooking pot\n\u2022 1000 watts\n\u2022 Recipe book included\n\u2022 Limited 3-year warranty\n\nEFFORTLESS COOKING\n\n\n 1.  With the unit on and the LED displayed, press the MENU button to select the desired cooking function. The function light will flash. \n 2.  \n 3.  \n 4.   Select Low or High Pressure setting.\n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.   Press TIME to select number of minutes needed for pressure cooking. Time increases in 1-minute increments up to 40 minutes. Time increases in 5-minute increments from 40 to 99 minutes. \n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10.  Press START/CANCEL to start cooking. The pressure cooker will begin to heat. The red float will rise as pressure builds. When the selected pressure level is reached, the light in lower right-hand corner of LED will stop flashing and remain lit. At this point pressure cooking begins and the timer will start to count down. The timer will not begin to count down until full pressure is reached, which may be several minutes after the red float has fully risen. \n\n\n\nRECIPE TIPS AND HINTS\n \u2022 Many family favorites can be easily adapted for preparation in your Cuisinart Electric Pressure Cooker \u2013 soups, stews, side dishes and more. \n\u2022 The amount of liquid needed is much less than for traditional cooking methods. \n\u2022 Never exceed the Maximum Fill Amount of the pressure cooker. \n\u2022 Make sure the lid is on firmly and tightly, and moved as far counterclockwise as it will go to allow proper locking. \n\u2022 Hot foods/liquids will come to pressure more quickly than cold foods/liquids. \n\u2022 When pressure cooking is completed, follow recipe instructions for releasing pressure. For Quick Pressure Release it is important to begin immediately upon completion of pressure cooking; otherwise foods will continue to cook, and may overcook. \n\u2022 Do not store pressure cooker with lid on tightly. This saves on gasket wear and tear. \n\u2022 More nutrients are preserved during pressure cooking than with traditional cooking methods, as less liquid is used and thus fewer nutrients are lost to evaporation. \n\u2022 To adapt your own recipes, find a similar one in our cookbook and use it as a guide. In general, cooking time will be at least 1\u20443 to . of the traditional cooking time. Reduce your cooking liquid by at least half \u2013 you may need to \"play\" with your recipe to get it right. You may wish to add vegetables at the end of cooking to avoid overcooking. You can also use the cooking charts provided as a guide.",
