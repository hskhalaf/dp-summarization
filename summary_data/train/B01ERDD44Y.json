Initially I was trying to look for something without leopard print and that was a bit hard to find but thank goodness I found this one! The hood has paw imprints (cute) and that's about it. Kitty took this bed immediately. She loves it so much that I bought her one for the other room so she can pick and choose where she wants to sleep. I am so glad that I bought her this bed! Please don't stop making the small size and plain colors!",

My studio apartment get pretty cold at night and early mornings and I would find myself grabbing them and snuggling with them under my blanket to warm up their frozen ears and paws. The larger cat in the photo he does not like the hood so I removed it. Now I've noticed when he climbs out in the morning his ears and paws are nice and warm. I would buy a second one but him and my new kitty enjoy cuddling as you can see (: he is a large cat weighing at 14lbs and the little one she is all fluff they fit pretty snugg. May have to invest in a second one.",
