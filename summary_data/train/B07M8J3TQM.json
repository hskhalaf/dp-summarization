Had to disable turning off when the lid closed in power settings but then if I forgot to shut it down first it would get crazy warm in my bag. 3rd one seemed fine but after 2 weeks one of the fans has started to make a lot of noise and is clearly struggling. Going to try and get razer to send me one if it's an easy install but very frustrating!",

Tightly packed and using top quality materials. Nice touch with the screen/keyboard dust cover for wjej you aren't using the machine. The power adapter is slim and feels solid. Nice rubber cable management attached. The laptop itself is quiet even when under load, I play Ark with a fair few mods and this handles the game on epic settings perfectly. Every product I have ever bought from this company really is head and shoulders above its competitors. Keep up the awesome work! Thanks.",
