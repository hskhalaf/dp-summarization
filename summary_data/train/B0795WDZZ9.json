      "text": "Wow! I HATE curling irons. I know they work, but I have 0 patience for them. I also have not figured out the method for using my flat iron to curl my hair. This iron is so easy to use and it took a solid 10 minutes to do all of my hair (mid-back). It will beep if the hair gets tangled. There is nothing dangerous about this product at all; I thought the way it was set up it would rip my hair if it got caught. Nope! I would definitely buy this. So worth it!",

It beeps when you have too much hair in so make sure you section off small enough sections because that is the one thing I struggled with.

      "text": "Not surprised that Chi delivers another amazing hair tool. Heats up quickly and leaves flowing curls with a just left the salon look. Took a few minutes to get used to but then it\u2019s a breeze. For those who commented that hair gets tangled and you have to reset, the directions in user manual are incorrect! It says to use the wand with the display on the side closest to/facing your head. That is wrong. The display should face away from your face/head so you can pull the hair over the wand and into the opening.",

You just have to make sure you don't put too much hair in at once - it doesn't tangle, it just beeps at you. And it's a bit awkward to reach the back of your head, but just takes a little practice.
