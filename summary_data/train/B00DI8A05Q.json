KabelDirect has by far the best quality for charging, sound cables, 3.5 cables, rca splitters. All types, I have purchased everything from monster to Anker, Belkin and too many to list. KableDirect works with everything. Their cables are extremely durable and great quality. You can tell right away what kind of cable you purchased. If you do some research you will see KabelDirect is nothing but quality and great prices. Highly Recommend!!!!",

It progressively got worse. I had to squeeze the cord and hold it a certain way for the volume on the left side to be on. I bought the exact same cord again, because I didn't want to mess around with a different manufacturer, etc. It's working great, so the problem wasn't the headphones. But, I'm wondering if it's normal for these lengthy cords (mine is 15') to malfunction after a while.",

The KabelDirekt product is comfortably heavy, is not prone to tangle, and lies flat and straight. On the other hand, the OEM cable is rather thin, apt to get snarled, and keeps a memory of its being coiled up in the package. Additionally, the availability of the KabelDirekt product in a variety of lengths means I can tailor the length of the cable to the application--I won't have a cable that's too short, nor one with a bunch of excess length. In all, a winning product.",

I was going to send it back but now I've cut it to show you the inside I'll recycle as a headphone extension. Actually if you manufacture cables and sell online, a picture of the inner construction should be mandatory.",

There was no distortion when either end of the cable was wobbled, and the jacks fit perfectly -- no wobble, and no added size to trick you in to thinking the cable is better quality (while simultaneously bending your audio jack). Totally worth it.",
