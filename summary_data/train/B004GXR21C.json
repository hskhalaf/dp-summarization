Perhaps my glasses were faulty, but that's been my experience with these guys -- and I'm not really happy about it. But otherwise it's pretty cheap and a good price for all the pieces you get. But if you're displaying them, adjust the arrangement of the cups so the lines aren't visible :)",

They told me that the set does indeed contain lead, and that liquids should not be stored in the crystal overnight. I wish I had known this before purchasing.

They didn't break so i can't complain. Thank you",

I was worried that the stopper on the decanter would be lightweight but I was pleasantly surprised by its heft and durability. The tray is very plain and basic. It goes well with our decor because we don't need an elaborate tray to upstage the glasses, decanter, and most importantly what is in them.",

It's very durable and sturdy, and ALL glass. There is no plastic or rubber parts anywear on the decanter itself. The glasses are beautiful, and there are 6 of them. The tray is also pretty nice, it's a good tray, and not flimsy at all. The product was well packaged, and arrived quickly and undamaged. This is an excellant set, I paid around $80 shipped for it, and it looks so much more expensive. Very nice!",
