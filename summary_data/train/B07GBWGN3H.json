It seems to hold battery charge for a long time, but the fact that it can even be recharged is amazing. It\u2019s long and slim so it can reach into my candles to light them where other lighters can\u2019t since I can\u2019t ignite them inside that small space. I also love that you have to turn the lighter on for it to be used. My little boys aren\u2019t able to accidentally use it.",

My only criticism is that the cord connecting the unit to a USB charging source is like two or three inches long, very short. I really love this for lighting candles. No more worrying about whether we are low on lighter fluid.",
