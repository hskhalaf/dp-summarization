    "description": "INCREASES ENERGY & CONCENTRATION\n\nAllows energy from the intestines to place focus elsewhere, improving energy. Nutrition is very important to mental health, and the weak vitamin absorption before your colon cleanse may lead to loss of concentration. In addition to you having more energy, absorption of crucial vitamins responsible for mental clarity is improved, meaning your concentration may also be supported.\n\n\n\nLiving Well Now 15 Day Natural Cleanse is the best colon detox on the market! With additives in our food, pesticides on our crops, and pollution all around us. When your colon is backed up with toxic material, your body becomes sluggish and unable to perform optimally. Some toxins remain in the body and require some help to facilitate removal. Benefits of using a colon cleanse:\n\n1-SUPPORTS COLON HEALTHToxins taken into your body will be processed, making it to the colon. By not cleansing your colon (and liver), causing damage. By ridding the body of the waste, you support the many functions of your colon, including digestion and proliferation of beneficial gut flora.\n\n2-WEIGHT LOSSLow-fiber and processed foods lead to poor diet choices. It\u2019s very hard to relieve yourself of low-fiber foods compared with high-fiber options, and these foods will often linger much longer in the gut. A colon cleanse flushes this matter from the system, and, in some, may lead to significant weight loss that stays off.\n\n3-IMPROVES DIGESTION & PREVENTS CONSTIPATIONThis can make for poor digestion, and vice versa. When digestion is impaired and constipation ensues, waste products can linger in your body. Detoxing your colon allows those undigested waste products to be pushed through your system, providing constipation relief. This purge clears the way for good nutrient absorption, thereby supporting good health.\n\nMust Try these Colon Cleanse Capsules Today!",
