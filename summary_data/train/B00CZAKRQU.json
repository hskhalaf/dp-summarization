If you put both parts on top of each other they will not be centered. After fixing this its functional. The stain isn't great but you get what you pay for and my friend was still appreciative. In the end, if you care about your cues take the time (30 minutes) to unscrew each clip and properly align them with bottom portion of the cue rack.",

Once installed it has a nice look and is relatively simple to install. I would highly recommend using a stud finder to ensure at least one end of each piece is securely fastened to the wall. Also be sure to use a tape measure to properly ensure you will have the proper distance from top to bottom. This is a very neat and tidy solution to ensuring your prized pool cue's are displayed properly, and out of harms way.",
