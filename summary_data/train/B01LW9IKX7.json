Tried the suggested fixes, but didn't work. I then had to do go Amazons technical support, who had obviously done the same google search and who then sent me to apples technical support, who , gues what , asked me to try the same things. Now waiting for them to sent a repair package. Generally not what I have come to expect from Amazon or apple",
