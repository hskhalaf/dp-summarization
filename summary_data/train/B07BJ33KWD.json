However, disappointment quickly set in as he began building it and found that 4 turning pieces and 3 cart pieces were missing from the set. It wasn't only disappointing to him, but to me as well!",

Its a really cool looking coaster them, however the way the pieces of the base holding the roller coaster all the way around , are held is skim to say the least. There are just a few blocks and I would have expected more of a platform all around the roller coaster base to make it look nicer. Problem is because there are only a few pieces, the roller coaster falls apart easily. For the price I feel they could have added more pieces and design to this set.",

I am not sure the specifics on how long it took him to put it together (he is ten) but once completed, my brother sent me pictures of it, and it was very cool looking. My nephew was very proud that he was able to put this whole thing together. Highly recommend, as it is a very neat Lego set!",
