I purchased this soaker hose the same time I purchased two others flat soakers. They are working great. This one can't handle the sun and broke down causing the unrepairable blow outs. I'd consider other hoses if you want one to last longer than two seasons.",

You turn it on at a low pressure or use the flow restriction washer that comes with the product. Bottom line, I am very please and just ordered another.",

Believe it or not, it broke again just below the repair. The entire hose is rotten. I decided to replace it with a flat fabric hose.",

The only down side is picking it up to put it away-it's a muddy mess unless you leave it to dry out before trying to coil it up. A longer one would be even worse. The 7 year warranty is nice.
