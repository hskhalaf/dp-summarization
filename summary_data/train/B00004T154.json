      "text": "Works great, I like the seat. However, if someone puts the lid down and stands on it (in the case of my 12-year-old, to get rid of cobwebs above the toilet) then the plastic arms that attach the lid will break and you are S.O.L. :-). We had 2 toilet seats break before I realized how this was happening. We don't have this problem with other toilet seats even when used as a stepping stool. The issue is that the plastic arms are fine for normal use, but when weight is put on the closed lid, the padding compresses and puts a lot of strain in the fragile plastic arms and they break.",

Since I will need to buy a replacement seat, I'll just go for a full refund and get a different brand. Beware! They don't stand by their product.",

Also, the seat sits slightly skewed to one side on the toilet and I'm not sure whether this is an issue with the seat or the toilet itself (which may have skewed mounting holes).",

After reading many reviews it's my understanding that it is a trade off. If you want a cushioned toilet seat that's not cold, then you can expect to replace these periodically. To me it is worth it for the comfort. I do hope this one will last more than a year. I've had it for a couple of months now and I am very satisfied with it - no tears no problems ! I have purchased several cheaper versions of these and they we're not as comfortable and tore up within weeks. So far this one is excellent!",

My wife noticed recently that the top seat cover areas where the padding is has turned blue. I find it odd that both seats are blue after having them for almost a year. I would hope any cleaning product we have used over the year would not contribute to this issue. I believe the seat is possibly wearing down and loosing it white paint perhaps in under year. I will need to replace these seats so the rating is low since they did not last me even a year.",

After decades of having a screwdriver dedicated to (and exiled to) the bathroom for the express purpose of tightening the toilet seat screws that always seem to come loose with some regularity, I found myself literally amazed with the new seat. No more screws to tighten, this seat has been re-engineered so that once you attach the screws to the bowl, the seat has these two very handy snap on connections that attach to the top of the screws. Besides the NASA level toilet seat connection system, the seat is comfortable and easy to clean.",

This seat was the answer to our sensory defensive son\u2019s toileting issue. The fear he was going to fall in coupled with the hardwood of our previous seat made each day a battle. But, I am thrilled that he loves this seat and feels comfortable on it!",
