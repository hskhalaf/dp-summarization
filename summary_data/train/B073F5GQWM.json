He's a very good boy.. the instructions are great. With treats and encouragement, he was using them with ease within about 10 minutes. They fit great and have 2 Velcro straps. The top strap ensures they don't fall off if you put them on snug. His sister tried to pull 2 off by giving a good tug, but they stayed on. Now the old man can walk with confidence and I don't have to have towels or rugs everywhere.",

I purchased these boots to help my girl to walk better because she has developed a little hip weakness and these prevent her feet from slipping when she walks on our tile floor. The rubber sole grips very well. I use them on her back paws only while indoors and then on all 4 paws outdoors. I am very pleased with the results and so is she! Excellent product that I will definitely will buy again.",
