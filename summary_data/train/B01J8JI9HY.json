      "text": "Did take longer than the 30 minutes claimed in the instructions, had to contact Nexx support, and they responded quickly. Had to use multi-tool to cut an indention into my garage door header to mount the sensor. I ended up using crimp-on spade connectors to connect wires to my garage door opener. Too much of a hassle three wires to stay on the post as I was tightening the screw down. Absolutely love the geofencing and auto-open feature. I recently had a metal roof installed and that interfered with my old remote. Had to drive half way up my driveway before the remote would open door. Now as I pull into the driveway, the door automatically opens! Love it!",

The trick is to figure out where to route and install the sensor. My opener has a solid top surface covering the belt. I just used that to route it to the garage door. I used double sided tape to secure to sensors, but I may come back to screw them in later. They work fine as it is.",
