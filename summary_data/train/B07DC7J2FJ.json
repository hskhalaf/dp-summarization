It doesn\u2019t last super long, especially when eating or drinking, but I don\u2019t mind. It doesn\u2019t leave a bad residue as it starts to wear off, so it still looks good when you reapply a few times a day. I have it in a couple colors. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking to brighten up your lips without being overly dramatic. Hint: when first using, it takes like 30 clicks to get the color to saturate the applicator sponge - don\u2019t give up haha.",

This is not a moisturizing product at all, but it doesn't dry out my lips like other long wear lip products I've tried. I just hope they keep making it",
