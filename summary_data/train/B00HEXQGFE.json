I was able to make over 100 cake pops in under 2.5 hours (non decorated of course). 2 tips to future users- use the recipes in the included booklet. There's less water and the consistency is PERFECT! And 2, use a ziplock bag with a corner cut out to fill the cake pop holes 3/4 way full for perfectly rounded pops!",

My one friend wanted a beach themed cake pops and my daughter had never made cake pops before so we did some research reading amazon reviews and found this cake pop maker that was affordable with good reviews. The cake pops turned out perfect; great shape and color to them. Does not make a lot of cake pops at once, but since it was easy to do we just made multiple batches and every cake pop turned out the same. Would recommend this product.",

The brownie batter is too dense to make it perfectly round like the cake batter, but they still look adorable and are absolutely delicious! It heats up quickly, is easy to clean and is nice and tiny to store. You can make more than just cake pops. I found some great recipes for bite sized apperizers online (pizza balls, corn dog bites, cheesy bread balls, baby quiche, blueberry pancake bites...so many possibilities! Highly recommend, will be purchasing the larger one asap! Holidays are coming up, you must get this machine, it's made me smile all week.:))",

I make them 4 times already and they were perfect ! I followed the chocolate recipe of the booklet, which was very good. I would recommend to buy the 100 re-usable sticks at the same time. The only difficult part is that you would need a stand to have the cake pop stored in your fridge. I made one out of a eggs carton box and it works well! Excellent gift for girl or for Valentines!!",
