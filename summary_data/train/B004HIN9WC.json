Within a week,both plastic spindles that attach the speakers to the headband physically broke at their respective bases.. As a workaround, I unscrewed the sides, replaced the broken plastic parts with wooden dowels (for rigidity) and then used electrical tape to secure the headphones in place. The MacGyvered improvisation is holding up better than manufacturer's design, but if I do end up replacing them, I won't be buying this model again.",

Good sounding headphones to wear that don't eat up your battery life, just slightly bigger than ear buds but more comfortable, and probably more hygienic for long trips since you aren't sticking the directly into your ear canal. Unfortunately they don't cancel noise nor do they have a microphone on the wire, but for basic headphones these have been worth the price and I wouldn't worry too much if they do break or get lost.",

Not noise canceling, in other words, with just the headphones on and no sound, doesn't block noise, but with music on, you can hardly hear anything else. Definitely worth the price!",

They are comfortable to wear and come in fun colors. I like mine in the royal blue and the color is true to the picture. Great for listening to my music, audiobooks, and podcasts on the plane, at the pool, or on a walk.",

The one drawback is the same with every other pair of on-ear headphones I've tried: even after making adjustments, they were irritating. After prolonged periods of use, they become downright painful. I'd recommend going with earbuds, or over-ear headphones. I bought thein a store, and they sound pretty good to me, as well as being much more comfortable to wear.",

Trying to compensate with a pair of ear-covering headphones brought about exactly the opposite response: the music turned very bass-y, but not crisp, with muffled frequencies. The JVCs are just right: because they don't cover the ear but sit on the ear (more or less), a bit more bass that would be lost through earbuds is captured. The result is a beautifully balanced sound with a round, solid but not overpowering bass.",
