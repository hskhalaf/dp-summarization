The tubing is so flimsy one hesitates to hold anything too tightly. Be forewarned, if you do for some reason want to tempt fate and buy this desk, don't put anything of value on it. It will probably cause the desk to collapse.",

The allen wrech basically stopped working after minimal use, and even upon shipping in replacement parts and finishing assembly (save for the keyboard tray, because why bother at that point) the middle desk section would tilt forward dramatically at even the slightest pressure which, for a desk I intended to draw on, is a definite dealbreaker. I realize a fully non-defective model likely would not have these issues, but for them to give this unit the okay to ship to customers makes it highly unlikely this manufacturer will have my trust in future.

The assembly was very easy, even came with the allen key you will use for 95% of the job. Every part was labeled with a number too, even the screws. The metal parts are nice and threaded so you don't need any nuts to hold them in place. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there was some damage to the desktop parts, most likely caused by shipping, but not enough for me to really care.",

It also doesn't feel sturdy...it IS sturdy, it just doesn't feel like it sometimes. It was simple to put together and when I damaged a piece during the process, the customer support people were extremely courteous and helpful, and I got my replacement piece within 2 days.
