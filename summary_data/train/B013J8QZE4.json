The only thing i didn't like is that after i received the tires, the price went down 40 bucks on each tire! :p (If I had known it would happen I would have waited a week more lols)",

They are a summer tire, and I got caught in a sudden downpour, if that happens, pull over and wait it out.",

I run them on a shelby gt500 heavily modified (800hp at the wheels) they have a much better grip than the stock tires which honestly isn't saying much but these things hook good. Of course you're going to be able to break them loose but if you know how to drive your car they will work great. I daily drive my car yes even in light rain and they still hook decent enough (again not driving like an idiot in the rain) but they make it to where I am able to drive an 800hp rear wheel drive car in the rain so I am very pleased.",

It bulges somewhat on the side facing inward but perfectly flat on the side facing the outward. So it looks great and doesn't rub which was my main concern. It doesn't solve all traction issues since it is still easy to spin. But traction is greatly improved and far more controllable. Like the other reviews state, it is a streetable car now.",

They handle way better in the rain then drag radials, I would recommend these tires for street driving over summer performance tires.",
