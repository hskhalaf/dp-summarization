That was my only complaint- I do think the instructions were not complete enough to explain the removal of the last layer. I was almost going to send this back until I realized there was one more sheet to remove.",

Let me tell you that I'm next to worthless putting these things on any devices, but I was successful with the InvisibleShield Glass Screen Protector. The screen protector is THICK!

I only needed to use the cloth provided to smooth down a few places along the edges. It is important, though, that you have the iPad screen itself very clean before applying the InvisibleShield Glass.",

      "text": "Once applied, this product is fantastic. It provides incredible protection and, according to everyone with whom I have spoken, the customer service is extraordinary if the glass ever gets nicked. Total replacement, no questions asked. For the lifetime of the product. It doesn't get better than that. The only negative -- and it's not a negative as much of an unavoidable reality -- is that it's hard to keep away microns of dust as you're applying the Zagg glass to the screen. Lots of blowing away the dust is required. But that would be true if any product. I highly recommend this product.",
