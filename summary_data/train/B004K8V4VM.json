Pretty comfortable to sit on - have had kids (10 to 12 years old) and adults use it at the dining room table without problem. Could be a little uncomfortable if you have a \"bony butt\". Could easily add some padding on top if you needed to. Has some pads on the feet to not scratch your floors. Easy to move (35 pounds each). Sturdy - seems to hold weight without any problem.",

It's modern and sleek, and it goes great with all my very expensive RH furniture, I highly recommend this stainless steel bench!

It was packed/padded very well (NB: they warn you to save packing material, just in case) and arrived in perfect condition. When we opened we found a well made, nicely finished bench which wow are using as a coffee table. Works perfectly for our purposes. All in all, I highly recommend.",

It\u2019s a bench so it\u2019s not going to be the most luxurious seat in the house but it\u2019s one of the prettiest in mine. The slats don\u2019t bother but may if sat on for extended periods of time that could be different. A cushion or pillow can solve that easily. It can go anywhere a bench should be and more.

    "title": "Modway Large Gridiron Stainless Steel Bench",
    "description": "Size:Large BenchStraight lines were once deemed the realm of strict logic. This conduit design accomplishes something quite profound. It blends linear components with a pleasantly stainless steel tubular effect. Modernism used to be about extremes. Wild shapes and patterns that don\u2019t dare resemble its predecessors. We\u2019ve reached an age of maturity of sorts. We appreciate style, but all the more, we respect those designs that represent a blending of cultures. The Gridiron tubular stainless steel bench is famous not for its radical shape, but for the strategic transcendence that it provides. Gridiron is perfect for reception rooms, living and lounge areas, and any other place in need of transformation.",
