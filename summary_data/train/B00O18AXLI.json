It is huge and has no elastic band to help fit the head properly. Granted, I do have a small head (about 20 in circumference). This hat will only fit people who have larger sized heads - most likely adult males and even then, I'm not sure if it would stay in place. It will probably not fit a child.",

The one we received here was Very disappointing to have a received especially for what size/age it claims it fit. Size would fit more of a 6 year old is my guess without movement",
