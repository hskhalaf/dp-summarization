I have used them about 4 - 5 times so far and they fit well and provide nice traction. I live in Louisiana and they are not too hot. On the lighter side as far as weight goes. I plan on buying another pair and will use these as my shoes for the next year or so. I recommend them as a great hybrid - spikeless golf shoes.",
