The crevice tool is really the only attachment that actually picks up debris. The other brushes just seem to move the debris around without picking it up. The form factor of the vacuum is also a bit cumbersome. You can't really use the handle and vacuum at the same time. I really wish I would have returned it sooner, but I thought I would try it a few more times. But now the box has been discarded and I stuck with a vacuum that does not really suck.",

Bad things - suction is much, much weaker than I anticipated. Cord is too short. So, if you just want a vacuum to suck up dust bunnies in the laundry room or Cherrios from the kitchen floor - this is find. To clean those hard to reach carpeted areas or carpet along floorboards ... take a pass.",

This is the only way to clean carpeted stairs. You will love the fully motorized power brush. Nicely done Shark. My only MINOR criticism is that cord might be longer--but I put a heavy-duty extension cable on it to resolve this. Try it and you'll be surprised.

The one downside is that it's tricky to position a bag to collect the dirt as you pop open the bottom and everything falls out - plus, it's quite difficult to clean the dirty, dusty inside of the plastic collection cylinder. Need to work hard to get a wet cloth into the small spaces, so I suppose the idea is just to dump the dirt and leave the clear collection cylinder looking filthy?? Aside from this, does what I bought it for very well.",
