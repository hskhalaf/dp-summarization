I has two cupholders,a pocket w/zipper and plenty of room for whatever u got. I don't have kids like most reviewers. It's great for road trips. Throw some snacks, books, tablets, drinks whatever.

Anything you put in here is a projectile in a crash, so just be aware that this is a risk you're taking and 2. When you strap this in using the seat belt, unless it's a lapbelt only, it pulls it sideways and no longer sits straight, which drives me crazy. Made of pretty good quality materials, I was impressed by the durability right off the bat.",

Very spacious. When it's the weekend and I have someone who needs to sit in the seat, I simply use the handles and lift it out. Also, I can fit more stuff between the holder and the seat, such as a purse. Best purchase I've made for my car. I own a sub but I'm sure it would fit any car seat well.",

It holds a lot of items and the cupholders are very steady. The zippered mesh compartment was great for storing the ipad/DS charger cables. The set up takes only a minute and the seatbelt holds it securely to the seat. I had two happy kiddoes the entire trip!",

The smaller pockets help hold things like my phones (we're hands-free in this state, and my phones and charges also always seemed to be in the way of something--even if it's just the holder interfering with the vent or dash display--but not anymore!) or other smaller items.

These held up to messes, kicks, heavy hard cover books, water bottles, etc. And now that the trip is over, I can keep one open in the car and the other folded up under the middle seat.
