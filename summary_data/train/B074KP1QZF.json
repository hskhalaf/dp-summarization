It has a preset/fixed depth of focus, you have to get very close, within half & inch, to the object, otherwise its blurry. So, other than taking pic of surface texture or tiny things, its not very useful. I wanted to take shots of insects, but by the time you get that close, they\u2019d hop off. You literally have to hover over & cover the object with the white bowl.",

They do not clip on or attach any other way.",

      "text": "Incredible macro lens. Bought this for my new phone. Not cheap, but well machined with excellent glass. Liked it so much I've ordered the telephoto, wide and fish eye lenses. Some photos attached. Dead nandina twig, dogwood leaf, textures of my bracelets, tiny crinoid fossils, texture of a dilapidated vinyl top on a Cadillac. These were all taken my first time to use the lens.",

Moment products had some nice reviews and the lens/camera case setup looked to be the strongest and you didn't have to worry about the attached lens being exactly lined up with your Iphone lens. Pretty full proof setup. I purchased the Macro, Wide angle and Zoom and all three lens with my Iphone X take great pictures. The Macro does take a bit of \"fiddling\" with but I think it's me. My daughter has used it to take Macro photos of beaded jewelry she's made and the photos are impressive.",
