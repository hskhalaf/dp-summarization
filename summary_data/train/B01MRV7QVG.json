The \"leather\" seams were also not well sewn together, and normally, you expect better of UGG shoes, given the price. Over all, very disappointing. PLEASE be vigilant, as these can be very well faked. (see photos)",

My feet stay completely warm and dry in these boots, and the traction of the rubber is very helpful when navigating this crazy polar vortex I have moved into. If you need good snow boots, buying these is a very good decision. Would totally buy again if presented with this decision again.",

I'm that person who's feet are always frozen in the winter, but these boots keep my feet warm and dry. The only nitpicky complaint I have is that the laces tend to come undone, so I have to double knot them. Other than that, I highly recommend them.",

I do believe these are authentic Ugg though, because I tried the scan tag on the left boot and it brought me to the official Ugg website. Too bad Amazon is out of stock of anything aside from 5 and 5.5 (are they not being made anymore?).",

I ordered one size bigger than I normally wear & hoped they would be wide enough to fit my wide foot. They do & I love them! These boots fit great...look great....feel great! They are toasty warm in cold weather & are waterproof, although I haven't tested that out except to walk through heavy dew in the brush. They're a bit pricey, but I think the quality will hold up & I'll be enjoying them for many years. So happy with my first pair of UGGs.",
