It only seemed to work when they were sitting next to each other and within 10 feet of the WiFi. And now appears in less than 24 hours has burned out the batteries. Waste of money, needs A LOT of work in my opinion",

I think our WiFi in child\u2019s room might be too weak for the toy. Doesn\u2019t use 5G so it relies on older WiFi which in our house is much weaker. Didn\u2019t realize this mattered when purchasing. Daughter loved when it worked - ultimately we couldn\u2019t keep a toy this expensive for occasional working, regular connection problems and buying 4 batteries every 10 days. Hope maker can fix because we would buy again if issues were fixed!",
