Make sure when you use the suction tip your fsce has some water on it(very little) makes gliding over skin easier and not damaging. I use the highest power. I put Vitamin C serum on after.

I used it for 6 weeks and didn't see any better results from this than using a topical microderm cream which I did after showering. I will say that this did scrape off the dirt and excess skin better than the creams (as the more you scrape the more skin gets abrased). The suction quality was great for it being handheld, it is lightweight and very easy to use.",
