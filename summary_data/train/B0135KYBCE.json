The first time I used it was on the Oregon coast on a very cold, windy, wet day. I was thankful that my hands were able to stay dry as well. Since it was a bit big for my camera I had to be careful to adjust it so that the cover did not get in front of the lens. All in all a good product, and it sure beats the home made version I was using with a cut out hole in a zip lock bag!",
