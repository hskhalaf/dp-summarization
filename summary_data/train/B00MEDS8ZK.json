      "text": "Bought this for a 4 and 6 year-old and they LOVE it! The adjustable height is an excellent feature. The only thing I would caution is to warn your kids not to attempt to adjust height on their own - my 4 year-old attempted to lower it and the post slid down fast and pinched his fingers in the groove. I would recommend modifying the post to slide down more slowly for safety reasons. Otherwise, I'm impressed with it's quality and stability and am happy with the purchase! Since it's shared by 2 kids I purchased extra balls and went with Picador Cartoon Design Basketball Size 3 Combo Pack Lion + Elephant and would recommend them as well.",

Its not sturdy enough to keep it up, the rest is but the breakaway rim itself is or has a very bad/weak design as it does not \"lock/snap\" in place it's just too weak and the rim/basket is falling down by just minor touch, making it more or less useless as a basketball hoop. It needs to be more sturdy than that to be used as a basketball hoop. Flimsy, flimsy design at that part. Other Little Tikes products we have are all good and sturdy so didn't;t expect this to be soo bad.",

I'm going to have to figure out a way to keep the basket up permanently or otherwise fix the lip that is supposed to keep the basket up. As such, this functionality is a pretty poor design.",
