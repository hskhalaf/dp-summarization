The outer leather was stiff and hard not very soft and plush like my previous shoes. The shoes were not comfortable and I do not know who the supplier is for this outfit but I know that these are not hush puppies. In my opinion they are very poor-quality counterfeit shoes. The leather tells it all. I can put my fingers on my earlier Pairs and it is soft and subtle and comfortable and these replacement shoes are thin and hard and stiff. Someone needs to contact hushpuppy and I think that I will.",

I am a diabetic & I bought the shoe based on good ratings, but the shoe is inadequate for neuropathy nerve pain. The insole insert is thin & gives very little cushioning. To make the shoe wearable I threw the pathetic insole away & replaced it with an insole insert with adequate cushioning. And of course this raised the cost of the shoe. Another issue with the shoe is that the design of the single Velcro strap makes for a sloppy fit. Two straps per shoe makes for a snugger fit.",

They were almost returned because the quality is the same as less expensive brands but I decided I do not need any more hassles with shoes which will always be used indoors and never outside.

These Hush Puppies are no bother to slip on and off. They look good, are well made and fit nicely. Also, my feet have a tendency to swell at the end of the day. The easy, hook-and-loop adjustment is another positive. Again Amazon Prime delivery was terrific. Plus, Wifey says they look good; that alone added another star!",

I drive vans and cars for a living and the right heal wore on an angle. However, since that wear is not common to most people, I think the majority of purchasers will be quite satisfied with these shoes.",
