Motion detection is always always ALWAYS enabled when I arm it. I am a single woman live alone and think the system is worthless for security. I have had a stalker and someone entering my home and have zero confidence in this system. The only thing it IS good for is to take a live shot when you're away to check on your home and pets.",

Easy to set up and very good quality pics and video for what it is. Highly recommend.",

Originally, on the two cameras I ordered, the motion detector on one camera did not work. I contacted Blink and tried several things they suggested to get the motion detector to work but to no avail. Blink sent a replacement camera and a return packing slip and label. The replacement camera worked just fine including the motion detector. I am very happy with this purchase and might order an \"outside\" camera to go with my two indoor cameras. Very good cameras and very good customer service from Blink.",

The first time I called the company they sent replacement batteries. Also the cameras broke easily when they get knocked over and since the base is not sturdy at all it is a likely scenario.
