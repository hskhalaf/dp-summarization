He defends it from the other cat, who is not allowed to even look at it. The last one we had lasted about three months, our kitty is about 14 pounds, and used it multiple times a day. Super easy to assemble, I would argue quite sturdy, and great to throw some catnip on every once in a while for cat happy times. You can't beat something that does a two for one, both a bed and a scratcher.",
