One coat is not really ideal though so I usually spray one direction and spray crossway after a few, while saving my arm and time. I'm not sure what to do without this machine. I not only use this for the ceiling but for walls in general and it is great and fast, just be sure to wear a mask because it gets everywhere. It was a learning curve for me at first but that is usually the case with machines you haven't used before. The cleaning is not a fun process, but it gets easier to do after using it a couple of times.",

Purchasing this sprayer, paint (top of the line) and a new ladder (safety first) I saved a minimum of $2,000 over paying someone to do it. My suggestion is buy this sprayer, do some test spraying and you will love the outcome and THE SAVINGS!!!",

I called customer service and they didn't grasp what the problem was, telling me to soak it in warm soapy water. I made two trips to my local paint store and had the manager call also. I ended up getting a whole new gun and spray tip so I could finish the job I started. very disappointing.",

Eventually just ended up back rolling them. Still saved time though. People complain about cleaning, but I didn't find it overly burdensome. For long term storage there is a solution that you have to buy. The stuff from Graco is overpriced and I ended up buying a concentrate from Titan that was much more affordable.",
