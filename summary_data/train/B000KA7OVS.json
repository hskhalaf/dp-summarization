      "verdict": "Even if you don't care that ViewSonic's VG2030wm lacks HD DVD or Blu-ray support, we can't give this LCD monitor a strong recommendation simply because there are too many better, more capable displays on the market for the same price. Its image quality is fine, but that's not enough.",

The other complaint is that with the large speaker boxes at the bottom of the frame, the appearance of the monitor is more clunky than I would like for a flat LCD screen.",

I would have given it five stars, except that it was two weeks late in delivery, with no explanation from either the supplier or Amazon. When I queried Amazon after the expected delivery date was passed by several days, they said they would check on it. No more communication, and the monitor appeared a week or so after that. Disappointing. But I like the monitor.",
