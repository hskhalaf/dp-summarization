The spatula works well for flipping/cooling your rice (if you are making your own at home). The only reason I gave the kit 4 rather than 5 stars, is the fact that the chop sticks are held in pairs by stickers. The stickers are very hard to remove and leave a sticky residue that was very difficult to get off. I would suggest changing these to a paper wrapper with the sticky part only at the end where the paper overlaps. Other than that, I highly recommend this item.",

If you soak it in cold water like the directions say, you should find that it spreads much easier than using your hands. Use saran wrap if you want to try the rice on the outside, otherwise you'll have a big mess on your mat.",

Rolling sushi was so fun and easy that my whole family decided to try. Even my three-year-old son was able to easily and successfully create a beautiful Maki. The kids have been begging to do it again soon, and I know we will. Great value!",

If you are doing the americanized version then you can use food wrap as a barrier, cleaning up stickey rice is not worth skipping the wrap.",
