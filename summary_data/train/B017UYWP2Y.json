Beers fit nicely (snug) and the thick material seems great for keeping glass safe - even with less than 6 bottles/cans. It's also collapses nicely for storage. I plan to give this carrier as a Christmas gift to my craft beer loving father-in-law (with beer in it). I imagine he will get a lot of use out of it on his boat next summer. I also recommended this product to a new-mom friend who works full time and pumps at work.",

I do like that the slots are snug, would definitely keep drinks cold. Would purchase again if I ever need one for beer bottles.",
