I was concerned they would be too small especially on my right foot which is just a tad bit larger than my left. But they ended up forming to my feet giving me great support and zero issues after the first 10 hour day. Great comfort and solid construction. I will definitely recommend to Women who have wide feet enjoy comfortable shoes that can be walked in all day and look good on your feet.",

They seem pretty waterproof but I would spray them yourself if you plan to do a lot of wet hiking.",
