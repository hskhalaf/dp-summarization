I don't know if 45 lb or bigger would fit in combination others or might be too big. The whole thing took about 10 minutes to assemble using the included Allen wrench plus one of my own wrenches, and it seems sturdy and stable. Overall I'm pleased with this product.",

The bolts barely fit into the threaded pegs on 3/5 of the arms, and one wouldn't fit at all (threads on the peg are defective).
