It doesn't make noise constantly in the slightest breeze like them, either, but only when a breeze you can feel goes by. It does indeed play the opening notes from Amazing Grace, usually in random order, but every now and then it plays them in correct order, which is pretty neat. I think of windchimes as frivolous things and this was definitely an impulse buy, but it is one that I am very happy with. I really like it.",

Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! Didn't want to drive my neighbors nuts with them going off all day and night.",

I play music and have for 40 years but I cannot \"pick up\" Amazing Grace in this set, sound like random tuning forks to me. Considering the price, I would probably look elsewhere for another wind chime set",

Tuned to beautiful melodies and scales from around the world and available in a wide range of styles, songs and sizes, you can choose the Woodstock Chime that speaks to your soul. HOW IT ALL BEGAN. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Percussion, in 1979 and it remains a family-owned business in New York's Hudson Valley. Grammy award-winning musician Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. As a professional musician and instrument designer, he was fascinated by the Scales of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can't be played on a modern piano. Garry had the idea to cut and tune the lawn chair chime tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our bestselling wind chimes.",
