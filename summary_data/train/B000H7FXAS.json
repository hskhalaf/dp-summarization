      "text": "Ok, this was an inexpensive digital camera, purchased new in 2006. It has taken some absolutely fantastic photographs, far beyond what can be expected in this price range. Finally just replaced it six years later with an Olympus VR-330, for no good reason other than the new model was on sale. Rugged, easy to use and best lens quality for the money, bar none, this is typical for all Olympus gear. If you understand that optics are more important than mega-pixels, you are probably already familiar with Olympus. This camera does not disappoint!",

The coolest thing about this camera, to me anyway, it uses two AA batteries. If your batteries die on you, go buy two more AA's. You don't have to worry about charging it, or buying a second battery. If your on vacation, you don't have to pack a charger, AA's are very easy to come by. I love this camera, and the software bundle is top notch. Edit: 1-23-2007, this camera takes unbelievable pictures, outside, inside, where ever. I have printed out a ton of pictures, they are absolutely breathtaking. I still recommend this camera.",

But, even though this camera took beautiful shots, the battery life was terrible. I had to use the LED display for the view finder since there was none included in this camera. I had to change and recharge the batteries 4 times to take images of one birthday party. I returned it after talking to a helpful technical assistant for Olympus. He said to get a lithium battery that it would last longer. But he didn't know if Olympus had battery rechargers for this camera. He used a Kodak for his photography.",

Nevertheless, she took to this camera - as they say - \"...like a duck to water.\" The controls and settings are intuitive and easy to use and the built-in help, or how-to, menu covers anything she could want to do with the camera. I, on the other hand, being a little more experienced in digital photography, nevertheless found the Olympus FE-170 adequate to my requirements as well. All in all, a good little camera for the beginner that will still be responsive as experience grows.",

It was a good purchase - her camera is better than mine now (which was an earlier Olympus Digital camera).",
