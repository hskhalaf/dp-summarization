      "text": "In approximately 50 swings and less then 10 minutes of work the handle broke off the head. The problem is the eye is disproportionate to the size and weight of the head, in that the eye is far to small. The handle is even tapered significantly just to fit into the eye. Truper needs to do some more engineering on this product line before anymore purchases should be made.",
