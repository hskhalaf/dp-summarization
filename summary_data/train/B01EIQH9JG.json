I did use it on first night camping and it kept my lower body perfectly toasty in 34 degree weather. Keeping 1 of 2 bags purchased since it will be my goal bag to fit into by next fall. Super comfy and plenty of length on the normal size. If the hubby can lose some weight too I will def. reorder.",

The two best features are the rope at the opening where your face goes and the velcro tab at the end of the zipper. The rope keeps the cool air from seeping into the bag and the velcro tab keeps the zipper from unzipping once you are snuggled up. This sleeping bag was designed a true camper! Must buy!",

I toss and turn a lot so that was a negative. I unzipped the entire thing and used it as a blanket instead. While it did keep me warm, I had to keep waking up to fix when it slid off my body. This is a great sleeping bag if you're thin. I'm a size XL in women's clothing and this was a tight fit.",

Updated to one star as the item is too difficult to roll back into the bag. It takes me 15+ minutes of frustration as I try to stretch a non stretch bag around a poofy slippery rolled up sleeping bag. Terrible.",

But for car camping in pleasant weather, I guess its good. Doesn't pack real small so its bulky for backpacking",

Basically, it's going to fall apart after a number of uses. But for the whole set at approximately 30 USD, it's definitely a good budget product. Only if you don't mind the troubles of the flimsy adjustable straps.",
