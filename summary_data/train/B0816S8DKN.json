Sadly it; has been discontinued and replaced with other line. Keep in mind they are half a size smaller. Other people mention it too. I should also mentioned this pair of shoes is suitable for someone who has wider feet. Shoes it's self are quiet springy and soft yet feels solid, wraps around feet like your own skin. It has enough sole thickness across all sole to support someone forefoot striking. I am forefoot striker too. I normally do 3 runs a week around 5k each run. So far I am happy with product.",

      "text": "Was unsure of fitment so used Amazon Wardrobe to order an 8 and 8.5 UK size shoe, I am normally an 8 in a regular work shoe but can be 8.5 in a trainer. As it happened the 8.5 was a perfect fit and oh so comfortable and cushioned. I have never worn a pair of trainers like them and am really looking forward now to returning to fast walking / running since a long time off. First class service from Amazon even in the Pandemic! Delivery fast and drop off at the local Post Office for returning not needed items went without a hitch. Thank you, brilliant!",

Have discovered that you can push the shoes quite hard and they respond well. Proved to be quite grippy when I went a bit off-piste and ran/walked up to the top of Arthur\u2019s seat in Edinburgh on a wet and misty morning. Very happy with the purchase, and they are easy to clean - no obvious signs of wear yet.",
