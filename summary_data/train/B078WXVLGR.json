Joking aside don\u2019t hesitate to buy. Also like the longer cable. You can clean the whole flat without having to plug him into different rooms as the cable reaches a long way",

All I can say is this now my main vacuum and if I want a quick go over it will be the others I use, glad I purchased this product!!!!! It\u2019s fantastic even when using the other accessories the same suction is there unlike the other 2 I mentioned. Don\u2019t hesitate!!!",

Also, if any of it breaks you can simply get a replacement part then watch a YouTube vid on how to fix it, saves you getting a whole new one!",

      "text": "Such joy to be reunited with Henry , although this one is a turbo Henry and my last one ( many years ago) was a regular Henry. ..it still packs a punch and simply hoovers to perfection. Brilliant! I never thought I would get so excited by hoovering with Henry but after other vacuum cleaners I have used, this proves to be the quietest, most powerful and lightweight machine and moves around with ease.",
