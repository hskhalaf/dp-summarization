It helps to identify the pieces for each step by their labels before starting the actual assembly. I did it all by myself. But getting another person holding pieces in position do help at some point. It looks nice as pictured. It is nice seating on it too. If you want to sleep on it, you may want to get a thicker cushion.",

These are not complaints per-se because for the price it\u2019s really not bad. Just trying to make sure your expectations are not too high. If I were to put this in a rental property I would not expect the canopy or the cushions to last more than a season.",
