When there's not much room in my freezer (most of the time), I set these popsicle molds into spaces here and there. I do not have to rearrange my whole freezer to accommodate 6 popsicle molds that must be kept together. I'm very glad I chose these molds. They are sturdy and will probably last a very long time, even though we use them a lot.",

Easy to pour, easy to store in the freezer, easy to pop out of the mold before eating, easy to clean (I mostly use the dishwasher). The handle parts have a little space on the bottom to catch anything that melts, so that's useful. Overall, a simple tool but well thought out.",

It is so handy to just reinsert the popsicle back into the mold while eating until you are ready for the next bite. I often eat them while working on my computer, so holding it in my hand the whole time I'm eating it is not efficient. Also makes it easy to put back into freezer if the whole popsicle is not eaten - which happens with my grandchildren. It seems like they don't get melty/drippy as quickly as flavored sugar water ones or ice cream bars.",

That's something you can get used to. I like the drip tray so you don't get sticky hands. I made cucumber lemon Popsicle without sugar and they were very refreshing after working in the garden. I just received it this week and that's all I've made so far.",
