My husband and I got a good laugh while hanging it up. The map itself is gorgeous. Ours arrived with zero damage, creases or dents. It was nicely packaged. I'd buy it again. (If I needed another GIANT map lol) Update: 1/2/2016 ... We've had the map a few months and we couldn't be happier with our purchase. We've learned so much! It REALLY helps to have a map of this size and quality while doing history and geography lessons!!!",

The size makes it fun and easy to locate places on the map. It blends well with decor because of the muted colors. It is laminated and comes well-packaged, but as expected, it does not come with any mounting materials. We used java gel stain stain on 2 1x1 boards, stapled to the backs of the tops and bottom, with 4 saw-tooth hangers across the top for a vintage/classroom feel. As a homeschool family, I am considering purchasing a second one for our home classroom/study area.",

Overall it is a nice map. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars are the clarity of some of the locations and missing locations",
