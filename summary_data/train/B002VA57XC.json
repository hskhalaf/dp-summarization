I have a contourHD as well and the color's on this are a bit more vivid. The mounting brackets can be a little bulky with all of the locking thumb screws but that's the only real downside I see. I'm not a professional videographer by any means, but the camera was a good buy when it was on sale. My first few videos don't look quite as good as most of the promo vids, but that could be from any number of reasons.",

Aside from the superb (daytime) video and photo quality, the wide variety of mounts and accessories for this thing is what makes it such a good purchase for someone seeking an HD actioncam. It is also very easy to use (2-button operation) and is encased in an extremely tough housing. One thing to note is that video/photo quality is not great in bad lighting, at night or indoors...but that's sort of a given as with any camera.",

However the GoPro is waterproof which was a definite positive for me as we plan on using it for snorkel, scuba, and wakeboarding.",

Other than that, this is a great little camera and i highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to video their racing/sports activities.",

For example there is a mounting clip that comes with it and I have no idea what it is for or how to use it (the white little clippy thing which I think is called \"easy release clip)). There is no description with the product or online what it is for.",

It's the only one that's waterproof to 180' so if you ever plan on taking it in the water it's the only one to consider. The field ov vision is superb at 170 degrees wide-angle for 720p, and 60fps gives you great flexibility for slow-motino applications. The camera really is worthy of 5 stars but I gave it 4 stars because GoPro has yet to introduce the LCD backpack. Lack of LCD screen on this camera is kind of a bummer.",

    "title": "GoPro HD Motorsports Hero",
    "description": "Style:Motorsports HEROFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nDeveloped for the consumer and proven by professionals, GoPro's all-new HD HERO cameras are the world's most advanced line of on-board, full HD 1080p cameras designed to be used during sports. With amazing clarity, stability, and slow-motion capabilities, these cameras record your sport's most exciting moments in professional quality HD video and automatically-captured 5 megapixel still photos. HD HERO products can shoot video or photos from your point-of-view, mounted on your helmet, body, car, motorcycle, surfboard, or other equipment. And GoPro's 170\u00b0 wide-angle lens (the industry's widest) even lets you take shots of yourself during your activity. All captured hands-free, while you stay focused on your activity.\n\nThe HD Motorsports HERO is the HD HERO model developed for motorcyclists, autosports enthusiasts, and other powersports athletes. This product incorporates not only the HD HERO camera itself, but also the mounting hardware you need to mount the camera securely to virtually any helmet, motorcycle, car, ATV, jet ski, snowmobile, boat, or virtually any other vehicle. Included are mounts for two helmets and three vehicles, as well as a suction cup for maximum versatility and convenience. The camera's quick-release mounting design makes it easy to re-position the camera around your vehicle for professional quality HD video from several angles. \n\nOriginally designed for the consumer market, GoPro's wearable cameras have garnered praise from professional athletes as well as film and TV producers who demand convenience and performance from their filming equipment. The HD HERO line produces higher quality HD video than action sports cameras costing ten times as much, and as a result many video segments you see in action sports film and TV today are shot on GoPro cameras. As the #1 maker of wearable sports cameras in the world, GoPro has years of experience in developing cameras and mounting accessories for the most hardcore of sports. As a result, GoPro has won many coveted awards, including Motorcyclist magazine's prestigious \"2009 Product of the Year\" award and the \"Editors' Choice Award\" from both Popular Mechanics and Backpacker Magazine.\n\nIn the end, GoPro's HD Motorsports HERO adds so much to your enjoyment of your favorite activities that arriving home to watch your footage is almost as much fun as the activity itself. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nProfessional 1080p HD Video that Looks Great Even on a 52\" TV\nTruly professional quality video that delivers the clarity and excitement you see on TV or in films. HD quality so good, GoPro's cameras are used regularly by both professional athletes and film and TV production companies around the world. See the quality for yourself in these sample videos: click here. \n\nEasy to Use\nTurn the camera on and press the shutter button. Shooting your own HD action sports video is that simple thanks to the HD Motorsports HERO's user-friendly default settings. Upgraded controls such as brighter LED icons and louder status beeps make the camera easier-to-use than ever.\n\nWidest Range of Video & Photo Capabilities\nFor the more technically-inclined user looking for the latest in technology and options, the HD Motorsports HERO offers a remarkable range of video and photo modes, giving you more creative control: \n\n\n * 1080p \u2013 \"True HD\" video at 30 frames per second produces maximum clarity and realism. To put it in perspective, 1080p video at 30 frames per second is the equivalent of shooting thirty 2-megapixel photos per second. Incredible realism you're used to seeing only in the movies. The viewing area becomes a slightly less-wide (127\u00ba) at this resolution, wide angle view, making 1080p a slightly less wide-angle view than the other resolutions. Perfect for in-car filming, for example, where you might want to focus more on objects in the distance than up close. It's like having two lenses in one camera.\n * 960p \u2013 \"Maximum Wide Angle\" video at 30 frames per second. Certain sports like motocross, mountain biking, and skiing require maximum viewing area to capture your speed and technique. This 960p mode offers 25% more vertical viewing area at the top and bottom of the screen than other resolutions, so you can see more of your bike and handlebars beneath you, your knees and skis while you hammer the moguls, or a more of the trail and horizon ahead. Document more of you and your surroundings with 960p for the most immersive video possible. \n * 720p \u2013 \"Slow-motion Cinema\" is possible thanks to the HD Motorsports HERO's incredibly smooth 60 frames per second 720p video. 720p (1280 x 720p) can record in either standard 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second. While 30 frames per second pleases the eye, 60 frames per second straight blows the mind when played back in liquid smooth slow motion. Everything looks good in slow motion...including you.\n\nRich, Realistic Color with Fast Automatic Exposure Adjustment \nThe HD Motorsports HERO combines the industry's leading DSP technology (digital signal processor) with cutting edge sensor technology to bring you the richest, most natural color available in a wearable sports camera. This powerful combination also results in the fastest automatic exposure adjustment of any wearable camera. This means you can move back and forth quickly between bright and dark settings (like sunshine and shadows on a trail) and still achieve smooth exposure adjustments that give your videos a professional look.\n\nProfessional Sound that Automatically Adjusts to your Environment\nThe best sound quality of any wearable camera, period. Professional quality sound with AGC (automatic gain control) tuned for action sports and motorsports. With the ability to reduce the sound of wind noise at high speeds, the HD HERO line of cameras are simply the best sounding wearable sports cameras available. Fully automatic with no manual settings or adjustments needed, the camera will adjust the sound level automatically to maintain and optimum sound recording.\n\nAlso includes an optional non-waterproof back door that can be used in activities where waterproofness is not needed. This feature allows more sound into the protective housing, resulting in fuller, more immersive soundtracks. That said, the AGC (automatic gain control) does an excellent job of automatically increasing the microphone's sensitivity to provide impressive sound even when the camera is sealed in the waterproof housing with the waterproof back door.\n\nTrademark Video Stability, only from GoPro\nGoPro is famous for producing cameras that record extremely stable video. Video that is smooth even at highest speeds and during the most intense sports. The HD Motorsports HERO takes GoPro's obsession with stable video to the next level, keeping the action amazingly stable with no wobble or \"jello-cam\" shakiness that plagues other wearable HD cameras. See for yourself in these sample videos: click here. \n\nShoot 5 megapixel Photos Automatically, a Feature Available only from GoPro\nGoPro's HD HERO products are the only wearable sports cameras to offer automatic photo-taking modes, making hands-free photo capture a reality. You'll be amazed at the in-action photos you'll capture thanks to an ability to shoots a photo every 2, 5, 10, 30 or 60 seconds, automatically. Other photo modes include traditional single shot, triple shot and self-timer modes, making the HD Motorsports HERO the only camera you need to document not only the most active moments of your life, but also the more relaxed moments where a traditional photo is what you want. You'll also appreciate the edge to edge sharpness of the 170\u00ba wide angle lens as well as the HD Motorsports HERO's terrific low light performance (1.4 lux). \n\nRechargeable Lithium-Ion battery lasts 2.5 Hours, Heater Included\nThe included 1100mAh Lithium-Ion battery lasts 2.5 hours and is rechargeable through any USB port. You can charge it with your computer or with any USB compatible wall or car charger. You can even use the camera while the battery is charging, convenient for filming road trips where you might leave the camera running for long periods of time. A second battery can be added to the back of the camera, doubling the battery life to 5 hours (see Battery Bakpac under Optional Accessories, below). AC/DC wall outlet and car cigarette lighter-based chargers are also available from GoPro.\nFor colder temperatures, an integrated battery heater helps keep the battery warm during winter sports, extending recording times beyond what's possible with other camera systems. \n\nLargest Storage Capacity of Any Wearable Camera: 32GB Capacity for 9+ Hours\nUsing up to a 32 GB SD card (not included) allows for 9+ hours of HD video or thousands of still photos when using the automatic photo mode. Also works with smaller 2, 4, 8, and 16GB SD cards. Write speed does not affect the performance of the camera, though GoPro does recommend using only well known, name-brand SD cards for maximum reliability.\n\nIndustry's Widest Angle Lens (170\u00ba) Now Shoots 127\u00ba Wide Angle, Too\nA sharp wide angle lens is critical to capturing the raw excitement of action sports \u2013 not only to capture the scenery flying by, but also to get your ski tips, handlebars, and the horizon in the frame to give you a sense of speed and adrenaline. GoPro's cameras are famous for their wide angle lenses, the widest, sharpest, and highest performance lenses available in any wearable sports camera. Plus, when mounted on equipment, the 170\u00ba lens is wide enough to capture yourself in the scene, to really record your exploits. But this is no \"fisheye\"\u2026you'll see remarkably little distortion, despite the wide angle.\n\nUnique to the HD HERO line of cameras is the ability to shoot in both 170\u00ba and 127\u00ba wide angle modes. The 960p and 720p video modes utilize the full170\u00ba wide angle, while a lesser wide angle view of 127\u00ba is possible in the 1080p video resolution. This gives you more creative control and the opportunity to capture the action with different \"lenses\"...making for a more professional looking video. In reality, the lens is the same but the processing power of the HD HERO camera makes this convenient feature a reality.\n\nProfessional image quality, edge to edge sharpness, and the industry's best distance focus makes for exceptionally clear HD videos and photos.\n\nShockproof / Waterproof (180' / 60m) Housing Protects Camera from the Environment\nPolycarbonate shockproof, waterproof housing protects the camera from rocks, rain, snow, and on dives down as deep as 180' (60m). Proven in the giant surf around the world from Hawaii to Tahiti, Mexico to Northern California, you can be sure the housing will protect your HD HERO camera in even the most powerful surf.\n\nOptional Accessories Available in Early 2010, Compatible with all HD HERO Cameras\nA HERO BUS expansion port on the back of the camera allows you to click in expansion \"Bakpac\" modules allowing for add-on features, including:\n * LCD Bakpac, a click-on LCD screen attaches to the back of the camera, allowing for instant preview / review of your footage as you capture it.\n * Battery Bakpac, a click-in secondary battery allows for 2.5 hours more recording time, for a total of 5 hours recording time between charging batteries. Can also be used as a wall charger for additional HD HERO Lithium-Ion batteries.\n\nMajor Upgrades from Earlier Models\nThe HD HERO line's many upgrades from the earlier standard-definition WIDE HERO include:\n * Three HD video resolution modes: 1080p, 960p, and 720p.\n * WVGA wide screen standard definition video at 60 frames per second \n * Shoots up to 60 frames/second for slow motion playback in WVGA and 720p resolutions\n * Rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery with 2.5 hours of record time\n * Camera can be powered by car or wall charger, battery will charge while recording \n * Support for up to 32GB SD cards, 9+ hours of HD video recording\n * Professional sound system with for great sound in high wind environments.\n * Improved low light performance for both video and photo modes\n * Dual wide angle views now available: 127\u00ba in 1080p, 170\u00ba in 960p and 720p.\n * Brighter status LED and louder status beep for easier controlling of camera\n * HERO BUS expansion port for adding LCD screen, extra battery, etc. \n * Waterproof depth rating is increased from 100' / 30m to 180' / 60m\n\n\nHD Motorsports HERO Includes Mounting Hardware for Motorcycles, Cars, Etc.\nThe HD Motorsports HERO's camera mounting hardware has been proven at the highest levels of sport. It's been worn by more world record setting athletes than any other wearable camera, including by two time \"Highest Jump on a Motorcycle\" world record holder Ronnie Renner, and the \"Highest Jump on a BMX Bicycle\" world record holder. GoPro's camera mounts have been proven in the heaviest waves in Hawaii, Tahiti, Mexico, and Northern California...used by professional surfers looking to document their most heroic moments in giant surf. Industrial-grade 3M brand adhesive tape used on the flat and curved mounts can be removed if desired. This all means you can mount your HD Motorsports HERO camera with confidence. The HD Motorsports HERO comes with:\n * 5 Megapixel HD Motorsports HERO Camera \n * 1 Rechargeable 1100 mAh Lithium-Ion Battery \n * 1 Waterproof Quick-Release Housing (180'/60 m) \n * 3 Flat, 3M Adhesive Mounts for attaching camera to flat surfaces\n * 2 Curved, 3M Adhesive Mounts for attaching camera to helmets and curved surfaces\n * 2 Quick-Release Buckles \n * 1 Vertical Surface \"J-Hook\" Buckle \n * 1 Suction Cup Mount, ideal for attaching camera to windows or other smooth surfaces\n * 1 Three-Way Pivoting Side Arm Assembly lets you mount camera on side of helmet\n * 1 USB Cable \n * 1 Component Video (HDTV) Cable \n * 1 Composite Video + Audio Out Cable \n\nReplacement lens kits are also available for $20, so there's little worry of scratching the tempered glass lens while going for glory. Trash the housing in a massive crash? Replacements are available for $40. It's a GoPro...go for it.\n\nWarranty: One Year",
