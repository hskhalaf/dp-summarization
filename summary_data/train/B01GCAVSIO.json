CONS: Size. Takes up 2.5 slots and covers a PCIe 1x on my board. Solved with this Slot Riser  Take note - 12.8 inches long! That's almost 13 inches. Recommend you open your box and measure the clearance. Clearance in my mid-tower was a few millimeters short due to rivets, so this was a great excuse for a desired case upgrade. Weight is significant--I rigged support for the unmounted end.",

This made for a way awesomer look anway, just a heads-up for anyone using that case with a vertical radiator, you don't have room for this card and it and the fans. Not a bad thing.
