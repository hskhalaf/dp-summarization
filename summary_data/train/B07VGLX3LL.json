The hiker\u2019s true-to-size fit and remarkably sticky outsole also make owning one a great pleasure. With all that said, the shoe might not appeal to users with bulky feet or buyers on a tight budget. In spite of some flaws, the Breeze LT Low GTX is promising, thanks to its combination of traits that matter on the trail.",

As long as the waterproof holds up like my hikers did I\u2019ll be so happy . They do run a bit small so I\u2019d go a half size up , I had to return and reorder . Hope this helps.",

Soles are flexible / thin enough to where you will feel loose gravel in the trail. The trade off - these are really light weight and super comfortable. My experience with Vasque is that they are very durable - that is why I went with 5 stars. If these blow apart after a month, will update this rating.",

The Vibram is strong and sticky and found it gripping flat kitchen tile and sticking somewhat, but that's a good sign when no amount of dirt or dust will keep it from clinging to a surface.
