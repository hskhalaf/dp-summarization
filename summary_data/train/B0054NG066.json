      "text": "I love the Spectracide products and have used them for years since they work well. But this order I placed was for a 6 pack of smaller cans. For an average size room of a house these are just perfect. Getting a reduced amount of spray to unleash in various rooms is great. If you have really large rooms you might want to use two of these, one at each end of the room.",
