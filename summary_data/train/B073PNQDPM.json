Provides enough time to take my hand away, and it has a nice wide opening. It also came packed very securely. I use the generic 13 gallon trash can liners and it's just fine. I also placed some laundry boost scent beads at the bottom of the can and its been smelling great for weeks. Hope this info helps.",

We had it where our old foot operated can sat and found out just walking by this can too closely will open it. We had to relocate it to stop the walk by openings. If I had kept the box I would definitely consider returning it. We are now just considering turning the sensor off and using it manually.

      "text": "To be honest I'm not super happy with this product the motion sensitivity is way to low and inconsistent. I have to hold my hand over the sensor sometimes for a couple seconds just to get the lid to open. We usually end up pushing the open button to make it work which defeats the point of having a motion sensor can. I would definitely look elsewhere next time.",
