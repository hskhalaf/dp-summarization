I never used either pan above 350 degrees, which is below the max temp shown in the instructions for use. There is something going wrong with the finish on these pans! I am very gentle with all my cooking pans, only hand wash them, never use scratchy pads or the dishwasher, and always use at or below recommended temps. Chicago Metallic needs to get a handle on what's going wrong in the manufacturing process before they sell more of these.",

      "text": "I like these no stick pans. They are heavy-weight and don't warp like some of the lighter pans I've had before. The cooling rack is sturdy too. I should add that the only thing that killed my older pans was my tendency to use sharp objects like pizza slicers and knives. Eventually I cut through the no stick, but even with many scratches they still performed very well until I finally got tired of the slowly increasing stick factor. I've ran them through the dish washer numerous times on high heat dry cycle (regular detergent) too.",

      "text": "Had this baking sheet set since Nov '18. Used the pan maybe five times. Only hand washed. Non-stick coating flaking off in chunks in multiple locations. Chicago Metallic provides lifetime warranty - EXCEPT - you have to pay to ship the pan (and purchase a specialty size box) to them for exchange... that's nearly $20! WHAT A RIP-OFF! Thanks Amazon!",
