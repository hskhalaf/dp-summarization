The burn time in the description says they burn for approximately 8 hours...ummm, these burn for barely 3 hours, and in my opinion is not APPROXIMATELY 8 hours. Also, if you are looking for a dripless candle this is absolutely not a good choice either. I buy quality candles all the time and wanted to give these a try since they are supposed to burn cleaner. $24 is way too much money considering the short burn time.",

Sometimes you can detect a vague, very light beeswax scent if you sniff a new candle itself. I am happy with the candles; however, the unusual instructions on the bookmark contain information of a spiritual nature that is not biblical. It is not necessary to include such instructions on how to light and extinguish candles. Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars.",
