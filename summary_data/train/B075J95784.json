Just breath in deeply and breathe out strongly into the tube. It only took about 10 minutes to fill. And the thing is amazing... Just find the nearest hill, hang on to the handles, and let it go... I got the big one and my 8 year old son fit in perfectly, was able to hang on to the handle bars, and went further than I ever did in my life! This was the best time I have had in a long time!",

I love that it included a nice carry bag, so it can be deflated, and packed away easily in the off season, or between uses. It also included a pair of patches, because things happen when you are sledding. It's a great size, and looks awesome. I know he will love it!",

Very early and quickly deflates also. Because it\u2019s so durable it\u2019s a little slower than the others but with small kids that can actually a positive.

That one still performs well but it's best suited for those really slick, ice-covered hills you find at the snow tubing venues. The A-DUDU tube works better on the hills you'll find in your backyard.",

It was a great introduction to sledding for him and quite frankly, on a steep enough incline this thing go's plenty fast! BTW, it's super durable as well. This year we we found hills around the neighborhood but next year I think we'll take the tube up to the mountain :)",
