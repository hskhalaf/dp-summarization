      "text": "The i7+ would move about but would get \"clear main brushes\"/\"error 2\" errors and stop about every 5 minutes. Basicly, our shag carpet with sparse multi-thickness strands some as long as 1.5\" would fool the i7+ brush resistance sensor into thinking there was too much hair or something wrapped on the brushes. It would do this especially when spin turning. This is according to iRobot support after I sent them up close pictures of the carpet with a coin for scale. So I recommend confirming compatibility with IRobot if you have more challenging carpets even for the top of line most powerful Roombas.",

I love that it empties itself, will recharge and go back and finish. It knows where it has been so picks up where it left off. For all busy working folks - this investment will give you your weekends back! Highly recommend it!",

The suction dock is also a major step up in automation over prior models, as the bin will fill frequently even on small jobs. Suction isn't great, but the robot excels at day to day maintenance cleaning and is probably sufficient on hard surfaces. I wouldn't expect it to deep clean carpet or remove fine hair. Otherwise, this is a great tool to keep the home clean all week, particularly if you have little ones or furry ones tracking debris around often!",

      "text": "To get the Roomba i7+ to connect to WiFi, I spent three hours trying all the troubleshooting tricks noted by users at various sites. I then spent an hour on the phone with their customer service representative the next morning. She was friendly and had several recommendations, all of which I had tried the previous night. I nevertheless tried them again with her, and they failed. I should note that my WiFi setup is not at all unusual. How can a company sell an $800 robot vacuum cleaner without testing it against standard WiFi systems?",

This device is amazing. The extra bin lets it go solo without needing my attention, it glides over my rug fringe without doing damage and yet somehow it is doing a better job cleaning. I think the twirly brush really helps because its able to get in corners and under counters where my old vacuum couldn't . I spent weeks looking at consumer reports and amazon reviews before getting this and so far it was worth every dollar.",

I've had the unit two months now, ran it 100 times, and still haven't had to change the bag in the base.
