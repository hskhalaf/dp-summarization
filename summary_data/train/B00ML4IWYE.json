However, you need LOTS of space to fully enjoy them & then you need LOTS of storage, especially if you don't want to completely deflate them between use. And that storage needs to protected from things that could puncture & damage them. They appear to be made of strong quality materials. I do have a concern that when the kids flip over in them, they were often landing on their heads/necks. Helmets weren't suggested, but I think they should be used.",

Just so happy they are outside playing with each other instead of inside watching tv. They have held up really well so far and we have had many teenage boys playing pretty hard with them. Would definitely buy again!",

I was a little worried about them holding up to the abuse of some pretty wild 11-13yr olds, but they took it well and showed no signs of failing after the fun-filled 2 hours of use by a dozen somewhat unsupervised kids. Well worth the investment!",

I've learned that it's important to have a snug fit (or else you go flying around on the inside when you get hit). This is large enough for my XL hustband but still fun for my young kids. Perfect for the whole family! AND they're still inflated whereas other brands I was constantly needing to refill. A larger investment for sure but I'll be able to use these for several years (I've already tossed one set of a less expensive brand).",
