I'd recommend to anyone that needs CVT fluid within these specifications. *UPDATE 9-30-14* I am very happy with this purchase. I thought it was just a placebo effect when I changed out the fluid and tranny filter on my '07 Freestyle, but the fact is that the shifting/RPM's under load (like down an on-ramp) is far smoother than it used to be. I attribute this to both the fluid and the filter change at 150,000 miles in my Freestyle.",

      "text": "Just want to give a thumbs up after 700 miles on this new fluid. My 2007 Nissan Maxima manufacture warranty expired (passed10 years 96K miles). I decided to replace the very dirty dark original fluid with new fluid. Chose this more affordable Valvoline CVT fluid instead of the Nissan NS-2. I purchased 12 quarters. Flushed (cycled) out 11.5 quarters of the fluid (save half quarter for refill just in case) by following procedures learned from Youtube. It has been running very smoothly on the new fluid. I will probably flush it more frequently when it gets dark (dirty) every 30K or 40K miles in hope to extend my car's life to infinite. Let's see how long it lasts.",

I ordered 12 quarts did a complete drain and fill followed by flushing the rest of the old fluid out through the transmission cooling hose. Plenty of Youtube videos out there on the process. I still have almost 4 quarts left so I will definitely order more for my next transmission service.",

I have been driving with this new fluid changes more than 1,000 mileage and can feel difference and more smooth in my transmission. My Ford has about 165k original miles transmission.
