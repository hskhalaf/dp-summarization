The leather palms were flexible but with enough traction that it was easy to grip slippery items. He loves these gloves, and I just ordered him a second pair.",

Probably not your work glove but a good durable, very warm daily use glove. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend these. I will try them winter biking which is what they are sold as and I imagine they will be great for that. Just not in Alaska. That I know. I like 'em!",

Not sure if I would wear these to construct a house or something, but they make a great glove for daily use. One other comment, I also clean the snow off of my car with these, and I think another cool property of the deer skin is that they have a bit of natural water resistance. Snow and water just brushes off.",

They are perfect for walking the dog, or running errands in the winter. I ordered the XXL as I have large hands (9 1/2 inches around the palm, 7 3/4 inches from tip of middle finger to heel of palm) and they fit perfectly.",

These gloves, while NOT moisture resistive, keep even my finger-tips fairly warm, warm enough. I have to say that, overall, these have been the best solution so far. Soft, warm, and flexible, for dry weather conditions. Would recommend.",

I'm disappointed, as I've been trying to find warm gloves in size small that enable the user to drive. These SKYDEER gloves are of the proper material for grasping and holding on to the steering wheel. They also feel wonderful. They just run too large, presumably because they are unisex gloves.",

I bought these based on the positive reviews and the low price but I wanted a warm glove for low winter temps. Thinking of returning them...",
