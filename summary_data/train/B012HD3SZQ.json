The cotton comes out the top and you have to work to learn how to spin it onto the cone correctly. It doesn't work nearly as well if it isn't cleaned every time. Also, the fuse holder on mine burned up after 2 uses. I replaced it myself rather than sending this monstrous package back.",

I use it as a rental item and lots of cotton candy was made in it over the weekend and now I'm afraid it will not work properly next time due to not being able to get the burnt stuff out of the head. :(",
