I usuaally don't make a big deal about the motion controls, but that made using the bow/slingshot much easier. Love that the boots are now items like in Windwaker so putting them on/taking them off is far easier. Mildly annoying that you have to play through the game first to unlock Master Quest, but that just gave me a chance to adjust to the controls and changes.",

My only complaint is that the 3D effects don't always work as intended and can cause ghosting/ double images.",

    "description": "Nintendo Selects highlights a variety of great games at a great price, including this one. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D brings a completely re-mastered version of an epic entry in the beloved The Legend of Zelda game series to Nintendo's newest hand-held system, Nintendo 3DS. The game couples phenomenally enhanced graphics with stunning, glasses-free 3D visuals to bring to life the daring adventures of its hero, Link. A streamlined touch-screen interface and newly implemented motion controls provide a fresh and intuitive feel as players immerse themselves in the tale of the creation of Hyrule and the struggle for control of its all-powerful ancient relic. The game will also feature new challenges not included in the original game. The Legend of Zelda veterans can look forward to the Master Quest - a second quest with revamped puzzles and redesigned dungeons that feature the same graphical and interface upgrades as the main game. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is a masterful improvement on one of the landmark releases in video game history.",
