This makes ice fishing much more enjoyable. The price was fair for this auger. My only complaints are that this has had a small fuel leak since I first used it. Reading the reviews, it sounds like is a common problem. Next complain is that this thing is expensive and its the cheapest I could find. You'd think that a competitor would have put out a more affordable one by now. Save yourself the hassle and just buy this. You won't regret it!",

      "text": "Finally can stop using a hand auger in the dead of winter to drill holes. Took this out of the box and assembled it and filled the tank with the required gas mixture. Followed the instructions for priming and choking it. Third pull it fired right up. Used it on a lake with 12 inches of ice and it cut like butter. Auger isn't real noisy and works great. If you are on a budget I highly recommend this auger.",
