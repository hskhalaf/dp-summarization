I'm not an online gamer and pretty much exclusively use the Be a GM mode and it's entertaining. Goal scoring takes a bit of learning but once you get it you can score in droves. Unfortunately, my defense is porous so I need to score. Turning the difficulty up doesn't so much as increase the level of play so much as decreases your goalie's competence.

This game isn't really glitchy, it's just got some proximity issues with goals, icing, offsides, etc. I also don't like when games make your players dumber when you up the difficulty. Seems like a lot fewer passes connect when I up that rather than just having the CPU defenders in better/smarter position to intercept my pass which is how I personally think difficulty should increase.",
