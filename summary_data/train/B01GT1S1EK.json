It\u2019s comfortable, has responsive cushioning, solid traction, and decent support.At $125, there are better performance sneakers out there (including signature basketball shoes such as the Jordan Why Not Zer0.2 and Nike Kyrie 5).

Any way, ago a year ago, while playing racquetball I twisted and sprained my right ankle for the third time. I need a year to heal. When I came back I was really nervous about playing again and was wearing a bulky ankle with my racquetball court shoes. I couldn't find a decent high top racquetball shoe anywhere. A friend suggested using a basketball court shoe. The Under Armour Clutch fit shoes is the best. It really hugs my ankle and I get great support. I would definitely recommend these to anyone playing a \"court\" sport.",
