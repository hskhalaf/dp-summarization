      "title": "Very tasty bars, a little bit expensive",
      "text": "I like all three flavors in the variety pack. The lemon has the perfect amount of flavoring. The chocolate tastes very similar to fudge. The almond vanilla is a very mild but yummy flavor. They all have a subtle aftertaste. The texture is very different for a low carb bar. It is crumbly, and also has a very slight crunch. I like the texture. These are plant based with natural ingredients which is another plus. The only thing I wish is that they were a little more affordable.",

They are a bit chalky but not overly sweet. Going to order the 6 pack variety next.",

The only thing I notice is that they are a little grainy I am guessing due to protien powder of some sort. I am not saying they are bad, but it is just noticeable. I will definitely order again.",

      "text": "A good treat in between a meal, or awhile after a meal. I love these bars! The consistency is unique--it's dry yet crunchy, seedy--the variety and quality of ingrediemts in the bar makes the texture very interesting and satisfying. Not very sweet, but is satisfyingly flavorful. I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 so that not everyone would grab them immediately and be disappointed. I can see how many people would not like them at all. Also, they are quite expensive!! They are subtle, I guess, but for me, DANG they're good!!! I think it's a \"love me\" or \"hate me\" kind of protein bar.",
