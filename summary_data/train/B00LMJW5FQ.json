The Magellan Cyclo 505 does not support Linux. I must rely on family and friends who use use Window products to connect to Magellan for registration of product, and firmware & map updates Other than this minor annoyance, the device appears to be a reliable GPS device, good for cycling about in unfamiliar areas. The affordable price is a big selling point.",

I even tried using my Garmin Ant+ speed and cadence sensors with no luck. I could have lived with the touch screen issue, but the sensors not working meant this unit had to be returned. I was even willing to live with having to charge the unit daily due the battery not lasting a full day.",

Lasted about 17 hours on and all day ride so that was impressive to me as the Edge was lucky to do 5 hours.

My buddy was able to instantly upload his ride from his Garmin using data on his phone. Pros: price, color touchscreen display, surprise me feature, control music via Bluetooth Cons: difficult to setup, needs wifi to upload rides Verdict: good GPS for recreational riders (especially for the price).",
