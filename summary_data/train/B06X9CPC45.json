Consistent speed with wired connection, but wireless is key. Should work straight out of the box. My old $25 tp-link router put out a consistent max speed signal. But I wanted better range and features. Ended up buying a tp-link AC router for about $60 less at Target. Works straight out of the box. I'm shaking my head at you Linksys. What happened?",

The setup was also pretty easy to do oh, and I like some of the smart features that are available using the smart app.",
