Unfortunately that hasn't been my wife's experience.

There is ample cushioning not just in the heel (which is very bouncy), but also in the forefoot which feels like a gel pillow. They hug your feet entirely, providing wonderful cushioning and support with a lightweight, stable outsole. They are expensive for a reason- I tried 2 other Asics pairs at 2 different, lower price points and they did not come anywhere near to the quality and feel of these ones. Nothing else compares. Fantastic.",

I am a 64 year old female runner who runs about 3 times a week, now only 3 to 6 miles each time. This old body's joints need that cushioning as do my feet.",

I didn't notice this until it was too late to send them back (due to only wearing them inside for short periods of time) so I am persevering and hoping they stretch a lot. My last ASICs Gel Nimbus 15 were a wonderful fit, hence buying the same type in the same size but they don't match up. I just wish I had bought the 15s again now.",

Saw a podiatrist who said you cannot get a better pair of road shoes and my sports physiotherapist said the same today. The cushioning is fantastic, they're light & the fit is excellent. I'm usually a 6 and for 6.5 - spot on. Buy these - you won't regret it. They also looks awesome which helps \ud83d\ude09",

      "text": "I bought those for walking as part of my exercise weekly routine. The main criteria for choosing ASICS as a brand initially and these running shoes in particular are my knees. They click sometimes and I wanted to protect them as much as possible, hence proper trainers. I am not disappointed to say the least. I am actually looking forward to my walks because the shoes are so comfy and great to wear. I am UK 7, my foot is quite wide and I have ordered 7.5. Great fit for me! Plenty of space for the running socks!",

    "title": "ASICS Gel-Nimbus 17, Women's Running Shoes",
    "description": "The ASICS GEL-NIMBUS 17 features technologies such as Fluid Ride, a 2 layered midsole construction featuring a combination of both SpEVA and Solyte. Another key feature for the 17th edition is the latest evolution in ASICS midsole technology, FluidRideTM. Improving on it's previous generation it provides the ultimate combination of bounce back and cushioning properties with reduced weight and exceptional durability. The upper construction know as FluidFitTM combines multi-directional stretch mesh with stretch reinforcements that adapt to the athlete's foot, creating a truly customised glove-like fit for the wearer. A new addition to the many technologies featured is the Exoskeletal heel counter which provides improved support and creates an improved heel fitting environment. The customisation goes further with P. H. F. securely hugs the heel with memory foam in a durable execution. The Nimbus 17's come gender specified. A design built on lasts and moulds that are tooled specifically to designated widths. ASICS design philosophy employs linked componentry to enhance the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-of, accomplished through an impact guidance system aiming to leave a better overall feeling and comfort throughout. The outsole is produced from a Durasponge technology, a blown AHAR rubber compound that gives enhanced cushioning and durability in the forefoot. AHAR+ also features a strong material that's strategically placed in critical areas of the shoe to provide excellent grip without compromising the shoes durability, the + means the shoe is lighter that the previous generation technology but not taking away the overall efficiency or productivity. An improved wearers gait efficiency is given from the vertical flex grooves that decouples the tooling along the line of progression for enhanced gait efficiency.",
