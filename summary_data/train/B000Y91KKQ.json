While some people complained about it being hard to put together, if you just read and follow the directions it goes together quite easily. I've had no problems with the tires, which many reviewers complained about. Overall, it's a great wheelbarrow and the large wheels make it a breeze to move around the uneven ground of my yard.",

I thought oh well I'll just have the tube repaired. I took it to my mechanic and he showed me multiple spots inside the tire where the belt was exposed and actually puncturing the tube. Bottom line? Cart ok. A bit lightweight. Rusting somewhat. Tires?--- total junk. Replacement? $44 bucks. Add that to your purchase price. Not a good deal. Rating- D-.",

      "text": "This meets my needs because I'm a bit older, not divulging how old here, but enough. The two wheels make it much more steady than the one-wheel type. Great assist in yard work. Built a path using it. It is for not too much of a load, but then I couldn't handle a huge load anyway, so perfect! I did put it together myself and it didn't take long. Wasn't a difficult assembly.",

Took it to a tire place and when they tried to get the tire off to replace the tube the rim bent and cracked like an aluminum beer can. Cheap materials, to say the least. I ended up buying two solid tires on new rims. So if you don't mind spending an extra $45 to replace the tires this wheel barrow is fine. My next one will certainly be from a different manufacturer.",

I bought this after reading the good reviews, but after having it for a couple years I can only say it was a big disappointment. These days both tires go flat after a day or so, and I don't want to pump up tires every time I use it. That would be enough to avoid this, but the metal parts have started to rust pretty bad. And the third strike is in the design. There is no way to store it tilted up like a normal wheelbarrow. It then gets water in the pan, and those bolts also rust. Avoid this, and save yourself a lot of trouble down the line!",
