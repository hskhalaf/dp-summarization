When I placed my face up against the face shield, as instructed by the manufacturer, it felt like I was breathing in scalding water. The inside of my nose burned for quite a while afterwards. I'm so thankful I didn't let a child use this. Another bad thing is the design of the unit. If you fully extend the arm, the bottom of the unit will topple over. The only good thing I can say is that I liked that it had a longer electrical cord. But that wasn't enough to keep the thing from being returned.",

Had I tried this one at anytime I would have thrown out the former one and bought one of these immediately. These are wonderful and don't burn you with the steam released. They have an adjustable amount of air to add to the steam by extending the outlet pipe and allow air to enter. This steamer helps greatly with sinus related issues to expedite rapid recovery with minimal need for other forms of treatment. Bottom line is that everyone--repeat everyone should own one of these or have access to one of these to be prepared for periodic sinus related flareups and issues.",
