I thought I had travelled a lot, but once you actually scratch all the places you have been, it made me realise I have to travel more! I scratches easily and the colours underneath are very clean too.",

The actual map itself (the \"travel edition\") probably should not be taken along during your travels because the gold covering is VERY prone to scratching, even from wax paper.

    "description": "Scratch off Map Travel Edition\nFollowing the enormous success of The Scratch off Map Poster, we now bring you The Travel Edition. This miniature map is still as cool as its predecessor but cuter in every way. It makes the best present for any globetrotter as the map (in its sturdy tube) fits into your rucksack without taking up too much valuable room.\n\nCompact Scratch Map you can on your travels\nThe idea behind Scratch Map Travel Edition is that you can take it with you as you journey around the globe and scratch off where you\u2019ve been on route \u2013 all you do is scratch off the gold top foil layer of the place you have visited to reveal a brand new and wonderful world underneath.\n\nEveryone intends to keep a log or a diary when they are voyaging but in reality you generally just forget, can\u2019t be bothered or get writers block. The Scratch Map Travel Edition is the perfect way to keep a tally of where you\u2019ve been, plus, flip the Scratch Map Travel Edition over and you have even more glorious things to fill in, map out and stick on. Amongst other things, the reverse side of the Scratch Map Travel Edition has a plain white map to allow you the opportunity to plot your route. You can also paste an image of yourself in the \u2018before\u2019 box and then \u2018after\u2019. The perfect way to assess the tanning progression!\n\nThe Travel Edition Scratch Map also has some tops tips on it. For example, did you know that Bulgarians shake their heads from side to side to mean \u2018yes\u2019 and nod up and down to say \u2018no\u2019? Did you know that cutting down a cactus in America carries a twenty five year prison sentence? Perhaps think twice about bringing home a prickly present for someone. One of the other quirks the map has is sections where you can jot down the music you listened to, the best friend you made and the top 10 highlights. In short, the Scratch Map Travel Edition is brilliant.",
