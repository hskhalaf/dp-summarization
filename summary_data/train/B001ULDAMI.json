I have owned different HP printers still do, but this one is absolutely wrong. Gives errors constantly, not recognizing genuine cartridges when they are not newly installed, printer needs to be reinstalled when failing. I would definitely not recommend this specific model, Got my other daughter one too, she has the same problems, the only showed up later",

That said, I can only say it straight up - This printer is awful. The software is terrible and intrusive. Paper feeding is iffy at best. Front panel control are unhelpful. Really, there's no cost savings here. Spend more on a better printer and you'll save the differnce in time and headache.",
