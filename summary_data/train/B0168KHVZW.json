The fun part: THERE IS NO RETURNS (unless your third robot also breaks!) Basically, Neato's strategy is to keep you in the replacement loop until your 1 year warranty runs out and you're left with a robot that doesn't work and you paid a few hundred bucks for! I sew MANY people in the EXACT SAME SITUATION complaining online (either here, or other forums). Dear Neato: if you have a product that breaks every 3 month, you ONLY accept replacements, but keep your warranty from the date of purchase, you know you're not legit!",

It's a game changer. It's more effective at picking up dirt and hair, AND it doesn't damage my walls and furniture by repeatedly bumping into them. (I just had to repaint all the baseboards in my house because of the marks the Roomba had left.) The app functionality is great since I dock my Botvac under furniture so I don't have to look at it.

I got an extra magnetic strip to mark areas where I don't want it to pass thru, which is helpful. One occasion where I called Neato for customer support and they were terrific. Definitely recommend.",

The wifi works great, we start the Neato before we get home after being gone a few days and no longer have to deal with the cat hairs on arrival. The wifi link also alerts if/when the unit stops or needs attention (like emptying the canister) The setup was simple and fast. The unit will run for about one hour before returning to its base to recharge. Then it automatically returns to where it left off and completes the entire house. It is great into corners and around the furniture legs. Very good product.",

My only complaint is locating a USB drive to update the vacuum, which I think should be included with the product.",

It vacuums the entire house including carpet, tile, and heavy rugs without a problem. The dirt receptacle is easy to dump. It goes under furniture and manuevers into corners, etc. I can't compare it to others as this is our first.
