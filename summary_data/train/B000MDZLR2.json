The MDX stores the spare tire underneath back cargo area exposed to the elements. Wanted to try this cover to help with the sand/dirt/muck that will build-up on a spare in this location. The cover fit very snugly and I could connect the plastic clips. Time will tell if the cover will hold up to the elements in this location. So far, it looks good, covers the tire nicely, and it looks so much better with the cover on.",
