Now I am being told that their policy has changed and they won\u2019t replace the \u201cnew\u201d older unit at all. Instead, they will ship me a box to send the old unit in and repair that and send it back to me. We have been without the use of the product for over two months. This is too expensive of a product to be this unreliable. So disappointing that product support is so bad.",
