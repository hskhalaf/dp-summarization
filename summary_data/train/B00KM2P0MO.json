      "title": "Large Handles, Defects in Workmanship",
      "text": "I had been looking forward to using these to replace all of our mis-matched thrift store mugs of the past. When they came in, they were packaged really well, and they are a great size and the handles are awesome for my husbands larger hands. The problem is EVERY SINGLE ONE of them has a defect. A couple of them are small little air bubbles on the inside that you can see. It creates holes and I don't know if it messes with the integrity of the ceramic or what. Two of them have holes/dents in the outside. A bit frustrated by this, but I guess we just hope they hold up.",
