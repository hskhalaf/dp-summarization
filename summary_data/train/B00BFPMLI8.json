With this valve you can reduce the temp to whatever you want and can cook moist chicken breasts and perfect slow cooked ribs (350 deg on the temp gauge). Spend $20 extra bucks on this valve with adaptors and you will be glad you did.",

It does work well enough when you alter your cooking methods to the quirks. So, points there. I should've read consumer reports before buying.",

      "text": "Grill works great! Over the years I have tried many portable grills in my campers and this one is the very best. It cooks evenly and is so easy to handle and clean up. It is small and easy to store, not too heavy. You can fit a lot of food on the cooking surface too. One word of wisdom - don't waste your money on the cover for this grill. Expensive and almost useless. Make your own carrier to store it in your camper and you will be a lot better off.",

We bought the grill to use with our travel trailer on RV trips and have found it to be absolutely the best all-around portable grill that we've ever used. It is solidly built, provides even heat and really does a nice job. There was a bit of a learning curve, and I made the mistake of having the grill too hot at first. After a couple uses, however, I was pleased with the cooking results. We are most definitely very happy with this purchase.",

    "description": "Style:Portable Grill2GoThis traveling grill will cook your food to perfection using Char-broil's TRU Infrared technology. Its high-impact frame with legs and carry handles makes it easy to take with you. Perfect for tailgating, camping or road trips!\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nYou can grill on the go, and ignite your taste buds anywhere you are hungry, with the Char-Broil Grill2Go X200! This roadworthy powerhouse doesn't mind getting tossed around; its rugged construction and latching lid are built to survive the adventure; whether that means canyon camping or competitive tailgating. Built-in, push-button ignition requires no batteries to ignite a 9,500 BTU burner powered by a small and easily portable 16.4 oz. disposable LP cylinder, while the no flare-up TRU-Infrared cooking system cooks even in the coldest climates \n\nThe Char-Broil Grill2Go x200 is a simple and lightweight tabletop grill that enables you to cook your favorite foods while fishing, tailgating, camping, or relaxing at the beach - with the high quality that only Char-Broil TRU Infrared can deliver in a portable grill. The perfectly portable grill weighs less than 20 pounds, but don\u2019t let the size fool you: with 200 square inches of cooking surface, you can grill burgers or hotdogs for more than a carload full of friends! With convenient push-button ignition, this travel grill quickly heats up to grill burgers, chicken, vegetables, and more! \n\nThe Grill2Go x200 even features a die-cast firebox and aluminum lid built to survive the adventure away from home. The lid is hinged to the rest of the grill to keep things simple when you have limited space but want to cook, the large handle allows you to open and close the lid safely and easily. When it's time to go, packing up is hassle-free with the securely latching top and dual Cool-Touch heat-resistant handles. Quality rust-resistant and durable steel construction with a black porcelain finish helps to extend the life of your grill \u2013 plus, the stainless steel cooking grate is a snap to clean. \n\nHOW TRU-INFRARED WORKS\nAll Char-Broil TRU-Infrared grills generate a minimum of 65 percent infrared heat, which is evenly spread across the entire cooking surface to cook food -- without drying -- at temperatures that range from simmer to sear.\n\n \n\nUnlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying and locks in natural juices and flavors. Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared cooking system virtually eliminates flare-ups while producing very even heat (no hot or cold spots). \n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES \n * Ignition tucked inside right front leg to protect from damage \n * Hood-mounted temperature gauge \n * 200 sq. in. total cooking surface\n * Stainless steel grilling grate/li> \n * 9,500 BTU main burner \n * Easily converted for use with a 20 lb. tank (sold separately - Char-Broil model 5584623) \n * Grill size: 23.7\"W x 15.7\"D x 13.6\"H \n * Weighs 20 lbs.",
