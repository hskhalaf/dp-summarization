The snorkel has a ridiculously loose latch that unlatches by itself under any pressure or after any abrupt movement. For instance, when you dive (from the surface, no jumping). Reattaching it in the water is also very inconvenient and requires too much effort/time.",

This is the type of mask you would find in the dollar stoer/5 below. it has a very cheap feel and the tiltle is MIsleading calling it PRODIVE , no professional or occasional dier would use such a product. the silicone seem old and dry .",

I have a really small face and a hard time getting goggles not to fog up so I was sceptical of these. We had no fogging issues and the snorkel worked perfectly. The piece to attach the snorkel to the goggles is a little flimsy but the packaging says the company has a lifetime replacement guarantee and will expediate the new part to where you're located. Hopefully we won't have an issue while in the Bahamas but if we do they're claiming they'll expediate us a replacement while we're there.",

The snorkel has a comfortable mouth fit and doesn\u2019t allow water in the snorkel when diving underwater. After snorkeling several hours my face is usually sore from the mask, not the case with this one.",

Of course the times were purchased in advance of the trip so the return time had expired. Very disappointed!",

      "text": "Used this snorkeling in calmer water and open ocean water and worked great. No water leakage into mask & snorkel stayed in place when on, best thing was the convenient carry pouch! and the price! Was used by adult women & men. After we were done, rinsed out the gear, dried the inside of the carry case with a paper towel and will be used next time we need it! Again, the carry case was great in that the snorkel care was protected from sand and snorkel gear also was protected (and didn't get other things wet) when being thrown into a large beach bag or carried by individuals.",

We went snorkeling and these snorkeling goggles fogged up within the first 2-3 mins under water. It ruined some of the fun, mainly because I had to keep clearing our my goggles every 2-3 mins which was annoying and irritating. These were advertised as \" anti-fog\" which is definitely not the case. Unless you like clearing your goggles every 2-3 mins while underwater, I'd stay away from these.",

Only 2 stars because of the return policy and the breathing tube working well to keep water out of the top. May not work for you if your head is really big (like me) or small (like my gf)",
