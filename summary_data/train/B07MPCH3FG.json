I have just been using it a week so far, plan on keeping this one and get rid of all my tongue thermometers expect one for a backup. I do recommend keeping the instructions with the thermometer, reading and learning all the hints and trouble shooting tips. I love sneaking in on my kids sleeping to take their temp. I can also see using this with those elderly that may have trouble using a tongue thermometer. So far so good. Thank you!",
