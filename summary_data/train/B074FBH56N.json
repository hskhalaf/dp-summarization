All parts are stainless steel, except the screw knob to attach the head to the machine, the stomper and stuffing tubes. I had a grinder that attached to my Kitchen Aid mixer but ti was mostly plastic and it cracked after a few uses. My #12 is perfect for my use of grinding my own beef. Excellent!!!",

The stuffing tube worked great and this grinder is a workhorse. We ground all 50lbs in a very short time. I had been a meat cutter for years, working with large Biro and Hobart grinders and for the size, this thing is a powerhouse. Easy to clean, easy to operate. We look forward to using it again and again. Very nice grinder.",
