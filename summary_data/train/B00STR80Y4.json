The durability is not so great, though. I've only worn it a couple of weeks and have not yet washed it, and the logo has already peeled off and some of the stitching around the elastic and the top has come off. Seems like it should last longer than this. The fit and support is good, though.",

      "text": "After developing \"tennis elbow' from lifting weights, I did a little research, and then purchased the Copper Compression Elbow Sleeve. The second I put it on I felt instant relief. The muscle soreness immediately went down to a manageable level. It's comfortable to wear and since I started wearing it last week, I already feel better. So it's safe to say that products such as this can promote muscle healing. Of course I'm using it in conjunction with rest and ice packs. Another thing I like is that the sleeve is snug, but not too tight on my skin. Good circulation is obviously a critical component of the healing process.",
