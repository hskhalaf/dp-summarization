However when it came to pairing these with my iPhone, the headphones would not turn on. And after many attempts to pair them, the left earpad fell off and would not stick back on. I do not want to dismiss this as the products fault as I read many positive reviews here on Amazon and would seem as this was a defective unit.",

Very good bass extension, excellent midrange and clear top end without being harsh. I can wear these for prolonged periods without any fatigue and as the cups are so soft they remain comfortable (although they do tend to warm your ears in warmer weather due to the amount of cushioning). No reason to choose any other BT on ear headphone.",

Detachable cable is not locked in as in K450 (should be good for survivability of the cable). On the negative side - the headphones comes with neoprene carrying poach, the old K450 had carrying custom case (which is much safe way to carry headphones around).",

On the down side, the actual quality of materials is kinda bad, the hinge falls apart after roughly one to two years, this is the second headset with the same problem, I think I'm not gonna buy a third one and instead go with an another brand.",

Pros: Nice looking and comfortable Sounded ok, but a lot less bass than my old beats (to be expected) Cons: Didn't like the swivel folding style and the carry bag doesn't close properly, headphones kept failing out in transit Sound failed to impress me or provide feeling to the music in most cases - missing too much bass for me Extending arm broke whilst trying to replace them in the loose bag again! Broke after a few months",

I have a fairly big head, but can only imagine that these were made for a mythical beast with a huge cranium and a high pain threshold. Although you use them on phone calls, you have to use the handset to answer or terminate calls. First world problems, but annoying all the same. Sound quality is fine for me, connection rarely drops, and the battery life is great. Would like to return them, but they're not faulty. Just not right for me.",
