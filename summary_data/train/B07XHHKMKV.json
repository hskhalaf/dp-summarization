I was worried that a phone with a 6.55 inch display would be uncomfortable to hold, but the aspect ratio makes the phone narrow enough to make it comfortable to hold. The build quality is also top notch and as good as the previy Samsung device I owned. So happy I went with the 7T. There is nothing else to match the performance at this price.",

Really impressed so far . Pixels were plagued with hardware issues and Samsung's fingerprint unlock was dreadful. Only negative for me is the notch which isn't very attractive but you can black it out in the settings but it's not too bad. Don't hesitate at this offer price , you won't find a better phone in my opinion",
