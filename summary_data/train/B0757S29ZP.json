Seeing as how I don\u2019t have particularly sensitive skin, and I felt a slight warming/almost burning sensation that can be a little intense. For those of you with normal skin though it\u2019s a wonderful product.",

Also this goes on very thin. So it doesn\u2019t feel like your wearing a mask. But it totally works, I had a few blemished that dried up overnight. Just make sure to use good moisturizer after using.",

I\u2019ve used it as a mask but prefer to use it overnight as a spot treatment. It absolutely prevents those stubborn blemishes from getting bigger. It won\u2019t necessarily erase a blemish but it does seem to stop the progression of a new one. I highly recommend!",
