This lightweight camera may have a now-outdated sensor but it sports a big, light-grabbing and versatile lens and as many programming options as most DSLRs. For an experienced enthusiast, the P510 gives you as much flexibility as you are likely to need and adds a built-in GPS chip for outdoor shooting. Speaking of which - beware this camera's only flaw, IMO, is that it is not really built for outdoor use. It is very fragile! You will need a solid protective case to go along with it.",

I know, because I've used it single handedly while holding onto my squirming 3 year old or while baking with one hand full of flour, or on the beach while propping myself up on the sand. It takes clear pictures, fun to use the zoom and it captures motion pretty quickly and without much if any blur. I still haven't figured out all of it's abilities, but I'm still playing around. The flash is powerful and helps pictures turn out vibrant not washed out.",

The P510 has quite a number of features that will handle whatever any photographer may need. The 16 mp and 42x zoom are great. Photographs taken with the camera are some of the best quality I have seen. The clarity and color are unmatched.

The item could use some minor ruggedization, as I purchased it to replace another that dropped from about a foot onto the ground and was damaged. A stronger metal should be used on the barrel of the housing, maybe? also maybe some rubberization on the body. Still, this was my fault, so I can't fault this great camera for this. If you're buying it just because of the GPS feature, don't. It takes forever to obtain a position, and that rarely works.",

Even handheld the camera manages to eliminate motion blur at maximum 1000mm equivalent zoom. The image quality is excellent if you are not a \"pixel peeper\". There is always some noise in digital camera images and when you cram 16 megapixels into a tiny little image sensor the problem just gets worse. But this camera manages noise very effectively and still maintains good image detail. Just two minor complaints: There is no RAW image option and there is no provision to add filters to the lens.",

However, the zoom is amazing and all of the other features make this a good buy. The only feature I am not sure how to get around is the flash. The camera will complain that you need to use the flash in most cases when indoors. I am sure it is something I will learn how to circumvent as I read the manual more in depth. I put a high speed 64GB SD card in so I am sure I won't run out of space.",

Suddenly the LCD screen developed horrible vertical lines and blotches of strange colors and was no longer useable at all. To get less than one years use out of a camera of this price is unacceptable and points to Nikons bloated hit and miss product line of the digital age. Nikon customer service is all but non-existent now and they are not honoring the warranty. Due to this and previous Nikon disappointments, I've moved on to other camera brands and will not return to Nikon.",

That's a cool feature specially when the subjects are beyond the builtin flash's range. I was evaluating the new Nikon 1 but, after careful thought, I decided against it in favor of the P510 due to more versatility, zoom, features, gps and less price.

The only down side that we have found is extremely minor, and that is that it doesn't have an orientation sensor for rotating the images automaticly.

The flip up LED screen is an amazing feature that makes versatile shots more possible. The zoom is amazing and the color is great. It's not a perfect camera. I don't think any camera is. But for the money, this is a better camera than its successor the P520.",

I've bought cameras before & they always came with case & SD card of some sort. Not this one. Well, I guess the case could be a bit expensive sometimes but a cheap 8GB or less SD card could have been included & avoiding a bit unhappy customer like me. C'mon Amazon!",

It's great for beginners because it's easy to use (in my opinion). You can take great quality pictures and videos with it; however, in low light scenes, it struggles with the focusing. It's smaller than I expected, which I consider a plus; great grip, and the color red gives it more style and stands out! I wouldn't change it for any other camera. I don't regret having choosing Nikon P510 instead of the Sony DSC-HX200V",
