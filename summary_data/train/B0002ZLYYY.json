I do not fall into the latter category. I find the print difficult to read because of the font size. I was very surprised to discover that this radio cannot be used WITHOUT the remote. BOSE must have had a very good reason when designing this item, but I can't imagine what it was. Value for money - I'm not convinced. I've given it four stars. Perhaps I'm being unreasonable.",

I found the stations that I listen to got weak in the afternoons and faded in and out somewhat. A $10 antenna fixed that problem nicely but I was disappointed that Bose did not include such a small necessary item with the initial radio purchase.",
