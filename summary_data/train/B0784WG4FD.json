      "text": "I had a yellow jacket nest within a window dormer. The wasps were entering holes in rotted wood to reach the nest. Following the instructions I applied the foam over and around the holes in the wood after sundown. The next day the nest had the same wasp activity. I tried again during the day while the wasps were active. The wasps were buzzing around the foam but they avoided it. I believe you have to spray the wasps or the actual nest directly. In this case the nest is hidden within the dormer. I had to call an exterminator who applied a dust. This ultimately worked.",

It took three or four stream sprays directly on the insect to slow it down. Neither of them died. I waited 30 minutes on both, then had to finish them off with my shoe. Then, I got to clean up the droplets practically everywhere. I'll try another brand next time. I don't recommend this at all.",

The nest was then easily taken down within a few minutes after ensuring more wasps weren't returning.

After that, it simply isn't sufficient. I'm sure it would be good for a nest. Otherwise, get an electric swatter.",
