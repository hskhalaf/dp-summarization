Push a button to take a vid, push and hold for a pic and everything is stored to the glasses until you transfer to your snapchat. (Do it over Wifi so everything is HD) My few gripes are that the battery life is frankly terrible and they are way too pricey. The camera quality appears 720p which in 2018 is nothing to brag about and the charging cables magnets are cheap.",

You have to use snapchat to upload everything. For $200 you should be able to upload to your gallery too but they are produced by snapchat sooo As for battery life, I can take about 10 videos and it's ready to charge up again. But with that being said, you can just take pictures and it uses less battery. Water resistant? I mean I've worn them on my head while it's sprinkling outside with no issues but it hasn't been summer yet so no direct swimming pools.",

I have been able to pair the glasses on a few occasions, it seems like if you \"forget\" the spectacles in settings and start over, there's a chance that they will connect but doesn't always work. The amount of work you have to put into successfully pairing/connecting the glasses to your phone is ridiculous and not worth the price tag. For $200 I shouldn't have to be troubleshooting these things every time I want to upload a video.",

You can only post the video as part of your story which seems to limit what you can do.

The video quality is not as good as my phones camera but it is good enough to capture the moment. In all, I am happy with my purchase.
