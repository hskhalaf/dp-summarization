I saw the advertisements for this on the tv and thought that they might be a good alternative to drink when we travel. They were not in my opinion. I wasn't happy with these, but then again I'm not used to drinking filtered water.",

      "text": "The best part is they don't add a lot of other ingredients to flavor their water like the big companies do. (Some other companies even put in artificial sweeteners and call it water.) Mist water has done everything right on all of the flavors and the only negative I can think of is they are a little bit on the pricey side for just water and a little teeny bit of essence of fruit flavor. Other than that I hope other people become fans because I would hate to see this go away. It's an easy way to drink lots of water even if you don't like water. Anyone who's tried this will like it.",
