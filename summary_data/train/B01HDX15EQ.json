And when it's all don't you have a very usable Bluetooth speaker with surprisingly good sound quality. Pricey for what it is but not at all unhappy. Will likely buy some for nieces and nephews. 4 star due to price.",

      "text": "You experiment with included parts to show how speakers work - very cool! You then put aside those parts to build the speaker. I was somewhat disappointed as its pretty much a few plugs and snapping on the case to build the actual speaker. Speaker sounds great but I really with it was rechargeable and did not need to be always plugged in to the power outlet.",
