Before switching to Royal Purple I was having Synchro issues with first gear not wanting to fully go into gear on the random occasion. Since switching, rowing through the gears is noticeably smoother and I've not had any issues getting it into 1st gear since. Also it may just be in my head but under Full Throttle it feels like the car pulls a tad bit harder than before. (differential fluid was changed to the RP 75w 90 at the same time, so it may be a combination of new gear oil in both) Either way, I'd recommend it.",
