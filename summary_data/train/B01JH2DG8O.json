Whenever I forget to use it, inevitably he will rub his face on the carpet because moisture from his tears gets down into his wrinkles. To use this product, I use a clean warm washcloth to gently wash around his eyes and folds, then I pat dry with a clean towel and apply the product around each of the areas. Tidus' face stays white and itch-free. We love this product.",

I tried everything for his tail pocket like prescription wipes from the vet, baby wipes, holistic formula of coconut oil, lavender etc. Nothing worked. My last hope was the wrinkle paste. With in 3-4 days I noticed the redness in his tail pocket had gone away and there was no longer any residue when I would clean it out. It works! I definitely recommend this for infected/itchy tail pockets!",

      "text": "Bought this for my 9 yr old Frenchie. She is prone to allergies that cause her eyes to get gunky in the spring and summer. Giving her allergy medicine just wasn't enough to help. The eye gunk would sit in her skin folds if I wasn't constantly wiping her face. In between her face folds it would get inflamed and pink. I discovered this cream and it really helps calm her skin down. So I'm continuing giving her allergy medicine and using this everyday no more inflammation! A little dab goes a long way. I only wish I found this product sooner!",

Before adding a Medicine...This Crud.covers the baffles Thick & paste that does not soak into the areas well & or easy & comes off very easy so in my opinions it does not get the job done it promotes,it's a mess ,& any one who has the baffles of their Dogs it's unsettling & painful for them So they don't want you putting a puddy of thick crud on them...That does notta!! So look for a proven rated.baffle review before buying things...Thank you...",
