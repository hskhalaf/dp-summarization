      "verdict": "The support and traction from the lightweight Salomon Quest Prime GTX unquestionably made its average price all worth it. The pair is sturdy yet required little-to-no breaking-in. Its Contagrip technology is not left unnoticed, as well as its quality construction. The comfort of the backpacking boot which was tantamount to having no foot fatigue at all was also appreciated.\u00a0No matter how perfect the boot may seem, some shortcomings still plague it. Upset consumers noted that the toe box is too wide and there are some issues with the laces. All in all, this Salomon offering may end up as a credible pair for backpackers because of its trail-related advantages, as long as buyers adjust to its shortcomings.",

I tried mink oil, wax and other leather softening products but they BOTH still pop as I walk. Second the Gortex is stitched inside the boot and they put a seam right where my heel sits and it rubs my foot creating a hot spot and eventually will cause blisters. I will be returning these and buying the tried and true Keens.",

Then I wore them another 12 hours just day to day, and then another. After 36 hours of wear they became comfortable. This is a rugged boot designed for hiking. After a low round hike in the swamps it stands up well. Keeps out water. I will say that there are more inexpensive boots that do the same.",
