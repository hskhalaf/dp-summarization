      "text": "This water bottle is great for traveling, it folds up really small for airplanes but then can be filled with water. It's durable and can be easily clipped to a backpack. I like that you can use it as a \"straw\" water bottle by sucking from the nozzle without tipping the bottle up into the air, or you can tip the bottle into the air, whatever you prefer. It is a bit hard to clean since the opening is small, but I guess with a good brush it wouldn't be so bad. It's also comfortable to keep in a small fabric backpack because it's soft, it won't dig into your back like hard water bottles.",

Other than that it is the perfect running bottle. The loop fits easily around my finger and makes it hard for me to drop, but easy to hold. Fits right in the crook of my arm while running.",

Also, it's been to the pool a lot and been in a ton of contact sun-screened hands; maybe its' made the matte go away faster.

My go bag has a G.I. canteen and a CamelBak bottle on the outside, but I keep one of these Vapur bottles rolled up inside, just in case. These are RUGGED for a collapsible and can hang on a bag loop with the built-in carabiner. If things go bad, water is the most important commodity to take with you, or collect along the way. Without water you will die. Highly recommended.",

This bottle was dropped in gravel and snow repeatedly. I had clipped this to my backpack but must have not screwed it on tight enough so I lost it at Trolltunga. I loved it so much, I came back and bought a second for travel/hiking.",
