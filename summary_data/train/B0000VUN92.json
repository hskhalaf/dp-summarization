I can tell that it has faded slightly (comparing the inside to the outside color,) but I get a reasonably price piece of protection that allows me to avoid erecting a shed for the tractor. I will definitely purchase another, if this one ever wears out.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nRandall G. Bennett5.0 out of 5 stars So Far This Cover is Working Great For Me at a Bargain PriceReviewed in the United States on September 7, 2019Verified Purchase I have a 52 inch cut Gravely ZTR that I was keeping in an open barn. Unfortunately the mice decided that it was the perfect place to build a nest and this caused me to have to replace some engine parts. I liked keeping the mower in the barn but I hate taking it to the dealer for repairs so I started looking around for a cover. I found several available on Amazon mostly at $50 and up until I ran across this particular cover. The price definitely got my attention so I decided \"why not\" and ordered it. Since it was designed for a lawn tractor I wondered if it would cover a ZTR but after several attempts (and finding the tag that says \"front\") I managed to get it on and it covered my mower completely as you can see in the photos. I did fold the seat forward and put the steering sticks on top so it would be shaped more like a tractor but that is certainly not a problem. It fits great and keeps the weather and MICE out too. They would have to get out in the open to get to my mower now and we have a couple of cats that would definitely make short work of them. I like this cover and give it my unqualified recommendation.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse WBC Coach4.0 out of 5 stars This will give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of durability ...Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2014Verified Purchase I just ordered my third one in 5 years in my moderate NC climate. This will give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of durability and value. Fit is very good on my 48\" deck Husqvarna lawn tractor with some room to spare. Do find puddles on the seat fairly regularly but don't know exactly why as the rest of the tractor shows zero signs of accumulated condensation, leakage, or rust under any conditions. Cover RARELY ever comes loose. In other words, this thing really does its job...except for the minor inconvenience of the puddle on the seat. I suspect somehow the two rear vents must let in some moisture either in the form of rain or condensation that has only ever accumulated on the seat. Not a huge deal since the tractor, including the deck, has been well protected for all the years I've been using this exact model of nylon cover. I only give 4 stars because I think it should be made to last longer than two years with much of that time, in previous years at least, spent in open shade and not in direct sun. Please note that this past year I did leave the covered tractor in the sun for the whole year and the cover disintegrated after about 1 year. Thus, this was a \"rush\" order since my tractor is presently unprotected and the shredded old cover is in the trash. Cover gave way without warning.Read more 20 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse tm5.0 out of 5 stars Good light duty coverReviewed in the United States on September 25, 2018Verified Purchase Fits most standard size lawn tractors. Mine has a 44\" deck. I think this cover will last me a long time. During the season my tractor is parked in dense shade. Barely any sun gets to it at all. I only use the cover on it if there is a chance of rain in the forecast. In winter I store it in the garage till the spring. So the cover won't see ice and snow either. I like the air vents it has. Good to have air vents in summer. Many covers don't have them. The green color looks really good. Much nicer than black. The only thing I don't like about the cover is the storage bag is sewn on and does not come off unless you cut it.Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Wes1.0 out of 5 stars Dont waste your money. Buy a better coverReviewed in the United States on August 2, 2018Verified Purchase This thing is thin, flimsy, and doesn't even cover my entire 42 inch cub cadet tractor. If I hadn't cut the part where the bag attached to the cover itself I'd return it. But the stupid bag kept flapping against the tractor and made an obnoxious noiseRead more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Will4.0 out of 5 stars Good cover for a good price!Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2015Verified Purchase We've had this cover for about two years, and are now buying a replacement. After two years of exposure to the elements, the fabric became weak and it tore when installing it (snagged on part of the lawn tractor). I suspect that's about what one would expect from this kind of material\n\nOn the plus side, this is an easy-to-use cover, and I really like that it has a sewn-in tab at the front that says \"FRONT.\" Sure makes it easy to know which way to put it on! :) It has done a good job in keeping the lawn tractor out of the sunshine and wetness.\n\nOn the negative side, there were a few times when we had the cover installed in what appeared to be the correct manner, but it still got water on the tractor seat. I'm not sure if we had it on crooked and it rained, or what, but it only happened on occasion.\n\nOverall, we're buying it again, so I guess that means we like it!Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Liazard3.0 out of 5 stars Decent product, but doesn't stand up to the sunReviewed in the United States on February 9, 2014Verified Purchase Still buying them probably mostly because it fits my tractor so well. On the other hand, I'm going on my third one in four years because durability is very limited. I pinched the material today to lift it up off the tractor and it just ripped. Tested some other areas and yep, it's pretty much completely failed. I went into my Amazon orders and noticed I'm ordering one about every 2 years, that's about how long they last in the Florida sun. And about 4 months of that it was in the garage with the cover stored away. Seems like it could be made of much better, thicker fabric for the price.\n\nOf course, any nylon fabric will fade, crack, lose water repellancy and/or deteriorate after a couple of years in the sun. This is a decent product, better than most. Great color. Looks much better in the yard (and fades less) than the black ones.\n\nWhen it wears out buy another. A tad cheaper than a $20,000 garage.Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse TK4.0 out of 5 stars I can't believe how big it is........Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2019Verified Purchase My mower has a 42\" deck and this thing covered the entire lawn mower even the tires. I am not sure it's waterproof as I have it sheltered a bit. But it's easy to get on and off. I got the green color so I won't see if it get moldy but I will probably throw it in the wash machine once in awhile to clean it. Not sure if you are allowed, but again I don't need waterproof, just something to keep off blowing rain and dirt.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Sometimes Jones5.0 out of 5 stars Great ProtectionReviewed in the United States on December 26, 2017Verified Purchase I love this cover. I've covered my tractor for two winters with this and it remains flexible and unaffected by the weather. Granted, I park my tractor under my deck, but the deck is covered in planks that let rain and snow drip fall onto the tractor. I can tell that it has faded slightly (comparing the inside to the outside color,) but I get a reasonably price piece of protection that allows me to avoid erecting a shed for the tractor. I will definitely purchase another, if this one ever wears out.Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nmarshal5.0 out of 5 stars Good CoverReviewed in Canada on December 5, 2019Verified Purchase I have this one on a Murray 23 HP 48 inch deck lawn tractor...Very nice cover...I had one on a Bolens for 2 years winter & summer ,was still good when I sold the tractor with it still on....V/G productsRead more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
