Perfect for those 3-5 day business trips or a 7-10 day outing where you want to double your socks and underwear but halve your shirts and pants. Add a small travel size 3oz. Wrinkle Releaser pre-spray and you are fresh and crisp in under a minute. I love this product.",

I bought a big expensive one about a year back and it recently stopped working so decided to give this a shot. Travels in a bag easily as we took it on vacation. Use it almost every morning and has taken the wrinkles out of any material you can think of quickly! Also - love that it gets hot so fast and is ready to use in less than a minute. I highly recommend this steamer!!",

Don't try and lay something flat and \"pour\" the steam onto your item - you'll just pour water on it. That's the limitation of this sort of thing, the steam goes up, so whatever you're steaming needs to be vertical for it to work well.",
