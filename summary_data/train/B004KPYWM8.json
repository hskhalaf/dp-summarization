      "text": "Love so much. The texture is super light & gel-like .. it absorbs in seconds. Not perfumey. When it use it (especially after skipping a night) I really notice a difference. I have sensitive skin & many products are too harsh. My skin also errs on the dry side so I really benefit from using this over night. It\u2019s not heavy so you won\u2019t have to wash your face in the morning if you\u2019re running late Took me about 4 months to finish using almost every night on my entire face & neck I highly recommend !!",

The texture of the product feels light and the product does feel like it provides a lot of moisture (just as much add regular cream to me anyways). I'll definitely keep buying this. I see what the hype is about now. :)",
