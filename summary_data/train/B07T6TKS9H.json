I was looking for one that would be good enough for my small kitchen but once I heard it playing I was stunned at how full and well balanced it sounded! I've been using it since I got it in the mail and I can't be tired of it. Very easy to pair. I'm charging my phone on it and the battery life is spectacular, so you don't really have to worry about charging it often. Overall, great speaker! I would recommend this to anyone!",

It sounds crystal clear and it is very lightweight making it so very easy to transport with you where ever you go. The Solar panels within the speaker make it so convenient to make sure that it is always charged. I really love the feature that is has in the speaker for you answer the phone if you are using your phone to play music. It was well worth the money I spent for it, actually it was very inexpensive.",

Clean and crisp with no static, even when using at max volume. My main reason for purchasing this particular speaker was for the solar panel so that I could use while in the pool, and I'm not disappointed! No more worrying about battery life while trying to swim. And it's waterproof!! This is also gonna be super handy on our annual beach vacation. It's the perfect size for a portable speaker.

So I contacted Amazon and they simply replaced my unit as this was warrantied for 18 months and after being on the phone with the customer service tech for an hour, who was very helpful, she couldn't locate who made or sold this item either.

You\u2019re getting what you pay for, a cheap speaker that\u2019s fine for quiet places but too quiet if you use where any kind of background noise is happening. I used it in a work truck and could make out music like 70% of time but trying to listen to podcasts or books where you need to understand everything said was asking too much. And like the title said the solar panel popped while sitting in a hot car. Not planning on rebuying",

It comes with a charging cable and for those who don\u2019t have Bluetooth an aux cable is also included. We compared it to the Alexa we have on the porch and the bass was much better. When the volume increases the quality is not affected. Customer service is fabulous as well you can tell they care about their customers.",

It was very easy to hook the speaker up to my phones Bluetooth and begin listening to my music! My son especially took interest into the speaker. Whenever a song is on he carries it from room to room with him (but it can definitely be heard from a few rooms over). It\u2019s the perfect outdoor speaker for this reason. The sound range is great. It\u2019s super durable, compact, and user friendly! 10/10 recommend.",
