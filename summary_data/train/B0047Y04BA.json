      "text": "I needed something to put on our bathroom ceiling because I didn't feel like retexturing or painting after I removed the popcorn ceiling. It's subtle yet beautiful. It elevates the bathroom's appearance. It's been up for a couple months and I haven't noticed any effect of the humidity from the shower. I always turn on the vent and open the door after showering to let out the steam anyways. Originally I was going to do a tile backsplash in the kitchen, but that turned out to be out of my budget. I had leftover wallpaper from the bathroom ceiling so I decided to use that as a backsplash. I love it!!!",

Turned out really nice. The paper is pretty and you can see the embossed detail from several feet back. I did practice painting one piece and it looked nice. . took the paint well but liked the white better. It was a lot of paper for only a few drawer faces, but I plan on using it again with other projects.",

Be sure to order plenty and perhaps return the extra so the same doesn't happen to you. A roll doesn't go very far.",

Don't worry those go away once the paint dries. Love the look but so much hassel",

I let it dry for awhile before I used the razor blade (which was new and sharp) to cut after it was applied and that seemed to work best - cutting right after it was applied made awful tears. It is absolutely beautiful though! I plan to paint it in a day or two, but it looks good enough to leave as is :)",
