Unfortunately, when I opened the \"sealed\" package, one of the pairs was very, VERY clearly used (I'll let you imagine what that means), which is disgusting. Shame on the person who returned the pair and for Amazon or whomever is in charge of quality control re: repackaging/selling. Obviously I can't speak to whether these things worked or not because I went nowhere near trying them on. I was going to upload a photo but thought I'd spare everyone the ew factor. Triple gross!",

I am disappointed that I spent money on special underwear believing in these claims. However, they are actually very comfortable. These are the most comfortable panties I have ever worn that stay in place. They are extremely high rise to the point that they even peak through my high rise yoga pants and definitely my jeans so that\u2019s a little bit annoying. Other than that they are true to size. If you want comfortable panties these are it. If you want gym underwear to fight odor and sweat look elsewhere",

Pros: I originally purchased them for a trip that required me to bring something easily handwashable and fast drying and these definitely did the job very well. Good for camping or any outdoorsy trip. The fit is very comfortable. True to size. Comfortable, fabric feels similar to moisture wicking fabric. Cons: A little too high waisted. Not a big problem for myself but if you tend to wear lots of low rise pants/bottoms it will probably peek out a little too much. But if you\u2019re like myself and you almost only wear high waisted things, it should not be a problem for you at all.",

They might feel a bit loose if you do high-impact exercise, so if you get these for crossfit or running, order a size smaller. The specific problem I solved with these was how wide the crotch material is- most thongs have a teeny width across the crotch, which leaves some of us without enough coverage. These COVER IT. Great buy, and will continue to buy more.",

These thongs adequately keep my manhood contained, and the back is not abrasive at all. I've run several miles in these already, and have washed them as many times, and the thongs are holding up well.

Sides/back can be pulled further up for a more curvy/sexy feel or worn lower to avoid peeking out from behind one\u2019s pants.

They fit, but they are a little larger than expected. They come all the way up to my belly button or higher. They are very stretchy so if I avoid stretching them at all and push them down they sit closer to where I would prefer them. Quality and comfort are awesome! They are great for working out. I will be ordering more in size large.",

I read that these do run \"large\" so I ordered a MEDIUM, and they fit so well, and are SO comfortable, and you never realize that you're wearing them? Went back online and ordered 2 more packages. That must tell you something!",

Quality is pretty good, I only had one pair unravel in the washing machine. Colors are good and don't bleed at all. Material is breathable and soft. I prefer other brands for everyday wear but these are great for workouts and are an affordable alternative to other brands. Only complaint is that they dig in slightly since I shrunk them a bit in the dryer. Would recommend hang drying.",

I'm 5'5 130lbs, so not bony skinny at all. I assume for larger hipped people this would work better but it sadly didn't for me.

I have no idea how they're still in one piece, but I am disappointed in the fraying around the seams. Still using them 10 months later, but I'm over it. They are also quite high cut, which, combined with the stretchy fabric, makes these ideal for an 80s throwback spandex workout costume.",
