She has to go to work early and has no time to stand around stirring this stuff. She adds it to coffee or hot tea, stirs it and then spoons out the clumps floating on top which is also time consuming. She asked me not to buy it again. So regardless of ingredient quality, taste, health benefits, etc., it is a waste of money if it doesn't dissolve and gets thrown in the garbage.",

I've tried hot water, warm water, room temp, and cold water. It doesn't matter the temp, it just is a clumping sticky mess. Even using an immersion blender, it sticks to the blender and is a lot of effort to blend in completely. If you're getting this to add to smoothies it would be great. I like the concept but I don't have the time or patience to work it into my coffee which is how I incorporate collagen.",

    "description": "WHY BONE BROTH + COLLAGEN? \n\n Bone Broth, derived from REAL food sources, is considered to be one of the most ancient and remarkable nutritional substances and best source of natural collagen in the world. Everything that connects our body, keeping skin tone and joints strong, needs collagen. Collagen protein is different than whey and casein protein because of its high levels of amino acids. \n\n DON\u2019T BE FOOLED:\n\n Not all collagen supplements are created equal, whether advertized as collagen peptides or collagen hydrolysate. In fact, most rely on just a single source of collagen. Until now. Introducing Peak Performance\u2019s ultimate blend of Bone Broth + Collagen with types I & III collagen for hair, skin, nails, muscles and bone support. PLUS type II collagen for joint and cartilage support, gut and healthy immune function.\n\n OUR GUARANTEE:\n\n Recent testing reveals popular collagen and bone broth products contain a number of potentially hazardous contaminants, including antibiotics, parabens and more. \n\nWith a trusted brand like Peak Performance, you are GUARANTEED the highest quality Bone Broth + Collagen from pure, pasture-raised, grass-fed cows. Our Supplement contains no antibiotics or toxins and no artificial or refined sugars or fillers.\n\n Peak Performance Pure Pasture Raised Grass Fed Hydrolyzed Bone Broth + Collagen Protein is Paleo Friendly, GMO Free, Gluten Free, Soy Free and Dairy Free and is quick and easy to mix in hot & cold liquids: coffee, smoothies, soups etc. \n\n This collagen protein is easily digestible, gut friendly and are made for women and men who are busy professionals, athletes, high performers and parents on the go. \n\n Mixes great with the Peak Performance High Altitude Organic Coffee.",

      "IMPORTANT - MOST SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT 3RD PARTY TESTED! This is a dirty secret that many supplement companies don't want you to know that their products are NOT independently 3rd party tested outside of their own facilities. Why?

Peak Performance is committed to the HIGHEST STANDARDS and this product is 3rd party tested to ensure it is 100% SAFE FOR YOU.",
