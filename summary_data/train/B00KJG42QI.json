Hard to put a finger on the issues with this one but whatever it is, it just doesnt seem as much fun as the others.",

      "text": "My two sons aged 9 and 11 have played all the previous lego PC games and loved them all. My sons always play using Xbox controllers. I bought them Lego Batman 3 for Christmas. Big mistake. There is a known bug with this game in that many computers do not recognise Xbox controllers, so my sons tried playing with the keyboard but soon gave up. I wish I had searched Google before I bought this game. I do not understand how a company that has made so many good Lego PC games can have made such a mess this time.",
