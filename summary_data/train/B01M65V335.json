I'm getting bored and it's time to mix it up. I saw a Tracy Anderson video on YouTube and she suggested the weights. I did it without the weights, ordered them and tried the video again with the weights. Boom my booty was so sore in a great way! Sometimes I lay in front of the TV and do leg lifts. I've also put them around my wrists and done some arm circles. Nice light weight, perfect for low impact training. I love using these when I do a barre video too!",
