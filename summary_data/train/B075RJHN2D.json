Based on Tech Supports requirements, we even purchased different types of RAM to try. Eventually we had to return the mother board since it did not work properly. Hopefully the replacement will not have this issue. Update - Amazon was willing to replace the board. New board arrived and it is working correctly. Don't quite understand why it took ASUS Customer Service a month to figure this out. Overall, disappointing - but happy to finally have a working board.",
