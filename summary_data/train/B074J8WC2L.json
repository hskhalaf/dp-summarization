      "text": "Great product, had some issues getting the keyboard to pair so thought I would share the solution. The instructions that came with only said the turn on the keyboard then turn on bluetooth on the ipad, however these instructions ( added info about hitting the control and 'c' button which seemed to put the keyboard into discovery mode, as soon as i did that it paired immediately. Hope that helps if anyone is having the same issues as me.",

I may have just received a bad apple, and given the fact that they are so good at taking care of the customers, I felt it warranted an edit of my review. The keyboard itself does everything as advertised, and now that I have one without mechanical issues, I am happy with the purchase.",

No charge . Great customer service",
