So, I'm stuck with another full can of hairspray that won't spray! I see others have complained about this problem as well. When I call the \"money back guarantee\" number on the can, the manufacturer says they will not cover products purchased on Amazon. So, buyer beware!",

My hair is very fine and this spray allows me to spray it on and then style it. It doesn't have a strong hold. It just allows you to spray and style. You would need the Shaper Plus for a stronger hold.",

I know it is a good product, but it is no good to anyone if you can't get it out of the can.",

I love that it goes on \"dry\" and that I can brush through it easily and restyle my hair if necessary. Because I have long hair, I don't shampoo it daily, so I also love that there is no hairspray build-up with Shaper. It shampoos out beautifully even after 2-3 days of daily use. But even though it brushes out easily and doesn't build up, it does hold well. Best. Hairspray. Ever.",

Now, however, when I have the need to use it, it won't spray. It just spits and sputters and I can't spray my hair. I have tried cleaning the nozzle, but to no avail, and now I find out that I only had 30 days from purchase to return it.",
