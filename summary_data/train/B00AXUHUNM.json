You are told not to inflate above 2.4PSI They should offer a way of telling how to guess-tamate without a gauge. Also, if the 2.4PSI is without a person sitting in it. I ordered a gauge even though none of the gauges have a very good review. Other than that I love this boat and have now modified it to accept a hand operated trolling motor",

However, I think that this pontoon is unsuitable for a total load of more than 200 pounds. I know the pontoon is rated to 350 pounds, but when the water is cold and the air in the pontoons start to decrease in pressure, the pontoons can very quickly 'deflate' and cause balance problems. Overall, I do think that it is a value for money product, just don't expect too much from it.",

      "title": "Roanoke - Great Pontoon Boat",
      "text": "As a first time buyer and only an annual user for floating a river I chose this boat mostly for the price. Of all the boats that appeared at our camp I think this one was the best, even compared to other CA boats. I really like that the seat is higher so you don't sit in the water. It was easy to put together. There was a slight problem with the oars not fitting together but we managed to make it work. One more thing... for some reason it is fast. I had a hard time staying with the pack, it just wanted to run away!",
