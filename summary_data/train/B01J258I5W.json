Now I have to spend $250 for a travel stroller with a more comfortable seat for my 1 year old. It was great folding up the stroller and tossing it in overhead bins on planes or in the trunk of a car, but that came at the expense of my son\u2019s comfort.

Too bad because almost all the other features are great: compact, easy fold, maneuverable with one hand, and decent storage for such a small stroller. It isn't super easy to unfold, however. You have to pull the front and back wheels away from each other using two hands, so it's awkward.",

It\u2019s is very easy to fold and store, comes with backpack style travel bag. Super light weight, very easy to maneuver.

The top umbrella is tiny and doesn\u2019t give much coverage at all, but if all your worried about is getting through the airport quickly, you\u2019ll be fine. It folds up pretty easily, but can be a little more challenging to unfold as time goes on.

Also, the clasps that fit into the body harness come apart EVERY time you fold it so you have to tinker with them and try to figure out how to make them fit one another...It had good reviews online but I would not buy it again had I seen it in person.",

It worked great on vacation since we were able to fold it up pretty quickly when we went into crowded restaurants and put it aside/under the table. The backpack storage bag it comes with is great for gate checking or garage/car storage. We have a bob stroller (we love it) but it\u2019s 3 times bigger than this one so not as practical. The storage is pretty small but it seems worth the sacrifice. The handle doesn\u2019t adjust which is a bummer but not a huge problem.

I absolutely love the compact design. It doesn't take up too much space like my larger everyday stroller, so it's perfect for quick trips and travel.
