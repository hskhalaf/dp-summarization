My husband finally had the opportunity to use it and he was really impressed. Inflated the tire quickly without hassle. You can set the pressure and it will turn off when has it inflated to the correct psi. I love that it come with great storage bag and it is compact and light. Very easy to store in the car. I would definitely recommend this purchase.",

This is a compressor everyone can use , all it takes is two buttons its amazing. I pumped my tires in my SUV and Sedan with so much ease that I will buy 2 or 3 more of these, absolutely so handy love it. And so small that its almost the size of a phone. It also has a nifty flashlight and digital display in case of emergency when pumping at night. It will save you from so much trouble and money .",

Now I can adjust pressure whenever I need -- like when I go to snow country and the temperature is 30 degrees colder leaving tires under-inflated. ALSO - Now I know that when I need my neglected spare tire due to flat, I can pump it up to the required 60 psi. This pump is great. I set the desired pressure and all four tires get perfectly inflated. So easy to use.",

The actual numeric readout is fine. The unit is easy to hook up and stops when the right air level is achieved. Light weight, normal sound level, and attractive red & black color.",

I tried it out this weekend, and was very happy with the results. I own a Tundra, and had to issues reaching the tires. They give you plenty of cord length. The unit tells you what your current pressure is, then you choose the pressure you want, and hit the on button. It then turns off when it's done. I used my pressure gauge and everything appears to be on the money. Very happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "This little unit has held up well so far. I've used it to balance the air pressure in my car tires several times. It does heat up a bit during continuous use, so be careful to let it cool down. It has great pressure (150psi), is relatively easy to use (minus the fact that after you set the pressure setpoint, it blinks and then display 0.0 psi--minor annoyance, not a big deal to me), and comes with a nice zippered case. It's nice to get the HOTOR 8.5A 100W 110-220V AC to DC converter with this so you can plug it into a wall outlet (sometimes it's easier to deal with than fiddling with the cigarette lighter in the car).",

Cons: *It would be nice if accuracy was 0.1psi instesd of 0.5psi. *Power and light buttons cannot be seen in the dark. It would be nice if they were lighted or fluorescent. *Cable cannot be stowed in the body of the compressor, and The space to stow the hose is too tight for it; it looks like it will get damaged if its constantly stowed there.",

      "text": "I love this little unit. Originally, I got a Slime one at Napa, which promptly broke. This one, however, is well made. Even little details like the electrical cord, air hose and adapter fitting are nice (not cheap). I love the preset function AND that it remembers that pressure setting the next time you use it. I use it on my SUV and trailer tires, from 35-65 PSI. Worked effortlessly. Tried it in my friend\u2019s RV tires to 80 PSI, and it seemed to be putting in quite the effort. Not wanting to bust another one, I nixed that job. Definitely keeping it for my tires, though!",
