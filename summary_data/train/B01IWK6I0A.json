I also like the options for the LED lights. Overall, it is a great product and I would consider purchasing from them again.",

Set up wasn't even that bad for doing it by myself even though the directions suggested you should have two people (which would've be a little easier) but hey. I was too excited. I love the complimentary balls and I even got like this cute little beer pong towel! Putting it back together was a breeze too. Overall I really dig it. It's definitely a great investment when you have people over all the time. Thanks so much! \u2764",
