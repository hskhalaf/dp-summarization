It uses twice the amount AA batteries (4 of them and they'll last forever, so no biggee) to power a seriously robust motor. It's a great pleasure sharpening pencils these days. Highly recommended.

She can take it to the hospital and rehab center easily when she has to be at such places. It weighs much less than our old relic for her to handle and no need for an electric outlet.

      "text": "Love it! We use it in our classroom for colored pencils- and we've hidden it from students because it works so well we don't want them to do anything bad to it! :-) It's super quiet, so quiet I wasn't even sure it was working, but nope, the colored pencils came out sharpened perfectly. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, easily fits in the palm of your hand, but mighty and does a great job! We'll easily sharpen 20+ colored pencils a day (just regular school-type, Crayola, etc) and have zero problems. Highly recommend!",

But, it is compact enough that it doesn't take up too much room on my desk the way other electric sharpeners do.",
