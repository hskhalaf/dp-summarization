It focuses so fast and my wife caught some amazingly sharp and unbelievable shots of me almost dropping my daughter the other day. this coupled with an a6000 is amazing for child photography. seriously this lens is as sharp as dxo mark makes it out to be. I do not or have not shot with the sony f1.8 50mm but there is no way it is as sharp as this, even open at 2.8 this is tack tack sharp. I know sharpness isn't everything, but that's what I wanted so I bought this and won big for $200!",

Animal portraits are stunning with this lens. Human portraits might require extra retouching, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lens is very sharp - there is no hiding anything from it. The fast focus and the strange but inconsequential rattle noise might make it less than perfect for video purposes. Not unusable, though. The lens could still work in some video recording situations. It would just be a matter of finding some work-arounds.",

The Sony 50 1.8 is also sharp and has optical stabilization, but dollar for dollar, I'd pick this sigma every time.

      "text": "The lens is long prime, effectively 90mm on a full-size sensor. It's fast and sharp. Do not, however, think of it as a zoom lens. The factory hood is of little use. It fit loose and didn't shield the lens from flaring. I bought an accessory hood and ring adapter.The colors are true, no noticeable aberrations or distortions. I am very pleased with sharp focus/blurred backgrounds and long landscape shots. I think it would be a very good portrait lens.",
