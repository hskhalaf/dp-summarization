Just leave it in that mode and control it from the app from anywhere from thereon. Again, my apologies for the initial bad review, it's really good.",

Tried contacting the support people and they havent addressed problem as yet. replaced it or sent the parts that should have come with it originally. 5. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.",

I am able to let my instant pot cook and while focusing my attention on something else, I can check the status via bluetooth or through Alexa. The cleaning process is also very simple and the pot is easy to remove. I don't know how I ever lived without an instant pot!",
