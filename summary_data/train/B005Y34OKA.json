At any rate, we used this kit for piece of mind, but could have easily upgraded to 'legally acceptable for court' which is good; Performing the test is easy & so is registration. We picked up the results online which is very convenient. I would reccomend this product to anyone who needs piece of mind.",

After several attempts, I put the registration through without the additional request for hard copy. It could be that I was registering on my phone. The test results were fairly clear. I had not read the time allotment properly on how long it would take to have my results processed so I thought the wait was a little long. Once received, it was concise and easily understood.",
