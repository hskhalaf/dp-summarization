The touch screen works just fine and he's been using it EVERY SINGLE DAY since December (2010). His calls are very clear. Much better then with the older AT&T GoPhone he had. The pictures are decent for a 2 MP camera. No problems with texting either. He used his regular contract AT&T Sim card with this phone (not the GoPhone Sim card) and it works like a charm. We give this phone 5-stars !",

I went online and did a Google search and found a forum where literally thousands of people were talking about having the same issue with their LG phone. Wish I had had the sense to do the research before I bought the phone. Until the touch stops working, it's a great phone. But what's the use of all the good stuff this phone has if you can't access it because of the faulty touch screen?",

I would recommend this phone for children and internet illerate to use. It did come brand new, packaging was GREAT and the $15 bonus was good, but im now looking for another phone to buy.",

      "text": "I never had so much problems with cell phones before, except for this one. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. The main problem was that it did not send out text (Like most reviews warn you about). I did not bother to look at reviews because I thought that cell phones were somewhat like computers (They're obsolete within 4-5 years or so), so I assumed it would work. I had many important texts to send out and did not realize they were not being sent out until someone told me. Another BIG problem is that you can't return the phone if you open the package, so once you realize its fault its already too late.",

Once the cell phone looses the signal (though signal indicator is displaying 3 bars), I cannot make or receive calls. I have to restart the phone in order to make or receive calls. I am not sure if this happens because of AT&T network, or the cell phone, but together they dont make a good combination for sure. I would say its not worth spending this much money for this phone. Better look for other options.",

The touch screen stops working correctly after a few months and then stops working at all within a few weeks of that. I purchased the phone in June 2010 and had to replace it by September of 2010! And the replacement stopped working in January of 2011!! I think that speaks for itself. If you want a touch-screen spend money on a good one. If you just want an affordable, reliable phone try something without a touch screen. Good luck!",

It don't feel that duality, so if your a person that drops your phone often maybe you should rethink about getting this phone. Other than that its a pretty good phone. Camera is okay, not the best.",

If you want to get on the net, you better have deep pockets. They charge more then any other company I know of. I did however drop mine in the can once and after drying out, it was fine. I just dont like the touch screen or the service.",
