I put several drops of the oil on cotton balls and placed it in the areas around my house where we typically have a mouse problem. So far so good. But the winter isn\u2019t here yet so not totally sure which is why the 4 star rating. Also diluted it and used as a spray to keep grandma\u2019s cat out of certain areas in her house. It is a great option to have something I can use that has a pleasant smell.",
