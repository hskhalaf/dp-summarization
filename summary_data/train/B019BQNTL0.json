Note, I wore it over my running pants so it wasn't directly on skin. I accidentally ordered 2 by accident and my husband tried one. He's also overweight and it rubbed a bit on his stomach because he wore it directly on skin, so I suggest wearing this over a shirt to prevent rubbage if you're heavier. Fits my iPhone 6 and keys no problem!",

I wear this belt when i run intervals and long distance - if i want to listen to music. By the way, i put the phone in airplane mode and listen to music downloaded to my playlists. So little radiation ... important especially for long runs. So, overall 5 stars.",

You need to practice putting in your phone in and out but once you get the dance down, it's easy and should avoid accidental drops. LOVE the second pocket, and works well in front (for frequent access) or back. Back is great but if your run too much and lose your backside it might bounce a bit.",

I like to take my phone out to take pictures while I\u2019m running but I\u2019m always paranoid about my keys falling out. With this I can put my keys in the small pocket so my phone is by itself. The size is really good. It fit my iPhone 11 (including case) with room to spare. The belt is made with quality elastic so it is comfortably snug. It doesn\u2019t bounce but it also doesn\u2019t feel too tight. I am very happy with it overall.",
