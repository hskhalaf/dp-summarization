      "text": "I did not expect to enjoy using these Swim Gloves as much as I do. I'm a 71-year-old \"Lap\" Swimmer & find swimming to be an excellent overall workout for me. I decided to try these to improve my upper body strength & water resistance conditioning. They are terrific & give me all the resistance needed. They're very comfortable to wear, well made & I've already noticed a difference in conditioning since I started using them. I previously tried the \"Agility Hand Paddles\" & hated them, as they were uncomfortable to use & did not allow me the smooth stroke I was looking for. These Speedo Aqua Fit Training gloves are perfect for me!!!",

I have small wrists and the very end of the strap does not touch the pad on the wrist part, and that is the only part of the closure strap that flips up when I am swimming.

    "title": "Speedo Aqua Fit Swim Training Gloves",
    "description": "A Neoprene glove with webbed fingers and a rubber palm with adjustable wrist closure and ultra flexible webbing for use during water resistance training. Helps create smoother movement in the water for a more comfortable upper body workout. They also add propulsion through the water. Ideal for water aerobics and pool workouts.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSpeedo's Aquatic Fitness Gloves provide increased resistance in water for greater toning and strengthening of muscles and cardiovascular exercise for your heart and lungs. Made from neoprene, the gloves feature webbed fingers, a rubber palm, and adjustable wrist closure. You'll get smoother movement in water for a more comfortable upper body workout and increased propulsion through the water. \n\n About Speedo\nIn 1914, Speedo was founded in Australia by Alexander MacRae, a 22-year-old Scottish immigrant who arrived in the country in 1910. The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, \"Speed on in your Speedos.\" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn\u2019t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it\u2019s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.\n\n Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.\n\n Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today. Many world class athletes who wear Speedo include U.S. phenomenon Michael Phelps, legendary Australian swimmer Grant Hackett, world record holder Kosuke Kitajima from Japan, and Holland\u2019s Inge de Bruijn.\n\nWhat's in the Box?\nTwo neoprene Speedo Aqua Fit Training Gloves",
