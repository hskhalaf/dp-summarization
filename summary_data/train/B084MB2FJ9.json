I don\u2019t get it, but it really, really does what it\u2019s supposed to and I was skeptical that it would hold because of the material, no wire, no silicone strip, etc. They\u2019re up where they should be, no digging into my skin anywhere, and this small section slightly gathered in the middle creates a natural separation so I don\u2019t look like I\u2019m toting around a pressed ham.

However, the pads for the bra are very weird. They are small, hard, and poke out, making it look unflattering for my chest. The actual pads for the bra do not look like they do in the picture. They are removable, which I'm guessing is the reason for the weirdness. I also don't want to wear it without padding because I need the support.",
