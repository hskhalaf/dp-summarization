The same thing happened. I used a 10 gauge 50 foot extension cord. I don't think I did anything wrong.",

I had already rented a larger jackhammer and knew it would be to heavy to lift in and out of the holes. I was looking for something lighter, but could still get the job done. What is nice about this product is that it has turned out to be very useful on the farm, and I find myself using it far more than I thought. It comes in handy for breaking up concrete, trenching in our rocky soil and digging holes to plant trees. Everyone that uses it loves it.",

Me and my crew ran it for a week straight busting up a slab and everyone was pleased with the performance. Not as hard hitting as the bigger Brute unit but still a great tool for the size.",
