      "text": "For the past 9 years I have had intermittent itchy skin that is not season dependent and unrelieved with scratching. It has gotten so bad, I have left scars on my legs from scratching so much. I have tried dozens of lotions and body washes including Cetaphil, Dove, Eucerin, Vaseline, CeraVe, Nivea, Suave, and other Aveeno products. Nothing has consistently kept the itching away until I found the combination of Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Body Wash and Moisturizing Lotion. With daily to every other day use, my legs have improved tremendously. I have chosen many products with no fragrance and oatmeal, but something about this combination has been a lifesaver.",

I have tried about 20 lotions for everyday use for when I get out of the shower. Some are sticky, too greasy, too thin, too thick, don't last long, have a strong scent, etc... Aveeno works great and is affordable. It absorbs quickly into the skin and you don't have to wait 15 minutes to put your clothes on afterward. It doesn't have a scent, which is my preference. I just hope they don't go changing the formula anytime soon. That seems to happen to me when I find something I like. :)",

Several of the products that were in packaging had been knocked right out and were bouncing around loosely. In addition, the plunger on the Aveeno was broken and mostly out of its package as well, most likely from being tossed around the box which was bigger than the items it contained. Tried the product by opening the bottle and wiping some of the product on my hands. Nice. Decided that I will have to order another bottle so that I can have one with a plunger that works.",
