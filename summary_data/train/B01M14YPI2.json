The trainer itself doesn\u2019t reach from my bra strap to my pants like others have. So I have to decide where I need it more. The stitching along the inside is also uncomfortable. The treads rub me and itch! So when I take it off there are red marks.",

I chose this waist trainer because the description said it was for long torsos. Unfortunately, it isn't long and to make things worse the hook and eye closure doesn't go all the way to the top on either side which causes the top and bottom of the cincher to fold down about an inch on both top and bottom making it even shorter on me and very uncomfortable.",

      "text": "My waist is 36, I bought the Medium and it fits comfortably enough that I wear it to work all day. It gives a great sinch in the waist because the latex is very strong. I've only been wearing it now for 1 week; so far I do not see any results as yet but just having it on, helps me to be more aware of my abdominal muscle, so I tend to contract them more in my daily activities. In doing so, I'm sure I'll have of a \"trimmer\" waist in a few months. I'm very excited to see the end results; fingers crossed!! I own 3 waist trainers....this is the best one! I love it. Great product.",

I was supposed to get an XL according to my waist (34.5\") but I'm used to wearing a tight fitting trainner so I went for the Mdeium like another user recommended. It works perfectly. I have it on the first setting and it wasn't too bad putting it on. I had to lay down the first time but it's getting easier every day. The smell wasn't too bad. I didn't wash it, just laid it on the back of my rocking chair for a day. My fingers smell pretty latexy after snapping it on but no one else can smell it. Will buy the next size down as I get smaller.",

Goaling to get to 26\" not just with this, but this to help shape. Great find, very solid material and hooks!",

It does get alittle bendy but I don't know how that can't be avoided when you're sitting and moving in it but it does the job for sure. If you're like me and don't want to spend a fortune on something like this I'd go with this type. You definitely benefit from the material itself because it's that rubbery type that gets warm when you wear it and helps with water weight. I did all the research like alot of other people but no matter what brand you go with they're not magic but this WILL suck you in and keep your stomach tight.",

The sizing chart is also a little off, I went by it and even on the smallest set of hooks I can fit my whole arm down it. Compared to other ones priced the same on amazon this is the best.",

It\u2019s very comfortable and you can stand to keep it on for hours without it being painful. I\u2019m 5 feet 2 173lbs I ordered the large which is my size and if fit at the last hook. That\u2019s great because your suppose to work your way up to the last hook that\u2019s how you know your making progress. This was also extremely affordable and well worth the money would purchase again.",

      "text": "I bought 2 of these Lady Slim garments. One in 2xs, and the other in xs hoping to wear the larger one, then be able to fit the smaller one. i will wear neither, as the SMELL is like jet fuel. I have left them outdoors to air out, but to no avail. I have had trouble before with 3rd party sellers on Amazon. It is a bid deal to send back and there usually is an argument. These 2 'shapers' will be donated. Don't think I will order anything else if not from Amazon directly.",
