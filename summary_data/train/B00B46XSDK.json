Quality of images is very good, but remembering where each setting is located in the \"unending\" menus and various knob positions makes high quality, impromptu photos difficult. Always focused, but aperture/shutter/effects get wonky without tweaking settings. If you have the time to memorize all the settings locations, this camera rocks. Casual, posed photos or still life/landscape ones come out spectacularly. Takes amazing sunset and cloudy sky photos. The shafts of light are well defined and make your shots look professional.",

It allows me to really zoom in to pick up the details on an installed piece of equipment to be able to see how it is mounted and installed. I can even pick off mfgrs part numbers without needing a ladder or manlift. The photos are acceptable but maybe not good enough for marketing brochures. That might also be due to my complete lack of ability. I use it in automatic mode so maybe there is a way to use the manual settings and get better results. EDIT: 4/18/2015 _ Camera started giving \"Lens Control Error\" and is unusable. Warranty expired last month. $250 for a years use.",

I'm a semi-pro who mostly shoots RAW (which this camera does), but occasionally I need quick shots that don't need post-processing. The Fujifilm EXR900 delivers. The noise reduction is well handled with little smearing up to ISO 800. I can shoot highly usable raw shots at much higher ISOs. I find the handling of this camera much better than the really tiny ones. There's a nice front grip. The menu is easy to navigate, too.",

Fuji is very familiar with the \"lens stuck open\" problem and will offer to fix it for $80 to $130. A failure message appears \"TURN OFF THE CAMERA AND TURN ON AGAIN\" - over and over, regardless of replacing the battery or memory card. This camera will likely fail you too.

The pictures this camera takes are eye watering. Crisp shots and does well in low light also. I couldn't be more happy. The wireless upload works great too.",
