      "text": "This bike shelf quality is very good, very solid I 150LB sit above not askew, screw tool is very complete, also very easy to assemble, the only bad is the assembly tool after the use of hexagonal tools are worn out quickly round it! Overall it's still a good shelf, so I'll give it 5 stars and hope to improve the assembly tool. If someone buys or does not have the improvement tool, I will change the comment to one star thanks!",

I don\u2019t rate 5 stars because couple washers and a nut were missing in the package and when I contacted Westgirl they never answer back.
