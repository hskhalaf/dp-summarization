The mount that came with the monocular to attach a phone was not quite what I was expecting. It did not consistently hold my phone in place. So I contacted the company, and promptly they replied and sent me an upgraded replacement which sells on Amazon for about $18. This was sent at no cost.

Surprisingly, he seems to have a lot of fun with it. He already took a bunch of good pictures of the backyard animals (birds, ducks, squirrels etc.) with his iPhone. The monocular is made with good quality, and very stable with the phone, and the picture is quite clear. And he even started teaching my 7-year-old son how to use it, and they both are enjoying it quite much. Will definitely put it into more use, like traveling, camping, going to concert etc.",
