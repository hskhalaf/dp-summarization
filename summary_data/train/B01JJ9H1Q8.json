There wasn't enough flour left for rolling things out so had to use other that I already had. Other than maybe needing to use a little less than called for, I believe this worked really well.",

Your pancakes won't ever taste the same:) and this flour seems to have some difficulties in biding, making crepes is challenging because they are not as solid and break easily...but what woudln't we do to eliminate gluten right?",
