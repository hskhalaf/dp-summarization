I took off one star because it is noisy on opening and adding/changing discs. Sitting the same distance from this changer as from the Technics, you could not hear the Technics when it changed discs. So far, plays very well, with very good sound. We use our OPPO 103's when playing individual discs, but use the Sony when doing something that would make it inconvenient to change out 1 disc at a time. Other than the noise, we have experienced none of the trouble mentioned in some of the other reviews.",

Higher end more expensive units will give you better fidelity, but for the average listener, the sound quality produced by this unit is fine. For the money, this model is a good deal.

The new player is lighter, noisier when changing discs, and has more economically-made buttons and switches. If anyone knows who may help me repair my old unit (it now fails to recognize any discs and continues to move through all five disc positions), please let me know.",

I play a lot of dubbed CDs (from cassette tapes), so some of the minor glitches could also be there -- mostly drop-out of one channel at the very beginning, and not consistent. So-- cannot blame it on the machine; otherwise very pleased with it.",

This unit was purchased for a second audio=only system and surprised with with its flexible features. It's no high-end deck by any means but sometimes you need to step back from the fancy DACs and transports and realize CD technology is so mature, just about everything you buy is going to sound good.",

My Pioneer CD lived a long life of 20 years and met an unexpected and sudden demise, as some of us will.",

You can no longer purchase players with the magazine cartridge feature and I wasn't prepared to replace my entire stereo system. The receiver and speakers are still working. The Sony player fits perfectly in my existing stereo cabinet and looks like it belongs there. The only negative is that the remote control does not have volume control buttons. Overall a great player at a great price.",
