I had to cut from both sides due to the width, but it did amazingly well. It's pretty light weight for how powerful it is. Absolutely love it !!",

Worried that the chainsaw would be unable to cut completely through some 6 - 7 inch diameter branches - wow was I wrong. It cut through like a knife through warm butter. When using fully extended on the pole - it's surprisingly sturdy, making it easy to pin-point the branches I want to cut down. It is heavy. After cutting 1- or 12 branches that were right at 10 feet above the ground, I could feel the weight. This saw is very nicely built, easy to set up and use, and balances nicely when cutting. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "This saw has delivered. It cuts through 3-4\" diameter branches with no problem. Cutting pampas grass does pull some live grass into the chain / interior, requiring occasional breaks to stop and pull it all out. The chain saw attaches / detaches from the pole easily, and is very rigid when attached. It is a bit of a workout, especially if you are using it to cut parallel to the ground. As mentioned in other reviews if you can rest the saw blade on the branch you are cutting, the weight is much more manageable. The chain oil reservoir seems to be tight/leak free, which hasn't been the case with other chain saws I've owned, so I'm glad of that.",
