It keeps things tidy and organized, instead of various wands all over the floor. And the real bonus is, the wands are standing up, stick side down into the slots so the ribbons, feathers and other dangling \u2018toy\u2019 portions of the wands are in a position where my cats can play with the dangling bits on their own, as well, without knocking over the stand. High quality item, would highly recommend.",

However... rubber cane tips have trouble being inserted and canes or tall umbrellas are a bit unwieldy for the height of the stand and tend to pull it over since roughly 70% of the weight is at the top. This will also not fit inverted or compact umbrella widths easily. I\u2019ll be looking for a more substantial and generous holder in the future. This one requires too much precision and care to place or remove a cane or umbrella without knocking it over.",
