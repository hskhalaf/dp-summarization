My 6 week old son has never slept so peacefully through the day than when he was in the wrap! It fits well, is made of really nice material (soft, stretchy, and sturdy), and comes with both paper and CD instructions! I'm already wondering how I made it thru 6 weeks without this glorious wrap! My husband wanted to try it right away when he got home and loved it as well! This is a great product and well worth your money!",

Also, when Baby is screaming, it feels like it takes forever to put on. Pros: Baby loves being in it. Even if she's screaming, she will almost always settle down within about 5 minutes of being put in it. And then she usually falls asleep in it. Sometimes it seems almost magical.",
