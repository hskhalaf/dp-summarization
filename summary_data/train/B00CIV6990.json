There is a new up date so I do not know my steps and if I do not snap the fitbit every night, it will no longer record my sleep patterns. So no mileage, no sleep info and I wonder why I am wearing it. I have uninstalled it on my phone to see if the old fitbit program was interfering and reinstalled it. That did not help.",
