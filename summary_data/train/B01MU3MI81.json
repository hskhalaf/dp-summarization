Our experience is in line with reports about the potential dangers associated with these masks. I regret purchasing them.",

I had to rip off the mask and fight for my life. I was in DEEP TROUBLE. Just made it back to shore. I will never use this mask again. VERY DANGEROUS!!!",

The other issue was that the snorkel mask leaked around the edges despite being sized correctly. The glass did not fog and the vision was clear but the water leaking was a deal breaker as the whole point is for it to keep the water out. I returned the item due to it not working, and ended up using my snorkel that just prevents water from entering.",

I have a short beard and didn't have any water leak in. The mask never fogged up. The only thing, which you just have to get used to, when the snorkel part goes under water, it immediately cuts off the air supply, which is a good thing, so you don't get a bunch of water. Its just a little surprising when this happens.",

Both my husband and I found the Seaview 180 to feel cheaper than the Aleoron mask. The silicone around the face didn't feel as smooth and fit as nicely as the Aleoron mask, and the mask just felt like lesser quality. The Aleoron mask gave a wider, clearer panoramic view, and also filters UV rays and gives a polarized more colorful view underwater. I also had an easier time breathing with the Aleoron mask. So while the Seaview 180 mask will get the job done, the Aleoron mask, in my opinion is a more enjoyable mask to use.",

I bought the larger size and have a slight drip. The wife cannot wear it all. Also, I was surprised that the straps were an elastic cloth instead of rubber. I don't know how that will wear over time in salt water immersions. Lastly, I wish the snorkel was slightly longer. You have to stay right on the surface.",

This mask fixes all of that. If the mask leaks a little, or water gets in through the snorkel, it collects down by the chin, and clearing it just involves lifting your head from the water and exhaling. Since the air intake comes across the mask before inhaling, a little water from a rogue wave goes right by instead of down my throat. A ball valve atop the snorkel keeps most water out though.

Im definitely a novice and had several miserable touristy trips using cheap masks. The cost of this mask is a small price to pay to actually enjoy your snorkeling trip! Used to snorkel twice sofar and I will definitely make room for this in my bag on every trip now! At one point I did get some water in the mask. Due to the great seal the water stayed in the mask but never seemed to get in my mouth, it remained near my chin if upright or close to the glass if horizontal.",

It allowed me to completely get rid of the phobia of feeling like I am suffocating with a regular snorkel (seems like I am not the only one like that). 2. I use it just for swimming because it allows me to concentrate on the moves instead of worrying about taking breaths. Especially when I do butterfly. 1 minor reason - it looks cool. Keep in mind that this mask is designed mostly for surface snorkeling. I not a pro and I was able to dive in this mask approximately 6-7 feet with no problems. After few adjustment it became pretty tight and wasn't leaking much.",

I love looking at the marine life but have an instant panic attack everytime I get in the water with a regular snorkel and mask. This worked perfectly. No panic. I could breath naturally without fear of getting water in my mask and choking on it. I would highly recommend if you struggle with snorkeling. I'm soooo happy with it. I will be purchasing another one for my husband so he no longer has to worry about his mustache breaking the mask seal. I highly recommend this product!",

My viewscreen ended up getting scratched early after I purchased it or I would have returned it. Keep it is a protective bag when not using. Great view and keeps water out.
