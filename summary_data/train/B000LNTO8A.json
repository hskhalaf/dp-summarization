So I bought this auger, and attached it to a cordless drill. It was the easiest thing in the world to use that to break up the earth - drill down, to about 24\"; remove the auger by reversing the drill; repeat the process a couple of inches away. The soil was easy to dig up after that. The auger is very solidly-built. Even after recent use, it still looks as-new. Money well spent.",

It's designed that way just like any spade or drill bit that is not rated for impact. If it was squares it has a high possibility of breaking your drill chuck teeth of worse burning your motor. As you can see it bored through rock, at the expense of a lot of battery power but it did it, just wanted to prove it could. I have a 20v DeWalt. And yes I used it to put up an entire fence, not for plants. 5 holes to every pole and the dirt comes up easy.",

Highly recommended, but you will need a powerful corded, not cordless, drill if you have hard ground. We waited until after a full week of rain to soften up the soil, and it was still hard. We have very hard clay-based soil so this was a tough test for this tool and it held up. I expected it to break as a result, but was surprised it lasted. Probably will plant some more because it was so easy!!!!",

The auger flute is welded onto the shank at three points. I preemptively welded a few other spots, but that may not be necessary. The result is that this soil auger works quickly, and in fact better than I had expected.",
