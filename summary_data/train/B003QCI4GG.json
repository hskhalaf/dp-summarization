I don't know how people could even stand more than 30 seconds inverted, it's quite an intense ankle pain. I guess if you don't care to go all the way back and only slightly back where it won't strain the ankles, this would work well... but if you are planning to go all the way back (nearly completely upside down) it will hurt the ankles so much that your body will tense very hard which I doubt is accomplishing any good.",

Good inversion tables are so balanced at the time that you get in it all you have to do is put your arms back to start falling backwards this thing you put your arms all the way back and you don't even move you have to really push yourself with the handlebars to even get your started. Which is not good at all. Do not buy. I'm returning mine.",

It stretches your lumbar and I suggest to go easy at first with the 30 degree angle and after a period of time adjust it if needed. I don't need to use it every day but do so about 3-4 times a week. It might take a longer time for me to see a major reduction in pain because my back has been very bad for a lot of years and it may take prolonged use of it to see a very positive cessation of pain in my sciatica. All in all it works and the price is right.",

Your foot and ankle just aren't designed to support that weight and this thing is too cheap to include a proper support system. still a decent buy. overall this and the boots is 140.",

If you cut it into two squares it really helps make this table more comfortable. The rounded cups that lock against the lower legs (just above the ankle) just aren't padded enough, but these improvised pads made all the difference. As far as construction, it was easily to put together in about an hour, with a minimal amount of improvisation. Happy hanging!",
