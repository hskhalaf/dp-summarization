My combination no longer works on any of them and the TSA open indicator is showing. The one lock that was not opened by the TSA still works but the others are now junk. What good is a combination lock if the combination stops working whenever the TSA touched it??",

Disadvantages: 1) They only use three digits. I would prefer a four digit lock Overall, I would highly recommend these locks.",

Some cool features like the red pop-out indicator that tells you if TSA opened it with their key (that resets automatically when you \"legitimately\" open it with the combination), and the feature that forces TSA to relock the lock rather than being sloppy about it as they all too often are (they can't take their key out till they relock it).",

At the same time I also bought a pair of these locks from Forge (same price). Forge works similarly, but to reset the red indicator, the lock must be opened using the 3-number code you programmed into it. So TSA cannot reset it. That makes Forge a better lock IMHO.",

The only thing I wish I had considered when buying the 4 pack is that we have to make certain to store the locks separately. Since they are all the same color, it\u2019s impossible to identify each person\u2019s lock.",

The \"open alert\" popup is a nice touch...that is typically not a regular feature in these kinds of locks. The price is just great. Now let's see how they withstand the hardships of travel!",
