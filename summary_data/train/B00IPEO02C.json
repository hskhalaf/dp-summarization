Be prepared to spend a longtime syncing the crockpot to the Wemo App. The WEMO App is not good, needs a serious upgrade and tweaking. Also on the app you can set the schedule for cooking but it does not turn off or shut off at the scheduled time, it stays on warm. So you need to setup an extra timer to remind your self to shut it off. Learned my lesson by cooking chicken all night long. Giving 4 stars because of the time it took to sync it to the WEMO app and the cooking time feature.",

Wi-fi setup was mostly a breeze. The unit connected easily to my smartphone (Android) and the WeMo app. It also updated its firmware automatically. While I like the product, I am disappointed that there is no way to set a rule for a more complex cooking schedule. For example, I have a recipe that needs the crock-pot to cook for 1 hour on high followed by 3 hours on low. Right now, there is no way to set this up using the WeMo app.",

It's sleek looking, non-stick and fits a whole chicken. I love the wi-fi (phone app is called WEMO) capability and it is easy to use. I would recommend this to family and friends.",
