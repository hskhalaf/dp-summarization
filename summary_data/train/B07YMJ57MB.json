      "text": "This is all you need to know. Google WON'T allow you to separate the 2 wifi bands (2.4ghz and 5ghz). They \"intelligently\" select the best band for your devices. However, this means it almost always directs the 2.4ghz band (stronger band, but GROSSLY slower download speeds) to devices that are not right next to the router. This is ridiculous. I saw reduced speeds in all my 802.11ac devices around the house (2019 iPad Pros, Apple Macbook Pros, Mac Mini's, Windows PC's, everything). Typical speeds on my previous network with 4-year old router (anywhere in the house) = 244 Mbps Speed on Google Nest router (if more than 10 feet from router) = 40Mbps Returned this garbage right away.",

I made the right choice. It was easy set up and get full bars all the way up to the second floor. Yeh, it's pricier than your average router, but you get what you paid for. it's a miracle!!!!

The signal is strong throughout the whole house now, utilizing both routers wirelessly. If you need multiple ethernet connections out of the router, you can add a switch to achieve that.

So far it is working extremely well and the installation was not that difficult using the Google Home app. It helps if you have some familiarity with the app, and you do have to add each router to the Home app as an individual device but they sync up on their own to determine which one is the master. It has definitely extended the wifi range around my home (3000 sq ft) and even into the backyard for about 30 ft. Wifi speeds are much faster than the original router from the cable company.
