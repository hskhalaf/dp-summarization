Price was steep but had already had 2 previous bluetooth earphone sets fail (will charge up but don't switch on). So all is good for 2 months; sound excellent, holding in the ears good. Then go to start my workout & surprise, press the button & they will not turn on. Considered I might have left them on so needed charging; plugged in and left them for half and hour. Come back and light is white. Try to turn on & nothing! Just like the cheap-as-chips earphones they lasted a couple of months but in this case I'm out 80 quid!",
