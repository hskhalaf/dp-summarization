I was afraid the water would collect in the chimney but it did not. While his arms kept him from going all the way down and he more or less leaned backwards he always rose back up. Fun decoration and will look forward to next year",

Glad I have a bunch from previous decorations. Santa only goes partly down the chimney. Previous version I had put some weights on the bottom to help pull him down. Sadly missing and needed here. Looks decent...but the missing parts and Santa not performing are drawbacks.",

Instead of Santa going up and down he stays inflated the whole time and ends up flopping over the side of the chimney. Save your money and buy one from a higher quality manufacturer.",
