      "text": "I ordered two of these leashes in late August. I was looking for an inexpensive longer leash for my two small dogs so my 87-year old mother could let the dogs outside without having to go out herself. They weren't exactly well-made, but served the purpose for a short while. The other day I was using one and the button broke off of the clip, so now I can't use it. I guess I got what I paid for. My advice is to pay a little more and get a nicer leash.",

      "text": "Nice lead that's well constructed with good materials. It's definitely for a small pet, but the brass component is a little large and heavy, weighing down the connection on the harness of an eleven-pound cat. The upside is that it's well made and doesn't stop the cat from roaming within it's 10-foot limit, but that's why four stars instead of five. It's gently used and the webbing has held up without fraying. The hand loop is comfortable without scratchy glue spots or fraying that occurred with other leads. It's never exposed to water, so consider a waterproof lead if that's your situation.",

This appears to be standard on all leads. I have remedied this by adding a second clasp. I'd rate this 5 stars if it had a double clasp.
