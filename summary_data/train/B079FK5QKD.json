Seriously, why not think about the little things like this? While I haven't even used the pillow yet, this negative experience instantly brings down the reputation and quality of the product.",

I decided to take a chance on this one after it was described as soft by so many reviewers. I'm glad I did. It *is* soft enough for stomach and side sleeping, but it's firm enough to support my head and neck. It doesn't get excessively hot like so many memory foam products do, either.",
