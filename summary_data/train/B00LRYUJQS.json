So not only did I waste money on this little \"gem,\" I also had to go out and buy a new wireless mouse.",

THREE MONTH FOLLOW UP: The device is more delicate than anticipated and I have had problems with it connecting and disconnecting from the USB port if lightly touched. On several occasions this has corrupted my USB drive that was hooked into the hub. The housing is in two pieces and not glued together. It comes apart very easily. I can no longer recommend this product due to its poor build quality.",

I wish they would make the same design in a superior product. Certainly, it is better to pay more for something that will last and not give you total frustration.

Oh, and their model names on Amazon match about 40 different USB devices on their drivers portion of their site, so which one will it be? Downloaded several drivers, none worked. Save your money.

I was able to fix this by adding a small drop of super glue onto each peg before putting it back together. It really isn't that big an issue, but considering the product is brand new, I didn't expect to have to fix the casing. Aside from that, it's been a great product thus far and I'd still reorder it if I need another USB hub.",

WORKS FLAWLESSLY on an Acer Chromebook, as well as Lenovo ThinkPad. Kinda flimsy construction, but worth the low price if you are just a casual user.",
