I know I will end up buying each toy from Toy Story 3, a set of the larger ones would have been nice. I will update this review if this product doesn't meet my expectations for durability. As an online shopper I rely heavily on reviews left by others when trying to decide what to buy so I try to leave useful reviews for those products that I feel strongly about. Please let me know if you find my review helpful. Thanks so much!",

This is the only one of the three I bought I am okay with, even like it. He is small, and my son complains, but otherwise, he's fine. He's definitely durable. His tail detaches like in the movie, and so does one of his back legs. He has a button on the back that makes him talk, he has the classic lines. Best one of the Amazon Exclusive bunch, especially since currently you can not get Rex from the Disney Store (otherwise I probably would)",
