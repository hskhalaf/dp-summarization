I had to keep restarting it like 15 times almost to the point where I turned it off. Im suspecting the value shooting out the gas is crappy.

      "text": "Just what we wanted! It took about 30 minutes to put together. We enjoy the ambiance of the fire, and it gives off some heat, but not like a wood fire. It has a striker knob and lights quickly. The ledge around the pit is about 9\" wide. Comes with a plastic cover. Good price. Arrived within 2 days, no damage.",
