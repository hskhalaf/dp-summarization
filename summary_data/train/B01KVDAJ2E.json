Equipped with plugs - just plug them in and power them up. The rainbow of colors makes them great as you can leave them up unnoticed ( very small but bright ) year round, and can change the color for the different holidays. You also have the option to adjust the brightness and powering them off and on ( via remote) . Makes the pain of untangling old strings of Christmas lights an ease to the the curb .....",
