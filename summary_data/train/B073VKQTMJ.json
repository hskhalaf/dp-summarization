The only bump I ran into was first installing it, you need to tie a knot in the rope over the adjuster. This prevents the rope from slipping and lowering it when putting your feet on it. It's a great purchase and really makes a difference in my legs and feet. Although sometimes it may relax me a little too much because I have started to doze a few times while using this!",

I moved offices and unfortunately lost one of the clamps. I reached out to the customer service dept to see if they sold them individually. They replied back fairly quickly and advised that at that time they weren't selling the clamp separately, but that they were happy that I was so pleased with the product, and sent a brand new hammock, at NO cost! Being in a customer service role myself, I can certainly appreciate receiving good customer service. Thank you again for all your help!",
