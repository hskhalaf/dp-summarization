Now I either get 4 false alarms everyday with low sensitivity, med range or I get people knocking on my door with no warning, low sensitivity, low range. Tried every combination of settings. Have been very disappointed with this. Wish I knew he was going to sell out, would have bought a couple of spares. The false alarms were to much, I now keep it at the low setting and it does let me know about 1 out of 5 times when someone comes up.",

I put ours up with a bungee cord on a tree... and frankly, I'd just as soon leave it that way. Tilting it slightly also helped it to get the coverage and readings I wanted.

The old one gave out two loud buzzes that I could hear when I was at the other end of our ranch-style house. This one I can barely hear two rooms away.

      "text": "I was dubious as to whether this would work in a mailbox, especially a metal one. I was planning to drill a hole in the back of the metal mailbox and extend the antenna to a quarter wavelength....The mailbox is about 150 feet from the front of the house and is made of steel (responds to magnet). .The back faces the house, and the front, the street. On the first test, I put the sensor in the back of the box, and it worked when opening the box door....set off the alarm in the house with closed front door. Didn't need to extend the antenna outside the box. It works great.",

To be fair, I am in my 60's and like all old individuals, I have some hearing loose when it comes to higher pitch sounds and this system emits a very high pitch tone. As it is, this is functional for me only if I'm sitting one specific chair in my living room. I'm looking for something different.",

Replacing the batteries are not easy on the motion sensor, if it was easy, anyone who knows you have one of these could disable the device. So, I understand why you must unscrew the senormous tof replace the batteries. Since I purchased the full set, I have purchased two more outdoor motion sensors for this item. The only warning I think I need to give is make sure there are no plants or other outdoor itemseating that might move in the wind, this will set the alarm off. I placed one down my driveway, one along the walkway to my house and one near my workshop in my backyard.",

      "text": "I bought this same product 12 years ago, at that time, it went under a different name, (Reporter), it worked great until the last year when the sensor would only pick up movements within 6 feet. Since the Chamberain replaced the Reporter, I went ahead and ordered this one. This unit works just as great as the Reporter did. So far, I've used it for almost 3 months, sensed every vehicle & animal that went by, very few false alerts, probably from moths or butterflies flying right next to the sensor. A new added feature with this one was the adjustable volume and an on/off button. I'd def purchase this same model when the time comes.",

As far as I know it has detected all the people and vehicles entering and leaving my driveway. I am very happy with my purchase.

The system didn't pick up in my house while on battery power but I did not have new batteries installed so that conclusion is irrelevant. My only concern about this system is the lack of options for the audible alarm. The alert tone itself isn't very loud and no other tones are offered.",
