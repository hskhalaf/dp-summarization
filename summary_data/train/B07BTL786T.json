These are decent, functional headphones that never fall out. Slightly fiddly to recharge, but they work well and the sound quality is good. Edit: 12 mnths later. Still going strong. Battery lasts a week. Recharges in 2 hours. Bluetooth syncs easily with iphone. Excellent product.",

These connect automatically like I'd assumed they would, I use them for walking/jogging in the mornings. They sit solidly on the head thanks to the sprung metal band, height adjustable and the sponge is comfortable. A Retro throwback to the 80's Walkman headphones. The Good: Battery life, Sound quality, lightweight, Clear phone calls, Google assistant, Quick bluetooth connect. The Bad: No volume control on headset, Charging port awkwardly placed. The Ugly: they're orange.",

This hasn't happened with other bluetooth headphones. There is also an audible sibilant hiss when in operation, which is clearly audible. The online instructions say that the headphones need 40 hours of play to settle in, but i can't see that putting sonic improvements in that are already missing. I would strongly suggest avoiding altogether.",

My orders from Amazon are usually much more snug than that.",

I prefer over-the-ear headphones because I find earbuds uncomfortable, but all the ones I had bought before were big, heavy and clunky. These headphones are lightweight, fit comfortably over the ear, stay on great, and have terrific sound. Even more impressive is the user experience. Instead of beeps and tones that you have to decipher, a real human voice tells you all the information as to connectivity, battery life, etc... The headphones also have a built in EQ mode for adjusting sound quality. With all the features, sound quality, and comfort into a low-cost package, these headphones are a terrific deal!!!",

The built-in mic works well for phone and Skype calls. Calls are kept private since nobody in the room but you can hear the other person on the call. Great for gaming too. :) CONS: There's no volume control or noise cancellation. Not a problem for me since I use my phone's and Skype's volume controls.

      "text": "I bought these to replace my Raycon earbuds (which ran about $120) and these are superior, in my personal opinion. Everyone needs headphones for something different. I use these for working in the kitchen. I can hear my music AND everything around me without either overpowering the other. They stay on my head and over my ears and if you're asking me I'll tell you they look cooler. I would buy these again.",

      "text": "So I got these for work. Partly for the retro factor, partly because it's just so damn hard to find wireless over-ear (instead of over-the-ear) headphones. They have shockingly decent sound quality for their price point and design. I can still hear everything around me, which is what I needed. You won't get pounding bass, but you shouldn't expect it with this style of headphone. I would definitely buy them again. Only real gripe: the charging port is difficult to get to; the included cable can barely fit it, and only if you force the earpiece pretty hard. It's a lot easier to get an Anker or Aukey cable in and out, since they have smaller plugs and rounded edges.",
