I ended up buying a Logitech Harmony 650 to put an end to the hassle of juggling so many remotes. Since the 650 doesn't have bluetooth I had to buy this adapter to get the pesky PS3 under my rule. The adapter works great and it's as easy to set us as the other devices. My only complaint is that it's kind of expensive. It's 50% more expensive than the PS3 remote. I deducted a star due to lack of value. Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase.",

Harmony will control the PS3 fine if you just put the PS3 into the Harmony configuration \"used\" as appropriate (for example, PS3 for games, PS3 for DVD...)

Depending on the Harmony remote, the interface to the PS3 buttons is different, I have a Harmony 1000, and it allows a simple switch between the {circle, triangle, X, square} buttons, and DVD-type {start/stop, pause, FF, rew...}. The other Harmony I have is an 880, and it has fixed buttons for DVD-type controls, with the PS3 buttons on the menu.",

Now I'm asking myself why the heck did I wait so long. I'm back to a single remote and love it. There is a slight lag from when you press a button to the action on the screen ( IR to Bluetooth) of maybe a half second, but you quickly adapt.",

This causes problems on browsing some websites like pandora. You cannot get to the play/pause or forward buttons at all. I talked with Logitech support and they dont have a solution for this. Also you will see multiple clicks so you need to take your hand of the remote controller buttons fast. Noticed this mostly on netfix movie controller.",

Everything in my home theater setup is on a decent surge protector (and nothing else was damaged), so I guess it just burnt out. Pretty frustrating that such a fairly expensive device (for what it does) died so quickly. Definitely my first negative experience with a Harmony (or even Logitech) product.",

The use of RF and Bluetooth is terribly clever and requires minimal setup. It also allows you to keep your PS3 outside line of sight (even in a cabinet!). If you've got a Harmony remote and a PS3, this product is a no-brainer. Kudos to Logitech.",

First off, I hate that it stuck out of the front ruining the experience, secondly when used with a Logitech Harmony it would often send multiple button presses for one press on the Harmony. This is the answer, and it's natively supported by the Harmony. Buy it.",
