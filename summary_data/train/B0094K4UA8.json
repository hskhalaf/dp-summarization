Trust in the Martin Logan brand; one of the top high-end speaker manufacturers in the world, and know you're getting a quality product. A good deal at $100 less than the B&W C5's and an even better deal at 52% off (Sorry for those who missed it)! Sound is subjective; but these vividly support a good range of music form Jazz, Classical to Classic Rock and Hip Hop. Try a pair out for yourself.",

They lack the bottom end I get with my other in-ears (that rhyme with pure). Tried each of the included tips, but just could not find the right one for the bottom end I was hoping for. If it's just a phone cord you want, these will work. But, if you are wanting the best clarity for music, these, for me, do not fit the bill.",

    "description": "Inspired by the sonic clarity and detail of our legendary electrostatic speakers, the Mikros 70 reference in-ear headphones deliver the realism, richness, and purity of sound that MartinLogan's discerning customers have come to expect. With superb ambient noise isolation, listening through the Mikros 70 is like having your own private MartinLogan listening room wherever you go. High quality materials and obsessive attention to detail are as much part of this new portable design as in our traditional loudspeakers. The Mikros 70 body is constructed from black anodized solid aluminum and sealed with metallic hyper black end caps to isolate ambient noise. A 90-degree gold-plated plug, tangle-reducing cable slider, and simple, yet durable, black rubberized cord dampen and isolate noise that can be transmitted through contact and movement, transmitting the most subtle nuances of recorded sound and nothing else. Included with each headphone is a compact carrying pouch to assure safe stowage when traveling. Each pair of Mikros 70 in-ear headphones include a variety of ear tips (3 sizes of bulb tips and 2 sizes of flange tips) for a comfortable, snug fit that isolates up to 97.8% of ambient noise and provides outstanding sound quality with deep, extended bass. Mikros 70's have an in-line remote and microphone that controls volume, play/pause, track selection, voice control, and allows seamless transitions between listening to music and phone calls on compatible Apple devices. The remote and microphone also function with a variety of smart phones, digital media players, and similar devices with a standard 3.5mm 4-conductor socket. Exact function of the remote will vary by make and model and MartinLogan cannot guarantee compatibility with specific brands or models.",
