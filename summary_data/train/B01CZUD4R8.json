The picture and audio are what I expected from any baby monitor, much clearer though than our old Samsung monitor and less expensive.

First, it's painfully clear this is a Chinese-designed and built system as it's on-screen messages such as \"Awaiting for Connecting\" when it's searching for a signal and \"Pairing is Succeed\" when it's pairing cameras. I have my camera on the wall about 7 feet from the ground and about 10-12 feet from my daughter, and the night vision's picture quality kinda sucks. I have a 2 story house and the base on occasion (yet seldomly) can struggle to maintain connection with the camera. Overall though, for what it does and what it costs, it's a great option. I would recommend this over any of the horrendously overpriced alternatives.",

Once it turned off, we fully charged it up again but the monitor wouldn't reconnect with the camera. We liked it until that happened. The picture quality is okay, there are certainly other monitors that have sharper images but for our purposes it did the job.",

This is our second one since our first one came apart after small fall. The power button then broke off and we could not shut it off. This of course meant we needed to constantly have it plugged into a power source. Overall I Highly recommend.",

The only complaint I have is the screen can occasionally cut out but it's just for a second then goes back to the normal screen. More of an annoyance than anything. I have nothing to compare this to as i'm a first time parent but I would recommend this and would buy it again over the fancy expensive ones anyday. Great clear picture and the battery life lasts a good while if you don't have the screen constantly on.",

The monitor was in another room, straight across from us, about 30 feet away. It kept disconnecting and would say \"Waiting for Connecting\" on the screen. I had to return and will have to keep looking for a monitor that can hold a connection through 2 closed doors.",
