But this was absolutely horrifying. Didn\u2019t wash them before I put them on the bed, cause I was too cheap to pay to to wash em, I\u2019ll never make that mistake again. After we noticed some itching, decided to wash them to see this. The sheets them self were good quality, but this has been a very expensive, disgusting, horrifying purchase. Don\u2019t buy these. Let this photo make you want to throw up and look elsewhere.",

I washed them in cold water and dried them on low, but still they pill. There are tiny crumbs everywhere, including on the bedroom floor. These sheets are not worth buying.

      "text": "Sadly, I can only say these were just a waste of my money. I washed and dried them upon receiving them using delicate/low heat cycles and they came out with many thread pulls. I didn't bother putting them on the bed because it seemed clear that they would quickly rip in those locations. I put them back in the box but it wasn't worth paying the postage to send them back. I am really disappointed in the quality. They were inexpensive but I can still think of other things I would rather have spent my money on than throwing my money away.",

Sheets appear to be of nice quality if they hadn't been stained apparently during the manufacturing process. Unfortunately, I did not open the package until after the 30 day return period so appear to be stuck with them. I have purchased Amazon Basic products/sheets in the past with no problem - hopefully Amazon is reading reviews of their product and address their manufacturing problem. I am a big Amazon fan and regularly purchase products from Amazon with very few problems so hopefully this is not a trend.",

The only beef I have with them is that they bunch up every night and have to be tucked in again. I ordered some cheap stretchy bed sheet straps for the corners which I heard really work well to hold them in place. Frosty lavender is exactly the same color which is refreshing. Pillowcases are standard with no pocket and no embellishment. I am pretty impressed though for the price.",

      "text": "They're inexpensive. They're very soft. They come with 2 pillowcases. The (cream) color is a great basic. They wash and dry well. That's the good stuff. The basic (major) problem with these sheets is the elastic on the fitted sheet. It has almost no \"grip\" to it. It's weak, and does not hold the bottom sheet firmly to the mattress. So they pull up off the sides, become very wrinkled and tend to bunch up in spots (like under your hips). In any case, they're okay as a second set of sheets, but to rate 5 stars, they need major improvement on the quality of the elastic.",

We needed sheets for new beds at a new house we purchased. The house was pricey so we needed something inexpensive that could cover the new bed. These sheets not only met they exceeded expectations. I simply love them. The cost/benefit ratio cannot be denied here. I enjoy them.",

If they somehow fall apart after a couple washes I'll edit the review. But for now we're considering buying another pair.",

My only critique is they\u2019re so slick, the cases slide off the pillow, but that\u2019s just being picky. They fit perfectly but never creep off the corners of my deep mattress.
