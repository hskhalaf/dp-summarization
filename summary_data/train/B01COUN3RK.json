Firstly, the best thing about these boots is that they do NOT slide down. I have owned numerous pairs of over-the-thigh boots, and always had to struggle with tieing them tighter throughout the night or altering them. I do not have that problem with these boots, and my legs are fairly slim (but muscular calves). They fit perfectly, with a bit of stretch to spare. Easy to walk in, comfy and sexy. Even lined with faux fur to keep your legs warm in the winter. :)",

It\u2019s not very noticeable and I think I can live with it, don\u2019t want to go through return and buy again process. If not this minor defect that would be solid 5 stars.",
