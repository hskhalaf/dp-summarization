The Whistle collar attachment attaches securely to the collar strap base, and the Whistle tracker device plugs into that. It\u2019s a solid fit. The tracker device is very lightweight and sits on my dog\u2019s back, so he doesn\u2019t even notice it\u2019s there. If you use more than one harness, you can order an additional collar strap base and collar attachment for a modest price directly from Whistle.",

It's been < 90 days so I wil have to return both under their risk free return policy. Tech Support also alerted me that since I purchased through Amazon, I may run into difficulty returning since > 30 days, even though Whistle's policy is 90 days.",
