He finished it much quicker than I thought, so for me it wasn't worth the $100 price tag at all only giving him a few hour challenge, but he loves it so that's what matters. It's got cool features for a lego item with the sides opening to reveal things inside and the head swiveling. Pretty cool, but for me I think it's not worth the price tag and should be bigger and more challenging.",

This feature of the kit was pretty surprising, put it over the top for me in an otherwise relatively mundane build. The 'torch door' opens when extending the torch but does not close when the torch is retracted, which seems kinda half-baked to me. The wiggly head more than compensates to me, a pretty great kit overall.",

I guess the complaint I have is, it can be completed in a few hours and wasn\u2019t very challenging. I have to take 1 star away, because I paid $32 an hour for the entertainment? I think completely LEGO sets, is a more expensive addiction than a narcotic habit. All being said, it was a blast and looks great!",
