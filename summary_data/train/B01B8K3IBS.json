      "text": "Construction of the bag seems to be fine. However, the location of the shoe compartment makes the bag unusable in my opinion. The zipper for the compartment is on the bottom of the bag. So, in order to get to the compartment you have to lay the bag on it's back. Additionally, if you have much in the main compartment of the bag, it's difficult to put shoes into the shoe compartment. The smaller compartments are helpful, I suppose, but none of them are really larger enough. The insulated compartments are a good idea, but not really big enough for a water bottle. All in all, very disappointed.",

It's shipped completely pressed and collapsed. The backpack was all wrinkled up and the edge of the top opening was bent badly. I had to stuff it with a lot of cloth for 2 days for its shape to look good.",
