      "text": "It took me two weeks to decide between sand/water or just a water table and I\u2019m VERY glad I chose this one! BUT let me be clear, if you have any kind of OCD and a small toddler think twice about this one. The sand and the water mix very easy and of course the toddler doesn\u2019t care how clean you\u2019d like the toy to stay.! One a good note, it looks to clean out very easy. Unboxing was easy and it was assembled in less than 20 minutes: the water plug was slightly difficult but no leaks!! My 1.5 year old has played with it almost all day now. Well worth the price and actually pretty therapeutic for me:)",

I like the plug in the bottom of the water part, makes it very easy to keep water out when you\u2019re not using it. The legs will buckle and fall out if you try to move it with both sand and water in it. All in all, it\u2019s a fun table, even if it\u2019s pricey.
