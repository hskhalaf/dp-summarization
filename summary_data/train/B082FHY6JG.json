My partner and I took turns for an hour, we tired out before it did! We tried each of the tips, each has very different experience, kinda like having a few different options in the one took. I can honestly say it\u2019s one of the best massages I\u2019ve ever had! The biggest surprise though was the case it comes in! It\u2019s incredibly nice!",

Highly recommend, but just be careful around bone and try not to go up on the neck too much as this is quite powerful.",

The six heads it comes with all have amazing uses and are incredibly versatile.
