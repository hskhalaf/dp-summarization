Also, the locking mechanism engages in three places across the opening, using a cam-style system that seems very solid. Finally, the opening piston works well but isn't overkill (it is relatively quiet). This was a great purchase.",

I wanted a simple and basic pistol safe (without having to charging, needing batteries, malfunctioning codes and fingerprints, etc) to secure in my car and in my house. The safe is a bit heavy, but still very portable and serves it purpose. I can take it to the range, secure it in my car, and attached the cable to my bed frame. It come with two key, just put the spare somewhere safe. it loses a star because the box is a bit heavy, but the lid seams thin, not proportionately thick/strong.",

As an instructor I was looking for something to securely transport and store my training firearms in and this product is perfect for that use. They look and feel solid and appear to be of great quality. I also feel like they are mush harder to defeat then some of the similar products on the market. I actually recommend them to my student for their personal use. I was able to put 2 full size handguns in them and a few mags (S&W M&P 40 Cal). The really are a great buy!!!",
