I spent a long time um-ing and ah-ing because so many people seem to struggle with sizing but i needn't have worried... on me at least, the fit was exactly right (I'm a uk size nine normally and by their size guide too). Now if only my joints worked as well as the shoes.",

Initial impressions: they looked good and seem to fit. However, running in them proved a different matter. They began to hurt as they do not provide enough cushioning on the soles. Very disappointed and I will be replacing them with more suitable running shoes. For this reason I cannot recommend them for anyone who wants to actually run.",
