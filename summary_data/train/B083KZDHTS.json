The bass is solid, and the battery life is impressive. Definitely better than the previous buds. I highly recommend them.

Sound only lacks deep bass (as most earbuds do). Turning on the ambient mode offers hearing to your surroundings. You can make it a slight pick up of surrounding of noises to hearing your neighbor's conversation across the street. They're comfortable enough and don't protrude from your ears like other more expensive ones. Great earbuds.",

I don't believe I should have to give the app permission to my calendar just to be able to listen to music with these ear buds. If you try and deny any permission they ask for, the app will not work. It's disappointing as I like the sound produced but I am not comfortable with the required permissions. Samsung should give us a choice on permissions, but instead I have to choose to return them.",

The nubs hold them firmly within the ear; I have never once had these fall out of my ears - which is a common problem for me with earbuds, especially those that don't go inside the ear. No active noise cancellation but the sound isolation is good enough in most scenarios. The ambient mode is great and I love that you can auto-enable that for phone calls. If you own a Samsung phone, these are a must-have, and I'd honestly recommend them even to those that have Pixel, LG or other phones.",
