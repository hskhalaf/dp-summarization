The hose connection didn't seem to work either. I went to home depot and bought a 1/2 in main line, a pressure regulator and a 1/2 in hose connection which cost me about 15 bucks all together. With the 1/2 in main line i get great pressure (too much in fact i needed a $2 regulator) . I installed this about a year ago and ever since my plants have been reaching for the sky.",

It does come with instructions and a proper connection to your hose. Have a hose washer ready though. The clips/stands could be longer or more rigid, but that's about the only complaint.

This became very problematic Having the sprinkler system on a timer. It would go unnoticed for a little while. The other issue that I ran into was that if you put too many heads on to the line, there will not be enough pressure with that small of tubing to allow water to get to the end",
