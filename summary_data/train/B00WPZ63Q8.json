My big 18 pound man brings a lot of litter jumping back through his car door, and the holes on this may just take care of it so easily. And it looks really nice and is of extremely high quality. It is a large mat as well. I am an absolute believer of the $40 litter mat.",

Even after washing it with special urine-cleaning products, bleach, sodium bicarbonate, etc. I tried to put it down again, but it just got peed on again. It's not worth $35. Maybe more like $20-25.

I won't say I haven't stepped on a single piece of litter but I'm doing so MUCH less frequently and this is while not sweeping the floor around it multiple times a day anymore. Between not having to sweep constantly and not stepping on litter nearly as much this thing is worth it's weight in gold.",

It is also thick enough that when you are by the box cleaning, loose litter does not get stuck to your shoes or knees. If you are not sure on how big to go, I would recommend the larger size as my cats are slobs around the box. We use this one for the mud room box and purchased to jumbos for the other two boxes that are near carpeted areas.",

      "text": "While it does trap cat litter pretty well, the fact that the mat slides around non-carpet floors really bothers me. Whenever the cats jump out of their litterbox, it slides against their weight. Eventually, it ends up on the other side of the room, becoming absolutely useless. I wish I could get a refund. This was a pretty expensive mat that's really served no purpose. The sides also dont clasp close, so the litter it catches falls out very easily. I would not recommend this to any cat owner out there.",

With this it gets trapped so I can dump it right back into box or throw out. Highly recommended!",

I had to have something that the granules were trapped into and then the cats would not re step on them to track.",

I estimate it eliminates about 85 percent of the scatter. Depending on your cat and whether or not they are a fluffy will determine how much litter makes it past the mat. It can be easily cleaned as well. The only CON I can think of is the cost. Still though we are going to order two more.",
