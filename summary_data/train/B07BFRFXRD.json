I have a big bathtub and it fits pretty well. It's very comfortable and I take long baths. I also loved that it came with a laundry bag to wash in the washing machine which is genius! It will never get smelly then. It hangs up easily in my shower when I'm done and dries completely. Great product!! I totally recommend!",

Then I saw someone else's review on this pillow and how it was so comfortable and her husband absolutely loved it. I don't know who you are, but thank you for writing that review! My tub is pretty deep and is not very comfortable on the backside, so I ordered this pillow and have only used it once, but I can tell you that I will be enjoying more baths from now on simply because this pillow is so amazing and extremely comfortable. If you have any doubts about ordering this pillow... don't! It's totally worth it!",
