Haven't printed photos yet, but since its same mechanics as my previous printer I can expect photographic quality. Nice addition for me is the scanner built into it. Don't have to drag out big scanner when needed. Easy installation, just run CD and its up and running. I recommend this highly..",

It literally took 4 and a half minutes to print one page... and that's when it hasn't eaten all of the cartridges that it need to fulfill its job. This thing is going to the dump.

They sent me a Canon MX410. I would have been more okay with it if it at least had some of the features that I bought the MG5320 for (Air Print, mostly), but it did not. What really annoyed me is that they shipped it in a MG5320 box! I emailed Milas Corp about it, and they sent me an MG 5320..except I never received it in the mail. Will not be buying from this merchant again. So frustrating!",

It's my first wi-fi printer and that functionality alone is worth it. Despite being a bit loud and a bit slow, the print quality is excellent (should be based on ink usage).

I've only had this printer for a few days, but I am very satisfied so far. The print quality and speed are excellent, and the features on this mid-range printer are excellent. I have nothing bad to say about it. I love that it works with Apple AirPrint. At first I couldn't get that to work, but the support page at Canon said that I had to update the firmware. That was easy, and now I have easy printing right from my iPad. Love it.",

How does Amazon do it? The price...the quality...the delivery. This whole machine cost less than the re-fill ink for my previous brand new HP (which I gave to my grndson). My second Canon...and I am sticking with that brand!",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nHyoun Kim5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Printer - Worth Every Penny - A FEW CAVEATS - READ!!Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2012Verified Purchase I've owned an HP color LaserJet for quite some time now, but the only problem is that is streaks. Something is wrong with the fuser/toner cartridges and despite me getting a local printer/copier technician to look at it, he thinks it can't be fixed. Not wanting to spend any more money trying to get it repaired, I'm just holding onto it until the toner runs out.\n\nBut recently, my my wife is planning on going back to college. Back to college means writing papers, printing out stuff, and all that jazz and she needed a printer that didn't have a huge streak going down each sheet. On top of that, she wanted a printer that was capable of copying/scanning. Having procrastinated for a while now, I did notice that another Canon Pixma (PIXMA MG6220) was the Gold Box Deal of the Day. That printer retailed $199.99 but was on sale for $59.99. Instead of pulling the trigger on it, I decided to wait until she woke up. Unfortunately, that printer sold out lightning fast. When I checked back, some kind of Toshiba laptop was the replacement product. She was upset, but told me to keep an eye out for another deal. Luckily, I checked Amazon that night and saw this printer (PIXMA MG5320) replaced that Toshiba laptop. The only difference is that it was the model down and was $2 cheaper. Not willing to lose out on it, I pulled the trigger.\n\n[ COMPARISONS ]\nComparing the whitepaper documents on the MG5320 vs the MG6220 I lost out on earlier that day, they seem to do the EXACT same thing (print speeds, DPI, duplex printing, etc) with the exception of 4 things:\n1) 5 individual inks vs 6 individual inks (the MG6220 has the gray cartridge)\n2) a non-touch screen vs touch screen (big whoop)\n3) No Ethernet (WiFi Only) vs Ethernet + WiFi (oh no)\n4) No Google Cloud Print Ready vs Google Cloud Print Ready (I have easily bypassed this to make it available on my printer).\n\nSo for 3 out of 4 functions missing, was it worth $2 (gold box price difference)? Yes. Is it worth $50 price difference (if you bought it retail)? Probably not.\n\n[ SETUP ]\nFrom unboxing to setup completion, it took me about 35 minutes. That setup includes removing all the tape/wrapping, putting in the ink cartridges in, powering it on, connecting it to my PC via USB, and then running the calibration steps required before actual printing. Since I connected it via USB, I have Windows 7 and it automatically recognized the printer and set it up for me. Of course, my wife likes having those diagnostic tools/software that comes with printers, so I installed that on my computer. I will say it's not as bad as past software/tools from previous printers I owned (Lexmark & HP). It's less bulky and the software is less intrusive. It's less \"bloatware\" than other bloatware drivers that usually accompany printers.\n\nAs long as you have Wifi in your home, setting it up is a breeze. All you need to know is your wifi network's SSID and the password. That's it. Type those in correctly and it will join your network and allows you to utilize Google Cloud Printing, Airprinting, printing over the network.\n\n[ PRINTING ]\nIn terms of printing you have the option of regular paper (on the bottom tray) or photo paper (on the top tray). There is a CD tray for printing onto CD/DVDs/etc (you must have a printable CD-R/DVD-R). So as long as you buy those disc, you never have to buy one of those label stickers.\n\nPrinting on plain paper (I just use generic copier paper for my HP Laserjet) is as good as printing with an inkjet gets. If you're wanting crisper text, you need to invest in paper that doesn't bleed as much. Remember, I'm going from a laser printer (which fuses toner) to an inkjet that sprays ink onto paper. Obviously my Laserjet looks crisper, but I can fix that by getting higher quality paper.\n\nPhoto printing is awesome. With the printer came a sample pack of about 10 4 x 6 sheets. If you're wondering what it is specifically, it is theCanon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, 4 x 6 Inches, 100 Sheets (2311B023) . Having printed photos dozens of times at CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart, the quality of the photos are as good as ones you get professionally done. HOWEVER, there are a few things I need to point out.\n1. This printer is a 9600 maximum dpi printer. The higher the dpi when you print photos on photo quality paper, the higher the detail.\n2. When you print photos, you need EXCELLENT quality photos AKA straight from the digital camera or high megapixel camera. My wife tried to print a couple photos she pulled from Facebook. They looked absolutely horrible due to the compression that Facebook does by default unless you check the option to upload in high resolution. This option is *ONLY* available on Facebook's webpage. The mobile versions do not allow you to do this. Because of that, the majority of floating facebook photos out there are not in high quality. Again, the artifacts (square blocks, uneven colors/detail) from compression (like the photos on facebook) will be very very visible when you print on high resolution and/or photo paper.\n\nOther printing features (such as templates) are bundled in the application (on the setup CD) and also on built into the printer itself. Such templates include the following: calendars, photo albums, lined papers (such as notebook paper, graph paper, checklist paper, agendas, etc).\n\n[ OTHER FEATURES ]\nGoogle Cloud Print - This is fairly a new technology and even myself, a frequent user of Google technologies, rarely use this. I just don't see it as useful to print to my home printer when I'm not home unless I really needed something printed. Regardless, this model printer says it doesn't support Google Cloud Print, but there are ways around it if you set it up on your Google account. Of course by doing that, you have to leave your PC on and always connected to the Internet.\n\nApple Airprint - Having 2 iPhones and an iPad in the house, printing from the Apple devices makes printing more accessible. Because this printer supports Airprint, it automatically shows up on your Apple devices as long as you set up the PIXMA printer on your local home network AND your Apple devices are on the same network.\n\n[ COPYING / SCANNING ]\nScanning is pretty good. We scanned a couple photographs just to test and it seemed to be good quality. It's really easy.\nCopying is a snap. You put the document on the scanner, close the lid, and then press to either copy in black or color. Not much easier than that.\n\n[ IMPORTANT NEED-TO-KNOWS TO SAVE INK ]\nNot sure if they were engineered this way (I've seen other Canon printers in the past do this), but by default, regardless of if you print in black only (say a report for school), black colors come from mixing your color cartidges together. So when you read reviews that this is an INK HOG, it's because those reviewers don't know how to set up the printer. Actually I blame this with Canon, because the average consumer would not realize this. To remove it, it's a hassle, but it's a major step if you want to save $$$ on ink. I will attempt to put the link directly here BUT, Amazon removes external links. The link is here: [...]\nIf this is the case, then just go to Canon's website. Look for the PIXMA printer and then go to Support. Type in \"black\" in the support search box and the document you want to look for is \"Print using black ink only\". Long story short, to turn it off, it's a combination of two settings:\n1. Media Type must ALWAYS be Plain Paper. Otherwise you'll use up all your colors to make up black.\n2. Grayscale Printing must be enabled.\nThat's it.\n\nLastly, I would suggest you not turn this printer off and NOT use the power save feature. When you do, it goes through the standard cycle of cleaning the heads and prepping the printer for print. EVERYTIME the printer does this, it wastes a little bit of ink. So you have to ask your self, do you want to save on electricity or do you want to save on ink (remember ink is about $45 - $50 a pack unless you want to buy them individually for $13 - $14 each). Of course there are 3rd party ink cartridges, but I haven't blown through my original set yet, so time will tell.Read more 87 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse C.

I bought this item in 2013, however I very rarely used it. In fact I had only used this printer less than 30 times at most. Yesterday 6-27-2017 I sent a 5 page file in plane text, & it just spit out blank paper. This occurred over 5 times in a row. So, I unplugged it, waited an hour to let it cool down. When I plugged it back in and turned it on all the lights flashed in a pattern, & the screen displayed ERROR B200. A quick search on the web revealed that MANY owners of this piece of junk had the same issue. The above error message states to unplug the device & take to a SERVICE CENTER. Are they serious??? It would cost more to repair than just buy a new. Welcome to the digital age right? BTW, This printer still has the original ink cartridges in it!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, NOR WILL I BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM CANON.Read more 5 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse TheRecklessPerfectionist1.0 out of 5 stars Tedious, to say the leastReviewed in the United States on March 20, 2018Verified Purchase First, the scanner function wouldn't link properly to the computer, so after weeks of troubleshooting I finally just gave in to using a thumb drive to transfer scanned images manually. Tedious, to say the least. Second, the thing takes probably 3 minutes, sometimes more, to warm up and start printing the first page. Third I got the dreaded B200 error code, spent days troubleshooting it meticulously and never got it working again. I did not try new Canon brand ink cartridges, because who is going to buy $70 in ink cartridges in hopes of getting their $90 printer to work again when it still has $50 worth of ink left in the previous cartridges. And the final reason I will never buy another Canon printer: just because of a printer head error, the ENTIRE UNIT stops working. Are you telling me Canon never thought about the possibility I might still like to be able to scan something even if there is a printing issue? Junk printer, junk company.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Tasd1.0 out of 5 stars Buyer BewareReviewed in the United States on January 25, 2016Verified Purchase I have had this printer for almost three years now and it has been nothing but trouble from day one. I did a lot of research before buying this particular Cannon and based on many reviews I took a chance although it was against my better judgement. I don't use a printer very often, but when I do I expect it to work. Two main complaints; First it cleans the heads way to often which uses up tons of ink and if you're in a hurry to print something you have to wait until it goes through it's cleaning process. So sit back and enjoy the printer at work. Secondly; If just one cartridge runs out of ink it WILL NOT PRINT anything even if you just want to print in black. I might add; Try buying OEM ink and see what it costs and notice how long it lasts. Also, the picture quality in far from good compared to other printers I have owned. The bottom line is I have dealt with these problems far too long now and I'm throwing in the towel and will go back to H.P. or another brand. I will never purchase another Cannon Printer of any sort again.Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States \n\n\nCUSTOMERS WHO BOUGHT THIS ITEM ALSO BOUGHT\nPage 1 of 1 Start overPage 1 of 1 This shopping feature will continue to load items when the Enter key is pressed.
