      "text": "As an I.T. person, I have owned and used a lot of headsets. I found this one to be the best by far. First off, it is extremely comfortable. Since I use it a work it makes those long conference calls and video meetings easier to deal with. In addition, the other people on my calls have told me how clear and crisp my voice sounds. Since I work in a corporate office, they are also excellent at reducing/eliminating the outside noise that goes on around me. If someone tries to talk to me when I am wearing them I cannot hear the person at all. I highly recommend these!",

I took off a star because: Although more than adequate the sound quality isn't that good (a $20 pair of earbuds is certainly better). Also the \"7.1\" is a misrepresentation. This implies they are 7 drivers plus a subwoofer. There's certainly no subwoofer in a headphone and there's only two drivers. I say I'd buy them again: Easy plug and play with Win 10. The fit and finish is nice as well as the cord feels very nice. They're lightweight and reasonably comfortable for an hour or so.",

      "text": "My sons, 21 & 9, are avid gamers and said these headphones are the same sound quality as Turtle Beach headphones. They could hear details in the game that they didn't hear with other headphones like their character's footsteps. These headphones come very well packaged and are made with sturdy materials, high quality. They are actually lightweight for their size. The earpieces are very comfortable. The lighting is multicolor and very cool looking, but not so bright that it's annoying. I just purchased them, so I'm not sure about malfunction over time, but given the quality they are made from and high performance I expect them to last quite a long time.",

You have to use windows features for that control option. Using DTS mode though, let me tell you... whew!

      "text": "This headset is amazing! I'd dare say it's ranked right up there with the famous \"Turtle Beach\" headsets in my opinion. I bought these specifically just to play the new \"COD: Modern Warfare\" and the sound quality is perfect you can hear everything from the feet running to a shell casing dropping after being shot. For me the noise cancelling is A1, they're extremely comfortable to wear for a long period of time (+1 for the hardcore gamers out there) and I mean c'mon the lights around the edges: icing on the cake! I could go on and on but I'd run outta room. Just go ahead and buy them and see for yourself you won't regret it!",

These have really good sound for the price -- the high end treble seems a touch flat, but the surround sound works great and they sound really good. The volume control is on the cord rather than on the headphones themselves, which I'd rather have them on the headphones but it's honestly no big deal. I'm really happy with them, they're a good replacement and I didn't have to spend a lot of money! :D",

It\u2019s very comfortable on the ears and the glowing lights is charming. USB plug in is easy peasy better than having to work with two aux plugs. The chords are durable af, my puppy tries to chew on it now and then.",

However, the mic isn't the best. I play games with my friends and use Discord and they instantly noticed a difference. They said it sounded like I was using a phone to talk, which is not exactly a good thing. So overall, if you're buying these for audio and head feel, these will be a good choice. But if you plan on using the mic as well, just know the mic quality is on the low end.",
