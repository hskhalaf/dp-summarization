Get some fish sauce, some Sriracha, and a decently flavorful peanut butter and save yourself the time and money. This product actually made me mad it was so bad. And yes, I stirred it first.",

The crunchy pieces are smaller than in \"extra crunchy\" Skippy or Jif, a change I like. I think I\u2019ve found my peanut butter. 11.2.18 addition Yesterday I added two tablespoons to a big pot (about 3 quarts ) of pumpkin soup.

I have pretty much ordered one every month and I have tried other flavors (bought directly from the company) and they all have impressed me. This is the kind of peanut butter that you can not only eat straight out of the jar, but also use in recipes to give it that \"something-something\" that regular peanut butter would not give you.",

It's not cheap but it doesn't have an endless list of additives and it's only made with a few ingredients. Unfortunately the delivery was delayed (so it's been my latest 3 Amazon orders), now I understand that's not necessarily a manufacturer problem, but if I buy a product that clearly states it will be delivered in 2 days and it's not, that is dissapointing and someone should be taking responsability for it.",

It wasn't very flavorful in my smoothie but it could be interesting in a baked good. Also, super pricey.",
