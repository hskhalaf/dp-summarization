The small basket held more than we thought it would, although if you stuff it, it is hard to pull things out. We utilized the reclining seat when my daughter would nap while we were out and she seemed really comfortable. The only downside is that the cup holders were small, so it wouldn't hold my reusable bottle. Although I'm happy that it has a cup holder at all. All in all this stroller was a lifesaver and is still being put to good use back at home.",

For laying down or laying back, the stroller is fine, but sitting upright is a problem. Baby is going to be uncomfortable sitting upright. Other than that, the stroller is fine.

Another feature is that the seat is short ( from back to front) and tilts down a little. The positives are that it is really easy to take in and out of the car and has good maneuverability. I am going to see if I can make him a thin wedge that I can put behind his back so he can sit up a little more.",

It was nice because the folding was East, it was lightweight as described, and it had a small storage at bottom. My only con was that it did not fit most sippy cups. The cup holders were too small. I do wish the storage compartment at bottom was larger. Also, my 2yo is on the taller side. She was uncomfortable in this because there was not enough leg room. The footrest was at the lowest position and she still was too tall.",

Then the back is ALWAYS at a slant - I can't fix it so my grandson is sitting up straight - so he hates it. The strap at the back that is suppose to allow you to set the back at different angles doesn't hold. I don't bother using it any more. Waste of money for me.",

Hard wheels are ok for our walks (she's ok feeling bumps) , but others might need air wheels for different terrain.",

I bought this to keep in my car instead of the full-size stroller that came with my travel system and use it mainly for shopping and quick outings with either my 3 y/o or 7 m/o. I wouldn't say it is durable enough for daily use and would opt for the full size stroller for walks through the neighborhood or the park to ensure baby's comfort. However, it's perfect for my needs as it offers better control and more options than an umbrella stroller and is much more compact and portable than a full size stroller.",
