I was looking for something that had good consumable costs, printed quality text and graphics, and could do photos reasonably well when I didn't need perfect photo quality. This hit all the marks. Have also found it is fast, and lots of good features. Software support is excellent as well (for a Mac). This is my daily goto printer now.",

Just follow the directions and you are good to go. First thoughts is that it prints very quickly. Black and white copies/print out was 3-5 seconds. Color was about 10 sec to print the first page. My other inkjet printer took 10 minutes to print out the first page...ugh.. Giving 4 stars for now until I put some miles on this machine and will update in full then.",

      "text": "I love this printer! Great for a small home office. I don't print a lot quantity wise, but do print shipping labels and flyers often. The auto duplex feature works great and is super fast. Also the double sided scanning saves time and frustration. I haven't used all the features yet, but so far everything works. The only problem I've had is it occasionally makes random noise like it is starting up from sleep mode and I haven't been able to find out why. I haven't had to refill toner yet, so hopefully that won't be a big disappointment.",

I don't know if this business model works in the long run, but people will most likely try alternative inks that will be developed for this model and brand. When that happens, as indeed it has already happened, everybody loses because the printer owner will have bad quality prints and less sales for Canon. Quality can never really sustain itself in a system that encourages substantial markups and programmed obsolescene. More industrial wastes to export abroad. ;-(",

I have tried to call customer service and waiting on hold for over 30 minutes 2 times. There is no technical live chat available. No way to send an email. It's like as soon as you buy the unit you are abandoned... Never buying a Canon product again !!!",
