As others have mentioned it does stink pretty bad, though I assume that'd go away eventually. In any case, I returned it and will find another brand. I should point out that while this is from \"US Art Supply\", the item is marked \"Made in China\".",

We have added two features that enhance our team members to do a bit more precise work. the two are: 1. Machined X and Y axis lines across the table top surface. 2. Added a brass tipped long set screw and small handle, in the base, thus controling table speed rotation and to also lock in place.",

After each day so spinning, I have to literally scrub it down and make sure all the clay or water is off. totally not worth the hassle. The ceramic shop (site) has literally the same product for 50% off of what it is on amazon.",

I have chosen not to return it, since it is so heavy, and I also generally have a ware board on top of the wheel head. However, it's hard to consider it of good quality.",

      "If you are a painter, sculptor or decorator working in ceramics, pottery, floral arranging, model-making, clay design, cake decorating and other artistic work you will find this wheel a perfect choice",
      "The base and top are all high grade and heavy duty made of nearly indestructible heavy cast metal joined with a heavy-duty ball bearing that allows the top to spin easily. Holds up to 50 lbs",
      "The base has a non-skid rubber boot that holds the wheel firmly in place without the need to drill holes in your work station",
      "The top is designed with concentric circles to allow easy centering of your work and the rim is weighted to give the wheel extra momentum when you spin it",
      "It is tall enough for you to get your hand beneath the top so you can rotate it while you work. lthough it has heavy-duty construction it is still light enough (10 lbs.) so that you can easily move it around when necessary"
