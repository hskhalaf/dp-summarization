When installing it on the wall, several of the nuts fell off from the vibration of using my Bosch impact driver when driving the bolts into the studs. Once everything is installed, its very solid. Just a few minutes of some additional tightening that should have been done at the factory, will make things easier.",

In addition to the misshapen bolt, virtually all of the factory assembled (smaller) fasteners had to be checked and tightened, as a nut fell off of one of the hinge pieces during mounting. This required tools not listed in the instructions (hex wrench and an additional socket size). Satisfactory outcome after dealing with those problems.",

I ended up putting a dowel rod inside the cross bars and that stiffened it up very nicely. I will buy a second one for the second set of wheels/tires for my wife's car.",

      "text": "Amazing. I used it to store my Sand Tires for a Rzr and it works perfect. In addition, if you have a creative mind and a hankering to optimize your living space, as soon as you take this out of the box you start to get other ideas for its use. Like, a pull up bar, or a fold down work table, or overhead garage storage if you add a top to it. Great price, great product. I plan on buying more.",

I was a bit skeptical of this one because some of the pictures I saw made it look like the pipes were bent with wheels loaded, and I thought that looked cheesy. I'm happy to report that with four wide tires and wheels on the rack, it's not bent at all and it looks quite nice. Thankfully if I sell the spare wheels, I can also fold it up out of the way.",

Good space saver for people with smaller garages. Recommend 100% thus far.",

In early 2013 I noticed that HyLoft now offers an affordable wheel-tire rack which folds flat when not in use. I decided to try two of them: once of my winter wheels and another for my extra (track) wheels. I am impressed with the quality of the HyLoft rack and ease of installation. I am very happy with them and have recommended them to my other car-friends.",

The screws are pretty long and they got a really good bite on the stud. It didn't even creak or shift one bit while I was putting my tires on it. Really sturdy, easy to put together just make sure to tighten all the bolts on it. I noticed a few of mine were very loose. The instructions tell you to go around and snug everything up as well.",

I also put a board over some of them to turn them into a sturdy shelf, or table, and then if I need the space they fold up flush with the wall. I see no reason for buying a more expensive tire rack unless you have very very heavy wheels/ tires. I also like the flexibility in mounted width- once mounted the width is fixed, but you have a lot of flexibility with how wide they can be.",
