I tried different cables and even displayport to hdmi converters. Because of how good the monitor is, I could almost overlook it if I didn't need to use both the HDMI port and Displayport (I have two machines connected to the monitor). I shouldn't have to though, not at this money. If you get a good one, you won't be disappointed, but this really is a dice roll, and that isn't OK for a monitor which costs the best part of a grand.",
