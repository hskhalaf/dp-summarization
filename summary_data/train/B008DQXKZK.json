Honestly the image doesn't do it justice, as I believe it did some filtering to get the colors to show in view. In reality, the last line in Lime Green is about 1/5th as bold as it needs to be. It looks like the marker is actually near dead, beyond when you would throw it out. NOTE that I am comparing two products from the same company. Purchase this instead: Quartet Dry Erase Markers, EnduraGlide, Fine Tip, BOLD COLOR, Assorted COLOR, 4 Pack (5001-17M)",

Also, quite a few times when I put the cap on the rear, pulling it off also pulls off the rear cap. For courses where you don\u2019t have to write a lot on the board, I easily recommend them.
