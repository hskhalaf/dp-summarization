Their mommy says they have been watching a lot of Winnie the Pooh movies at home so I decided to purchase these as a surprise from Mimi and place them on their porch (with gloves on of course!). I was very pleased with the quality and they come wrapped in a plastic cover so it was easy for me to disinfect it. Those are important things these days! Thank you, Amazon, for the speedy delivery! Mimi can still share a little love with her babies!",

The only reason I dropped a star is I wish there have been designed in a way that our hands could have gone through all the way to the head. that would have been much easier to maneuver the puppet.",
