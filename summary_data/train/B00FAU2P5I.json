No problem they still work, then maybe 6 months after that the right earbud stopped working. I paid $100 for these and I would say its not worth it (not to mention that they are now for sale on here for $400+ which is ridiculous) plus the company doesn't exist anymore but even when they did I submitted multiple requests to get them fixed but no response.

Not a big deal though because not very many people can say they have wood headphones! My headphones happened to come without a carrying case but I e-mailed Grain Audio and they sent one right away no questions asked. Great customer service. Show them some support and buy these!",

    "description": "Earbuds redefined. The 2014 Red Dot Design Award winning In-Ear Headphones from Grain Audio deliver perfect sound and design. Owners of this product can maintain their style without sacrificing any audio quality. The solid walnut casings ensure the best possible sound with crystal clear highs and booming lows. The comfort fit design allows people to rock for hours without any pain, ensuring that the IEHPs will be the earbuds of choice for music and design lovers alike. We pair each enclosure with our proprietary driver that features a Neodymium magnet and a CCAW voice coil. Go ahead and translate that to \"AWESOME\". Awesome sound that is balanced to give you a better listening experience than anything else on the market. Like all of our products, the design of the IEHP is an exercise in purpose and restraint. The silicone strain relief protects the wood housing and is comfortable on the ear and to the touch. The inline mic is simple and intuitive to use. There are no unnecessary flourishes or extraneous details.",
