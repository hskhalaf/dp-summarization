This cover feels sturdy, yet the cloth on the outside is soft enough and feels nice. LOVE the pattern too, and I really think this will help protect my hands from my scorching hot steering wheel when it's over 100 degrees here in Tucson. Great product for such a reasonable price.

Use a hair dryer to loosen the steering wheel cover right before you put it on. I thought I was going to break my steering column when I was putting this on. It fits VERY snug on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler",

      "text": "Even though I couldn't use this product, I wish I could have. It's beautiful and feels really good. But I had put in search criteria for a Prius-sized wheel cover and this came up in the search - I didn't read everything, and it turned out it was just a regular wheel cover and would NOT fit my car. Super-disappointed, as there is a whole seat-cover system made out of the same stuff and I was thinking about getting all of it. I guess it saved me some money, LOL!!",

Original wheel cover lasted about 3 years & this order was my replacement, original got very faded by the sun. Color is bright on the new one though and the cover feels good in hand, very comfortable. The only downside is that this new cover absolutely stinks of rubber. My whole car reeks of it still and it's been about a week. Hopefully it airs out soon, I really would hate to have to get rid of it.",

It may make your car smell for a few week if you put it on during a warmer season, but should go away after a while. I can onl faintly smell it anymore and it doesnt bother me ebcause it can be easily masked by an airfreshener or opening a window. Great quality product, and i love the design.
