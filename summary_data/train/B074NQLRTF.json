As you can see in the picture, the strap connects at two places to provide adjustability. It came with the strap connected to the spot you see here, and it was quite firmly fastened - when I did my best to remove it, slowly applying more force, it eventually tore the plastic around the fastener. While I'm disappointed with this flaw, the light is still a good product.",

Nice and bright, easy to use, holds a charge, folds down small. Would definitely recommend. I bought mine in July 2017 and now it's the end of January, 2019. Great for camping and bike/backpacking trips. I have not taken it on the water, but I will. (Oh, the strap is kind of cheesey, and will probably tear off, but then it won't get in the way of the solar panel--mine still has the strap, but I fold it back so it does not block the solar charging panel.)",

Charges fast, light works well, sufficient brightness, meets all for my requirements. Unfortunately the handle is not met to be opened and closed 2-3 times a day. Update 2nd tap or button on the handle has also ripped apart. Going to try crazy glue. Without the adjustable you can only hang the light one way.",

They also use it in their cabins to play cards, etc. Great for walking to events at night during the summer or on the beach. Charges well. Completely solar. Gives off a ton of light. When not used collaspses to about an inch as easy to pack. Also good bday gift for camp buddies.",
