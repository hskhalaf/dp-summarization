I liked that there were different levels to pop them out at; the smallest was best for our kitties, and I'm sure the full extension would be better for large dog breeds. The collapsible containers cleaned easily and were ready to be stored once again for travel.",

These bowls are perfect for taking to the park and on hikes, as they are used for dispersing water.

I've seen many dogs gag and cough when being watered in the field in this manner. Taking a knee and providing a drink from a bowl clipped to your belt allows the dog to drink with his/her head down at their own pace. Take a minute. Look your dog's face, neck, shoulders over closely while they are getting a fresh drink. Use the time to think about your next move in the hunt. Pet your dog and praise the rather than just pouring water down their neck.",

      "text": "This is a nice, collapsible bowl with a handle and a small carabiner to hook to your belt or bait bag. It is easy to carry or store in your car, but too large to fit in my bait bag. Instead, it clips onto a loop. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because the carabiner is not strong; it broke on my first trip out. The package contains two of the bowls, and a replacement carabiner is an easy and cheap thing to replace. I consider it a very good purchase for a good price. All three of my dogs, ranging from 17 to 60 pounds, drank readily from a bowl during a walk.",
