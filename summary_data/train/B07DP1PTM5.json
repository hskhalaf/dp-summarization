I sent it back and they sent me a replacement. The replacement came quickly, but it had the opposite problem, the crumb tray would not come out of the toaster. It was jammed. I was a bit annoyed, but decided to keep it since I rarely remove the tray. I do like the wide slots, cool touch, and even cooking. I generally leave it on the three. I would recommend this toaster for the most part, just beware the crumb tray. Seems like something that could be easily fixed.",

      "text": "Purchased toaster in October 2019. Toaster quit working properly in March 2019 - 6 months after purchasing it. Control lever would not stay down. Toaster will work if I hold the control lever down. Too late to return to Amazon for refund. Sent seller an email through Amazon 7 days ago. Have yet to hear from seller about warranty. I see that the item is no longer available through Amazon. Hope this was not a \"quick sell item for a quick profit\".",

On the down side, the top surface has a slot running the entire diameter of the toaster and it will catch any and all crumbs...the larger crumbs must be dug out...the others fall to the bottom of the toaster and can be dumped. Another \"problem\" it the bagel setting...it just toasts longer. Most bagel settings toast only one side of the bagel slice.",

A month or so ago, it started burning toast some of the time, even though on a low setting. It's like the timer works intermittently. I would have given it 2 stars, but I realize this was a cheap toaster.",

There are two bread crumb trays at the back of the toaster that slide in and out easily by pressing on them. My only suggestion would be to have these trays at the front of the toaster so you wouldn\u2019t have to pull the toaster away from the wall to clean them.",

The crumb tray beneath the toaster is a perfect way of cleaning the toaster, which was absent in my previous toaster. There are various option according to your style of toasting the bread. Also, there is a separate option for toasting a bagel and defrosting freezer items. I am happy with the purchase.",

My old toaster had narrow slots and it was very hard to toast bagels but this toaster has wide slots and easy to toast both bread and bagels. Push up feature for small items is great as well. Finally I have a toaster that doesn\u2019t burn my toast. This is one of the best toasters I have ever owned. Very happy with purchase.",
