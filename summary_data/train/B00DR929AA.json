Called DEWALT and they sent me to an authorized repair shop in MD. Few days later brought the machine home and started but it started smoking so took it right back to the repair shop. They sent it back to DEWALT and DEWALT sent me back a BRAND NEW HAMMER. I am happy with the 1 year warranty!!!",

I've also used it on asphalt, no sweat. Great also is the tamping shank with the six inch square tamping plate for compacting grade. I\"ll edit this review after i've used it to pile drive some grounding rods. There are a lot of accessories to increase the usefulness of this tool.",

The issue is that the doesn't came with the wrench to tight the screws that get loose with the vibration and is not a common tool",
