Replacement grills are hard to find, but after much searching, I found a source on the Internet. The cost to replace the grills is a bit high, but much less than replacing the entire fan. I suggest spray painting the new grills with a metallic colored rust preventative paint before using them.",

Based on similar complaints, this is a defect that should be remedied by the manufacturer.",

Bottom line - we now need two remotes. The \u201cnew\u201d one to turn it on & off, the \u201cother one\u201d to utilize the fan\u2019s other functions.

Seems like a design defect as the top of this fan is heavy and puts weight down to the bottom towards the back where the screw sits. Now I can no longer raise the fan without worry it will topple over under higher speeds since the screw no longer can hold the fan in place. Checking into a warranty since its been close to a year next month, hopefully I can get this fix/replaced. Will update review once I see how warranty goes.",

The manufacturer double-boxed the fan, but Amazon decided they needed their logo involved, so they put this very heavy double-boxed fan in a larger box with a couple of pieces of crumpled paper (useless)...the heavier box bounced around inside the Amazon box and ripped through it in a couple of places. Then, once you start unpacking the actual fan, there's dozens of smaller cardboard pieces...just seems extremely wasteful.",

To work properly the remote needs a clear sight to the fan - it is weak.",

      "text": "Super quiet. I was concerned paying this much for a fan vs my last $30 fan, but what a difference! Cools better, quieter, and sturdy. Don't expect to move this one around, though, as it's about 25 lbs. A bit of a challenge. Update 4/2017: I still like the fan, but found an issue keeping it clean. I use a handheld vacuum to clean the fan cage just fine, but can't open the cage again to clean the blades once assembled. They've turned black from dust that gets blown around now. Missing my cheaper fan that I could disassemble for cleaning.",
