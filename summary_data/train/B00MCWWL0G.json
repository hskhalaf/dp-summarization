      "text": "I purchased this camera about 18 months ago and have had good luck with it until now. When the battery fails it will lose it's full charge in about 10 seconds. It uses a 3.7 volt, 1500maH lithium polymer battery (Kayo KPL 103443) that IS NOT user replaceable. That fact does not bother me since by profession I repair broadcast video equipment, but this particular battery seems to be a proprietary battery sourced only for manufacturing this model camera. It is not available to the public and even using my resources I have been unable to find a replacement. Drift Innovations just might answer your emails but they have absolutely no real customer service or repair service.",

Also, the wi-fi viewing on the phone is not working well. I would not buy this model again. I need a camera I can trust, this isn't it. Edit-Too many corrupt files to make the camera usable. Seller will not work with me on return authorization, even though Drift authorized it. Camera is obsolete, so I have no choice but refund.",

Picture quality is great. Battery life as described. Really easy to mount to helmet and set up simple.",
