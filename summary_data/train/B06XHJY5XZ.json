My only problem is that the watch is easy to brake, but only if you aren't careful with it. I accidentally took out my frustration on the wall and the watch band broke on me. But luckily I was able to get it fixed. However the watch band will start losing its color overtime, but it doesn't happen as fast as other watches. Also, the u boxing experience was top notch, I recommend this watch to anyone on a budget.",
