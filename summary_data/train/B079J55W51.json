Would recommend over the hard plastic versions.",

They fit in my ears perfectly flush, and didn't have any long handles sticking out that could get bumped or pulled while in a sea of a thousand people. They allowed the right amount of bass and treble through to give a great sounding performance. At the end of the night the small rubber flap allowed me to pull them out, clean them off, and stash them back in the metal carrying case. I love them.",

I guess that just means it can be blown out like a speaker. Bit saddened since these cost 15x what a pair of foam earplugs do.",
