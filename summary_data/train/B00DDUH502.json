      "text": "Why a person would wear any other training shoe is totally beyond me. These things are so comfortable and amazingly light, yet durable. I have three pairs in various colours, and as well as wearing them for leisure and cardio workouts, I wear a pair at work too. Now, I'm on my feet all day but when I get home, my feet are still feeling totally refreshed and ache free. That can't be said for the previous big name branded shoes I used to wear. There's plenty of toe space and the grip on these is phenominal. I'm now a massive fan of these shoes and I'm trying to justify a reason to grab another pair :-)",
