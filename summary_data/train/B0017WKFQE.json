Well he wasn't a fan of me smelling like a dude and I wasn't a fan of burning my pits off after shaving so after trying different old spice scents I finally found the powder version. Something about the powder makes it come off less manly and a little softer. Don't get me wrong this is still a stronger more manly scent but it does the job and I'm not smelling awful anymore.",
