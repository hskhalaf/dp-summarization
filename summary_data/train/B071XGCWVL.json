Yes, you can buy an electric chipper for $1000+ (Patriot). BUT when all is said and done you are probably cleaning up a few small branches in the fall, or cleaning up when you trim your bushes. Do not purchase if you think you want to shred leaves. This really is a \"branch\" kind of thing. The opening is the one downside, albeit bearable. You will need a bucket or a rubbermaid container to catch the chips, or you can just shoot it on the ground. Overall great chipper for the average homeowner.",

The key to any equipment is its longevity and that remains to be seen. Suspect that as long as it is not abused should last quite a while. It sure chews up branches.",

This is my second Chipper Joe; the first was a CJ601E which lasted for 4 years of heavier than normal use. An internal AC/DC converter burned-out. I might try to repair it some day. The CJ602E operates differently in that the cutting action pulls the branches in quickly. The 601E needed the operator to feed the cutter by shoving the branches in. Both make the same size chips. Branches up to 1.25\" are fine. It's not industrial machinery; use it moderately and you'l get your money's worth. I would gladly pay $200 for a slightly more robust version that made the same size wood chips.",

It falls down when a stick has a bend and is firm, it won't feed in. This leads to a lot of pre-work prep to get sticks in a shape / state ready for processing by the chipper. At some point, it's more hassle than just taking sticks to the dump but it's a nice convenient light duty item. Good -- yes, great -- no. The next step up is $600-$700 so it's a great price point to get started in the wood chipping biz :)",

The CJ602E is almost exactly like the CJ601E, except it has an 1 extra amp of power. It certainly feels like that extra 1 amp is doing a better job, because I don't remember the CJ601E shredding the twigs and sticks as fast and efficiently as the CJ602E. Overall, very pleased!",

Clearing jams is easy, and more or less idiot proof -- the chipper won't start until the hopper is securely closed. All in all I've been very pleased.
