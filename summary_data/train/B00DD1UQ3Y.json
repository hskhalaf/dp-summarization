But at least you don't have to beat your hose on the carpet. It's cute. It looks like it should be a vacuum. it's not lightweight. And it is not useful",

Fortunately, the tools for the household vacuum fit. Very difficult to get it into the bag for storage, and then you need to vacuum the bag when you take it out.

Lots of cement dust and flakes and dirt. The unit is easy to carry. Connection to house current was no problem. Had to use short extension . No problems. Did very good job on first try of dry pickup.Poerful suction. Easy to clean up using house hose. Probably will not buy the battery.",

      "text": "Compared to the first generation dewalt vacuum, it is like comparing walking and driving. The new vacuum has more than doubled the total capacity of the vacuum, but the sucking power on battery feels infinitely higher. When a plug is convenient it does suck better, but not nearly as much as the difference between gen 1 and gen 2 on battery. The onboard tools are just a credit to the dewalt engineers. So happy to have this vacuum for the little messes, but it also is great for vacuuming the boat and car as well.",

These things are super convenient for cleaning up around the shop. Pop in a battery and walk around without the worries and restrictions of a cord. If you don't need to move around, plug her in to an outlet.",

Anyone with a DeWalt cordless tool set should have one of these.",
