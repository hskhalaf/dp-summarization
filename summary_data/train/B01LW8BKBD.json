These earphones were originally \u00a3149 but, got them for \u00a399 and even then I felt these were not worth the price. Although these earphones are packed in very nice Apple-inspired packaging, they felt cheap and the sound quality was terrible. I could not find a suitable fit and all of the eartips provided were extremely uncomfortable. I returned these for a refund and will be looking at other options.",

Then after two weeks they developed the popular fault. First they turned off for no reason half way through a run and then they would only work after a hard reset each time. Finally I got red and white flashing lights and then no charge at all. They don't even turn on now so I guess it's a battery fault. Full refund from Amazon which is great but, with this being a popular fault I'm reluctant to re-buy. Looking at Bose as an alternative.",

The holders on these seem to be a little loose around the ears (even though I have big ears!) whereas the PB3 has a really nice tight fit around not allowing much movement. PB3 overall have a cleaner and crisper sound, but the MPOW is louder and has a much deeper bass note ultimately making the MPOW more enjoyable to listen too overall. Though if you max out the MPOW the bass can distort a little. I returned the PB3 as I could not justify the price difference between the two where the MPOW has sound which is almost just as good.",

This is a perfect product in terms of ergonomics and the way it fits your ear, however if you appreciate sound quality and listen to different music, I wouldn't recommend. If you are into hip hop and pop music you should be fine. It's a pitty but I'll be returning mine after couple minutes of tests and different music styles played.",
