      "text": "Very good garden fork, bought to replace a \"Martha Stewart\" fork purchased from Kmart some 15+ years ago (its handle socket failed, due to some rust and heavy use). I like the longer-than-average handle that allows better leverage for lifting rocks from heavy clay soil, and for using as an alternative to a rototiller in tight spaces. This fork is fairly heavy, built to last. I think that the tines could be a little better, as a couple show some bending-maybe I've been too aggressive at prying out buried rocks. With a little care, I expect this fork to be the last one I'll need, going on 62 years of age. Would buy again (e.g., if somebody stole it!).",

Snow shovel is a bit better but not much. 10 tine manure fork used last year was much improved but would cause clumping and need to constantly pull off stuck mulch. This garden fork seems sturdy and did a great job with the majority of the mulch. Combine this with scraping the driveway at the end with the manure fork was the perfect combo. Hopefully this will last many years as seems well made and steel was what I was after.",
