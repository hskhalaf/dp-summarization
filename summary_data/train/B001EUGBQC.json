That morning I ordered this to be same day delivery. I sprinkled this powder liberally on the rug and left it for over an hour, nice lemon smell by the way! then I vacuumed the entire rug 3 times to get all the chemical lifted. I could not find another flea in the rug and the vacuum was LOADED!!! and within 2 hours I saw every flea it picked up was dead. Couldn't ask for a faster fix to a nasty problem!",
