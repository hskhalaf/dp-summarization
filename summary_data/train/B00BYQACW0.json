I contacted Schwinn and it's outside of their 1-year warranty so they were going to charge $14.95 plus shipping and tax to replace the under-engineered part. I found this:  on amazon for under $13, free shipping, and it's metal framework, so it should hold up way better. It looks slightly big on the bike, but works great for my son and fits perfectly on the post.",

Only issue is if the child has less than a 12\" inseam it will be a little difficult to use properly but he/she will grow in to it as time goes by.

Kids can learn to balance and get comfortable on a bike by scooting along and not relying on training wheels or adding the sometimes frustrating pedaling. Once they master this, simply add pedals and go. My nephew had a different brand and learned to ride this way. He is now 4 and rides like a champ. I couldn't get my daughter on bike because she was frustrated with the pedaling and always felt like she was falling over. Now she scoots along in the house and outside. Sometimes I'll have her prop her feet up on the platform and push her.",

      "text": "Even though the bike is smaller for my 5 year old, he loves it. Because he gaining confidence to balance himself and enjoys riding without adult support or training wheels. He is getting sense of balance and enjoying the freedom. I thought initially this would be bad purchase but I was tempted when I saw it was only sale. It was a quick 5 min setup time for handle bar and seat. Now my son wants to ride every opportunity he gets. I couldn't be more happier with this bike. So it was win-win for me.",

The bike seat works perfectly at the lowest setting for him and he will get plenty of years out of this bike. It is a gorgeous green color and not as neon looking as it is in the picture. It is a very sturdy and well made bike. My three year old is mastering it very quickly.",

It had none of the flaws described by other reviews and was rust free. The bike is quite heavy but feels very solid. Seems built to last for years.",

    "title": "Schwinn Skip Toddler Balance Bike, 12-Inch Wheels, Beginner Rider Training, Multiple Colors",
    "description": "The Schwinn Skip 1, 2, 3, and 4 is the ideal way for your little one to learn to ride and balance on a bike. When you were a kid, you had training wheels, got a good push and off you went. This method can still work, but balance bikes are designed to create balancing skills better than a tricycle can. Using a balance bike removes the need to pedal, teaching the child to push with their legs and glide, like using a seated scooter. Once they are old enough to ride a tricycle, they are old enough to get on a balance bike. You won't believe how fast they can go and how quickly they will learn to ride when introduced to a pedal bike! For such a simple bike, the Skip has great features, like a lightweight steel frame that's low enough for a child's foot to rest on the ground, a molded mag wheel with a 12-Inch tire, a steering limiter safety feature so the rider can't oversteer and a tool-free adjustable seat post. The Skip comes with a limited lifetime warranty for as long as you own the bike. Teach your little one to ride on a balance bike they'll love with the Skip by Schwinn.",
