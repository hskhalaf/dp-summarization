It lacks the typical Brooks support especially along the inner side/arch area. It allows your foot to pronate. The fabric is very soft and does not support the foot. My feet and arches actually hurt when I wear them. This has NEVER happened before with Brooks.",

The Brooks PureFlow 7 are certainly a much better shoe, especially the fit, compared to the Brooks PureFlow 5. I can't comment on the PureFlow 6 because I never purchased.",

The support level was as expected (not much) and I like the design and the way they look, but unfortunately they were just too stiff. Can't really enjoy a minimalist shoe when it feels like a board that doesn't bend with your foot as you run. I'd maybe get a more neutral color someday just to wear as a casual shoe or for light strength workouts, although the stiffness wouldn't be great for certain exercises like planks/pushups.",

The toe box is way too tight and something about the support aggravates major plantar fasciitis issues - enough so that walking/running is agonizing. I\u2019ve given the shoes a few chances hoping my feet would get used to them but no go. I purchased them in an 8.5 and that\u2019s the size I\u2019ve always worn.",
