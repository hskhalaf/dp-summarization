If you place them on the stand and then come back to use them a week later, they will already be near dead, so you'll get only a few minutes of use before they stop working. Unfortunately, it took me a little over a month to discover this, and Amazon refused to accept return, even though they were defective. If you buy these, test them extensively very quickly so you can discover defects in time to return them. Don't get stuck like I did.",

Analog is fantastic anyway so no matter. Referring to optical in last statement. As for distance, I live in single family home and have it set up in my basement, I can walk upstairs throughout home with no drop offs. Won't give these up!!",

The button placement is terrible, you'll hit the wrong buttons, the thing times out if your sound isn't on, so you'll have to take them off to locate the button and hold it, the Power-On LED indicator is just under where your thumb would press and it requires a timed \"hold\" to get them on. After having owned it for a while the thing just randomly turns off while I'm listening to music. Certainly not the quality of the 600's, I'm coming from the 555's.",
