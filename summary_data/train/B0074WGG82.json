      "text": "Over the years I have owned many GE small appliances. Before this, I had been happy and satisfied with their products. This one was never very impressive, flimsy and cheaply made with mediocre performance. In less than a year and a half, it's dead. It started with the light flickering and turning off, then wouldn't work until the light decided to come back on. No screen or button response until it did. Cue the horrible rattling and shaking. Then for the grand finale- light off, death rattle, and then, oddly, the timer started to continue to countdown, light on, and no sound or microwaving happening. Time for a replacement. GE, you've lost your touch.",

However, the newer one just completed died 5 days past the 12 months from when we received it. The older one is about 3 years old and running perfectly. Fortunately, I called GE Customer Relations and they agreed to reimburse us for the purchase price towards a new microwave. They said they will normally honor a warranty up to 2 months past the 12 month warranty period. We will order the same model and hope it lasts several years like our original one. It is comforting to know GE will stand behind the product past the warranty period.",

You need to push it in with some force to close it and hold the oven in place when you press the door release to open it. I would not have bought it had I known this.",
