      "text": "Took awhile to get things set properly. Recommend that digital zoom feature be turned off. The viewfinder tends to give impression that image is great when it enlarged too much and finished picture looks bad. Great images can be made with it off. If subject is too far away, reducing picture size will enlarge it (bring it in closer) and still give satisfactory sharpness and detail. Initially, I did not like the camera, but after getting it set properly it has become my favorite. This was purchased as a backup for my first one. 14MP gives great details, especially on macro shots and images at less than full zoom.",

I have been amazed at picture quality, speed of focus and overall usage. I am attempting to relearn photo techniques and like the ability to switch from automatic (which allows for much faster picture taking) to manual mode (learning the capabilities of the camera). I am very happy with this camera and recommend it to those wanting better pictures than a small compact without the weight, need for additional lenses and size of a larger DSLR.",

It is somewhat bulkier than a purse camera but not as bulky as a full size SLR and it delivers the same quality as full sized SLR's without the inconvenience of having to change lenses because it has a 40:1 zoom, the highest zoom ratio of any camera on the market now. It has image stabilization, but at the highest telephoto, you still need a tripod...same is true for full sized SLR. If you want to take the full moon so it prints like you see it, or take a close up (macro) from 15ft away, this is the camera for you.",

This is after taking well over 7000 pictures. Zooms nicely and the HD video is like being there. Filmed parts of a concert and burned a DVD.

I say \"keeping it simple\" because I've never had an SLR, nor am I familiar with one. I made the decision to buy this camera because I wanted something with a megazoom and higher quality than what I had without having to spend over $1000 and the additional costs of lenses. So far I've taken this camera on vacation, hiking, and around the neighborhood and decided it was just what I was looking for.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FZ100 features a newly-developed Leica DC Vario-ELMARIT lens with powerful 24x optical zoom. As Panasonic's first hybrid compact digital camera with a MOS sensor, the Lumix FZ100 can record full 1080p High Definition (HD) video--giving you a powerful hybrid that can shoot video and still photos with ease and professional-like quality. \n\nThe Lumix FZ100 has an incredibly fast burst shooting in 14.1-megapixel full resolution at 11 frames per second with a mechanical shutter, and increases the frames per second to 60 in 3.5-megapixel recording. Additionally, the Lumix FZ100 features continuous Auto Focus up to five frames per second at full resolution for great action shots. It also features Intelligent Burst shooting. The digital camera judges the appropriate shutter speed to suppress the motion blur according to the movement of the subject, rising as high as possible, activating the high sensitivity recording. \n\nPanasonic Lumix DMC-FZ100 Highlights \n\nIntelligent Auto (iA) mode\nPanasonic's Intelligent Auto (iA) mode, a hallmark on all Lumix digital cameras, now includes Motion Deblur mode. By updating the motion detection (Intelligent ISO Control) and brightness control (Intelligent Exposure) users can gain the highest shutter speed possible. Combined with the outstanding brightness of the lens and the POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer), the Lumix FZ100 prevents any blur created from a handshake or a moving subject. The iA suite of technologies include: POWER O.I.S., Face Recognition, Face Detection, AF Tracking, Intelligent ISO Control, Intelligent Scene Selector and Intelligent Exposure. Panasonic's iA is also available while shooting video. \n\nFree-angle 3.0-inch LCD\nFeaturing a free-angle 3.0-inch large 460,000-dot high-resolution LCD, the Lumix FZ100 features wide-angle viewing with Face Recognition functions that automatically remembers registered faces for future recording. \n\nIntelligent Scene Selector\nThe Intelligent Scene Selector automatically selects one of 6 Scene modes to best suit the shooting situation. \n\nDolby\u00ae Digital Stereo Creator\nThe Lumix FZ100 also features Dolby\u00ae Digital Stereo Creator. This high-quality stereo sound offers realistic sounds and effects to any movie.
