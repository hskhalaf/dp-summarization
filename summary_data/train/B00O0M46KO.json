I can connect either laptop and they both work. I can run both the laptop and two additional monitors as extensions (3 independent screens total). For the Mac I did need to download the driver from the Dell site, which was simple. Really pleased this device works for both operating systems. Quality is just fine for my business related programs; I can't comment on running graphic intensive programs.",

You need to download drivers from displaylink.com for Mac. 2. Latency on the monitor connected to this is 'ok' but can be excruciating when doing something simple like pulling up a folder from the dock. It becomes painfully obvious that it's an issue. My experience was based on Early 2016 Macbook Pro and Dell U3415W (Sub-4K monitor) I really wanted this to work, but the USB 3.0 seemed to be severely lacking in speed for display. I am rather curious if Dell systems have the same issue.",

I have not done all the possible tests to rule out a computer issue, rather than a dock issue, but since rebooting just the dock works, the dock is my suspect. I am running two external monitors, and until this recent issue had no problems after a tricky setup.",

It randomly stops working at least once a day and it also stops working if I leave my computer for more than an hour it stops working too. This means I have to unplug it an reset the device driver at least once per day.",

The key is to download the Mac OS X drivers from the DisplayLink website [...] The disk Dell provides has Windows drivers only. Once the drivers were installed it was plug and play.

Any time you transfer data via the hard drive things slow down and stutter. Also, watching HD movies on one monitor can severely slow things down and cause stuttering. For now I suggest buying a laptop with a docking connector, waiting for thunderbolt connectors or WiDi to become more popular.",
