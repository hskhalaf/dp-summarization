I can't testify as to the usefulness of the built-in \"pillow\", since they used regular pillows. Word of advice: follow the directions. Inflate fully, let it sit overnight to allow the vinyl to stretch, then inflate some more to adjust. A third, minor adjustment may be necessary, but I didn't find that to be the case. BTW, I mass near 300 pounds, and the bed was comfortable for me also when I tested it. Storage is extremely convenient, as these roll up into a compact package. Highly recommended.",

In addition, 4 months into using it, a seam in the middle of the mattress came apart, so now there's an uneven lump in the middle, effectively rendering this product unusable.",

I put a king matterss cover then my sheet set and quilt on and it looked just like a mini version of my bed at home. My husband and 65lb. Dog and I all slept soundly on our comfy Glamping Bed for 5 nights. About every other morning I would plug them in and blow up a bit more and they were fine. The ease at deflating was suprising as well. Definately worth the money.",

I have bought five all together (different sizes- I like the twins the best). (Sugestion: I use full sheets on my twin beds and king sheets on my queen/full beds.

    "description": "If the airbed has a leak you can find it and patch it But first check for the following Stretching is a natural characteristic of new vinyl and the first few times you use the mattress, some stretching will occur suggesting that the mattress is losing air. It is simply stretching under your body weight and this is normal for the first few uses. To check the mattress for leaks, first make sure the valves are secure, replace it if necessary. You can also put liquid soap and water in a squirt bottle and spray on seams. If there is a leak it will bubble. (Laundry detergent and dishwasher detergent will not work; they do not have the \"bubbling\" effect) After you find the leak, clean and dry the leaking area, remove the flocking with fine sand paper or an emery board, then apply the repair patch that comes with your airbed. Alternatively, you may purchase an Intex repair kit (#59632) for additional patches.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nOffering all the benefits of the Intex Raised Downy airbed but with the added advantage of lighter weight and mid-rise height, the Intex Pillow Rest inflatable airbed is ideal for travelers who want the comforts of a bed but the convenience of a blow-up mattress. The Pillow Rest is equipped with a quality-tested, 20.8-gauge, waterproof flocked top, along with 15-gauge vinyl beams and 16-gauge sides and bottom. The resulting surface is comfortable and secure, whether you're sleeping at the in-laws' overcrowded house or setting up a guest bed in the basement. In addition, the Pillow Rest is remarkably easy to inflate thanks to the built-in, high-powered electric pump, which does its job in a mere three minutes. No more fussing with tiring hand or foot pumps or rummaging through the garage for your detached electric pump. And should the mattress feel a little too soft or firm, you can customize the comfort level with the touch of a button. \n\nThe Pillow Rest is raised 17.5 inches from the floor, making it far taller than most inflatable mattresses, and includes built-in pillows for added comfort. And at 39by 16.5 by 75 inches (W x H x L), the mattress is an official twin size, making it a good fit for fitted sheets. The Pillow Rest--which offers a capacity of 300 pounds--comes with an AC power cord, a shoulder strap, and a duffel bag.\n\n\n\nRegarding inflation:\n\nMeasurements will vary based on the manner in which it is inflated and packaging disclaims \u201capproximate size\u201d.\n\nAirbeds are measured from the widest point including the beams (bulges) on the side and off the tallest point from the floor including built-in pillows if applicable.\n\n\nLocation, temperature, and humidity will affect the airbed\u2019s firmness. Airbeds will need to be occasionally re-inflated (topped off) to maintain desired firmness when used for more than a few days as vinyl tends to relax over time.",
