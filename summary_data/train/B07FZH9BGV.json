Also, upon receiving the package, I noticed the sticker was not \"temper proof\". It was half peeled off. Then when I went to charge the phone, it would not turn on or charge. It was a DOA. Also, note the weird foam ring on the power button. This does not seem right. More alarming is this was sold by AMAZON.COM instead of a 3rd party seller. Called tech support, and was offered a replacement, but now the replacement would not arrive until January 2, 2019!!!",

Fourth, the buttons also could not be pushed in. Fifth, the phone's back cover only had the Samsung logo, not the model of the phone or the MEID. The phone reminded me of the sample phones that are sometimes on display at a store. It was a fake phone.",

The rear fingerprint sensor works quickly and my finger seems to rest where it is located. Therefore, I don't have any problems using it. I also use the iris and face detection feature. Sometimes it is fast and other times I revert to the rear fingerprint sensor. It isn't talked about much, but you can use earbuds with this phone. I have them also. Therefore, it seems like the best of both worlds.",

I'm gradually becoming familiar with my Note 9 and i found out that if you invert/select \"negative color\" in the settings menu, the yellow ink will contrast with a black background on the screen very nicely. All you have to do is go under accessibility in your settings, then to vision, and finally to the negative color option. It takes a few extra steps but the difference is very noticeable. By the way, this phone is phenomenal!",

Despite meeting all the requirements per Samsung and Amazon, the Samsung promotions team would not accept the Amazon invoice as proof of purchase when trying to register it. After 4 phone calls to Samsung and 3 chats and a phone call to Amazon, each telling me that they did not know why it was not working and telling me to call the other company I have finally had it. It is false advertising to list the product with a promotion that the promotion team is not accepting.",

The screen is incredible, and despite the size is easily held in the hand and I am small hands, the phone is very reactive and has a very good signal reception, almost the same as the Mate 10 and much higher than the Xiaomi. But what really makes it unique is the s-pen. It is difficult to describe what you can do in words you have to prove it. You assure them that they will not regret if they buy it",
