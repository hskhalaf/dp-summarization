I'm not an expert, either: thirty years old, female, not particularly strong but I know my way around tools. I've installed and repaired a couple ceiling fans, and have installed some track lighting. This was easier than most of those projects. I installed this on the bottom of a kitchen cupboard and everything went smoothly! The instructions are not super detailed, and maybe that's where others ran into trouble. But if you have a general knowledge of electric and light installation, you should be fine.",

We had mini fluorescent models installed in our kitchen and swapped them out for these and added a dimmer and couldn't be happier. The color is much warmer than fluorescent but not as warm as dimmed halogen. Still, they are a much more natural color and being dimable is great. Installation was easy, the units have knock-out holes on the back and ends for the wiring and each included one strain relief.",

The LED light is wonderful in the kitchen - bright and probably won't be replaced again in my lifetime. I'm going to replace the rest of my undercabinet fixtures with LED's.",
