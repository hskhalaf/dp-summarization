If you're looking for a legit biker jacket for cooler weather with no frills yet useful pockets, look no further. Size: I am a 5'5\" 135 lb athletic build. I generally wear size small up top. I went with a Medium and worried it would be a bit large- but it fits perfectly and snugly. Just enough room for warmer clothes under and the ability to bend arms. I'd even consider a large if I were planning to layer extensively or pack the pockets. I would NOT go smaller. Definitely size up, in arm length and fit!",

I had to return it because the Medium was too big (I'm 5'0 125 lbs with a large chest so I sized up). Also, I was buying this jacket for style mostly and it was a little bit too thick for the warm Los Angeles weather and I figured I wouldn't get much use out of it. I was sad to let this beauty go but please please please do yourself a favor and purchase this gorgeous jacket.",

The hidden pockets are fabulous too; finally I can leave the house with no purse- all the essentials fit! I wear a 12 and got the xl so I could layer if necessary. The zip out liner is great too- makes this an item for three seasons!",
