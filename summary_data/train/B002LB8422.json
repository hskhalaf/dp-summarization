      "text": "This is a cheap portable digital camera, and when you buy it expect it to perform as such. It takes great pictures in the sun, or bright indoors, but struggles like most cheaper models in lower light conditions. When you use the flash the colors always are off, and if you don't use the flash (when it is not naturally bright enough) things get blurry. All that being said. Its cheap, portable, high-quality (when conditions are right) camera. If you want to spend <100 on a camera this is a great choice. I am satisfied with it.",

The use of standard SD cards is far better imho than XD cards that some other brands use - they are more widely available I find and more computers have slots. Its light and compact. I would give this five stars except for the NON-STANDARD USB cable and charger. To charge you have to bring the charger and take the battery out and put it in the charger.",

There is a button to take the pictures, view the pictures or take video. It has a nice display screen on the camera and when downloaded they are just as nice. It is small and compact and fits in her little purses. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a camera for a young one that is not too much of an investment or if you just want a 2nd camera that you can take anywhere.",

My friend showed me how to change the settings to get rid of any red eye and to enhance the picture quality. I've never been able to use a digital camera that good, but this one seems to be very user friendly. The battery life is amazing. I charged it once and it's still going strong. Overall I am very happy with this purchase. This is just a basic camera though. If you are the average person that just takes pictures every now and then just for fun this is for you.",

You can find it online. I have 2 Nikon Coolpix cameras, one of which I dropped and damaged the lens. Nikon fixed the camera under warranty and gave great customer service.
