However, I believe the sizing recommendations are a bit off and inconsistent, because I usually wear a size 8 and ordered a 40 per the recommendation on the official Shimano website. The 40s were very snug on my foot and too tight at the toe. The 41s have a little room at the toe, but after riding, I determined this is perfect. Would recommend sizing up one size if on the fence.",
