I don't like the mint taste so when you are faced with pretty much mint this or mint that, you have to decide which mint taste you can tolerate. (Yes, I know some offer some other flavors, but have you ever tried them...oh..ugghh!) Anyway, this is worth a try. I usually buy at the store, but saw they have it at Amazon so thought I would add it to my box of household items I was having delivered.",

The dentist and his assistants were floored when I told them I only brushed once a day, because there was absolutely nothing wrong with my teeth and they are clean. The big difference that takes my teeth from a pale white-yellow to a nice bright white is this mouthwash, 100%.",
