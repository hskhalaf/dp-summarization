This mattress is so thick and plush yet firm which makes me believe it'll last a long time. It fits standard crib sheets and it's so easy to clean just unzip the cover and wash. My baby doesnt even notice the difference when we put her in her crib after falling asleep in our bed ! She can sleep at nap time on her own while watching her shows it's very comfortable for her.",

Even directly putting my nose to the mattress didn't reveal this foul odor others mention. A great buy, and I can happily replace if the cover and (separate purchase) waterproof covers don't hold up to a toddler's periodic urine.",

I removed the matress case before the mattress gets expanded and washed it in delicate cycle . Put the mattress flat and it reached 4 inches within half an hour. Has mild smell but it went away really fast, I also removed the two mesh that was under the original case/sheet to let the corners take the full nice shape . All good nice soft yet firm and really good for infants and toddlers . Am really happy . Good quality no strong smell , just buy it and you wont regret it .",

While it might be okay for a non mobile child initially, eventually as the child becomes more mobile, it would be a safety hazard. We ultimately decided to return this mattress for a different one.",

I'll give it a few more days to see if it expands before returning. My other concern is that the mattress seems a little too soft for an infant.
