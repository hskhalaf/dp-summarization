Almost went up in size, but took a chance and they fit great (other brands I have had to go up to two sizes larger!). Will be buying more when these wear out!",

I dont mind that too much because I figure I gained a more stable boot and there's more cushion as well. I did appreciate those benefits on my hike. The price is worth it I believe! Cant really comment on their durability yet. Will update if I have issues later on.",
