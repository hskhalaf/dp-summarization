I bought a new 7.1 config lately, and feel empty; I have a theater in the bottom of the barn, and originally it was z5500's and they got replaced by this new Onkyo, which sounds OK, but the 5500s are legendary for a reason! They will rock your socks off! I'm sad that Logitech is going smaller, but that is where the market is at, but when I get some scratch together I'm gonna buy me some 5500s again! They are legendary for a reason! Whoever designed these guys was a monster genius!!! lol, seriously...",

But for some reason the designers decided that the mounts for the satellite speakers only rotate around in one direction, which makes mounting them not only particularly difficult, but it limits where they can be placed if you want them aimed in a specific location. I finally found mounting locations that accommodated this flaw, but this placement was not optimal. Therefore, I deducted one star. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the sound quality and they look good in my office too.",

I've been enjoying the true sound and quality of dozens of dvds, xbox games and my IPOD, resulting in clear and loud sound, with great bass power and excellent sound quality, zero distortion! Great option for your computer, home theater or videogames, by far the best option available, even better than the early Logitech's Z680 which by the way were incredible.

I use it both as a HDTV Surround System and a PC Surround. The Subwoofer/Amp unit crapped out on me at just under 2 years old and Logitech replaced the entire unit for free, including shipping back the original system. Great, great service. But I paid $349.xx for it. At a grand, you gotta be kidding me.",

Sound is fantastic- You may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media player/sound card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output. The best part... It can play loud, too! Cranking it up to its full potential produces deep, rich pounding bass, without even making the amplifier's heat sink very hot to the touch! A best buy!",

The only draw bakc is that it has limited connectivity. One optical in, one coax digital in, and and IPOD connection. If you design your entertainment system right this set will do it all. I use my XBOX 360 as a DVD player and for games obviously. I had to buy and Optical cable splitter so that I could also connect my DirectTV. Small inconvenience, and well worth it. You will not find a better 5.1 system for this price. This is already my second set of Logitech speakers.",

The master console is fancy. Cons: - Stand by power consumption is about 18 watts - bummer. - Cannot customize the tone (bass - treble) not a big deal. I'm quite happy with this purchase.",

A huge positive over the z680 was the improved Control panel/volume It react quickly to your turns no matter how fast or slow you turn the knob.
