This is a wonderful, reasonable version of that safe wormer. Extremely safe and extremely effective. I would never risk using a less-safe product. This is the only one our rescue uses -safe on even 2-week old kittens. I use the identical bottle on my super-precious 17-year-old toy poodle. If you get wormer from your vet today, it is ALWAYS pyrantel palmoate-the identical product in Nemex.",

I did have to go 2 months in a row to completely rid her of them, it was a nasty undertaking. I'd originally tried an OTC powdered wormer, but it didn't make a dent in her worms.
