Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to contact hamilton beach for new parts. If this machine can not handle daily wear & tear for a few months, then what's the point in buying it. I cleaned it properly & used it once each day. Just a warning to all of the everyday juicing individuals out there. Other than that it works good.",

The manual suggests to place a plastic bag in the pulp refuse container, which is a good idea as it lessens clean up time. But having to clean the other parts is still slightly challenging, but not too much. Not for the lazy . But I expected that the juicer will need to be cleaned (no such thing as a no-clean juicer right) so for the sake of drinking fresh juice I am willing to clean it. Because it is within my budget, I am ok with it. Not willing to part with more money for a fancy schmancy juicer.",

I'm soaking everything in soapy water but if I'd rinsed all the pieces thoroughly I could have loaded it in the dishwasher w/out soaking. The blade is easy to clean w/ the brush that came w/ the machine. I'm very pleased and my grandson loved his apple carrot juice!",

I've even tried to run the pulp through again to be sure I've got all I can and nothing extra comes out! That's a powerful factor for me. I put a grocery bag in the collector bin to catch all the pulp so I don't have to clean it out every time. The juicing basket does require some work to clean so be sure to keep the cleaning brush handy at all times.",

On the other hand, it makes for smooth juices. The debri/pulp that is pulled from the juice is pretty dry, suggesting the juicer is pretty efficient. Our compost is much richer for this pulp too!",

      "text": "Read all the other previous reviews......and we concur, this juicer is awesome. We've only had it for a month or so and juice almost daily. Powerful, ez clean up, only thing I can ding it on is the fruit fibers clog up the rotating strainer quickly meaning you will have to clean more often if you decide to make more juice!! The little catch cup doesn't hold much and we really enjoy juicing so have an extra glass ready.",
