      "text": "This is the single greatest video game to come from Nintendo, ever. It should pretty much be bundled with every Switch because I cannot imagine anyone owning a Switch without this game. I am a Zelda fan to the core, and this game did not disappoint me at all. Sure, they changed the way dungeons work and made them less intense, but this game is about more than just completing dungeons and defeating Ganon. The amount of detail this game has still impresses me after putting 200+ hours into it. I know this may be heresy, but this game rivals (and in my opinion, surpasses) even Ocarina of Time and A Link to The Past. It's that good.",

Even though it shares similarities to past entries and even games like Skyrim and Assassin's Creed, it's not even fair to try and compare this game to any other because it does everything so well that it stands in a league of its own. Totally worth buying a new console for.",

The puzzles, challenges, and endless quests give you a lot to do. The game also doesn't penalize you for completing challenges in your own way. As long as you complete the goals, it's satisfied.
