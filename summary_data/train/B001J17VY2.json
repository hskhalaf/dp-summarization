I have since purchased two more of them through Amazon and will be purchasing the 84\" version in the near future. As others have said, this is a great paddle for the price. Be warned it does have a smaller diameter shaft than most other kayaks - the foam cushion does enlarge it some though - it may be a better fit for those with smaller hands than those with large hands.",

Better than a entry level $20 paddle by far, but definitely not something Id take into the backwoods as my only paddle for a 2 week trip.

The drip guards keep your hands dry, and even if your hands get wet the grip pads make it easy to keep hold.

If you purchased a recreational type kayak, lifetime, dolphin, etc from a local store with included paddle for about 200, this is gonna be what makes your purchase a lot more enjoyable. Keep the old paddle as a back up / spare though..or decorative wall hanger. I would recommend this paddle without hesitation.",

      "text": "It was our first kayaking season, and these were our first paddles. We like them (but nothing to compare to). The only (minor) issue they were getting stuck at the joint toward the end of a 2-week camping trip. This could be a common problem with this aluminum alloy (?) tubes, but I am not sure. I'll try to add some geese for next season.",

      "text": "As my wife says,\"you buy cheap, you get cheap\". Two major issues manifested in the very first use. First, the paddles both warped slightly and bent backward where the shaft end inserts into the paddle. Second and most important is that the shaft grips twist and slide which mean that your grip is constantly shifting. I suggest trying a paddle before making a purchase if you can.",
