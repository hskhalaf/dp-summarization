      "text": "For the price (around \u00a3340), this is not a bad lap top. A couple of things have proved annoying with use, however, & I don't think I'd recommend it very highly. Annoyances: - mousepad is over reactive, often selecting items without me left clicking on them. -sound quality: tinny and not very pleasant. - Windows 8: not the fault of the laptop but really, seriously NOT an improvement on windows 7!! Good stuff: - reliable connectivity: even my erratic router hasn't managed to interrupt me yet! - feels light & looks sleek - good memory size",

I am bombarded by pop-ups, despite having the pop-up blocker on, and navigating to anywhere means making numerous attempts before I get where i want to go instead of to some garbage website trying to sell me some crap I don't want and interfering with what I'm doing. I am hating this so much that I am tempted to throw the thing in a cupboard and forget it. Congratulations Microsoft. You made an enemy here. Hope you're pleased.",
