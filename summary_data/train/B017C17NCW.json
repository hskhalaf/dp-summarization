I will find some use for the mats, but not what they are intended for. This was a case of buyer beware, but on the other hand, kudos to the seller and photography capabilities.",

While my bathroom configuration doesn't allow for this, the mat has been extremely successful and the litter is well contained. I don't expect this mat to wear out any time soon, although when that day comes I'll be going right back to Pawkin!",

It's a great size and the litter gets trapped into the weaving perfectly. Cleanup is easy; just roll it up, bring it outside, then give it a few flaps to get most of the litter out (I haven't tried the vacuum method). Would recommend!",
