      "text": "All right so for these headphones that are on-ear. PROS: They don't push too hard on your head which is really important for me as I wear glasses. also they are very durable, they are inside my gym bag for more than a month without a protective case and didn't even break You can wash everything on the headphones CONS: worst part of these great headphones is that they won't stay on my head. If I'm doing a deadlift the headphones will literally slide off my head. If you have hair buy these headphones if you don't just go for the under armour ones.",

Update , super sturdy headphones great battery life, not a lot of sound leakage only if you're not wearing them but if at max volume people will hear it, well worth the money if you go to the gym or work and want something that sounds good , is comfy and doesn't get hot with great battery life",

They sound great and clear, no distortion or dropout. They are okay with movement and they are very comfortable to wear. They clip together around the neck when not using and they are lightweight and you forget you are wearing them, except of course for the music in your ears! Really like these and they come in a great box for gifting. Sturdy too but not bulky. Good quality at a good price for what you are getting. Easy to charge and lasts for hours. Very pleased. Recommend.",

These sport headphones however have just the right balance of crisp sound with booming bass. The headphones are made with a comfortable knitted cord, And stay in place when I'm running. Thankfully these show no signs of Bluetooth signal disruption, And so far they last around 15-16 hours before needing another fast recharge via USB. They also come with extra earbuds in a small pouch bag if want to change the sizes up.",

      "text": "I just don't like earbuds so I'm not the best person to judge these - maybe I have weird ear canals, but earbuds just don't stay in for me and these are no different. They're not entirely wireless, they are connected, which is probably better as they're not as easy to lose. And I like that they attach with a magnet when you're not using them, so they stay on like a necklace. Impressed that they're really quick to charge and a charge lasts for ages. Plus, when they STAY in my ears, the sound seems really good! If you like earbuds, you'll probably love these.",

There is a carry bag supplied as well. The earbuds included are of different sizes so need to check on the size. Overall excellent earphones. My concern is the cost.
