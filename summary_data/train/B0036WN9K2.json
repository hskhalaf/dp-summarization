      "text": "This stick is a decent quality for the price. You have to mind the reasonable limitations of the stick and blade combo. It is only held together by two small screws. I found that for the most part if you use it for street hockey balls with no slapshot's you're probably fine. If you attempt to use it on a puck (green biscuit for instance) you will likely break the blade (pictured) and after a short amount of time the blade fastening will loosen up off of the stick and you will have to redrill or otherwise find another method of fastening the blade to the stick",

So I quickly examine the blade and always still seems to be firm? It remains a mystery.",

It feels good in the hands, it has good control of the puck, and its pretty durable. The problems I began noticing as I became more familiar with hockey and used it more and more were it has very little flex, and the blade gets worn down quickly from dragging it on the ground because it is just ABS plastic. However, there are replacement blades made by MYLEC that are cheap and some are made out of composite material. Overall, if you are beginning to get into hockey, I would recommend this stick.",
