I have had my pair since February and the volume quality has dropped so low that I can barely hear anything anymore with both the phone and headset volumes at maximum. I have no idea how this happened and I am not going to be finding out any time soon. I am now out the cost of the headset and I will try not to throw them out the window.

Their bluetooth works great, I can listen from another room 30 feet away from my phone. The sound is clean. The battery lasts 8 hours. I bought them for my wife, then I used them for exercise and I really liked them, so I'm buying another one for myself. Hope this helps.",

Further, talking on the phone was easier... the \"in-ear\" design of these makes using them for phone conversations a bit awkward and uncomfortable over long periods of time. I also feel as if I'm charging them more often than I did with the original ones. The sound quality for music is great, but for that, i have a pair of Bose. They're just ok at the price, but aside from the gimmick of having music/calls pause and unpause when the earbuds are together, I'd go with the Level U.",

With the original Level U's, if you pressed the volume buttons on the neckband, it would change your media volume levels on your phone. With these, you can even see in the Level app that there are 2 separate volume levels. Some people prefer this, I don't, so I wish there was an option to change it.

      "text": "Works really good and despite that this is the version without active noise cancelling, once that you are listening to music you reduce almost every regular ambient noise (transit, people talking, and those kind of things). The Bluetooth connectivity works good near the source of sound, however it does not have a lot of reach. The battery works as expected for a item of this dimensions, I use them a lot so I always have to charging them at night and then another time in the afternoon. For me the issues with the battery and the bluetooth reach are not a problem, so I'm happy with the overall performance and sound quality of the headphones.",
