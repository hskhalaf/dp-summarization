Then I dropped it the first day and broke off one of the little legs that allow it to stand. I did more research and came across this Rowenta Travel-Ready iron, which folds up and comes with a travel pouch. It's perfect for the small seams I sew when I quilt and its narrow profile is great for getting into corners. I like it so much better than the larger iron in my laundry room, I might just use it for all ironing from now on.",

There is a button near the bottom of the handle that must be pushed in order to move it. My first inclination was to try harder-then HARDER. That's the manly thing to do if you want to ruin the iron. It takes little pressure to push the button and it works fine.",

I am an iron geek, I even do my jeans, I know that's weird. Pros Gets Very Hot Adjustable Settings Steamy Easy to Travel With Cons None Overall excellent little iron for on the go people.",

Afterwards my entire apartment smelled like burned plastic and if I hadn't been there attending to it as this happened I hate to think of what could have happened! This item is a safety hazard!",
