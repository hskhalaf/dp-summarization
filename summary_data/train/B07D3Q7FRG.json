When she was younger she thought nothing of climbing up on something to get a drape or.curtain open. However, we as family have begun to worry. We were having trouble finding.the right item for her . When I happened to mentioned our dilemma to my boyfriend as we were talking. He mentioned this item and it looked like it would work. It is taking her some time to remember to use the teacher and not climb but, other then that it is working well at keeping grandma independent and safe. Would highly recommend it to others.",

Due to limited shoulder movement, this dressing stick has been very useful in helping me take off my socks, since it is very difficult for me to reach down to remove them otherwise. Also, I found the dressing stick works pretty well to place medicine bottles in my cabinet. The bottle cap top fits just right into the curved \"U\" part of the coated wire end. I even used the hooked end to place a loose hook from my shower curtain back up on the shower curtain bar. So, you see that this product has many uses. Would definitely purchase this item again!",

      "text": "This dressing stick is great tool for those individuals that have difficulty bending. It has many uses. I use them to put on slacks, and taking off shoes and socks. For the longest time I would not go to clothing stores because trying on clothes was difficult. So now when needed, I take the dressing stick with me. It has come in handy when I drop things on the floor. The hook can be used to pick up keys or garments that drop. This has greatly helped me be more independent. It well worth the price.",
