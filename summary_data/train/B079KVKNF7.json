As a result, all of our furniture is now sticky on the corners. Not only does this product fail in mitigating corner danger, but if our child fell into a corner, he would get stuck.",

I am also a fall risk and was always afraid that I would lose my balance and injure myself on the sharp corners of my file cabinets. I ordered these corner protectors when I saw them and am so glad I did! They were super easy to attach to my file cabinet corners and give a very soft,cushy protection.These protectors are clear and would be perfect to child proof sharp furniture corners. They also would be a great baby shower gift!",
