I made sure I flushed the radiator 3x by running 50/50 water and vinegar mixture and flushing with distilled water til it is clear.l, then fill the coolant. This is one of best coolant we have ever used and we have used everything. We have also switched out the vehicles we have in Asia where it gets to 40c / 104F sitting in traffic for 2 hours. 4 years since and no scaling or corrossion. The lavramon machine was clear. We change every 2 years.",

The wife's BMW the thermostat opens at 210 degrees and the thermostat cap is 30lbs that's just a lot of pressure in that system. I figured that this would help in that situation with the higher boiling point it did not. Shortly after installing this I blew my water pump as well. Can't blame that here but you never know. I will tell you I purchased the Evans waterless coolant and have not had an issue",

    "description": "Size:1 Gallon\n\nStar brite worked with the world\u2019s leading formulators of coolant additives to develop a product that significantly outperforms traditional coolants and helps engines develop maximum horsepower. Star Cool combines an essentially non-toxic propylene glycol base with unique poly organic additives (POAT) to create the most technologically advanced engine coolant.\n\nStar Cool is the best choice for all high-performance engines. With a service life of up to 2+ years, 250,000 miles or 4,000 hours in gasoline engines (750,000 miles, 7+ years or 12,500 hours in diesel engines) it goes significantly beyond all OEM specifications. Star Cool passivates metal surfaces to create a barrier to corrosion and will seal pinhole leaks or small cracks. Pre-mixed with de-ionized water, it is ready to use and safe for all water-cooled gas or diesel-powered engines. Star Cool is ideal for year-round use; protecting against boilover to 265\u00b0F and freezing to -26\u00b0F (with 15 psi cap).",
