It\u2019s totally under powered (btu\u2019s) and in order to keep an optimum smoke temp of anything over 225, you need to crank it on high and it blows through propane. The water pan is terribly small. It\u2019s flimsy and is only about a half inch. The smoke bowl is tiny and can only be used with a small amount of wood, so changing the bowl to keep a good smoke happens often. This same bowl doubles as a water pan and if there\u2019s water in the pan the wood won\u2019t smoke. Just a waste of my money. I should of paid more for a better unit.",

To solve this problem, I used the water pan on the bottom grilling shelf, and drilled a bunch of holes on the very bottom pan. This method allows for the wood smoking bowl to still be used, but SO MUCH better temperature control!!! My next modification project is to cut out sheet metal \u201cskirts\u201d and pop rivet them in between the legs to act as wind barriers. The flame kept blowing out in breezy environments, otherwise I would give this smoker a full 5 star review.",

If the wind is blowing at all, you'll have to block around the bottom to keep the flame from going out AND to keep the temperature up.
