      "text": "I really wanted to like this wetsuit. Well tailored. Good fit. After first wearing in the pool for 30 minutes, broke out that night in a violently itchy rash with scores of spots like chiggers or fiberglass exposure. After two itchy nights, the rash subsided. Thinking there might be some chemical on the suit, washed it in mild detergent. A week after the first incident gave it another try. Applied Body Glide in case it was a friction problem. That night the same rash came back, only worse. Definitely something wrong with the Neoprene. Incidentally, bought a Natyfly afterward, but didn't wear it because the stitching and labeling is identical. Appears to be made in the same factory.",

The thing is, the matching jacket labeled as a wetsuit, is not actually a full wetsuit, as the sleeves and side panels are the thin patterned fabric of the \"V\" design on this vest. The vest has the thin layer over the neoprene to make this design whereas the jacket sleeves are of this thin fabric without neoprene under it. Also of note, the vest is labeled \"mens\" so although it matches the women's shorts and jacket, the vest sizing is mens. It is otherwise very well made and the neoprene quality is thick.",

Only comment is that if you're planning to layer, you might want to consider something that doesn't zip - I wore this under another jacket, and the zippers kind of pushed into my throat",

I could float effortlessly while viewing fish and did not have to keep treading water. The material had a strong chemical/solvent like smell to it even after wearing it a week in the ocean water. This product is hard to beat for the price.",
