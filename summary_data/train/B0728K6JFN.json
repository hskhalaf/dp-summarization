They were warm and waterproof, but most importantly, they were comfortable! I walked 24 miles in these shoes over three days with absolutely no issues. Now that I'm back from my trip, I wear them almost daily as causal boots with jeans. I love them! I would HIGHLY recommend these. Two years later. These are still amazing shoes. I highly recommend!",

I've put them to the test while hiking; walking straight through puddles; in late spring temperatures; in a blizzard; on icy sidewalks and grates; and in mud. They NEVER fail. They're comfortable in all temperatures and they don't leak. The only detracting comment I can add is that they're a bit tight around the instep, so really heavy socks might not be the best choice, but they're also not necessary with these boots because they have amazing temperature control.

Because of that, the seam on top of one bothers the top of my foot. For a 150, the company could have made the shoe with some cushion inside.

They are perfect winter boots and have a really good tread which was one of my main concerns. I was able to wear them right out of the box with both thick and thin socks. Easy to take off and snug enough that they dont flop around when walking. Definitely recommend!",

Great water proof, a little tight the first day I wore them, but then, the next day, they were molded to my feet, so comfortable. I found them to be pretty warm, but did switch to snow boots when we hit the negatives. I love that they have a wood heal so they can be reheeled in a few years, much better than blundstone with their rubber heel, I picked these over that brand and Im so glad I did!",

They have great traction and are definitely waterproof. Comfortable - I chose my true-to-size size, probably could have gone up .5 size, either would have been fine.",

For a $150 shoe, I really expected better quality.",
