I bought this one to hold my markers AND the smaller case which holds my colored pencils. I have a separate case for my other utensils, so this is my color case. Sure there are cheaper cases out there, but this one is just entertaining and special. I got it for myself but it would make a cool gift for a student. My little sisters always try to steal it from me to unzip the whole thing (of course I let them) banana for scale",

It has one large compartment and a small zipper where the mouth is. When unzipped this looks like teeth. This pocket is more for looks rather than function. It seems sturdy enough for a light load. It's hard to say if it would hold up to heavier loads as he doesn't carry books in it yet. Side pockets will hold 16oz waterbottles, but fatter thermal cups slip out. Overall I'm very happy with it and so is our little guy.",

The \"grillz\" zip up inside when it is closed and that was the only thing he was disappointed about. I didn't realize until he showed me that it completely unzips into one long piece of fabric!! Pretty cool, but I could see that being a distraction if your child is already easily distracted at school. It seemed to be of very good quality and looked super cute. We will probably be buying him another once school starts next year in a different style. He loooooved it!",
