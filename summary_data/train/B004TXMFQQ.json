Details like the 90\u00b0corner near the compression lock not being ever so slightly rounded off. The extremely sharp burr around the lanyard hole. The small wave gaps between the scales and the liners. The way things dont line up. And most importantly the knife is completely UNSAFE there is significant blade play and some form of delamination or crack in the steel on the blade edge. ordered a para 2 and I was sent a para 3 clone. Absolutely inexcusable from a Spyderco authorized dealer.",

I think I'll us this as my 2nd edc. I'll carry this to beat up, and my Kershaw Launch 7 for defense. I dislike the location of the pocket clip, but at least there are holes to change that. However I have no F-ing clue where to get those screw drivers. Am I happy with it, yes. Was I expecting more, maybe. It is not too big and does not take up that much pocket space like everyone says. stfu.",

I\u2019ve used it at work and thought I messed up the black finish on the blade, but it was actually aluminum that rubbed off of what I was working on. The finish still looks excellent!

The pivot needed just a llllliiiiitle adjustment but it works great now. The black coated S30V blade is beautiful with the G-10 handle.

Overall I love the knife but if I could go back I would have gotten the satin finished blade.

Adds rust resistance to already great rust resistant steel. Pros: One tough Son-Of-A-B*tch, Made in USA, lightweight, strong, stupid sharp, durable, as rust resistant as it gets, great grip and traction. Cons: Weak Tip. Black DLC has to be cleaned and oiled to look perfect. Bought in Summer 2016 for $130. Great value,",

      "AN IMPROVED CLASSIC - Undeniably one of Spyderco's most popular and in-demand designs, the Para Military 2 distills the world-class performance of our legendary Military Model into a more compact, pocket-friendly package.",
      "SUPERIOR QUALITY - We kept the same high-performance full flat-ground blade but we've also lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger coil.",
      "A SECURE GRIP - The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profile thinner; removing uncomfortable angles when in the closed position.",
      "EASY-TO-USE - The Para Military 2 features extreme strength, reliability, and ease of use of our patented Compression Lock mechanism and versatility of a 4-position pocket clip.",
      "DEPENDABLE - Refinements to overall construction may not be drastic but from the G-10 textured handle to the steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort."
