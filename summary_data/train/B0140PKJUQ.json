My only concern was the longevity of the top part of the press and the removable insert that creates the cavity. It's held in place by fragile plastic so I don't expect it will last for long. I would like to see this hamburger made from metal with a better locking mechanism for the top half and cavity insert. Otherwise, I would have given it five stars. But I was most impressed with how simple it is to keep clean",

If you like your burger thicker then it would be ready to grill right out of the press. This is a neat little implement.",

They are also difficult to remove, so I would recommend spraying them with butter or putting a coat of oil inside before you use.

I especially like that the bottom piece is not fixed to the sides. This makes it very easy to push the burger out. The top piece that make the burger well (indentation) works nicely. I found that if you rub the top piece with a little oil, it prevents the burger from sticking to the top. This only occurs on the first one or two burgers until there is enough grease from the hamburger to prevent sticking. Overall, I am very pleased with this burger press.",
