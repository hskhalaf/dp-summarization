I installed it a little too quickly on our coffee bar so I can't turn it when it's open. It's definitely still useable, but I don't want to take it off. Overall, we love this product.

What I like is that both sides are on a pivot. So when we unhook one side, gravity pulls it down. This will help them last much longer, as before many times the strap/buckle would stay horizontal, and get shut in the freezer door. This is what caused them to weaken, and eventually break. This one gravity pulls down, and drops out of the way of the door when shutting.",

      "text": "These are great! My dog taught himself to open the fridge door, so I went looking on Amazon for baby locks. A lot of them had bad reviews for the adhesive or for being cheap and breaking easily. I saw these recommended on a blog and I'm so glad I chose them. They are larger than expected and are sturdy and stick very well. I can't speak to how hard they'd be for a child to open... They're pretty easy for me, but that's exactly what I wanted, something to keep the dog out without making it annoying for me to use the fridge.",
