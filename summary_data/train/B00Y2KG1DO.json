We are not heavy users, maybe once or twice a month, so we were surprised when the front slot quit toasting one side at year one. We continued to use the back slot, but now the only way to get the toast slightly brown is to put it on the highest setting. Since it's only lightly used we expected it to last two years! Whatever happened to durability?",
