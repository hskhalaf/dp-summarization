The sound was quite good and the fit was great. I was originally concerned the weight of these phones might make them uncomfortable with lengthy use. However, after over 2 hours of use I did not even notice them being on. The sound volume was sufficiently loud enough to exceed my standards. I have had no complaints from family members about sound leakage (which I read about in a review I saw before I purchased them). They are a bit pricey (aren't all Bose products) but well worth the price given the performance. Highly recommended.",

I am about 10 feet from my TV right now and they are basically unusable... If I tilt my head just right I can get reception, otherwise they just continually cut out. I think that Bose skimped by using a small detachable BT receiver (it is actually removable!).",

You can purchase an optional wall charger, which I probably will. Since I am not always near a USB port.

      "text": "these speakers are awesome! the only two flaws is that it doesn't cancel outside noise but i knew that. The reason its getting four stars is due to the bluetooth not working properly. It worked great at first and then started getting to the point where you couldn't be two to three feet away from it without it not working so i returned and got a new pair and it seems to be working fine so far",

It's such a hassle that I don't even use the bluetooth feature for my laptop, I just use the wired adapter it came with. Over all great headset.

Would recommend to any that feel discomfort from wearing headphones ( pulsating ear from the pressure of headphones) A+++",

So he is sending them back, but not because they are not a great unit because you get what you pay for. I wanted to get him the best because he is the best dad. I can not say anything bad about them because they worked as well as I knew they would and can't beat them for sound. Just check if someone is wearing hearing aids then they will not work with some that sound off when they get covered.",

With soft ear cups and cushioned headband fits snugly and can be worn for extended periods without discomfort. When connected on bluetooth, at highest volume sound is not appreciably high enough. Listening to instrumental music especially leaves one with a feeling of discontent but the convenience of wireless listening quickly compensates. Sound is significantly improved on wired connection. Single charge lasts for 2-5 days depending on use. Folding earcups to flatten headphones for carrying/traveling is appreciated as reduces cumbersomeness. Carrying case somewhat disappointing as just a drawstring bag.",

I probably would have kept them for a hundred dollars less, unfortunately I just couldn't find what makes them worth their price. It's a nice product, but Bose is either trying to use this product to cover the costs of another one, or, their supply management folks are making a killing under the table.",
