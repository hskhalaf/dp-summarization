      "text": "I'm a woman, 145 pounds, 5\" 8\"\" with medium size bones/frame and while I ordered a small, I could not adjust the shoulder wrap so it fit snugly around my arm and shoulder. Thus, I couldn't get the degree of coldness I needed on my ligaments/muscles that were sore/strained. The cold packs that came with the wrap are soft and flexible and stay very cold for 20 minutes or longer so I put a towel on my shoulder and placed one of the cold packs directly on my sore shoulder. However, $60 is a lot to pay for a cold pack. This wrap may fit males fine but I don't think that it's a good option for a woman.",

I used ice and heat packs before the surgery and needed lots of ice for weeks after the surgery. Over the long time of my shoulder problems, I've tried several approaches to securing a wrap to this awkward part of the body. This wrap is the best I've found. It's not perfect, though. It is quite bulky and it can be difficult to position it \"just right\". Nevertheless, it is the best I've found. The two separate pockets for ice/heat packs is a great design feature and the gel packs that come with it work very well.",

It is enormous, and makes a big cold shell around your shoulder that cools things slightly, but because it fits so poorly there is no contact between the sleeve and your skin, thus the ice pack is too far away to actually do the job. If the fabric wasn't oversized, and the adjustment straps weren't designed to crumple the ice pack.... It is just a poorly designed product all the way around. I will be returning.",

      "text": "I have found the smaller size to be very tight and the larger size to be a little loose even when all the velcro is adjusted. Other than that, it is very functional and allows me to do other things around the house while wearing it. The ice packs stay cold a long time and the best part is the gel doesn't shift around like some other ice packs, even as it warms up.",
