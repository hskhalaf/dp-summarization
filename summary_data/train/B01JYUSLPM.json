The base doesn't have much support at all, so when you attempt to get off the chairs, it begins to fall forward. Very unstable and disappointing.

Just be very careful with a knife blade when opening the top of the box. The assembly process was fast and simple. Clear instructions and only four bolts per stool. Everything you need is neatly packaged with the stools Total time to unbox and assemble both stools was 25 minutes, including the time to inventory the parts. I highly recommend the stools and the products from this company.",

But these aren\u2019t very stable at all. They\u2019re way too light. Trying to sit on them can be a challenge without falling over if they\u2019re set at a high height. And I\u2019m not a very large person. I could probably tip them over with one finger. Although they\u2019re cheap, I would invest a little more into ones that have a heavier base.",

Simply leaning forward creates a nerve-grating squealing squeak. I use these bar stools at my sit/stand computer table. I am of average height and weight, and there are no children in my house. My point is, these bar stools do not and have not received heavy use, and they have not been mistreated in the many months I've owned them. They have squeaked since the first time I sat on them. Regrettably, I cannot recommend these chairs.",

Hate trying to hassle with pieces unless I actually need it for the product and it was the cheap plastic ring. Probably due to handling. I had the chairs put together in less than 15 minutes they look great",

Just remember to remove the cap on the gas tube.",

These bar stools are a solid buy, easy to put together and very comfortable. I love that these include a footrest and a gas lift to customize the height. My biggest negative feedback would be that the chairs are quite light and that the base should be a bit heavier to make the bar stools more stable. Also, the package was initially missing the gas lifts but customer service was very responsive and shipped me the missing parts within a week. However, overall I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend these bar stools to anyone looking for great value.",
