This would be a good thing to buy because you can strengthen your legs and that will make you faster so that you can run or walk longer and faster.",

Puts much less stress on my lower back and yet really works the hips, thighs and upper back as well as grip strength. Glad I purchased it as it is well made",

I stay away from straight bar deadlifts due to a 'tweaky' lower back. My back felt great using the trap bar and put it in a much less vulnerable position. Highly recommend this bar.",

So if you looking to go heavy, this bar is limited, with that said I m sure iron plates won\u2019t have that problem. Another minor disappointment was the color, on the picture it looks black but out of the box it\u2019s that bright chrome. It\u2019s not big deal but I would have liked to have the black one",
