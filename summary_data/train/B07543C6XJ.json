So instead I used it in my tent and placed it on my tents floor.

Our son can walk now, but the sand was down underneath the mat, so he was able to take naps comfortable and not get sand everywhere. easy to pack up and store.

The sand clumps and you end up with 100 lbs of trapped sand between the layers. I had to cut one end to get the sand out. The manufacturer should have thought of this and left one end un-sewn. Other than that, it works well. Well enough that I bought a second matt to cover more surface area.",

It feels like those old reusable shopping bags that were plaid and itchy. We didn\u2019t open it til we were actually on the beach and had we looked at it before, I probably would have returned it because of the material.",
