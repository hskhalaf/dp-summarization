In a big open space you don't notice it but inside a house, he just ends up stuck against a wall.",

Also, we found that when the phones was distracted by notifications, the app needs to be refreshed. But that maybe with our GS7. But if you have a pet, like a fat who thinks and acts like a tiger, they will attack R2. Our brat cat dislikes the smell of oranges, so we placed some essential oil on the outside.",

I also got them a BB8 to run with R2. Its cool having droids in the house making all those noises while running around. Works great on hardwood floors. Carpet its 50/50 with R2 but with BB8 works fine! Great and wonderful RC toys!!!",

The roaming mode is very cool, but R2 gets caught on bookshelves and in tight corners fairly often. The battery life is really good. I've lost interest before I've actually run out of battery. There's also an interactive charging mode where R2 will interact when he senses your proximity while he's charging. I would note that the feet are just little rubber tracks, so you're basically limited to smooth floors or low pile carpet. Driving him on unfinished concrete is definitely NOT recommended.",

It won't go over an area rug or move over a room transition bump; but that is not a problem. It's a fun toy, now we need BB 8 to keep him company.",

After reading what it was capable of doing explained on the packaging, it really piqued my interest. Price was too steep for me at the time so off I went. Seeing it on sale here..I couldn't resist. I only tinkered with it for about 10 minutes and really enjoyed it! In time, I am sure I will handle the maneuvering like a pro. Should you be sitting on the fence about buying this...sit no longer! I am very pleased with this item.",

The sound effects are straight up movie accurate, and he's got a ton of different pre-canned actions/reactions, even the classic \"oh damn I just got blasted\" fall over effect. :-) Best part of all: the kid loves it and the dog is freaked out by it. 5 stars!",
