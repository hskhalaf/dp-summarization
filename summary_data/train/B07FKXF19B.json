Though it received mixed reviews from the users, it is still safe to say that the GORun Vortex is a good shoe. This neutral running shoe is great for daily trainings and other athletic activities.",

        "Utilizes a two-mesh fabric that is woven together for a stronger upper",

But after just a few weeks of hardly any wearing, the fabric separated from the synthetic near the seam (see picture). The shoes are practically new, and we are extremely disappointed. We would like Amazon to replace this pair!!!!!!!!",

At first I loved these shoes as they were quite comfortable. So much that I would have bought another pair when these wore out. I could walk all days in these and my feet wouldn't hurt. However the other day the right shoe started to feel like is was slipping sideways on my foot. Like my foot was rolling in the shoe. It is a bit annoying but not enough to make me hate them. That is why they only get a 4. Still, the one issue may not stop me from buying another pair.",
