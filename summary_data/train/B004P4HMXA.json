Other wise a few harsh words would be needed. Also, the cloth washers had to pressed on the bolt. I created a small press using some sockets. All I can say.

      "text": "Awesome fan but the Westinghouse Lighting 7787000 remote does not fit inside of this that Amazon recommends, you have to literally rewire it into the ceiling which I did or magiver it. But other wise the fan works great. Looks awesome and is not loud and moves a lot of air. Have no complaints so far. But get a remote and yes the lights will dim if you buy a remote , not sure what will fit but inside of this fan but the remote does dim the lights by holding down the light button on the remote. So far so good.",

Once it was all up, it looks great, is low profile, and doesn't wobble or anything (didn't have to balance it either).

I searched everywhere for modern looking fans, good quality, enough brightnrss, etc...they were all well over 150, this fan is a steal at under 100!!",

Directions were straight forward and easy to follow. Keeps room cool. Fan makes some noise on high, but I didn't expect it to be silent like a fan that is twice its price. The light that it gives off is also decent. Again for the price I think you get good looks, decent air flow and it isn't overbearingly loud.",
