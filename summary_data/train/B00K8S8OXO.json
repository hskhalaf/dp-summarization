      "text": "Bought our iron January 2019, broke September 2020 and now gone to the local council tip. The iron itself is just an iron but annoyed lasted less than two years before breaking despite only ever using ionised water to generate the steam. It failed by tripping the electric circuit in the house, and when the electric was reset it tripped again until the iron was unplugged. Tested another socket downstairs and the same happened again so definitely the iron. No idea what the problem was but am not having a dangerous electric product in the house. Thankfully our house has a modern RCD circuit protector, as wouldn\u2019t trust using the product without one; too dangerous.",

The temperature dial is not positive in it's setting and therefor very easy to accidentally alter whilst ironing. Although there are indicators on the dial denoting high to low temperatures there is no indicator on the surround of the dial suggesting where the setting should be. It seems to struggle with simple creases and I get the impression that it does not emit enough steam whilst ironing. I'm single so do not have piles of ironing but if I did.........",

      "text": "A really powerful, lightweight iron. The cost of this product, for the quality is amazing, it really does well what an iron should do. It is easy to use, quite light and not chunky, and really does pack a punch with easy to control temperatures and a very simple fill system. For the price, this is one of the best irons we have ever had.",

      "text": "This iron is very cumbersome ...not a sleek design...and doesn't steam very well. The cable length is the best feature and it beeps after a certain time when not in use which is also good. However, the constant steam isn't great and the button for the shot of steam is on the right side of the two buttons on the top of the iron (the other for a squirt of water) which is the opposite side to every other iron I have ever used and I find this very uncomfortable when ironing. This, together with the the poor steam output are the reasons I wouldnt recommend.",

It looks nice though... Lol",

I will be saving up for a decent steam iron and binning this in the near future.",
