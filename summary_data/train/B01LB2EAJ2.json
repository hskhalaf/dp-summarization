The standing working height and log tray take much of the back pain out of this job. Don't be afraid of the 5 ton capacity. I find that if I rotate a log that doesn't split just a little bit the second try will usually split most logs. I highly recommend this log splitter.",

The splitter has not been moved more than 4 feet after assembly and has remained in the stand-up position the entire time. The plastic has broken just from use. See pictures.

Also, too weak for harder wood, larger pieces and knots and crotches. However, for the money, and for residential use this is perfectly adequate. The value is great. I was able to split a lot of 5 month old poplar rounds that were bigger than 12\" diameter with this. I would recommend only for home use. Pros would need a much bigger machine.",

This worked very well on partially dry white ash which can be split by hand but it's difficult to do so.This handled even logs with large knots. The splitter came quickly after order. Like other reviewers said, the box was somewhat damaged in transit and the Styrofoam broken in many places. But no damage to splitter noted. It was a little challenging to fit the pieces together, but the instructions were good. Don't know how long it will last, but \"out of the gate\" I'm very happy with the value.",

Love the 2 handed operation as a safety measure. Arrived ahead of schedule - always good! Easy to assemble the legs. The piston doesn't push the log all the way to the splitter head, so the last bit needs to be ripped apart by hand, but that's been no problem. The wheels need improvement - larger or inflatable would be good and we may try that. Highly recommend this YARDMAX YS0552 5 Ton Electric Log Splitter.",
