The cover has a pile of tie down straps \u201cmy iPad cam up with that\u201d, the cover fit my Yamaha Nitro very well with a little extra which wrapped around my snow flap There wasn\u2019t any flapping on the cover at all at 70mph. I would bet I\u2019ll get at least 3 to 4 years depending on the road time It protects my machine 365 from the elements. I will buy this again",

      "text": "I bought this cover for my 99 Arctic Cat ZRT 800 and for the most part it fits good. It is plenty long enough but did fit a little tight around the hood and belly pans. This is mainly due to the triples being wider in the front than the twins. There are lots of straps on the cover to hold it in place while being hauled on the trailer. I did have issues with the front of the cover coming off while being trailered and that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. If you're looking for a good aftermarket snowmobile cover this is your cover.",

      "text": "We've used this cover on our snowmobiles for years because it is reasonably priced and has enough tie-down straps to securely keep it in place. Unfortunately, this cover is not UV resistant. It lasts 2 to 3 years at the most. We live in the mountains of Colorado so UV is a killer for many materials up here. The snowmobile and their covers are stored outside year-around. Amortizing the cost of this cover over 3 years makes it pretty cheap protection, so we just go with a known replacement every 3 years.",

There are LOTS of tied down straps and hooks - great for trailering. But I don't trailer, just use for yard storage, so all the straps are sometimes annoying. BUT that's not much of an issue vs if you didn't have enough tie downs when you need them. I'm hoping the light colored panel will make these a little more resistant to sun damage than my old all black ones of unknown manufacture.",
