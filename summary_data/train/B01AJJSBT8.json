Also, in deeper than a foot of snow, snow got over the cuff and onto my socks. All these things aside, it's a solid boot, and I much prefer them to the Sorel Joan of Arctic, which I had before. The KEENs are much more comfortable, lower profile, easier to walk in and less clunky indoors.",

My feet are freezing in them when it's only 40 degrees out, and they just get colder as the temperature drops.

      "text": "I'm a big fan of KEEN boots. I have a pair of hiking boots by KEEN in a size 8 and figured that the sizing would transfer over to these as well, which they did. Warm, comfy, a bit squeeky when you first wear them but that's ok. My feet are sensitive to friction and I love that KEENs tend to be a tad wider, making them the most comfortable boot option for me.",

The faux fur lining on the top of the boot does not extend into the insole. With no lining on the insole, the boot would not be good for snow/cold weather. Also, the fabric pattern on each boot does not match each other. It looks like the boots are mismatched. See photo. Returning these boots.",

These boots only carry 100 g of insulation and normally its recommended 400g and higher for winter. I kept the boot because I already had used them but was a bit disappointed because I was looking for warmth more than anything.",
