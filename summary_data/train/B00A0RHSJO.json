I installed everything and made sure it was all tight, but upon turning the water supply back on it sprayed from the adapter where it screws into the toilet. I'm gonna buy another T adapter. If that works, I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 (but not more given that it didn't work out of the box).",

Both of them actually because I bought 2. It is in their manual that this things come with both plastic and metal. I would advise that when you buy in amazon, make sure who your buying from. Plus amazon is really good anyway with their customer service so if you buy new and you guys get a used or parts are missing, tell amazon.",

But for $50 (with the valve), it's 85% of what you need compared to one of those fancy Toto systems. And it doesn't require an outlet.",

The plastic wrench installation tools worked just OK - it's difficult to properly tighten the fitting nut without stripping the wrench.

If your water pressure is above 50 psi than it might cause soft tissue damage at full throttle. Start by barley turning the knob and waiting a few seconds before turning it higher to see what works.

Once you start using this, you\u2019ll never want to be without it. I need another one for our downstairs bathroom. We used to go through so much toilet paper and now we don\u2019t! This makes you feel so clean. It\u2019s such a good feeling. Even though it\u2019s not warm water, it\u2019s not horribly cold, especially once you\u2019ve gotten used to using it. We recently remodeled our bathroom and had to go without this bidet for a week. I thought I was going to die. Also, the customer service is AWESOME.",

The main benefits of using a bidet are it cleans much better than just toilet paper (in fact you never feel as clean without one) and you use less toilet paper (useful if your toilet clogs often). This is such a simple contraption, but yet so effective. To all those that find the pressure control to be inadequate in controlling the pressure, try adjusting the pressure/tap on the pipe before it forks out to the bidet. That worked great for me.",

Too much water pressure and you\u2019ll spray deflected soiled water everywhere. Remember there\u2019s a little gap between your seat and the toilet itself so soiled water could find its way out. Plus you\u2019ll find yourself swishing/brushing the bowl after every use (that\u2019s a sign of too much water pressure). Great product.",
