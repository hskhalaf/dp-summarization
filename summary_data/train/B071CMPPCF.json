      "text": "This bed frame is amazing, much better than I expected. I\u2019ve purchased metal bedframes from Ikea before, which is squeaky and unstable. This one, however, is incredibly sturdy and quite. The metal frame looks nice and doesn\u2019t feel like cheap metal. Besides, it takes less than 30 minutes to assemble, I simply lay it out on the floor and follow the paper instructions, easy and straightforward, all the tools are included. My mattress fits it perfectly, there is a little dip to prevent the mattress from sliding around. Plenty of storage rooms underneath, I store several plastic storage boxes and a laundry basket! It\u2019s definitely a great metal bed frame!",

I put it together in about an hour and a half and put my kids 8 inch memory foam mattress on top. It's great to keep all of their trucks and cars and toys under it and with their mattress I don't feel the metal bars and we aren't using a box spring or junkie board. We may opt to buy a bunkie board in the future to preserve the mattress but it's not necessary at this point. Very sturdy frame and no noise or slipping of the slats. Good construction, great product!",

It is easy to assemble, it provides great storage underneath. And it keeps the mattress from sliding around. However, it will NOT allow a bed skirt to fit neatly. This bed frame is great for a stand-alone bed that isn\u2019t going to get fancy with a bed skirt. Be aware that the corners are not rounded and do extend beyond the corners of a normal mattress. Had to return it and eat the shipping costs. Oh well. Good product otherwise!",

      "text": "Although this appeared well done on first inspection in the box, half of the support beam in the middle had the hooks attached unevenly, and one of the central legs arrived with a split weld joint. In addition, although not complicated to assemble, it was extremely time consuming, as none of the bolts fit quite right, and it required large amounts of pressure to force the screws to through the misaligned holes. I am not sure whether it will be worth it to ship something so heavy back, or to just find a local shop to fix the weld joints, however this the first item I have ever purchased on Amazon that I have been so disappointed with.",

If you weren\u2019t paying attention, I could see you stubbing your toes a lot since it sticks out more than expected. Minor inconveniences for such a well made frame.",

It is totally unusable unless I re-drill it with new holes and even then I am not sure about the length as the middle is 75\" but the ends are almost 77\". I wrote to the company at the specified email but have not had a response. There is no website. After examining I reassembled it and it's fine.

It supports the mattress well for a teen boy, and he says he can't feel the support bars. This may be a testament to the quality of the mattress, though. The frame is a well-made and sturdy one.
