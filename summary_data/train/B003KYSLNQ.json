It has now been over two months of submitting documents and phone calls and I have yet received my replacement unit. I, for one, cannot recommend buying Cuisinart appliances as they do NOT HONOR their guarantees.",

Because it was still under the 3-year warranty, Cuisinart replaced it no questions asked. Now, 19 months later, the pop-up lid suddenly is locked in a closed position. No matter what, it will not open. Just called Cuisinart about it only to learn that the 3-year warranty is based on the original purchase. In other words, I'm out of luck. Decided not to risk going through all of this again and just ordered the Hamilton Beach, which is priced considerably lower anyway.",

Now I\u2019m relacing it with a Hamilton kettle, which I should have chosen to begin with. I was being snobby and thought the expensive Cuisinart model looked sharper.

( and even some stainless contains nickel and cadmium so even if it is stainless don't totally let your guard down. learned that while researching this pot)",

The Keep Warm function also seems to be a default setting, so every time we get a power outage it resets to Keep Warm. Other than that annoyance, it\u2019s a great kettle.",

Besides making americano style coffee and occasional tea, we keep the kettle going when cooking to provide constant hot water for cooking. I treat it with a vinegar solution every few months to get rid of any hard water build up. The finish stays nice with just a wipe down or simple soapy wash if the outside becomes greasy from cooking.",

    "description": "Style Name:Electric kettle\n\nTHE PERFECTEMP FOR EVERY OCCASION\nEquipped with 1500 watts of power for fast heating, this electric kettle brings up to 1-2/3 liters of water to a rolling boil in a matter of minutes. Better than that, it offers six different preset heat settings, which allows for steeping tea at just the right temperature depending on the variety. Using the simple one-touch controls on the kettle's handle, select 160 degrees F for delicate teas, 175 degrees F for green tea, 185 degrees F for white tea, 190 degrees F for oolong tea, 200 degrees F for French press coffee, and \"Boil\" for black tea or to make instant cocoa, oatmeal, noodles, and more. \n\nCUISINART CPK-17 PERFECTEMP CORDLESS PROGRAMMABLE KETTLE\nThe control panel also offers blue LED indicators, a \"start\" button, and a \"keep warm\" button, which will maintain the set temperature for 30 minutes. For added convenience, the kettle's 360-degree swivel base allows for pouring without the hassle of a power cord getting in the way, and its memory function makes it possible to remove the kettle from its base for two minutes without it shutting off or losing its place in the heating process. \n\nOther highlights include a stay-cool nonslip handle, an \"open\" button for lifting the lid, a blue backlit water window with measurement marks, a concealed heating element to prevent mineral buildup, a removable/washable scale filter, a dripless pour spout, and boil-dry protection with auto shutoff for safety. A user manual with recipes comes included. The kettle measures approximately 8-1/5 by 9-4/5 by 12 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty. \n\nPARTS AND BENEFITS\n 1.  Dripless Pour Spout with Splash Guard\n     keeps counters dry\n     \n     \n 2.  Removable Scale Filter\n     for clean water\n     \n     \n 3.

Power Base with 360\u00b0 Swivel\n     for cordless convenience\n     \n     \n\nPRODUCT OVERVIEW\n * 1.7-liter capacity\n * 6 preset temperatures\n * One-touch controls with blue LED indicators\n * 30-minute Keep Warm option\n * Memory feature allows kettle to be lifted off base for 2 minutes without shutting off or losing its place in the brewing process\n * 1500 watts for fast heat-up\n * Blue backlit water window\n * 360\u00b0 swivel cordless connector\n * Stay-cool nonslip handle\n * Concealed heating element to prevent mineral buildup\n * Removable/cleanable scale filter\n * Auto shutoff and boil dry protection\n * Limited 3-year warranty\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\u2022 MEMORY FEATURE\nThe kettle features an internal \u201cmemory\u201d that lets you leave the kettle off the base for up to 2 minutes without it going into standby mode. When returned to the base, it will restart the heating and/or Keep Warm cycles right where they left off.\n\n\u2022 KEEP WARM MODE\nKeep Warm is the kettle\u2019s default function that automatically maintains selected temperature for 30 minutes. If you have selected the Boil preset, your unit will hold a temperature just below boiling during the Keep Warm cycle. To bring water back to a rolling boil, press the Start button twice. Keep Warm can be turned off by pressing the Keep Warm button at any time before or during the heating cycle. \n\n\u2022 BOIL-DRY PROTECTION\nYour kettle is equipped with boil-dry protection. If it starts heating without enough water in the unit, the heater will automatically shut off to avoid damaging the heating element. The lights will flash and the unit will beep to alert you. Once the kettle has cooled down, lift it off the base, then replace it to reset and restart the heating cycle. The quickest way to cool down the heater is to fill the kettle with cold water; however, you can also wait for it to cool down by itself. \n\n\u2022 SLEEP MODE\nIf the unit is not in use for 5 minutes, it will revert to sleep mode. The heater and all lights will be off, but your last selections will remain in the unit\u2019s memory. To turn the kettle back on, simply press any button, or lift it up and then return it to the base.",
