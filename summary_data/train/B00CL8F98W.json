It can only stream at around 3 frames per second in 720p. This is not a network issue. In low quality, it streams ok, but who buys an HD camera to stream in the lowest quality. Lastly, although my D-Link \"Main Console\" app on Windows shows that it supports the DCS-5222L, and it DOES perfectly support all functions on my 5020L's, it will not detect the DCS-5222L. So, again... do yourself a favor and get anything other than this model. This should lead to a class action lawsuit.",

      "text": "The camera constantly dumps offline while I'm away and sends erroneous email alerts of the offline status. Once offline, the camera will not take input from either remote or local log-ins. This is troublesome since enabling the motion detection allows the camera to capture actions on the memory card that cannot be stopped for the inability to disable the motion sensing.",
