      "text": "Great but expensive coffee grinder. What I liked is that the burrs are replaceable unlike my other $135 grinder that only lasted 1 1/2 years. I like the fact that the grounds are weighed and not dispensed by time. More accurate as the burr wears. If you prefer drip or French Press coffee, be sure to get the steel burrs so that your coffee will be of a coarse enough grind for those applications. The Baratza website and YouTube are a wealth of information. Customer service is top drawer!",

      "text": "This is our second Baratza Vario grinder. After accidentally knocking the first one off the counter I knew the replacement could only be another Baratza. While not inexpensive, the grinder performs beautifully (if not knocked to the floor) for years with consistency. Used daily for French press, pour overs and espresso in our home, this workhorse pays for itself by providing the precision that home coffee enthusiasts demand. Highly recommended.",

      "title": "Great grinder with a weird flaw",
      "text": "The grinder is great in terms of the core grinding, speed, noise, etc. Amazingly good! The weird problem is that the bin that holds the ground coffee is made of a plastic that is super-high-static. That means that the grounds don't all come out and in fact stick to the outside of the bin when pouring. I am mystified by this issue. I 100% see how that is a problem you have in the first run, but how did they not switch plastics after the first run, particularly when their other grinders use different materials for that. Posting this review because they really need to address this implementation flaw.",

I cleaned it at least once a month but this morning while getting coffee ready smoke rolled out of the motor and it was done. I took it apart but couldn't really see anything wrong. I'll look closer at it tonight but I'm not very happy what I consider a low usage machine just burned up.",

Yes, I tried completely different beans and cleaning five times per instructions without luck. So I contacted Baratza and it was explained that the plastic \"carrier\" part must be worn out and needs a metal carrier upgrade for $90 +freight. I was curious and ask if the metal carrier is is now standard on new Vario-W units. No, they are still shipped with the cheap plastic carrier I was told. $550.00 ??? and they still ship the inferior carrier only to need an upgrade later. I am extremely disappointed.",
