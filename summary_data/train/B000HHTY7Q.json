When the detector detect the air/gas flow, it will alarm, higher flow rate, higher alarm sound. Besides that, you cannot get too much information from the detector. I don't think this device really worth over $100 .",

You set the detector for a base level reading and it indicates increasing concentrations as you get closer to the source. The long flexible probe makes it possible to explore difficult-to-access places. Very easy to use.. just read the brief directions. I recommend it.",
