      "text": "We were skeptical about this but were pleasantly surprised. So sturdy! It could support 150 pounds! The only downside was the design was a little lacking and our dog didn\u2019t take to it well. Other than that, no flaws and would highly recommend. AND the case has a zipper to make it washable! Beware, because the inside frame is reinforced cardboard, I imagine liquids may make it soggy, warped, and moldy",
