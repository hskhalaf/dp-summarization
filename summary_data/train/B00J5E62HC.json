When the wick burns out, you can clearly see the unburnt leftover wax. I burned 20 of them, and they all varied in their burning time: From 3.5 to 4.25 hours. Disappointed.",

But now, after a couple of weeks and using over a dozen of these little candles and I'm confident in saying they only burn anywhere from 2-3 hours (see photo) - certainly not anywhere close to the 6-7 hours as promised.

If you just need cutesy little tea lights then you are probably fine going cheaper. Me, personally, I'm really stuck on these. They even photograph better on my social media and YouTube channel.",

The only problem would be with more shallow tealight holders (if you have them, they may stick out over the top). I use these in mason jars and taller tealight holders so actually they are a lot more effective with the longer burn time. I'm very happy with this product and they're definitely better than I expected :)",

Only issue is we did notice they do leave a little more of a residue on a front window where we have a 10 candled Christmas set lit. But that's an extreme case based on 10 candles lit right by a window every night during the Holiday. I totally recommend these based on reliability and affordability.",

If the wick is too long, your flame will burn hotter, making the wax evaporate much faster. This is actually good advice for any candle. A quick snip before lighting is all it takes, small extra step for longer burn. Great purchase and good to have stocked up for hurricane season!",

The candles come carefully packed in a box with each layer sealed. (Evidently they came in a big bag before, jumbled together, but no more.) Yes, some dents occasionally in each one, but easily corrected by a finger push on the metal casing. Not something anyone would notice. Every one lasts at least 7 hours. I've never had a failure in months of use. Bought my second box today, and plan on ordering more in the future.",

These candles were the right price for sure, and after testing recently, they have a VERY LONG burn time as promised. However, they accomplish this in two ways. One by the type of fuel used, and two by using a very thin wick. What this means is that the flame isn't very large, but once your eyes get used to the dark, they're adequate. Make sure you use a tea light holder, as after a few hours, the entire candle will liquefy as it burns.",

They also burn cleanly and evenly. In the two cases I've purchased, I have not had one dud! These come beautifully packaged, shrinkwrapped in a sturdy box that prevents them from getting dinged or bent. Seriously, once you try these you'll never go back to what you were using before.",

Most of the other tea candles that I have encountered in my life seem cheap, run out quick, and seem flimsy. However, I was not afraid of my home burning down with these and they lasted a good amount of time. I can recommend for a romantic room lighting. I am not sure what other uses they might before other than some good aesthetics but I would recommend for whatever you have in mind. I would purchase again, but the set of 100 will last a long time.",

Since I had a couple of the Cost Plus candles left, I burned several of them along with some of these to compare their longevity. The Stonebriar candles lasted just as long as the Cost Plus ones, if not longer! They're a great value and very high quality -- I'm sold! Highly recommended.",

That has not happened with these and I really appreciate that. As for the claim that they burn for six hours, well they do. Exactly as claimed.
