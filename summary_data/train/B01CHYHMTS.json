      "text": "I purchased the TazzK32 Chipper Shredder in June 2017 and it has seen very little use. One of the first things I noticed was some of the screws had worked loose which was expected with the vibration that occurs while operating the machine. I was a little surprised though when the wheels fell off due to the axle breaking apart. Then the carburetor almost fell off and now the muffler has broken and fallen off. At a total price of $641.99 I would expect something to be better quality than this. I now wish I had spent more and got something that's not useless junk.",

Mulched up several small trees and huge piles of leaves with no issues and a pretty easy learning curve. When using the hopper for leaves and twigs, less is more. Small handfuls will go down quickly and require less stirring with a stick to get them into the shredder's teeth. When using the chute for larger branches, trimming off the bigger offshoot branches helps, but smaller ones will just follow the main one down the chute. Be sure to wear hearing protection, eye-pro and gloves. We're very happy with the purchase!",

I ordered this last July and 6 months into it after 3 uses, and while looking down, I saw the muffler falling off. While I was shredding/chipping, the muffler had torn from the metal and fallen onto the ground!! Not only is this a defective item and a safety issue but the sender obviously packaged already used and returned parts as the holes where the bolts go, were missing the paint and some parts were bent. With that being said, it did work good the first two times using it. Extremely disappointed.",

I prefer not to leave thick cakes of mulch inside because once it dries it is more difficult to remove. I cleaned by opening the vacuum hose port and hosing from all openings. Loosened lower casing screws to allow excess water to drain out.",

I wouldn't buy this in hopes to reuse the mulch though, it shreds much to small to make it worth using. The only bad thing, is the bag is too small for how fast it works!!!",

It was easy to assemble and start. One suggestion I have for the manufacturer would be to include a holder for bag support rod when moving or storing. A simple tube or clamp near wheels or handle would suffice. All in all, happy with this purchase and I would recommend to family and friends.",

Typically small twigs or long stems if not held are pulled in (either shredder or chipper) without fully shredding (so these may clog output and otherwise have to be re-shredded to get finer chips). My main complaint is that the hopper was shipped unbolted but sitting on top of the mating bolts. This severely bent the hopper flange and I was not able to completely straighten the flange. The damper door was also bent. As result I can't fully tighten flange screws and I must pry the damper door open each time I use the shredder hopper.",

Will update after I've pushed some yard debris through it. Update: Aside from the missing stud plate to secure the hopper to the base, have now run a couple hours' worth of branches through the chipper, and unit has performed reliably well.

I have fed it limbs and grasses as well. It's a solid performer. Best of all, all the lawn and garden waste that I was sending the landfill is now being used around my garden beds. I am a tool and gadget guy. This is, arguably, my favorite tool to use. Love it.",
