It is not so wide so my foot slips off sometime when I\u2019m driving it down. 2. One of the tines became bent. This is more of an aesthetic issue, and it still functions just fine. But being stainless steel I expected it to be more durable. Next time I will spend a bit more and get something nicer.",

Benway's review to get details of how Radius' customer service department handled my replacement request so that I had a new fork w/i half a day. I will add that except for the breakage, I loved using this digging fork. The circular handle is a major plus for me. The big box stores just don't have quality spading forks. A favorite locally-owned nursery recently started carrying the full Radius line of tools.",

      "text": "I wanted to try this even though it cost 1.5 times a regular digging fork in retail stores. But the ergonomic handle more than pays for the price difference. This is very easy to use. I dug by entire back lawn ( ~900 sq ft) in a day with this. This is a good workout too. I also found another use for this fork - I have English Ivy over my entire back yard and was trying to up root them - I use this fork to go under the ivy and uproot them. Very handy indeed.",

The unique shape of the handle allows for a greater number of uses than a typical digging fork including the ability to cultivate with a twisting motion.

The solid forged head/neck allows the strength needed for heavy tilling. The tool is also properly sized for an average-size adult.",

That one broke a tine on its first use, even though it had been rated highly by other users. I then bought this Radius Garden 2-14 Pro - which was my second choice because it was a bit more expensive. I have now used it extensively on my garden (for 2 months) and been extremely pleased. The round handle at the top seems a bit odd; but this works very well. My advice, if you are unsure, is to try this one - it is well made and works well - worth the added cost.",
