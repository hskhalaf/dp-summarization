The drawings won't help much in identifying flowers unless you happen to be standing right beside it and even then the vast majority of the pictures aren't detailed enough to be really sure about anything. The information on range of the different flowers isn't usually very specific. However, there is a nice touch of general information or lore about many of the plants. I got my copy used and cheap so it's OK - I wouldn't have been too happy about paying full price for it, though.",
