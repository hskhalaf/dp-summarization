Wish all the others were so easy! I am not an audiophile but to me the sound is great volume, clear and even from the kitchen location it is great to hear 2 rooms away.

Found that I was disappointed, probably because I've gotten accustomed to those sets with the higher resolution. Will keep it for use in a guest bedroom, but, I wish I had stuck with my first inclination and gone with the higher resolution. Additionally, don't count on using apps such as Netflix....I was lost trying to get it to work and gave up. I've generally been pleased with LG's products, but this was a exception.",

      "text": "I have lived with this very limited performance for a while. I thought I was not \"smart\" enough to access the functions. Well, after getting my very savvy adult daughter to tech support my problems, I discovered that the TV is outdated and would not support my most used streaming sites. Don't buy this if you want to stream HULU! Also TV cast does not work. In addition, the network connection drops frequently and does not save password. So I have spent countless times reconnecting in the midst of show or movie. I will neeed to buy a newer model. Lesson learned. Money wasted:(",
