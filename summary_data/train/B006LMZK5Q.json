It caused red, burning swollen face after 1 use. Had to go to dermatologist to get medication to heal my face. Dr is sending product to lab for identifying what was sold to me. $200 Dr. bill and pain is NOT worth the so called savings on my face cream. The party selling should be prosecuted for fraud.",
