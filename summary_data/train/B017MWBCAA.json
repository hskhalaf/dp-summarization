So thats what I bought here. Bad choice! As these I feel run a bit on the longer side. I have a thin foot so width was not an issue. They just flopped around a little more than I would like- So off they go- I will exchange them for a 9.5W (only because the strap will now be crossing more of the ball of my foot instead of the toes. They are a BEAUTIFUL SHOE! Can't wait to get them in the right fit!!",

    "description": "Sleek heeled sandal with slim ankle and toe straps\n\nSam Edelman shoes epitomize chic comfort. With exceptional materials and fine styling, each pair of Sam Edelman shoes is an affordable luxury that cleverly combines a youthful outlook with a worldly sensibility. Sophistication with down-to-earth appeal mean that these shoes are made to be lived in. Whether it's a classic revisited for a modern interpretation or a cutting edge design, Sam Edelman shoes always keep an emphasis on comfort. How to Measure Measuring Foot Length To measure your foot length, sit down on a chair and place foot flat on a piece of paper. Trace the foot by holding a pencil vertically and outlining the foot. The longest toe and back of heel are the most important measurements. Using a ruler, measure the distance from the bottom of the heel to the tip of the longest toe. Record the result in both inches and centimeters and use these measurements to find your size in the chart. If one foot is larger than the other, the measurements for the larger foot should be used. Measuring Heel Height To measure heel height, measure from where the heel meets the sole to the bottom most tip. Flat/Low: < 1\u201d Mid: 1\u201d - 2.5\u201d High: 2.5\u201d - 4\u201d Ultra-High: > 4\u201d Measuring Boot Shaft Height To measure boot shaft height, use a soft measuring tape to measure from the bottom of the foot up the length of the calf. Ankle: 3\u201d - 8\u201d Mid-Calf: 8\u201d - 13.5\u201d Tall/Knee High: 13.5\u201d - 17\u201d Over the Knee: > 17\u201d Measuring Calf Circumference To measure calf circumference, wrap a soft measuring tape around the fullest part of the calf. Standard Calf Circumference: < 16\u201d Extended Wide Calf: > 16\u201d2",
