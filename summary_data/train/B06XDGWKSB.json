Analysis of the unit demonstrated extremely slow speeds coming from the unit during testing, while speed from the cable were just fine. I ultimately replaced the unit with a different modem and both range and speed issues were resolved.",

My service before did not include phone service, so I was quite happy with my previous ARRIS modem. But when I changed providers and added the phone service, I needed to upgrade my modem with that option. This modem is functioning just like the other one and I am very pleased with the speed. So far I have not found any issues with this device. I will try to update this if things change.",
