It's not the fancy, articulated version for collectors. I looked at generic versions, but just couldn't do it. Maybe being a former Vermonter and now living in another NE state famous for quality goods has ingrained the idea of buying well-made items worth the (sometimes) extra. In actuality other, generic BIG bears were available and cost a heck of a lot more. The price is very reasonable for product !",

He holds up to lots of loves and hugs, I haven't noticed any lost fur or holes and I would still recommend strongly. So fluffy!!",

Very disappointed in the quality of the Vermont Teddy Bear. Due to lack of support from either Vermont Teddy Bear or Amazon we are having it stitched and walking away. I am having more and more problems with items I order from Amazon.",
