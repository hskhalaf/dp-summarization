      "text": "We bought this same sandal in a larger size because our child loved his previous (smaller size) ones so much last summer. They are so easy for him to put on himself, and they stay on well, unlike flip-flops. He actual wants to wear them all the time, but his school and summer childcare program requires tennis shoes on the playground for safety -- otherwise he would! These are also super easy to wash. My only wish would be for a white space to write his name (also required for school and childcare). They're all black everywhere.",

They withstand the wear and tear that boys do on a daily basis. I normally don't pay this much for a shoe but we have gotten these in the past and they are awesome shoes to have to go anywhere in. They are sooo worth it !!! Update !! We have bought 1 size larger each year for 3 yrs. These shoes are so durable. Great for ruggedness or water park etc... Our son loves them. He says they are so comfortable. (8 yrs old).",

Fairly durable although most 5 year olds are pretty tough on footwear. The sole could be a bit thicker, particularly in the front. The velcro on the top held up pretty well but the material around it could be a bit more robust. It too some hand stitching work to make a repair. He loves them and would wear them all year if he could.",
