Pretty good low-end, bass sound...not a lot of high-end treble sound (but using the TVs speakers for treble seems to work well). My only criticism is that you have to separately turn on and off the Bose via the remote. I haven't found an on/off switch on the unit itself...but I'll keep looking!

It rounds out the sound a bit, but has one serious downside: If you have a dvr cable box, it magnifies and over transmits the background noise from the box. This isn't a problem with regular TV shows, but with news or talk channels, it can get distracting.",

I don't know how well the base would sound in a larger room, but for a smallish room it sounds pretty good. I do wish that the system had buttons on it, because it is completely dependent on the remote, so don't lose it!",
