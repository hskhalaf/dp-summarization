Also, that the opening is tight when positioning clothes towards the back - I burned my knuckles.",

The children is gone but due to medical conditions, I do not like to stand a lot because of pain issues and this appliance helps prevent long periods of getting this task done.",

Additionally, all LCD displays are only in Metric. Frustrating. Also, this is not a time saver at all! I suppose it might be a money saver since it reduces trips to the dry cleaner. However, I'm at the point that a trip to the dry cleaner is better for my nerves.",
