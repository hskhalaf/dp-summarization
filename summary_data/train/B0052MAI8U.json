One of the best things is that because the case looks so great I oftentimes close my laptop just for the look instead of leaving it open and allowing it to sleep like I did before without a case. And I have noticed a significant decrease in getting anything on my screen or keyboard. It really has helped prevent my MacBook from looking older or messy. Great fit too!",

It's not like I was particularly hard on the zipper. It just completely ripped off while I was opening it one day. Otherwise, it's a great looking case and protects the laptop well. Is this a known issue? Is there any recourse from the seller at this point? I purchased it in August and began using it in September. Two months later, the zipper is dead and I can't close is securely.",

I love to open these up and smell the leather and the look is amazing. I carry mine into work all the time and it is disregarded as a large book. Occasionally someone will compliment the beauty of the \"book\" to which I tell them it is my computer case. The inside is soft and velvet and will protect the finish whereas the functionality is great in that I never have had any over heating issues that are sometimes problematic on some cases. The case is a bit pricey, but it is a premium look and premium quality.",

I was happy to see that the Vintage Brown case was what came in the mail (it got higher reviews and it matches the BookBook phone case I have as well). Very nicely made, fits well, zipper works with no difficulties. And the best part....it was $20 cheaper on Amazon than it is on the TwelveSouth website! I do love a deal!",

I ended up buying a snap on case and laptop bag, but am keeping my BookBook because I'll probably use it again in the future. It is bulky, and quite expensive.

I'm going to be most unhappy if it doesn't hold up. And oh yes, the last one: the two flimsy elastic pieces to hold it in the case are just that: flimsy.

I've incurred one scratch to the case, which adds to the antique look (and clearly saved my laptop). Occasionally, the little elastic tabs that hold the cover in place come off, but in my experience this has been due to me opening the case upside down (i.e., user-error). Otherwise, the elastic tabs work just fine. So if like me you use a backpack, I highly recommend this case.",

It is snug, I have to make sure the computer is placed just right and tight in there before getting zipper all the way up, but it's just lovely. Just wanted to let anyone who is considering covering their Lenovo with this that it DOES work!",

I enjoy using my MacBook so much more with this cover. The 'con' if there is one, is that the bottom isn't held into place by any straps. But still no big deal.

Just depends on what kind of case you are looking for. This one works for me.",

The reason I gave it a 4/5 is because I am constantly worried that I'm going to mess it up when I put it down on a public table or that it'll get a big scratch from rubbing against something in my bag; maybe I should scotchguard it? Also, I've been talking with friends on public when people will walk up to me and interrupt to ask about it. My last complaint is the there should have been elastic on the top and bottom to hold the bottom portion of the laptop more securely in the case.",

But other than that, we are enjoying the case. Definitely will be recommending to friends. Thanks Amazon for a great price!",
