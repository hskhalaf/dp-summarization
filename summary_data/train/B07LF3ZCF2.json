Bottom line is you can inflate either Schrader valves or presta valves with no additional attachments. The adapter is built into the hose.",

I am tired of pumps with the rubber compression fitting, they start to become difficult to remove and cause air losses. Also, this pump seems more efficient at getting air into the tire, not sure if that is true but it sure feels like it.",
