      "verdict": "Overall, the Air Jordan XI Retro is more popularly bought as a collectible or worn as a casual sneaker rather than a performance basketball shoe. Although it is a solid performer on-court, for its price of $220, many testers say that there are other shoes with better technologies at cheaper prices.",
      "pros": [
        "Majority of the users purchased the shoe due to its aesthetic appeal, saying that the Air \u00a0Jordan XI Retro was a \"head turner",
        "The Craftsmanship and quality of the shoe are good according to most of the reviewers",
        "Many of the testers appreciate the mix of solid and clear rubber in the outsole",
        "the hard rubber grips the floor when the sticky rubber starts to attracts dust",
        "Some players love how the padded mesh on the upper is breathable",
        "Most of the buyers are re-purchasers of the Jordan 11, commenting that the shoe brought nostalgia",
        "The upper provides good lockdown, shares a few testers",
        "A couple of users like how the upper is stiff enough to offer foot support",
        "It feels like the first Zoom Kobe Protro of Nike hugging the ankle"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some notice that the forefoot feels tight, adding that the leather takes some time to stretch",
        "One tester even feels uncomfortable because the material keeps rubbing on his pinky toe",
        "Many reviewers say that the due to the stickiness of the clear rubber on the outsole, dust clings very fast to it, making it necessary for them to do regular wipes",
        "A few shoe owners experience unexplainable squeaking with their shoes"

The Friday the shoes were supposed to be delivered, they sat on a FedEX truck over the weekend until Monday morning. they did make me the \"first delivery that day dropping them off @ around 7:06am. That kinda made up for waiting all day Friday.",
