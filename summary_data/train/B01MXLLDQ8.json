      "text": "Horrible this is my 4th dji drone and I have never had so many issues. I upgraded from the P4 and now I'm sorry I did. 1st the cam seemed nice although I only got 2 videos. On the 4th of July was flying at a distance of 400ft and alt of 200 just doing some city skyline pics with fireworks in the background. Drone lost signal and as I walked closer trying to regain control. I got to 50 ft away drone still would not communicate but was desending and at however at about ft drone shutdown and dropped like a rock a 1500 dollal rock. Total trash! Camera snapped off never did locate it. Drone fell into fountain.",
