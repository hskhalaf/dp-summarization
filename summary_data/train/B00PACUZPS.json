They are made strong and have held up great the last month and a half we\u2019ve been using them. I rotate them daily and they don\u2019t seem to have any wear as of yet! They are extremely easy to clean and great for the environment, you won\u2019t be sorry you tried them.",

The coffee tastes great and you still get the convenience of one cup at a time. When the cup is brewed you just throw out the grounds and the paper filter and rinse off this reusable filter. Nothing could be easier. Comes four in a pack in case you want to have one cup brewing while you prepare another.......a coffee assembly line.",

The water comes out way too fast to soak up any of the coffee grounds and wala, you have your watered down coffee.",
