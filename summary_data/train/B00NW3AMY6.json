I pushed it and it snapped in and seemed fine. 3 months later, I started having issues with the camera not taking pictures, freezing up, turning on record and not being able to stop it. I have performed countless hard resets, called HTC and now just got rejected for a warranty claim because they said the item wasn't new when I got it. I contacted HTC in November, which puts my purchase at 5 months old. HTC will not warrant the product and I am stuck with a paperweight. I will never purchase from this seller again.",

The camera will still work but it's so much more usefull with the phone app. The wide angle pix are great but no viewfinder seems to be a problem for people.

I love the discreet design and turn on by grip function, not a lot of complexity, very user friendly. Not having a screen to see what your photos would come out like took a little getting use to, but the wide screen shot captures pretty much everything in the aimed direction, just takes a little editing after the fact.",

There is no information on how to change the date and time setting. The battery is the weakest I have ever seen. It last about 2 30 second recordings if not wired directly to a computer. The record button is next to impossible to tell when it is recording or not. I had thought about using this as a dashcam but I see it would not be of any use as that. My recommendation, don't waste your money.",

Grip sensor turns it on when you pick it up, and a single button takes photos with a tap and videos with a press. Wide-angle lens replaces the need for a viewfinder, and waterproof construction replaces the need for a case.",
