      "text": "Not a suitable smartphone. Contains the software necessary to download smartphone apps and make data connections, but does not possess the RAM necessary to properly run any apps. Would recommend LG Volt or models of equivalent caliber and price range. I have tried the Event and other similar Virgin Mobile models - smartphone analogs sold at prices less that $100. All were disappointing in similar ways: an evident compromise made between providing the expected functionality of a smartphone, while being forced to include low-quality software/hardware in order to sell the device in a lower price range. Not worth the money saved. Make a $50-80 greater investment; those phones will be the perfect Low-End Smartphone you're seeking.",

I bought it for my 4yo son to play with (Angry Birds, taking pictures, watching movies, etc), and it's great for that. The only huge disadvantage is that it's difficult and risky to root this phone, and there are no custom roms or software upgrades available because the bootloader is locked tight. Kyocera will not release access, because it is against their agreements with the service providers. In other words, if you don't want to do anything other than use it as shipped and get apps from Google Play, it's perfect. If you enjoy tinkering with your phone, this is not for you.",

So, in all had 8 of these phones and none of them worked properly. Virgin Mobile even offered to replace them again but at this point I gave up on the phones and called it a lost!

This phone turns off and on all by itself. It barely gets reception ANYWHERE. I'm a little surprised that Virgin Mobile is still in business. I sent the phone back with the whole month of service still on it. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!",

      "text": "Felt very cheaply built. Battery life was dismal, maybe 5 hours with little use. Issues connecting to internet. Just before I decided to send it back, the screen stated going black and took a few seconds to get it to respond again. Only had for 2 weeks before sending back. Would not recommend Virgin Mobile or this phone. Nice customer service, but don't know how to do anything but work off scripts.",
