      "text": "I bought this unit to have alkaline water and Ionized antioxidant water. I have well water and the Ph level is 9.2, I could still tell he difference in the water. It was smoother and more refreshing. I measured the ORP for the daily drinking and it was not to my liking so I called them and they asked me to try different things, it got better but still was not satisfied. The gentleman sent me a mineral filter free of charge, I installed it and the ORP dropped. The product is great and customer service is second to none, they really want you to be happy with their product and stand behind it.",
