I fixed this by using a Dremel to cut out the posts, then used an exacto knife to clean up the cuts and then patched both the inside and outside of the holes in black duck tape. It's nothing fancy but my bow fits nicely now. I still gave it 5 stars because this is a low cost decent case for many other smaller bows.",
