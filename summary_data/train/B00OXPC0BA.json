There are no side pockets for storage. But none of that matters because what you're actually here for is the price. The price is so insanely low compared to other brands you kind of forget all the downsides. If you're doing long runs this isn't for you. If you like water to taste like water this isn't for you. If you need accessible storage - again this isn't for you. But if you want cheap and good enough to get by on a medium run or hike this is perfect.",

Since then, it\u2019s been great. I use on runs of 10 to 20 miles and find it comfortable and convenient. The chest strap is oddly small. But, I do not have a big chest, so that\u2019s been OK for me. UPDATE: The bladder sprung a leak in the seam. I have contacted Teton because it occurred during the warranty period for that component. I have heard nothing since the automated email reply ... more than a week ago. Disappointing!",

After taking 20 minutes to try to find the problem, I came up empty handed, but could clearly see where the water was leaking out where the hose connected to the bottom of the bag. I'd love to have to alter my review to a 5 star, but first I need a working bag!",

      "text": "I like the pack just fine, unfortunately after only about 4 months (maybe 8 uses) the bladder developed a leak on the bottom seam. This makes it un-usable unless you like water dripping down your back. I'm now looking to get a replacement, but not sure if i should bother with Teton or change to another brand. I have another popular brand, but it is a larger pack, and i prefer the lower weight. Not sure if this is a prevalent issue so i giving 3 stars in order to be fair.",

The bladder it came with is hard to drink out of and leaks a bit. I decided to keep packaging for leak protection, just leave the bladder inside the plastic bag after filling, then place back into the backpack.",

I thought it may have to do with the hose, it\u2019s super super long and I coiled it around inside the pack. But after taking it out, still nothing!!! I had to stop, undo everything and take water directly from the bladder for the rest of my run, I was soooo bummed! I guess you get what you pay for with this cheaper model. I returned the item with no problems",
