      "text": "The sound is good and the cables are virtually impossible to tangle but the flat cables are quite heavy and they always snag on clothing. The weight of the cable seems to pull down on the earphones causing pressure on the ears or the phones to fall out. I have to wear them with the cable under my shirt or jacket to stop the cable flapping around and pulling down. Also the flat edges of the cable rub against clothing more than a round cable, which you hear through your earphones. So it's best to use them when you're not moving. I will stick to cloth covered cable in the future.",

Until lately, i thought i should try it again because the sound quality was good, but this fifth is also a faulty product! I have to return them!!",

Warranty is 24 months so no replacement. This is the last time I'm buying Jays. The flat cable excels at keeping it tangle-free, but it creates a lot of noise in the ears (you hear it \"cracking\") at the slightest movement of the cable e.g. when walking etc. I didn't even try running with these but it would not be impressive I suspect.

The amplitude of vibration produced by an object such as a speaker driver is proportional to the change of pressure generated as the wave moves through the medium which surrounds it (such as air). Therefore, the amplitude of a sound wave is commonly measured by its pressure level. \n\n The decibel is a non-dimensional, logarithmic scale to denote a relative change in the strength of a signal or wave. When placed in the context of sound pressure level; it measures the nominal threshold of human hearing, relative to the quietest sound audible to the human ear. \n\n The frequency of instances where a sound wave reaches its peak during a period of time is measured in Hz (hertz). This is the number of complete cycles per second. Human hearing is limited to frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.\n\nSENSITIVITY AND IMPEDANCE\n Earphone sensitivity is measured in Sound Pressure Level (SPL). This is essentially a measurement of how loud or easily driven a pair of earphones is. The sensitivity is also influenced by the drivers\u2019 coil impedance which varies over the frequency range. The higher the SPL and the lower the impedance the more easily driven your earphones will be. \n\nWith JAYS Headset Control app you can change volume, skip songs, voice control and much more. And of course it\u2019s free and can be downloaded from Google Play.\nClick here for a larger image\n\nTHIS IS JAYS - LOVE MUSIC\nOur mission started out in Sweden in a small scale with a global scope of not letting go when it comes to stronger musical experiences in the canvas of all people\u2019s everyday life.
