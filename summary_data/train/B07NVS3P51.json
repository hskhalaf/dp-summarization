In a way, that\u2019s enjoyable, but I really wanted it to taste like Oreos. If I use my imagination, they almost do, but I\u2019m kidding myself.

      "text": "The protein bars had melted at some point in time before I received them. Either during storage or while being shipped. So they had an old dried out chocolate look to them. It affected the taste of them as well. I went ahead and ate them but I will not order anymore of these because I'm guessing I'll get the same outcome.",
