And now I see they have raised the price of these packs by 50%! COURAGE! Do not bother with these scammers. These are seriously inferior batteries that will fail within a year -- now at 50% higher price!!",

It ran in 6 screws and was dead again so I returned it and purchased a 3.0Ah from same supplier. It also was also no good after running in 9 screws. Since Makita has made these obsolete, I suspect there are no good replacements. I ordered a similar one a year ago and it charged and was trash after about 4 recharges.",
