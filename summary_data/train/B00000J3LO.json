It will definitely serve the purpose for everyday use, and I have no doubts it will be sharp for printing. If you want to step up your resume or presentation/ handout game, definitely try nicer paper!!! People notice.",

Low quality paper apparently produces too much dust and clogs things up. Plus the individual sheets tend to stick together when feeding through a home printer. This paper is much smoother and sturdier than cheaper papers, and accepts ink for readily without bleeding. It is not intended to be presentation paper quality, which would obviously be higher priced, and it certainly is not good for printing quality photos. However, from now on I will only use this paper for my home office and avoid the cheaper stock.",

If prices stay this good, I'll be buying this and other paper products through Amazon in the future. Granted, it can take a bit of work searching through all the options available to find exactly what one wants at the best price. But yes, it is better than driving to Office Depot or Staples. Well done Amazon.",
