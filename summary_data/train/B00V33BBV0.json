The plastic will turn into an ice box quickly and you won't feel your toes after 10-15 minutes with just ordinary socks. Also, make sure you get the boots for wide calf.

      "text": "Love these boots! Look great, roomy enough for big socks or boot socks but not too roomy without. Love the buckle for adjusting for bigger calves. Mine are 15-15.5 inches or so and these open up fashionably to allow up to 17 inches around. I want a green pair SO BAD but they have no 8s in that color \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m gonna live in these! Already wore them out to the pumpkin patch and plan to wear them for the rainy week ahead! Best rain boots I\u2019ve purchased.",
