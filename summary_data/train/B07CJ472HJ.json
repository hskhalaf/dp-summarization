Before running 30 miles the sole started to break off to the point where one of the pads completely split and fell off. I returned this pair and received a new pair and the new pair have again started to break (see photos). My logged miles on this new pair of shoes in the photos is 40 miles, have never had an issue buying this shoe from a brick and mortar so I question the authenticity of the product sold.",

Because of the prominent heel counter rather than the rollover or zero drop of the Hoka's, I don't have any sense of losing balance. And when walking, the fatigue I feel in my lower back is much better, probably because I'm not fighting for balance all the time.",

The effect of these shoes was nothing short of magical. My foot pain diminished over the course of the first week and then disappeared. I began walking two miles a day, then three, and after a month I resumed running--all pain free. It is now six months later they are wearing well, with none of the foot problems I had experienced before. Big fan.",

Have tried motion control shoes in the past but these do the trick, with no problems even on long runs, and they're lighter & more comfortable. With any running shoe the fit is important. The Mizuno Wave Inspires happen to fit my feet just right: relatively narrow and snug at the heel, so the shoe doesn't slide down off the foot. Good for all surfaces from concrete to dirt, and a durable product as well. If the shoe fits you, I recommend it.",
