(i wasnt clear if there was a total of 3 or 4......theres a total of 3. The tent is shaped kinda like a fidget spinner. also room dividers are just hang down flaps that do not zip. The tent itself is great though and went up easy and quick. :)",

My recommendation is to by camp dry spray with it... like maybe 6 cans... because honestly most tents that you buy nowadays are not completely rain proof. But this goes up easy and as long as you make sure all walls and lines are as taut as possible you will be fine. Our first excursion was extremely windy and rainy and we were fine even with our campsite being slightly flooded we were dry. Kids love camping in their tent \"castle\".",

We used it 4 days in a row in 4 different locations and thankfully the set up is quick since out of no where we were hit with a summer storm- hail included! It handled the storm and didn\u2019t leak. It\u2019s comfortably spacious, we had 4 large cots plus a large dog cage and cat kennels and we still had plenty of room. I would definitely purchase this again and I highly recommend this rent!",

This thing has flimsy written all over it, not to mention the middle poles don't even touch the ground. I mean not even close. They're about 8\" off! The floor seems thin, zippers cheap, fabric and mesh super thin. The hubs where you fold the tent up collapse if the tent is tugged in one direction or the other, no matter how well you have it staked down. For almost $300 this should at least work for one camping trip. I don't say this often about anything, but, DO NOT BUY.",
