I thought it was a little pricey at first but since I\u2019ve started using this mist it has replaced all other skin moisturizing products which contributes to the savings. I use this product twice a day, morning and night. The fine mist bottle goes on so light and evenly there\u2019s no need to even touch your face to rub in, it absorbs quickly and keeps skin hydrated all day with no greasy feel or residue and can be used sparingly. One bottle last about 3 months for me. Will continue using!",

I\u2019ve always bought from an Eminence dealer/salon and was very hesitant to buy my products now from Amazon (since I\u2019ve moved) from some of the reviews I\u2019ve read about products being old, used, and etc. Since I\u2019ve used this product for awhile, I was quickly able to discern the quality/age of product. It was nice to receive it wrapped in unopened plastic. Product was fresh and new and I\u2019m so very pleased. I don\u2019t remember what I paid for this in the past, but I\u2019m more a person of convenience and this purchase was fast, fresh, and convenient!! Thank you!! Will buy again as my other products run low.",
