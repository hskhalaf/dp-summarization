The warranty clearly states \" free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of 10 years.\" I was not able to have it installed for 3 years from purchase. It sat safely in the box. The arrogant person on the phone told me about a 90-day open box policy. This was not stated in the warranty. It is very difficult to get a person on the phone to get help. Bottom line, beautiful product but customer service is terrible.",

For that I would have given it 4 stars, but it just looks so nice and works so great I couldn't downgrade it because of that",
