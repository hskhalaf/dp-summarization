      "text": "This is a fantastic game! Although it is kinda linear just like a regular 2D Mario game, the 3D space and movement make it great! There's lots of levels to explore and plenty of secrets to look for. Most importantly, this game makes great use of the 3D effect of the 3DS systems. Several levels are designed in such a way that the depth illusion that comes with the 3D effect allows you to find secrets much faster than without it. Even though it is perfectly playable in 2D, I would highly recommend switching on the 3D effect if your system supports it. Haven't finished the game yet, but I'm loving it more the more I play it :D",
