      "verdict": "A classic shoe with a touch of modern technology comes the Converse Chuck II Low Top. As a successful make-over of the Chucks All Star, the shoe still keeps its classic image while providing enhanced comfort, better support, exact fit, and a more trendy appeal.Though the price of this kick is slightly higher compared to the original Chucks, it still falls directly at a budget-friendly price range. With the aesthetically classic vibe the Converse Chuck II Low Top gives off, one can never go wrong with these sneakers.",
