      "text": "My wife and I were trying to figure out a better arrangement for our kids to do their homework. Our dining room table was getting way too cluttered. We saw these at a big box craft store for considerably more money. When we found them on Amazon, we went ahead and bought two. These are pretty easy to put together. All of the parts were labeled, and the directions were clear. Because they are art desks, the table top will lay flat or lift up to an angle. Each of the kids chose a slightly different angle. The canvas drawers are handy for keeping their supplies organized. Overall, we're very happy with this purchase.",

We got near the end and unboxed the tabletop for the last few steps and found that despite having packaging protectors, one corner was completely broken. The outer packaging doesn\u2019t show any signs of damage. I\u2019m also not able to get the screws tight into the stool - not sure why. The desk regardless looks really great and feels sturdy - but had to give a 3. I\u2019ve contacted the seller and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll send me a replacement top soon!
