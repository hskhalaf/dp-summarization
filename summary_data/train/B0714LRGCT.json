I think the company erred on the side of caution in making the scent lighter. I'm perfectly content with the scent level. When I want a stronger lavender scent, I add a few drops of essential lavender oil. (Mind you, I have an enormous corner tub.) I ordered this instead of the Amazon brand I last ordered to give it a try. I do like the bag closure and scent on this one better. This is the one that I'll be buying in the future.",
