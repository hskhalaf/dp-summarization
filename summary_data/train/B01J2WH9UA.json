I am 5'11\" weight 175 lbs and ordered a men's medium based on sizing guidelines and other reviewers' inputs. It fit perfectly so I decided to order another short-sleeve and a long-sleeve jersey.

They immediately offered to send me the next size up saying sometimes the manufacturer slightly varies the size by color. Rather than risking a xahirt that could be too large I suggested they send me one in hi-vis orange. It fits exactly like the yellow. I would definitely recommend this shirt.

Finally, the zipper works fine and opens fairly deep for ventilation. I don't know much, but this one works for me.",

I could probably fit into the large and it would have that skin tight fit that many like, but I prefer just a little bit of room and this size accomplished that. Material is very light and comfortable.",

The moisture wicking properties are really appreciated. I like that it is a very vibrant color. On country roads, it increases my visibility for quite a ways. The elastic around the waist does take a bit of getting used to.",

Turns out this was a 3XL, which explains the good fit (and again, I'm 6-3, 245). On the other hand, I just received a 3XL from Strgao, and while I'll keep it, it doesn't fit as well as this one. So if you're a larger guy, Spotti works for comfort, other brands might be a bit wilder with the styles.",
