The nail polish dries quickly, even the (oops) super-thich coats I applied on some nails. My nails feel strong. This is awesome nail polish... better than the toluene-laced polish! Note: I buffed my nails before the base coat. Applied the base coat, 2 coats of color, and then the top coat. PS This nail polish, though formaldehyde- and tolene-free still smells like regular polish. I wasn't expecting that. \ud83e\udd14",
