The quality is better than I expected, very durable outside, soft inside, well constructed, good size. I use this everyday and really enjoy it. I do not have that much jewelry so I can for everything with room. If you have a lot of jewelry it may be too small. See my photos to help. I would buy this for a friend and definitely recommend.",

      "text": "Outstandingly well made (!!!!)....only issue is that they placed a mirror where users would be better served had they placed necklace hooks and a skirt of fabric to secure them. There simply is not enough necklace space, and placing more than one in a slot risks tangling. It\u2019s disappointing that they didn\u2019t take the opportunity for hanging space. After trying to figure out a way to ingeniously add hanging space, I finally returned it for a much lower quality box (ugh) that managed to hold more.",

I don't have to hunt for anything; it's all there in the compartments. A hint for others: I use tiny plastic bags to keep my chains separated and untangled. The bags are actually for pills and usually can find them in the drug/pill section of the store. I also use these bags for dog treats to put in my pocket so my pants don't get dirty (especially is the treat has any oil in the ingredients)-- works great.",

I've been using a Lori G armoire with mirror for several years and am just tired of its bulkiness. This leather box is sleek and classy. I'll probably have to order another to fit everything, but it is so worth it!",
