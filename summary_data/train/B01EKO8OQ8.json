It not only saves me a lot of trips to the local laundromat, but it can handle dirty clothes (if really dirty from soil and working outdoor, you might want to soak them in a bucket of hot water to remove oil stains and avoid having too much dirt in the machine) and clean them properly. I also use it for sheets (full size), bath towels and all my clothing. I truly love it. Look no further and get this one if you are trying to find an alternative to a laundromat and a regular washing machine.",

As long as you understand that the cords are short so it needs to be close to electrical outlet, water, and drainage (ie:toilet, sink, tub) you will be fine. No surprises. The dryer has a small surface space so dry in sections. Don't overload. That's it. Enjoy!",

It does not say this in the product description. How hard would it have been to add this to the description? Other than that it works well, not noisy, and the spin mode works great if you can get it balanced correctly.",

This machine saves us so much time when paired with our new portable dryer. The washer isn't as big as a normal washer, but it will wash all of our family's laundry (2 adults, 1 child) relatively quickly and conveniently since we don't have to travel up or down any stairs--it's right in our kitchen.",

      "text": "This is a great washer for our RV. It is lightweight and does a very good job cleaning the clothes. The high speed spin means that clothes need very little drying time on a rack. We have run about fifty loads through and it works well and reliably. Use HE detergent and fabric softener to reduce sudsing. It requires very little detergent for the clothes to come out clean. The only thing that could be improved is the length of the filler hose that comes with the machine, and that is easily extended by a trip to a hardware store.",

It is very easy to use, pretty self explanatory stuff. It holds up to about 13 lbs of a load. I wouldn\u2019t recommend using too much detergent when using this product since it causes colors to run.

They are very tight and takes quite a bit of effort to turn them especially the drain knob. they are very flimsy and mine broke after few uses (within a month)",

BUT for the size and price im please with what It can do.",

This machine has got some power to it. It washes clothes very well and you just need to use a small amount of soap. If you use too much soap you have to keep refilling water to rinse the soap out of your clothes. Its a little extra work, but totally worth it to have clean laundry and not have to go to the laundry mat. Just handle this machine with care and it should work fine.",

This isn't a set it and forget it machine, but it's going to save us from spending our every Saturday at the laundry mat and the bonus is that it will pay itself off in less than three months. The fill and drain hoses are both WAY too short and that is why I docked one star from the rating. We are actually letting it drain into our toilet as that is the farthest it can reach. We can work with it and overall are very happy with the purchase.",
