      "text": "I originally purchased a 5-in-1 Weather Station and Weather Sensor in August, 2015. The Weather Sensor worked fine for awhile. However, just 15 months later the temperature sensor on the Weather Sensor failed. Because it could not be replaced, I had to buy another complete Weather Sensor.. The temperature gauge in the second one failed just over a year later and the wind direction \u201crudder\u201d froze and can\u2019t be fixed. I do live on the coast but Acurite said \u201cno problem\u201d. Their Weather Sensors are inferior as far as I have experienced. I\u2019m going with Davis Instruments or Ambient Weather products hereafter. Way better quality but worth the price.",

Supposedly an internal solar-powered fan is supposed to keep the temperature accurate. It doesn't. Secondly the humidity sensor quit after 14 months - just out of warranty. (Purchased in March 2015). Newer stations apparently have a humidity replacement sensor that you can purchase and install yourself. Mine is \"too old.\" I would not recommend this station. Other experiences with Acu-Rite instruments are also poor. They simply don't last beyond warranty date.",

The highest wind peak we recorded was only 22mph but we're very protected with massive pine trees all around our property. The indoor display is very bright and attractive. It lights up the whole kitchen at night. Several of our friends have looked at it and want one now. It is 1/4th cost of our last weather station and does almost all the same things.

When you look at the display from an upward angle the numbers disappear. Not a big enough problem to drop it down to 4 stars, however something that you may need to be aware of if you plan on mounting it on the wall like I did. I just dropped it down a few inches to remedy this.",

Screws in plastic aren't supposed to be taken out that often. Now screws won't stay in. The machine works great at first but gets pretty frustrating, pretty fast.

The problem is, that when the sun hits the unit the little fan, which is solar powered, cannot compensate for the heat generated by the sun hitting the unit's case. The result is that the recorded temperatures are elevated by as much as 10 to 20 degrees! AcuRite needs to fix this issue. I have placed a secondary temperature sensor in the shade in order to get an accurate temperature reading.",
