      "text": "This clumps fairly well (tends to break into smaller clumps so not great but ok) and very little dust which was important. But DOES NOT cover the smell! I don't want a scented litter as I dislike having my cats smell like fake flowers but as I am currently in transit and living in small spacing, covering their potty smell is important and I've had to ventilate my room every day! Not doing the job of keeping the smell down, trying another kind as I have had better luck with other types of Tidy Cats.",

This makes it very hard to clean the litter box unless you're willing to take a garden hose to it in your back yard.",
