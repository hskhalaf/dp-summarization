      "text": "Worked like a charm. I ordered this clothes shaver when I pulled out our fall and winter clothes and saw they weren't in as good a shape as I remembered. I left them in the boxes until I got the shaver, then washed them all and shaved them one right after the other, molding the sweaters to my knees first and using a light touch. I was done in no time, and the shaver was very effective! No problems with snags, it didn't eat the batteries too quickly like some do, and the pills and puffs were gone!",

I usually have to run over the same piece many times. the cheaper ones I usually get at Christmas time in drugstores as stocking stuffers. These will snag is you are not careful but they work soooo much faster and better. There is a learning curve to them but it did not take 45 min for one shirt. My plan is to keep this one till Chirstmas and get a cheap one probably 2 cause well they are cheap.",

Luckily this shaver is able to clean it up a bit, give it a nice trim. The functionality of it could be improved as that clear plastic area that collects the fuzz balls will dislodge from use because it's part of the handle. And once it falls off, you'll have to hurriedly attempt to contain the mess. All in all, it's pretty good.",
