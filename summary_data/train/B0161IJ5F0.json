Early conversations around the light bulb went something like this: \"honey can you turn out the light?\" \"I can't, I don't know where my phone is.\" -or- \"I can't the router went down.\" But now we're pretty set! The bulb can actually be turned off/on easily using the regular switches, even if the phone isn't around. I didn't realize this. I highly recommend using the \"widgets\" available (at least for android) so that you can easily press a \"scene\" button on your phone without having to navigate to the app. I have two, one for \"relaxed\" and one for \"bright.\" PS. Take a poll of the room before you surprise people with the strobe mode!",
