Our first bag was perfect, but with this order, I'm very disappointed in Amazon. The bag looks like it was exposed to both heat & strong sunlight; the plastic is separating in spots and the bag actually \"crunches\" when handled. As I understand it, Ziwipeak calls for their food to be stored away from such conditions. It doesn't look like there's any perforations, but very disappointed at Amazon's quality control. That bag shouldn't have made it out of the warehouse.",

My sister's dog is a super picky eater so I suggested she try it and he loves the food and gobbles it up!! What they put into it is nothing but the best, and that is what I want for my dogs!!!",

When we come upon a new dog, they aren't interested because it doesn't smell much, BUT once they eat the first one, most dogs LOVE it!! Recently the product must have changed because it's harder than it used to be. Probably so it doesn't break as easily as it used to, but it still a great product. I used to feed this product to my underweight foster dogs as their meals to help them get better faster. I can't say enough about how great ZiwiPeaks are.",

Use with caution and adjust accordingly so that your dog can still concentrate on the training. It might drive some dogs into distraction. I found some even preferred this food over some cooked pork loin I had left over and had cut into small training treats! That was a first.
