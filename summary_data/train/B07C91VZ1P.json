This bag does not fit all 3mm-6mm mats as the description claims. My 5mm 23\" wide mat will not fit. My 3mm 25\" wide mat might fit if I fold it in half lengthwise before I roll it. I'm very disappointed. Keep looking if you have a thicker mat, even if it is only 23\" wide.",

I was concerned that the stress on the zipper, might cause tearing, long term, but the seams eased out and the fabric relaxed and it's actually a great fit for our mat. These are fairly sturdy mats, a little bit higher thickness, but not too crazy. I wouldn't recommend this bag for extra long or extra thick mats, but for a medium weight, it's a great fit and beautifully made!",

The adjustable strap is long enough to sling across my chest; hopefully it will work with a winter coat as well. The zipper is convenient for taking the mat in and out. If the zipper holds up, this will be a terrific bag on all counts. Plus I love the design, and you can't beat the price.",
