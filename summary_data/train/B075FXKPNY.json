I only have one complaint and that is: there is no power source selection switch. It apparently chooses on his own where the power is coming from. So if you have the rechargeable battery and alkaline batteries installed, you don't really know which one is powering the radio at any given time. Still, I can say that I can recommend this product to anyone who is considering it.",

Solar cells provide plenty of power to recharge the battery. Like another reviewer said I don't think it will survive a lot of rough handling. I was extremely surprised by how clear the NOAA channels sound. FM is great, AM not so much. A serious SW buff will be disappointed; you need digital tuning to really zero in on certain frequencies, but for the price I can highly recommend this radio. Buy it!",

I ordered a second one to be sent to my 80+ year old aunt, and she is also impressed. It is easy for her to operate and the radio reception is clear.",

If you press on the knob, it'll function, but just turning the knob does nothing. Charging the onboard 'rechargable' overnight yielded about 5-10 minutes of run time, so the radio seemingly needs AA batteries for any extended operation. There is also no way to manually switch between the AA batteries and the Rechargeable battery. Decent sound, but poor build quality and its heavy dependency on AA batteries make this radio pointless as an emergency radio.",

This is a very useful radio all the great features the FreePlay didn\u2019t have like the flashlight, reading light, Weather radio, short wave channels emergency siren, SD Card and the rechargeable lithium battery and AA battery options. Great radio at a nice price!",

The solar panel works: I put into a spot where it got daily direct sunlight for a few weeks and got a good hour of radio use out of it. The lights are bright: not tactical quality by any means, but can do in a pinch for a spotlight or emergency flashlight. The reading light is also conveniently placed for easy reading. I don't think it would hold up to a lot of rough usage, but for at-home use, it does just fine.",

      "text": "I used this radio on a daily basis for many months and became very frustrated with it. The slider switch that changes frequencies from FM, AM, etc. became faulty and made it difficult to stay in a mode. I would have to tap the device to get it to click into the frequency. Also, the volume control knob didn't offer a smooth adjustment when turning the volume up or down. Further, the tuning knob is like operating a hair trigger. The slightest movement can change the channel. I wouldn't recommend this product.",
