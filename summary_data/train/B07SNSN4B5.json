The cushion on the heel is good but not quite what I would want as a distance runner; I prefer the heel more firm to go such long distances. The insole is NOT removable as it is integrated into the sole so don\u2019t expect to put your favorite insole or arch support into this shoe. The aesthetics are flawless.",

The UA HOVR Phantoms are incredible. I originally tried them on at Dicks and found out that they run a little small. I normally wear a size 10.5 but noticed I needed an 11 in these. Overall, the quality is comparable to Boost technology and in some cases I almost feel like it is better. 10/10 recommend this shoe to anyone looking for comfort and support throughout the day!",

Lengthwise, the shoes fit great, but width-wise, they are a little looser than what I've been used to; however, the comfort is excellent, and these are a great substitute for the Nikes I have usually bought.",
