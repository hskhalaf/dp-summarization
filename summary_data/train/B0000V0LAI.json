I am extremely happy with it. There are a lot of nit picking reviews below. However, for this price you cannot beat it.

The only thing is that there are only a few slots on the sides for smaller handle items (broom handle). The other larger ones have a little too much room. We also like the fact, that the shovels and rakes do not touch the floor (yes we painted that too!)",

I took the casters off and modified the base (added a slotted cleat) to keep the butt-end of the poles from sliding out, then put in a bungee on each side to keep each flag in its slot. The flags just clear the ceiling in the storage area and are easily findable and much neater. I like the idea of storing the flags in a respectful, orderly manner.",
