I just bought a mini-ATX case (Rosewill Micro-ATX Mini Tower Computer Case with Dual USB 3.0, Dual Fans and 12.5-Inch Card LINE-M Black) and it is perfect for the mission. Facts: The fins are cheap serrated and sharp aluminum, the heat pipes are in minimal contact with the CPU. The worst aspect is the retainer clips that are crimped on to the cheap aluminum block. It is impossible to attach with out cuts and bleeding. The fan is a joke. Sorry Rosewill, I am not impressed! Please do not purchase this item.",

But this one should NOT have quiet in the name, sounded like a damn helicopter trying to take off, and that was on medium speed. The way the lines com off of radiator are kinda cheesy, they wont turn so you are relegated to installing it how the lines lay and that sometimes doesn't match your case design. I am disappointed in this one. Got a corsair in its place and I can barely hear it when its in performance mode, I mean day and night difference.",

I specifically was looking for a cooler that used push pins so I could swap coolers easily and quickly without removing my computer's motherboard. This unit is affordable, quiet, easy to install, and works much than the OEM unit ever did. I recommend it to anyone who needs a CPU cooler, especially if they are pressed for time. Combine with Arctic Silver MX4 for best results.",
