There are so many positives about this grill I won't bother mentioning, because you probably already know the quality Weber brings. The only con if I had to pick one, is that there are two bolts/nuts that are inside the grill that pop out, so when inserting and removing the cooking grate they sometimes get in the way. Other than that minor issue, this grill is a must have for any griller out there.",

We had a 3 hour window for their arrival, but 10 minutes before the window expired we got an Amazon text saying they wouldn't arrive and to re-schedule. There are terms for that kind of service....and they're all profane. Fortunately if you take your time, even for someone like myself who will never be mistaken for a \"handyman\", assembly is pretty easy. Great product.",

Only needs the small propane cylinder (like the type sold for Coleman stoves, and can be purchased at WalMart or Target), which is so much better than those clunky white tanks.

I always missed the flavor and cooking ease with REAL Charcoal, and now we have that back. This unit was easy to assemble alone (1.5hr.), and had all the parts and no damage during shipment. Everything works perfectly, and is as dependable as every Weber product is. Amazon Fed Ex Shipping was excellent and on-time.",

Cannot understand how the part was damaged given the meticulous packaging and lack of cardboard container having any visible damage. All that to say a great unit works fantastically. Love the propane addition to starting the charcoal chimney. It is a cake walk to grill.",

      "text": "Ok so, the way the bolts attach to the inner grill make it difficult to insert the grill face, unless you angle it just right you can burn your hands at the risk of the grill being uneven. The older model I had didn't have this defect, maybe the person putting it together made a mistake? Other than that it has great temperature control and i use it almost every day. The thick, high quality metal is nice and the large counter space is a plus. The igniter button is also easier to use than previous models. When this one wears out, you can bet ill be buying this brand again!",
