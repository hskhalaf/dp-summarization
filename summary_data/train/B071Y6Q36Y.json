Plugged the external drive on a different laptop, same issue. Unfortunately, I threw away all the packaging the night before, thus I can't return it. Not worth the effort to find a box and send it back. Lessons learned not to throw away packaging so quickly.",

Plugged it into different USB3 ports (same ones that external drives work on just fine) and it does diddly squat. Wasted the media. I should have tried it earlier. Now it's just wasted money and a pile of junk to throw away.",

Also, there is a restriction on region changes which cannot be undone. (Look under properties.) I have written this off as a nearly useless investment. The 9\" cable attached is a minor irritant.",
