The only thing I didn't like was that there is a tag sewn right on the inside of one of the muffs, so it was uncomfortable on her ear. I had to use a stitch picker/seam ripper and remove the tag. It looks fine now and was lightly stitched, but it was kind of a pain to have to take it off.",

But you can carefully cut away the tag and remove it.",

I've had them for about a week and the fuzz is already starting to fall off, and the headband piece is lopsided. It's made of plastic under the knit design, but I'm worried about breaking it if I try to straighten them out because the plastic is so cheap feeling. All in all, for the $10 I paid for them, they're not bad, but certainly not something I'd buy again.",
