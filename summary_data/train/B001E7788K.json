Norton does it's thing without muss/fuss/aggravation. About once a week I get a pop-up letting me know that it's running. That's it. I am Very pleased!",

      "text": "I also installed Norton Antivirus 2009 alongside Zone Alarm firewall and my system froze. Upon installation, Norton Antivirus 2009 directs the user--without explanation--to uninstall Zone Alarm but also offers the option to skip this step (without advising of why Zone Alarm should be uninstalled nor what the consequences of skipping the uninstall of Zone Alarm might be). I have freed up the system by disabling and later uninstalling Zone Alarm however I am none too pleased with Symantec. So how does the new version of Norton Antivirus work compared to the previous version? I have no idea. Any potential improvements were upstaged by the hassles associated with installing it.",
