I even tried dry brushing my face. The face brush is a little stiff but I have used it gently and it does do a good job of exfoliating. But one has to be very gentle with the brushing on the face. Yet I do think it helps my moisturizing routine to absorb better. I would purchase this brush set again.",

I will probably be on the lookout for a better option and will just be calling this body brush a small financial loss.",
