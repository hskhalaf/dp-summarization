The flaw in the design of the case is the lip is too thin, and although the case doesn\u2019t add bulk to ur phone, u lose essential protection. And I would also like to add that my previous case was one I got from apple, and although I always dropped my phone I had NOT even a scratch on the screen.",

Super lightweight, very durable, and the card hold works amazing. I can fit about 4 credit cards for a good fit, 5 is doable but not recommended because it could potentially stretch the case over a long period of having that many cards. Amazing case though, highly recommend! HOWEVER, Do not rely on the protective case it comes with. It\u2019s super cheap and flimsy, get yourself a better tempered glass one that\u2019s at least .3 thickness.",

Simple fix just flip or reverse to protect sensitive aspects better. After about 9 months of continuous use the grip mechanism is just starting to lose its effectiveness slightly.

While the \u201cflavor of the month\u201d decal offers some grip ability the main cover material is stiff and doesn\u2019t have much grip, especially around the outer edges. The case itself sits flush along the edges of the screen but I don\u2019t think that there is enough case bumping off the front of the screen to provide sufficient drop protection. The main point of having a case in the first place is to protect it from drops so it seems to be a fail to start in my opinion.",

The wallet is subtle and as such does not attract anyone\u2019s eye to my cards. Only challenge I\u2019ve had thus far is the wallet is tight and I have to take everything out to get my card/ID etc. However, I keep business cards with me and store them alone with my other wallet stuff (credit card, license). That might make it a wee bit too tight. All in all, if you\u2019re on the fence, perhaps worried about your stuff falling out or being easily visibale, don\u2019t be. This is a sound purchase.",

Holding the bare iPhone to get the SIM card in caused my skin to peel off the areas of hand holding the bare iPhone (think snake-skin-like peeling). Apple said this was probably due to the anti-fingerprint chemical coating. No peeling problem using this case. Thanks, Smartish! Who knew your case could solve a health problem?",
