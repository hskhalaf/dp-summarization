We were sitting outside and she put them on and didn't notice much until she looked up and was able to see blue sky through the leafs on a tree. Prior is was just a big mass of \"green\". We went inside and she was able to see yellows, tans and browns that she has struggled with. I'm not sure if an optometrist could add this to existing lenses but for this price it was totally worth it. For her it worked. I read reviews before purchasing it and it seems the seller does refunds. So if you have tritanomaly I say this product is worh trying.",

It\u2019s nice to see green and blue better since we have green lasers for inspection at work but they won\u2019t let me wear them because they are \u201ctinted\u201d so I haven\u2019t really had the need to wear them much but they are alright. Just wish the lenses weren\u2019t plastic and help out more with yellow side of tritanopia too. And obviously it seems a bit overboard for Tritanomaly but like I said its progressively getting worse so my review may change depending on how bad I get and to see how effective these are for when that happens",
