The charts on their website are great for figuring out the correct case, plus they take into account the size of your protective case. I run a lot and the armband has held up great. My only complaint is with Apple. Since they changed the home button to require an actual finger to click it, it\u2019s not as easy to use my phone in the armband. But the armband came with instructions to get around it by enabling assistive touch. Thanks tunebelt.",

So far the Tune Belt band is one of the best that I have used. Some other covers also made it difficult to use the screen due to the plastic cover however I have not had any issues with the Tune Belt band. The headphone cord option makes running much easier. The only downfall is that the arm band was a little small for my arm however Tune Belt is sending me a band extender. I would definitely purchase this item again.",

This thing is beyond cheap; forget about running in any kind of inclement weather. There is no zipper around the top, there's a hole over the home button, the armband materials are thin and uncomfortable, the plastic over the screen is flimsy and warped out of the box. (Er, plastic bag.) If I had purchased this for 5 bucks from a street vendor I'd consider it money well spent, but for $20 you'd be better off splurging for a better quality product. Avoid at all costs.",
