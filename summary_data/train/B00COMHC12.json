The sound for completion of the toasting cycle is not as loud as the sound of the spring mechanism tripping at the end of the toasting cycle. Update: We still love this toaster. Same quality as when it was new. We have once again found the bliss offered by great toast.",

Maybe i got a defective product and that\u2019s not the way all of the toasters behave .",

Another nice feature is the ability to lift up toasted bread by raising the lever slightly, raising the toast so you don't burn your fingers reaching in to remove the toast. I normally don't write reviews, but was so impressed with this toaster I felt compelled to. Great job Breville.",

Then after almost 8 months the lever broke after light (!) use: once a day for toast in the am. The $20 toaster we had before didn't look as nice but surely did a better job for entire 4 years. Functions should come first, design second. They put too much focus on design w this item.",
