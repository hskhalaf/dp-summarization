      "text": "Great little mower, but not very powerful. If you have any slope at all, gravity will overcome the motors power so it cant climb the slope, resulting in trimmed lower levels and uneven upper levels. Works perfectly on my flat backyard. Easy to use, does what it says, quiet as can be. The worst limitation is the cutting path- it is only 6\" wide. So it takes this mower several days to reach every area, about 5000 sq '. Sometimes the yard looks half cut, but eventually it all evens out. Also have a small robomower that cost much more and this much less expensive mower matches up well.",

They have this in the European market, but for some reason not in the US. If it had this feature here in the US, I would upgrade to a model that has it in a heartbeat.",

      "text": "Takes some tinkering, but I love it. Wish parts were more easily available, such that I could buy a base station for my front yard and have one for the back. As it is setup, my landroid cuts the back every day and it leaves the lawn in perfect shape ( versus me scalping the front every 2 weeks with my push mower. The firmware in my version is a little funky as far as setting the schedule, but I'm sure they have worked through that. This is my third season with it and it's still going strong.",

My yard was just below the stated mowing capacity and I even adjusted the mow area to accommodate the droid. The problem I had was it would run out of battery before returning to the charging base. I had to recover it every day and put it back on the base. I think a small yard would be ideal for this robot mower.",

I then dugg it down selectively (mostly high-traffic areas) to keep the wire from ripping. I had the Landroid get stuck 3 times in the beginning, but after addressing the ground and rerouting the wire it works flawlessly. The manual mentions firmware updates, but I can not find any on the support website. I would definitely buy this again!",

    "description": "Style:Landroid onlyThe Worx Landroid is the pre-programmable robotic mower that lets you customize daily mowing schedules. The Landroid runs 7 days a week giving your lawn a continuous manicured look by giving the grass a trim on a routine basis as opposed to traditional mowers that take off substantial amounts of grass on a less frequent basis. Among its many features, Landroid navigates narrow passages, cuts with precision on slopes angling up to 20 degrees and does it all with zero emissions. If your lawn is under 10750 square feet and you want it to look great every day, the Landroid is designed precisely for you. The Intuitive keypad makes it easy to customize a mowing schedule so your lawn is neatly mowed every day. The low noise operation allows you to mow during the day or night. This allows you to wake up to a freshly mowed lawn every morning. The Landroid runs off of a 28V rechargeable battery so there are zero emissions.",
