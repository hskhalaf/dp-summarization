One pair 'jammed' on the red LED and despite completing the recommended product reset it failed to regain 'life'. Amazon replaced these. The second resorted to playback in 'slow motion' whilst on holiday mid run and then the LED lights failed which the manufacture site as a hardware fail once the recommended product reset is again tried to no avail. For a c.\u00a3100 product this is pretty poor. I have no desire for a 3rd pair so I'll be contacting Amazon for a refund.",

However the biggest problem ive had is the silicone ear tips \u2018loosening\u2019 after 5 months of constant use. As a result they just fall off the headphones with minimal force and I eventually lost them both. A few other people have had this problem but unless you live in the US dont expect any help (customer service is shocking in my opinion). Paying \u00a310-20 for a replacement set is ridiculous. Would not recommend this personally.",

Whilst I don\u2019t know what the weight of the clip is (because, as you may have guessed, I\u2019ve lost it again) I\u2019d guess it weighs about a gram or so; gold is \u00a330 a gram so you\u2019re getting into precious metal territory for this thing.",

Also a real hassle to get in contact with customer support Jaybird. Hate when companies who are happy to charge big money for a product aren't then available for support. Seems a bit sketchy. It's unfortunate because the audio is pretty decent.",

Quality feels really low, cheap plastic compared to other models, e.g. Jaybird X3 Sparta.",
