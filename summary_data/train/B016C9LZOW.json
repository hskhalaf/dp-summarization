It's perfect for middle school or high school kids, with plenty of rooms for books, binders and even laptops/tablets - all at the same time. The padded shoulder straps are a huge bonus, and the quality is simply out of this world. I must also confess that I fell in love with the design/color pattern (Pacific/Pink Chroma), and ended up ordering a second, identical bag for myself for travel. It may say \"Pink\" in the title of the color, but it is more of a red/orange hybrid than pink at all.",

The straps are really well padded, and so is the entire back piece which is great when carrying books and boxes with hard corners. Useful compartments, loads of space, and generally haven't found anything at all that we wish was different. Couldn't ask for more (other than for Under Armor to stop supporting trophy hunting!!!)",
