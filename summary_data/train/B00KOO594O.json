Purchased the medium 4.5\" deep, not much can be stored in that space. Thick case and feels solid, just needs to be a few more inches deeper and 1/2\" wider to accommodate pages to lay flat. For some might not matter. In my case, important docs and papers should not end up being curled. Poor design in that respect. Feels overpriced if it will not allow for common USA size as advertised and described.",

Almost any fire box can be opened by dropping it from waist height on its corner onto a hard surface.

But it fits a standard size sheet of paper okay, it has a handle, and it has a locking mechanism that works. Is it 100% theft proof. No? I paid around $50 for it and didn't expect it to. Will it protect my documents and important things from damage and provide mild theft protection. You bet. That's all I wanted and that's all I expected from a $50 portable safe.",

Rather, the locking mechanism worked fine, but would pull completely out from the box if I tried to use the handle, thus opening the box while it was still \"locked\". I tried numerous times at assembly. Seems like it would work, but failed every time. On one occasion, the entire lower segment flew off and hit me in the face. I'm unsure why the lower segment of the locking mechanism would not be permanently attached to the box. Also, there is not mention of self-assembly, so I was not anticipating that. Such a hassle to return such a heavy item.",

I probably didn't read the measurements correctly, but thought papers and manilla folders would fit in this which they do, but they have to be slightly curled up to do so. Overall I think this is perfect to keep your important papers safe and dry in case of disaster.",
