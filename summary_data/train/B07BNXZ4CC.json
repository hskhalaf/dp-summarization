So returning the show mode dock and the Fire HD tablet. Should not advertise that it can do what the Amazon Echo Show can do if it won\u2019t support Drop In inbound.

But that may not be possible because Amazon has forced the portrait orientation in such a way that it works correctly with the \"show dock connector\" but gets vertically inverted with the folding case. Besides that the show dock connector really adds no extra value compared to a plugged in tablet with show mode running constantly.",

Not what I was expecting nor is it what I want. If you want show mode without covering your cool new colorful Kindle, consider buying just a stand and using show mode with the charger cable and generic stand instead.",

We could pay some extra cash to remove the ads, but the aforementioned steps seem to work fine. If you want to load non-Amazon apps, check online for instructions. Amazon tries to keep a pretty tight lid on who can install what on the computer.",

I bought a separate case for transport, but haven't used it. I leave the tablet in the docking station's case all the time. It's s a great improvement for charging 7th and 8th generation Fire Tablets!!!",
