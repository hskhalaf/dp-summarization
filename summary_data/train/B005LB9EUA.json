But telling a customer too bad so sad, you are stuck with the broken toy is unacceptable. Thank you Amazon customer service for quickly making this right. I now have a bus with 4 hub caps. My granddaughter loves this latest edition to my Green Toys collection. I am updating the bus to 5 stars and looking forward to more Green Toys from Amazon.",

It might be a decent toy to bury in the sandbox or sink to the bottom of the pool, but it's not a good house toy. FYI...the firetruck from this company has the same issue with the wheels.",

I note I also purchased the Green Toys Fire Truck which does not roll well at all, the wheels lock up constantly and I'm disappointed in that item. Some better quality control is evidently needed.",

It's a bit short a squatty, but she immediately started singing \"Wheels on the Bus\" when she opened it Christmas morning, so it wasn't a problem. Very sturdy, doesn't roll quiet as smoothly as other toys, but I imagine this is because the entire toy, including the axels, are plastic. It tends to roll a bit and then do sort of a Tokyo drift. Still very fun! Great to put Calico critters or a single small stuffed animal in for a ride.",

The thing I don't like about it is that the wheels are independently attached (no axle) and they look very wobbly when the bus rolls. So far they have held, but I always feel like they are about to fall off. I love the idea of good quality toys made from recycled materials. I think the quality is almost there.",
