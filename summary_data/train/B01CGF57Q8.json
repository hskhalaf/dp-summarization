With the harness, it's easy. I also use it on walks when she's getting fatigued. It's well made, and I really like the way it rolls up for carrying - makes it so much easier to hang on to it! I've tried a couple of other harnesses that didn't work for various reasons, so I was very happy when this harness turned out to be the one. Highly recommend it.",

With adjustable straps and a short leash, I have a safe, even grip on my dog (imagining she could slip out of a towel sling). The company followed up with a PDF of instructions, but it is pretty intuitive. I hope I never need it again after my dog recovers, but I will hold on to it just in case.",

It allows me to walk her and lift her hind quarters when she tires on her hind leg. So instead of lying down when her hind leg gives out, I can gently lift her just enough for her to be able to continue walking. It takes a little time for both of us to get used to the harness as it takes a little coordination to use it. It's easier to use than her wheel chair and not as bulkie. I would recommend this item.",

      "text": "Sadly my large goldendoodle hurt his back leg. Had been using a beach towel to help carry his 80 lb weight on the stairs, till I ordered this. Easy on & off with Velcro make a quick solution and the handles make it easy for me to help our dog. I ordered an XL and it's a little loose but comfortable. The inside material is soft on the body. Highly recommend.",
