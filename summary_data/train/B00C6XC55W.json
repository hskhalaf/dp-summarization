The floor remain pretty clean. I see this as getting 80% clean with 0% effort. Come back from work, empty the dust bin. That's all I do to maintain this guy. Occasionally I have to go look for him as he doesn't find his way back getting stuck on something, but you will quickly learn what kind of wires and places he has trouble with and adapt.

The charging station, however, needs improvement. When the vacuum starts and ends its cleaning cycle it runs over the charging tabs, and both tabs have been dislodged, preventing the vacuum from resettling itself. A design error, which I have been able to, but should not have had to, overcome. (I bent the tab back into place and glued it.)",

      "text": "I bought this for my wife, for use at our mountain cabin. It works very well, the wife is very pleased, as it cleans the floors in the evening, or you can program other times during low traffic around the house. The dogs don't mind it (scared them only once), and aside from it getting stuck in some tight spaces sometimes, it vacuums the hardwood floors and rugs w/o having to change settings, and returns to its base most of the time (unless it gets stuck). I would recommend this item to a friend.",
