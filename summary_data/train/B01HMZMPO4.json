Update:: I've now had these shoes about 9 months and they're still in great condition. I wear out shoes fast. I've put holes in 2 different pairs of shoes I bought after these (wearing these the most often) and honestly i'm impressed. 6 months is the longest a pair of shoes has ever lasted me before these. Highly recommended.",

Althought the Majerus felt better than the Busenitz I still feel both pairs somehow smaller than the Samba and the Seeley. Good side of the story, I ended up giving the Busenitz to my nephew (he's 9') and he had no problem. I kept Majerus anyways",
