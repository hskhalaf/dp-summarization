Tip to depress the ignition button for 30 or so seconds before igniting was especially helpful and did not cause panic! Added fire glass and just love the look and ambiance without the fuss!! So many compliments already as we sit out by the pool and pond. And now looking forward to s'mores with the little ones! Will be putting on wheels as one reviewer did to help move it wherever the party is in our backyard!

The size of the flame is easily controlled and really puts out some warmth. For that it's not ideal to place cold drinks on the table portion. Perfect height as a centerpiece to our outdoor sofa set. It looks more expensive than it was which is always a nice plus! Would definitely recommend!",

It lit 3 times and then stopped....with igniter or lighter. Tried everything and finally dragged it the gas company 35 miles away. $200 later they said it was the igniter so back onto the deck. Lit twice and quit. Now no gas getting to igniter. $400 later its best use will be as an anchor. Shame on them and shame on me!",

We had no issues as I have seen mentioned in other reviews! Within 20 minutes from putting it together we were roasting marshmallows and were nice and toasty warm on the chilly day we put it together! We are avid BBQ-ers so we always have an extra filled propane tank on hand.",

I hold the button in for 20 seconds after lighting before releasing and the flame will not stay lit. Have tried the troubleshooting instructions as well and that does not fix it either. Great looking pit but you'll need your own lighter and most likely will need something to hold the button down to keep it lit (this will remove the ability to raise and lower the flame level though).",
