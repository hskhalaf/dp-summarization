Along with this, it's so squishy that it doesn't actually provide real lumbar support. Definitely not worth the money. I will go back to my physical therapists original idea and roll up a towel as it's just as effective if not more.",

When I tried it, instead of filling the natural gap in my lumbar area, which is what it should do, it felt like I was sitting against a large brick. Way, way too fat, and I couldn't get it to soften at all. Then when I saw what was inside the case, I couldn't believe the price....a piece of foam rubber? OMG. What a piece of junk.

      "text": "I find the roll compresses to approximately 1 inch thick when leaned on. (I bought the standard density). Relatively comfortable, even if not as structurally sound as I'd expect. I'm disappointed in the strap, too. It's a stretchy material, which means that no matter how snugly you attach it to your chair, the roll droops. Looking at the strain this puts on the ends of the strap where it's attached to the roll, I can't imagine these connections holding up for any length of time. Bottom line, I think this is an okay product right out of the box, but doesn't appear that it would have a very long lifespan for me.",

It is a great lumbar support. It is lightweight but firm enough to support your lower back. I don't use the strap (except to carry it) but I think it would be useful in some situations.",

The full just fits my office chair better - but the D-section rolls seem firmer. Great products and long lasting! So thankful for these rolls!",

My physical therapist insists on having one of these in the car, at work, and wherever else I sit. This original roll is not overly firm, but definitely provides the right amount of support to keep the hollow of your back from resting flat on the chair. This ergonomic posture allows the vertebrae to properly align, which will allow them to heal. Slouching places added stress on to our spine by taking it out of its intended shape, so the roll works to maintain that correct posture and reduce the load on the spine.",

Several people have mentioned to me that they don't use the elastic strap at all and place it each time they sit down.

When it came in I though it was gonna be stupid and pointless. Literally the best thing of my life. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s gonna wear down fast. (I do drive a lot so that doesn\u2019t help) and it doesn\u2019t seem as stiff maybe as Id thing it to be. I have to kinda move it around depending on how long I\u2019ve been driven for but sometimes the idea of driving home is life changing. I HIGHLY recommend this guy. I wanna buy more.",

I even take one in my laptop bag for long meetings on travel. This roll is far superior to a couple others that looked and cost the same at the local drug store...but which were not durable and whose effectiveness was only a couple of days (they compressed and stayed compressed); I got fooled... Stick with OPTP; they sell the original roll and it works as advertised. The extra firm is especially useful for long trips in the car.",

Only con is it does have a tendency to roll to the bottom of the seat once you sit down, but you can just tighten the strap to stop this; I personally don't want to tighten the strap to much. I feel that will shorten its life span, which so far has been about 2 years for me and this thing is still going STRONG!!!!",
