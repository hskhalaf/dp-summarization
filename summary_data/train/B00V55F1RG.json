It hardly seemed any better than the regular ballpoint pens I get for a couple bucks at the gas station. But last night, I felt particularly called upon to write so I picked up this fountain pen and began writing. I'm not sure what happened, but something clicked. I finally got it - the feeling. The feeling of unrestricted fluidity between me and the paper. It was as if there was no pen - just me and the paper. It was magical. I love this pen now and this turned out to be one of the best purchases I made this year.",

It's a solid fountain pen, with a great grip and light weight feel, but I don't recommend it if you're looking for a pen with varying widths. It writes like a normal pen, but the flow of ink is the only highlight.",
