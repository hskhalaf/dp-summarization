      "text": "Well let me start out by saying the finish wasn't great, but if I hated it that bad I would refinish it. It took a lot of modification to fit in the hammer head. So, if you think this will be a quick fix it won't be unless you have a belt or palm sander. I am a young kid with limited funds so I had to use a rasp. It comes with a wedge which leaves the handle nicely secured.",

Once the finish is removed, the handle sanded down (I cut in custom grip areas), custom fit for the hammer head, and refinished, it's a solid product that'll last for decades.",

Honestly, the hardest part is getting the old handle out of the hammer head. After that, it's pretty easy to tap (well...bash) the new one into place and then trim the top and wedge it.",
