My fears this would be under powered and that I'd need gas are totally wrong.",

First, there is a gap between the two blades so you wind up with a narrow strip of grass that is not cut with each pass of the mower. Second, the bag hangs too low on the mower and will scrape the ground as it collects grass. My garden home lawn was being cut today. Both fully charged batteries died when only 60% of the lawn was cut. Do yourself a favor and buy another battery powered mower.",

Trick I find is to not rush the mowing. Just because this mower is so light, don\u2019t get tempted to jog and mow at the same time. Your lawn will get a bad haircut if you rush it. The twin blade system is interesting and I find myself using a slightly different mowing technique, more straight lines and fewer sharp turns. No issues with battery life. We have small block under quarter acre. Charge time is good. A couple of hours and it\u2019s100%.",

I don't store the battery in hot weather, so I consider the battery defective. 3) Why does the manufacturer not just supply 2 4.0AH batteries, or 2 2.0AH batteries. Make it consistent!!!

Since you are not supposed to leave the batteries plugged in longer than the charging time, we bought an extra charger on amazon and two countdown timers (like the Stanley 38428 Countdown TImer sold here) and charge both batteries simultaneously for the estimated time they need. Really pleased with the maneuverability and weight. The charge lasts enough so we can do all three lawns. The lower noise is appreciated by everyone. I won't return to gas.",

So far, after a few cuttings, this one has worked exactly as claimed and has no trouble with most grass and weeds, plus running over sticks, etc. If the lawn gets long it does slow down and use more battery power, but that's the nature of the device! Switches automatically between batteries, light enough for men or women to push around, cuts a nice swath. I read some of the negative reviews and simply don't understand what the users are griping about. If I had any kind of complaint it's simply that the assembly instructions could have been better. Not a big deal.",

It does tend to miss some single blades of grass if I move too quickly and if I feel picky I'll double over some areas. It's nice not having the vibrations and noise, and overall, I'm pleased with the effectiveness of the mower. I stayed with the Greenworks brand to purchase the leave blower and string trimmer so there are no issues with battery usage.",

It's a heavy mower, but the higher AH battery combo seems to make it significantly easier to push. The mulching function is not great - I think I was expecting the cut grass to scatter evenly but instead it is left in rows - but that's a small consideration.
