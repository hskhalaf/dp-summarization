      "text": "I spent so much time looking at different snow shoes for my two girls. These boots are fantastic. They are easy to get on and strap up so the kids can do it. They need a little help getting them off sometimes. The strap at the top is great to keep the snow out and really works! The kids say that they are comfortable and we played in the snow for a long long time with no complaints. Yay!!",

      "text": "I liked the idea of a removable liner. However, the boot does not open up enough to get my child's foot into it. She would need to bend her foot to get in, and she is too young to do that. I can't get her foot in by jamming it down. Tried having her stand up in them, still didn't work. I ordered the boot 2 sizes larger than her shoe size, anticipating her foot might grow over the winter, so the problem is not that it's too small. Disappointed but might try this style again when she's older and can put her own shoes/boots on.",

The other boots not only get water-logged, but they stitching comes apart after a little while. I finally bit the bullet and bought these high-quality boots. They are really great. My son loves them so much that he even wants to wear them even though the snow is now gone; they're that comfortable. And they are so far very durable.",

The liners easily come out if he is just going creek walking in the summer and wants to keep his feet dry, and pop right back in for snow and winter.",

To make them work, we removed the liner and used super thick, warm socks. This was a great success because we can slowly change the bigness of the socks as her feet grow so they should last along time. Honestly when she was born her feet were NEVER as narrow as the liners inside the boot are. The advantage is, you can take out the liners and also I liked you can tighten them around the ankle so they don't fall off.",
