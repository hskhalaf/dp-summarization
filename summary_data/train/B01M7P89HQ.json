I skate laps at the roller rink for about an hour straight and these skates are the ticket. I got them because I developed an injury while skating laps on in-line skates, so was taking a break. They took about three hours of skating to break in. They are very smooth, help me relax and feel in control. Since getting these skates I\u2019ve started skating backwards much more and even developed my backward crossovers for high speed turns. I\u2019m pumped!",
