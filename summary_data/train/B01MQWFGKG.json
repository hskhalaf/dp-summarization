It looks like whatever the pot has been coated in is beginning to melt off. I've owned several rice cookers before and I've never experienced anything like this. I'm not sure when this started to occur because when rice is in the pot, you can't tell between the material that has become exposed to the rice in the pot. I have contacted Cuckoo directly but have yet to hear back. The quality of this pot is terrible.",

Like rice, but better than rice ever smelled, in the history of cooking rice. I'm sorry I didn't get a rice cooker sooner. If I'd known, I would have.",

Cons: -Not intuitive -I'm not sure the rice is any better than my cheaper rice cooker made -Takes forever--we're talking over an hour for 2 cups of brown rice to cook -Heavy, bulky and either takes up a lot of counter space or has to be stored but doesn't have anything to hold onto for moving it. Edit: After a few months, it's also now sometimes doing keep warm instead of cook, which looks very similar. Twice now we've had to take it out of the cooker and finish it on the stove.

Also, the quick mode isn't as quick as other rice cookers I've owned, including their own Cuckoo models (more expensive ones). Maybe this is the differentiating factor.
