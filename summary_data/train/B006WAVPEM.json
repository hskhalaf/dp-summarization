I have been resistant to paying large amounts of money, convinced I could find an adequate flute for a reasonable price. This flute fits the bill. It is great quality and sounded great. We did have a problem with one of the keys and as everyone else has stated, the customer service was amazing to deal with. I spoke with Enrique who was very prompt and helpful, offering a completely satisfying resolution without any hassle! It's refreshing to deal with a company that stands behind their products and serves their customers respectfully!",

We've taken it in twice for repairs-and have been told this is one step up from disposal type. Even with the silver plated head joint and a nice sound, leaks keep popping up and it's frustrating for a talented player who needs the full spectrum of keys. If you can afford it, get a different one. It's a beautiful flute, but it isn't lasting and for $200 I thought we'd get several years out of it and we are really disappointed that it's as wimpy as the $90 we bought originally.",

A student does not know how to tune the instrument and less move the pieces for tuning. As it was for my great-granddaughter, I had to return her.",

Using a tuner, I can get perfect tones on notes C4 through C6, and I need practice in order to achieve better results in the higher notes.",
