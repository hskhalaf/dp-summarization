I should've listened to the other reviewers. \ud83d\ude14 I expected better from under armour. I don't know that I will purchase shoes made by them again. This was my 1st pair and I'm not impressed.",

It's stylish in color and design so I can wear this with shorts or even with long jeans or khakis. THE BOTTOM LINE: 5 out of 5 stars! Highly recommend this shoes.",
