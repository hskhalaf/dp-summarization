I don't know what they changed, but it doesn't have magnets all the way down or in large sections. This one doesn't stay closed. I'm bummed and will likely return it.",

If you are able to nail it in with the provided nails (I think there should be a few more), I highly recommend doing it that way. We didn't mind using them on our wood. Once the weather got hot our velcro didn't stick to the wood anymore, so it began falling off. That's my only complaint with this net, but using the nails alleviates that issue.",

      "text": "I have bought several of these types of screens for my French Door leading out to my deck, I have two small dogs that go in and out most of the day. This is by far the best I have found. It was so easy to install, I am 64 and did this all by myself. It is well worth the extra cost for the quality and the ease of installation. Not to mention there are no gaps because of the magnets are designed to keep it closed with out the gaps as with other less expensive screens.",

Otherwise, it was installed in 15 minutes, and once the fabric relaxes a bit, works as advertised. The magnets are pretty strong.",
