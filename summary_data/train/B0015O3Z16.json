Once again Great Eastern Entertainment not only satisfied with their Sonic The Hedgehog & Fairy Tail line but jaw droppingly impressed me with their naruto line. This plush is based off of Naruto's appearance from the original naruto anime when he was 13 in the anime. The plush is pretty anime accurate great rubber material on the leaf headband and a nice size great fur on top of the jacket also a little finger detail and basically for all naruto fans and collectors this is an item you need in your collection BELIEVE IT!!!",

It is a nice soft fabric. Also, very detailed, it has the pouch, symbols, and the leg band that Naruto actually has in the show. I wouldn't recommend playing with it but it is for more of display.",
