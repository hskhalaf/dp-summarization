That said, be sure that this size will work for you. By the time I put a good helping of food in it, it feels a bit cramped have room to stir and turn over the food as it is cooking.",

To season it, I washed it with hot, soapy water, heated it on the stovetop until completely dry, coated it with a thin film of oil, and baked it at 300 degrees for two hours. I plan to repeat the process to build up the seasoning. I am looking for vegetarian options to season this wok besides deep frying. Ideas, anyone? The wok gets very hot and retains heat well. The Lodge silicon assist handle holder (ASAHH41) fits loosely and does not provide much protection from the heat. I prefer to use a quilted pot holder instead.",

I included pictures, one with a coffee cup so you can do a size comparison. This is great for someone cooking for a four or less people.
