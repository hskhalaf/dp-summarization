The sound is so rich and the bass is really deep. It's great. The auto tonearm works just as it should and returns once the record has finished. I have it wired to my hifi and on medium gain, which seems to be spot on so far. I havent tried the bluetooth connection yet, so I can't comment on that. Its a great step up from the turntable I had before in everyway and I couldn't be happier with it.",

The Bluetooth is a handy feature too, of course not first choice for sound quality, but for listening on wireless headphones doing chores around the house, or even to cast to the downstairs kitchen speaker, it's definitely useful. Its sleek and simplistic design and functionality fits perfectly with the rest of the tech in my room. I can't fault it; definitely recommend.",
