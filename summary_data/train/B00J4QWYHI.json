Not really sure if he's a picky eater but think he might be because he insists on eating his same brown food daily kind of like a toddler that will insist in going a year only eating chicken nuggets every day. He isn't over eating it though, as he's not getting fatter, he's the same little noodle he's always been. Crash the super ferret seems to be just quite pleased with this so I'm thinking I'll buy again.",

I gave in, and quite honestly it's the best thing that's ever happened for my 4yo cat. He was overweight (16lbs!), sluggish, his coat was dull, his breath stunk. Since switching to this high protein food he's lost about 4 lbs, has more energy, his coat is shiny and gorgeous, and his breath is much better. His poops are nuclear but if it means he's getting more protein and no carbs like felines are supposed to get then I'll take it.",

I switched to the Mazuri brand ferret food on the recommendation of my vet and it has been great. They have solid stools, the overall smell of them and their cage has dramatically decreased. You really only smell it up next to the cage.",

My ferrets will not eat meat after many attempts, however I believe this is the best alternative available. I'm so glad I found this product and feel confident in feeding this to my ferrets to keep them healthy and they love it!",
