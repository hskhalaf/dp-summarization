Well, there is nothing budget about the quality and finish of these. You can feel the weight of its solid construction. They are not hollow like most you find at big box stores. Well worth the money and more. I would say the price point at a store would be about $5 or $6 each! The finish is a nice brushed nickel and unlike other reviewers none of them were defective. They are also individually wrapped. I would definitely order again.",

Local businesses wanted 3 X what we paid.",

My perfectionist son installed these (without any trouble), and they add so much to the finished look of the kitchen. Now I know from which side to open each cabinet door! I could not be happier!",

However, I had to buy different length screws as the ones provided were either too long or too short for my cabinet doors (though the longer ones did work for the drawers). Size 8-32 x 1 1/4 in long pan head machine screws did the job for the doors. I'd also suggest buying a template to make it easier, because if you're even a little off you can tell with these bars. I bought Laureys \" perfect mount\" and that worked well for me.",

It also came with long and short screws which is really nice, although all my cabinets used the long screws. Very happy with it considering out of the 75, there were maybe 2 or 3 which gave me problems. The only drawback I see is the high projection. It could hurt you if your legs happen to hit it. Most similar products on Amazon have the same projection. I had to purchase 2 handles(much more expensive) from another company that have a lower projection to be able to make 2 drawers usable to avoid hitting each other.",
