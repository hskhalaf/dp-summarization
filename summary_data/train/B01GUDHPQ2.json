There is an indentation from top to bottom on one side, there is a small dent on the top, and small marred area on one of the sides. Probably should have returned it, but for now it\u2019s better than the Kleenex printed box. Couldn\u2019t find a brushed stainless in the stores, so this will do for now. Reality is, it\u2019s discount store quality at department store price. I was able to get the sticker off with minimal effort, using a goo gone sticker remover and the little plastic marvel of a tool that comes with it.",

The brushed metal surface matches the finishes in the bathroom. I'd be happier if the surface was pristine.",
