      "text": "This is my go to dovetail saw. It's extremely precise and repeatable. With practice you always get the exact amount of wood removal per cut, so if you need to go say 1/16\" deeper it's two more pulls ( it cuts on the pull stroke). The backing keeps the cuts straight, it feels good in the hand...I actually wrap mine with rawhide shoe lace material for a better feel and a larger handle. An absolute joy to use but keep in mind that the kerf is far to thin to get a coping saw into the cut to cut out the waste, it's chisel work. Highly recommend.",

I wanted a thin saw that would work well for some finer cuts but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This seemed like the perfect solution. The blade cuts well and the reinforced top part limits any vibration in the end. In general, I am very pleased with my purchase, but I do wish it were a little taller. The depth of the cut is limited to about an inch. That works well for most projects I've tried, but I had to go back with a thicker saw for a couple cuts I needed to make.",
