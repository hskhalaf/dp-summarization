Simply the best (and reasonably priced).",

I picked it up fully expecting the worst and other than a couple marked corners on the OtterBox my phone is still like new! I expect maybe I got lucky but there is zero chance that phone would be running without the protection! Happy customer!",

But I'm not really in the habit of dropping my phone in the bathtub so I might cut the flap off which would solve the problem 100%.",

After purchasing two of those due to the clips breaking, I tried the OtterBox COMMUTER SERIES for Samsung Galaxy S8. It encases the phone in a protective rubber and then a plastic shell. No thin parts to break. It also thinner than any other case I have had for the Galaxy. Great Design.",
