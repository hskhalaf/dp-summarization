I bet money that this is made in China and FBA to make a profit. Sooo what can you really expect?

When I received it I was surprised that it was as cute as it turned out to be. It was for my niece, who is quite, and not quite as picky as say, a 35 year old man who watches the show, but I was pleased. It's cuddly and cute, and for under $9, one of the cheaper Pinkie Pie plushes.",

This came in handy since she caught a cold while visiting :( so her pony kept her plenty of company. Plus, it was Prime eligible so I was able to order the pony and matching sippy cup in time for her to enjoy it during her one week stay. Totally scored \"Awesome Auntie\" points with this little girl :)",
