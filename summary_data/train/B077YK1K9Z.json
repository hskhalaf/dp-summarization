The figures are surprisingly larger then I expected (measuring almost 2\" in height. Articulating limbs operate smoothly with firm, smooth action. This should keep most fans of Roblox thoroughly entertained and should be durable enough given their construction. I would have given 5 stars but the finished product I received is just a bit off. Upon closer inspection the plastic injection molded heads have some pock marks/divits from manufacturing that are noticeable. Hopefully, they can quality check their products a bit more as some buyers may prefer to display these figures.",

He got a special Roblox accessory online with this pack (yes, he tried to explain it, but I have no idea...but, he was super excited!)

The figures bend and move so you can have them do different activities, i.e., sit, stand, or ride the skateboard. The figures are larger than Lego figures, both in height and size. My grandson likes making little scenes out of the figures and then crashing them down. The figures seem to be pretty well made and have held up to his play for the past few weeks. He has asked for other figures from this set now that he has this se,t so I would say he really enjoys playing with them.",
