      "text": "Bought this to mount on top of our Honda Odyssey to carrier a 11 ft and 10.5ft kayak. We've been using this for the last for at least every weekend this summer. Through rain and high wind it has held up. I would highly recommend getting a bow/stern tie down. We also used an additional strap to hold the two kayak to the roof mount for piece of mind. Haven't used the dolly at all so its been a waste. Was able to park the van in the garage with this mounted.",

One of the big negs and why I subtracted a star is that the bolts that hold racks to the crossbar we're too long and had to be cut in order to not hit the roof. Otherwise these works very well ...I have 2 kayaks...one is a double that weighs 72 lbs and another single that only is 25 lbs ...these racks don't even flinch despite the one kayak being close to the max weight limit.",

The contact surfaces on the 4 bases of the rack move under the load of the kayaks and the rubber slips that protect the roof slid out and blew away. 3 stars for holding up at highway speeds without coming loose.",

If you line them all up going the same way, you could get 3 or 2 plus a bike rack up there. assembly was SO EASY and no modification needed.",
