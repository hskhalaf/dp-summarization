There is a break-in period, so if you're worried that they're stiff or too tight, I'd give them a few days. Bottom line- there's a reason so many people love timbs- the quality truly can't be beat. If you're on the fence... just buy the boots. They're worth every penny.",

Originally bought these for yard work; moving and stacking wood, repairing fence's etc. all of which required hours. These boots felt and fit great right out of the box. No break in period necessary. They are so sturdy and comfortableI I even throw them on to take the dogs through the woods.",

      "text": "I tried the size before I bought it online. I would say that buy a size smaller than the trainers you usually wear. For instance, I usually had size 40 for my nike/ adidas trainers, but I bought size 39 for this. BUT, if you compare with the boots you already had, i think the size is the same as I had a dr. martens boots in size 39.hope it helps, thanks!",
