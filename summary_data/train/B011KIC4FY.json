Its virtually no break-in period was admired and liked by consumers. It lived up to the brand\u2019s promise of 100% blister free experience. The boot\u2019s Gore-Tex lining also received praise from an expert. What left some wearers upset was its insuficient breathability.",

      "text": "Delivery from Germany to UK respecting the indicated time at the order. The boots were utilised on mixed hilly areas including a shallow river at a southern coastal area of England for around five hours of hiking covering about 17 miles. Could not be any happier - excellent results, no blister neither any discomfort and fully waterproof. came with three fitting options in the form of two additional soft rubber undersoles, one half and the other full length. Rigid soles may seem stiff at first but you will get to appreciate it if you walk on lose rock for the security it provides. Just make sure to couple them with the thickest wool socks you could find",

I\u2019ve worn them just twice / a short 2 hour hike and a longer 5 hour hillwalk in mixed conditions- they performed excellently. I love the customisable insoles - a great idea. Lacing system could be better but it\u2019s similar to most 4 season boots.",

I did have to return them due to a slight squeeze of the pinky toes (a problem with my weirdly wide feet so wouldn't put this down to the boot) which became worse when I tried on with thick hiking socks, and would have got the next size up but none were in stock. Will put on my watchlist",
