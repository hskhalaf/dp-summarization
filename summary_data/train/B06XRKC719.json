The jar on the top is the sour cream from my old blender. The cashews were soaked for 14 hours prior to making it. I had used my Ninja blender. On the bottom, same recipe made with my Vitamix. Didn't even have to soak the cashews! Look how creamy it is. This amazing kitchen appliance certainly make living a vegan lifestyle much easier.",

However, the power on this thing is a joke. If I attempt to blend anything thats frozen or even remotely solid the blender seizes up. All i can really say is Im so disappointed. Its an amazing design but no power.",
