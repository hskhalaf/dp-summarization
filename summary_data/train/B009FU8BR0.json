Even better, when I called support I was told the device was outside the free warranty period. I guess I should have known this, somehow. Never again . At this point it seems that the only option is to reset to factory defaults and Hope that the setup instructions will take us through the initial setup.. If not, back it goes",

Then it wouldn't play any channel since they are all sent encrypted over HDMI and Slingbox doesn't decrypt HDMI signals like a TV does. Sling's solution per manual is to hook up the analog inputs (component) as well but the Spectrum 210 cable box only has HDMI out. That would normally be the end of the story however I found that certain HDMI splitters resolve that issue. It now works great.",

      "text": "The Sling TV would not work when connected via an HDMI cable between a Charter Cisco set top box and a Samsung Smart TV )we could not get any video / audio when the HDMI cables were connected). The only fix we could find was to disable the HDMI connection and to exclusively use the composite video and audio connection. While this fixed the problem and gave us the ability to use the Sling TV, it begs the question of why Sling offers this unit versus the cheaper (M2) model, when the difference between the models is the HDMI connectivity.",

I was put off by some of the comments about set up. So far I have had ZERO issues. Only complaint is after the price of the box, you then need to pay for the app(s). So far I am able to watch my favorite sports teams without having to pay the various leagues. That is worth the price for me. A nice plus is the DVR is available as well. Only hitch is timing your fast forwarding or reverse.",
