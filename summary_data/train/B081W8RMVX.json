Cons: - Limited contrast - No optical zoom - No optical lens-shift - Limited lumens - Not 4K Overall a game changer in this price range with some limitations.",

If you don't use the stick (and just connect via HDMI to another device) the remote that comes with the projector is useless. You can't use it to do anything except turn it on/off. The picture is OK but nothing special. If you are ok with using the projector for video and audio, its not bad...but who wants to listen to audio from this device?",

I do live in an older apartment but it's weird it hasn't happened with any of the 4 other epson units I've used. When the picture is working though its great. Clear and precise and the unit seems to run cooler. Maybe the cpu for android tv is running hot? Maybe something is up with my units thermometer. Either way slightly disappointing. Everything else checks out in terms of digital inputs and bluetooth and ease of use and projecting so that it looks good from below or really any angle.",

Out of the box I was extremely impressed with the form factor of this Epson Projector. It's very small, compared to other standard sized projectors. I easily hooked it up to my MacBook Pro 2020 M1 via a USB C to HDMI connector. Once plugged in to the Mac, I chose to MIRROR DISPLAYS in System Preferences. For sound, you set OUTPUT to EPSON PJ, type HDMI. Very easy. I projected the image onto a screen, hung on the wall. Underneath there is a place to screw in a support, but it is smaller than that which supports a standard tripod mounting screw.",

And Epson is a good brand, they are very popular and have a good reputation. It worked without a problem. It was a big increase in quality from our last one. So far so good.",

The Yamaha sound is fantastic for the size. If you have it up against a wall, it will deflect wonderfully and sound even larger. The picture quality is top notch. I'm a believer in laser projectors now. The only thing that would make it better would be if it was 4K, but the price would double!",

Not to mention that it has surprising good built-in speakers, making this projector really all you need for a great on-the-go viewing experience.
