I have them hanging in my cypress tree (along with the hanging Spanish moss) and have received great comments. I can see that they would also look nice along a porch or table umbrella. They are still lit (dim but showing up) in the morning before it gets light out. I will be buying more for uses in other areas. Doesn't provide enough light to light up an area but great ambient lighting.",
