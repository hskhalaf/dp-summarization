I ended up with those more or less by mistake, 1 lb is pretty light. The velcro strap isn't sized for the average US male. It requires a quite slender ankle for the velcro hooks to line up with the felt. I'm 5\"11, 170lbs, relatively slender and the velcro doesn't reach properly. They do work for straight leg raises while driving (cruise, nobody around, practiced braking) and working at a desk. If they straps were longer I'd buy another pair at a higher weight.",
