Once paired, there is a great UI for configuring actions and a surprising amount of functionality. IFTTT, Zapier, and general web requests add almost infinite functionality on top of that. Some of the app integrations are not great. RunKeeper, for example, is not really integrated - Flic simply submits a basic time and distance log to RunKeeper, so you don't benefit from RunKeeper directly during your run. The form factor is really nice though and I have peppered my apartment with them. They're perfect for phone-free light switches and media controls.",

One last thing, the button is a bit too hard. An option to get a button with a softer and more responsive click would be great. However, compared to other products, this one's very discrete.
