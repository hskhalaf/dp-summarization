No software cd on the only bummer but you can download from Nikon. This was a factory refurb but it looks and acts new. Quite pleased. Oh, controls are different from other P&S cameras, Kodak, Canon, Olympus so the learning curve will take a bit longer. Very nice 30x zoom capability. Would buy again. Battery holds up well thus far which makes me very happy. I would buy an extra just to be on the safe side.",

The picture quality is excellent.A good quality SD card and an extra battery and this camera is the perfect vacation piece.

They include wi-fi transmission of photos from the camera to any smart phone, tablet, or pc, also a GPS feature showing exactly where any photo was snapped. Also there are multiple modes from totally automatic to manipulation of aperture and exposure. The zoom works easily and has marvelous carity. The downsides to this camera is the unfortunate tendency of the lens to extend with the cover open when the power button is jostled inside a pocket or purse as well as a funky behavior after recharging the battery that can require removing and reinserting the battery twice or more to achieve normal operation.",

I like that it can also communicate with my ipad to send photos to it for Instagram and shutterfly, for example, but it's a little complicated to get the app and get the ipad and camera to communicate before sending pics. Also, the battery in the camera needs to be mostly charged to do this, which I didn't realize at first and got me frustrated wondering why it wasn't working. And the battery seems to drain quite fast, especially if you use the camera to view photos often or when not in use for a while.",

The only problem is, and it's a major one, it's impossible to take pictures outdoors if it is sunny because the screen glares so much. You can't see what you are taking a picture of. It's like a mirror, all you can see is your own reflection in it. More often than not, when I decide to use it, I'm disappointed because I'm unable to see what I'm taking a picture of.

It's also a good idea to carry two or more batteries for more than six hours of on and off use.
