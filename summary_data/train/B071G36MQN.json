I wasn't too interested in the boundary rope but they guys insisted we put it out and they appreciated it.",

This net is Men's Volleyball high, but can be adjusted with the included pins, it didn't take long to put up. We left the net at its highest point to help our daughter clear more vertical jumps, and blocks. A few day after setting it up we had a summer storm and thought the net had fallen, but NO it was up with no problems. I would recommend this product and it's price well for the quality",
