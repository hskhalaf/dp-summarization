I called Panasonic and they said that the 12 month warranty had expired and offered no options except to buy another phone at full price. I tried online chat, with the same result -- no support for their defective product. I will not be buying any more Panasonic products.",

Also, about 30% of the time, the phone doesn't register store push buttons (e.g., press 5 for produce, press 7 to speak to customer service, etc.). On the headset speakerphone, you can barely hear the people on the other end. I wish I had the old unit back, but it didn't have Caller Blocking capabilities, which is the only thing this model has going for it. Look elsewhere, this is not a good model upgrade. That's the reason I'm writing this review, because I've only had this one for about 3-4 months and I can't stand it, so I'm looking for another phone. Going in the garbage even though it's still functioning.",

These phones have some nice features like the intercom and call block, however, the sound quality on the cordless handsets is very poor. I tried changing the noise reduction and volume settings, but people still say they have difficulty hearing me - I can hear them fine and they can hear me okay on the corded phone. The answering machine sound quality is ok but not great; hence the reason for only 3 stars.",

The sound is very good, the handsets work fine and it does what it's supposed to! Updating to say that the phones are still doing a great job and I enjoy them so much I added an additional phone to our set. You can check the answering machine from any phone and use the phones as intercoms. Very nice!",

      "text": "Love this phone! Our 16-yr old Panasonic started to have problems, so we thought that it was time for an update. The cord on the base unit is perfect for very long calls, when you don't want to consider a battery failing on one of the satellite units. The tilting information display with large fonts is perfect for those of us needing a bigger view screen. The \"call block\" function is very handy for those computer generated telemaketing calls. The color and design have a light and attractive appearance. The clarity of the calls come in very well. The cord extends comfortably about three feet, some may want a longer cord.",

I also love that the phone yells out (ok, it just speaks it politely) who is calling, because landlines tend to get a bazillion telemarketer calls and its nice to be lazy and not get up unless it yells out someone we know instead of a random number aka telemarketer. Beautiful phone, we haven't had a problem with it at all!",
