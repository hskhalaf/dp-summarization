      "text": "this stuff is amazing! I suffer from strawberry legs (pores getting clogged and bumpy) and this product worked wonders to exfoliate and also moisturize. Although when I stopped using it my legs quickly became bumpy and dry which makes sense. The only pain is that you have to mix the product together every time you use it because the oil and sugar separate. Still I wish I had found this sooner and it\u2019s defiantly worth the price",

After I used up the tub I bought on a splurge, I decided to see how hard it would be to duplicate at home. A few tablespoons of demerara sugar mixed with some olive oil and bingo! You have essentially the same product, while spending just pennies. If you're that attached to the scent, I suppose you could add a few drops of a citrus oil or maybe vanilla extract or something. Anyway, after seeing how easy it is to make my own, I'd be a fool to pay 60+ dollars for the same thing.",
