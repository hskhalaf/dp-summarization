It gets extremely hot when it is running games. Those are my only complaints other than those it's an AWESOME computer",

This computer has many great features and user options, but there is no USER MANUAL! I had to get a Dell service tech to tell me about a feature that was not documented in any of the software or in the on line manual. OK DELL, get your act together and provide adequate service.",
