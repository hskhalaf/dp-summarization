A 10L would be overkill for my dogs sleeping bag and I want her to be able to carry her own camping gear on her pack not mine ! Built well enough, though the size is closer to 3 or 4L.

I then used this sack for an intense 4 day camping trip and the sack held up without any problem, even with several unpacking/repacking/compressing. I am very impressed about the build and quality. And the price is right. I think this will last for quite awhile more.",
