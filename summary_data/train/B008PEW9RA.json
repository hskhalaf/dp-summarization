      "text": "I give it a 4 star because one of the ears lost 90% of its volume output after about 2 years, but while both speaker were functioning properly, the product produced good sound, created a good seal, and were perfect for exercise. The price justifies the short shelf life of a product that had hundreds of hours put into it. Also of note, the control buttons worked....partially...for Android systems. Turns out that there is a button combination I would trigger rarely that would call my last contact when I would fiddle while running. It always made for an awkward quarter mile for everyone involved.",

They're sturdy and the overall physical quality makes it seem as they will last forever, where they ultimately failed though was the tech side of things.",

So when these came up as a suggestion, priced at $40, I jumped at the chance. They sound just like the S4i's did when they were working well, and that's exactly what I was looking for. They stay in my ears well while walking, especially with the bigger tips. So far, so good. No complaints.",

Very comfortable only flaw is the apple controls are housed in a big heavy plastic case which I assume is designed to withstand dirt, water, and use with gloves. The apple control is bulky and looks and feels like cheap thin plastic, but the amazing sound, comfort and less wire noise so far overcomes this issue. The sound is better and has fuller sound than the Klipsch X11i. Would buy again especially since you can get a better price than the regular S4i.",

The sound quality is good to very good, but not great. The old Ultimate Ears I had years ago were the best. Nothing seems to match those, including newer Ultimate Ears.

The large buttons are great, providing me with control even when I wear gloves.

The fit and sound block airplane noise extremely well and the large buttons make it easy to make adjustments.

Now for the negative, the microphone and volume control is too bulky to be used in any activity even walking it tends to weigh down the headphones too much. The clip to secure the cord comes easily off the cord in a few strides which again makes the headphones more cumbersome because of the bulky volume control. On my galaxy s5 the volume control did not work, the play/pause button worked though. They are great headphones but not for exercising of any kind, best for casual listening.",

      "text": "The Klipsh earbuds provide clear sound and have been a great way to listen to music at the gym. I find putting the cords over the back of my ears on the way down to the CD player helps to keep the earbuds from moving or falling out as I move. I also put the small, black, plastic plus/minus piece under my sports bra strap. Occasionally as it moves one of the earbuds will go quiet but it does not happen frequently.",

After choosing the right tip for you, it's not easy to find the best position in the ear canal, anyway the headphones tend to slip in few seconds.The sound is good, with a rather open and detailed sound.

Neither rain, sleet, snow, nor concrete jungle can stop the award winning acoustics and live music experience of the Image S4i Rugged headphones. An extra-large, 3-button remote lets you precisely control iPhone calls and music whether you\u2019re wearing bulky gloves or are simply on the go. And while the headphones\u2019 exterior is built tough, these in-ear headphones have patented oval ear tips to keep you comfortable. Rock the Klipsch Image S4i Rugged headphones in yellow, orange, blue or red.\n\nBorn in a Tin Shed to Rock the House\nAt the heart of every Klipsch product is over 66 years of audio expertise beating strong. Our commitment to no-compromise performance has made us the preferred choice of top cinema operators, a leader in stereo and home theater sound and a premium name in headphones. Meticulously researched and designed in Indianapolis, Indiana, these headphones personify the no-BS attitude of the company\u2019s founder, Paul W. Klipsch.\n\nLong May You Rock\nWhether you are navigating the slopes, running through the park, or hitting the gym, the Image S4i Rugged will be up to the task with its moisture-resistant design, allowing you to take on the mountain, tackle the ramp, and handle the challenges of Mother Nature without worrying about your headphone. \n\nArmed with one of the best warranty programs in the industry, with a 2-year replacement policy on all headphone products as opposed to the 1-year offered by many competitors, you can take comfort that your Klipsch headphones will keep the music going as long as you do. \n\nA Concert in Your Cranium\nWhen it comes to comfort, no one beats Klipsch headphones. Unlike circular-shaped ear tips that put stress on the pressure points inside the ear, Klipsch\u2019s exclusive oval ear tips naturally fit the contours of your ear canals, providing comfortable long-term wear. In addition to unequaled comfort, these exclusive ear tips create a perfect acoustic seal to produce renowned, high-performance Klipsch sound. These light-weight ear tips also offer superior noise isolation, blocking out almost all ambient noise and provide excellent bass. Because we want you to be rocking out to your favorite tunes for a long, long time, the seal also allows you to enjoy your music at lower, safer volumes. \n\nListen without Limits\nThe Image S4i Rugged\u2019s audio works with virtually any device that has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and features an Apple-based mic and three-button remote for taking calls and controlling music on iPods, iPhones or iPads. Located on the back of the remote is a directional mic for hands-free, crystal clear phone calls. \n\nBuilt for all sorts of extreme activities, the S4i Rugged\u2019s oversized remote allows you to control your music and phone calls without having to remove your bulky gloves or take a break from the action. And with its positioning at the cable yoke, the S4i Rugged\u2019s mic and remote are exactly where you want and need them when answering calls and controlling music. The improved microphone is a highly intelligible 360\u00b0 design with echo cancellation, so you can make and receive phone calls with crystal-clear audio and won\u2019t have to worry about all of the noise around you.\n\nYour favorite playlists are at your fingertips with the S4i Rugged. The plus and minus buttons control volume up and down, while the middle button does the rest of the work. You can use the middle button to take advantage of the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and iPad\u2019s voice control feature. Just hold down the button and say your command.\n\nFront Row Center. Anywhere.\n\n\nJust like a VIP at a concert, you get a bevy of extras with the Image S4i Rugged headphone including four pairs of different-sized patented oval ear tips, clothing clip and a protective carrying case. Available in yellow, orange, blue or red, the S4i Rugged also includes a 2-year warranty so you can rest assured that your Klipsch headphones will provide years of listening enjoyment.",
