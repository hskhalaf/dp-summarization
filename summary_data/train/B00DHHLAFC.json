Wish it had more bristles, like more dense britslte distribution, know what I mean? But I suppose its sufficient for dust. I just liked the brush in this set:  The clorox set has a flimsy rubber lip that fell apart immediately. But I kept the brush because I like it so much.

And since that's its main use, it's not actually that helpful. So I think as cool as it is, I would have rather bought the average broom. If the bristles were nicer, this would be hands down the most functional broom I've ever seen.",

It\u2019s the right size to hold about a day\u2019s worth of piggie poop \ud83d\ude02 and the teeth on the dustpan are perfect for scraping hay and stray poo from the bristles. This even replaced the small wet/dry vac I got specifically to clean their cage!",

Now I can sweep quietly instead of running the vacuum while babies are sleeping :) my only complaint-I wish the broom was a little taller so that I didn't have to bend down to get under tables, etc.",

      "text": "Thank god a real dust pan. If a dust pan doesn't have a rubber ramp at the tip of it, it shouldn't be called a dust pan. All that \"plastic thing\" will do is allow everthing you swept to go right under it! This DUST PAN, however, has a brush with rigid brittles that I can tell will last a very long time. Additionally, the rubber ramp does a great job at catching everything I sweep.",

The brush snapping in is convenient too, though I keep them stored on separate hooks because the pail alone is great for catching things I sweep off the counter or table. Good buy.",
