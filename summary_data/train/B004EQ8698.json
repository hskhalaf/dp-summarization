      "text": "The brace has a removable metal bar so it can be ambidextrous. The problem with it is that this bar is about 1/4\" shorter that the pouch it slides in to, presumably so it can be easily removed without too much effort. This ease of removal however also allows the bar to poke out of the slit and dig in to your arm. I am frequently having to adjust the bar to push it back all the way in to its pouch. I can probably fix this by sewing the slit shut, however I really shouldnt need to do this. This could have been avoided with a better product design.",

They don't immobilize, but do offer support. They do a great job of keeping my wrists from being bent at all sorts of fun angles while tossing and turning in bed. The velcro will wear out over time (hence my replacement purchase). I've found it's better just to leave the velcro attached at all times, and slide it on and off my wrist. There's just enough elasticity.",

      "text": "Overall I think this brace is very good. It helped stabilize a broken left wrist very well. Where it falls down is the lack of padding around the thumb hole, the stitching there ends up quite painful, and rubs raw the skin between the thumb and forefinger. Wadded-up tissue, particularly moisturized tissue, helps. Another issue is that with a recently broken wrist, it is impossible to put this brace on without modification, because the sleeve is too tight. The elastic part of the sleeve can be cut with scissors to allow the brace to be wrapped around the wrist. I can confirm it is machine washable.",

This meant that the sharp metal edge of the bar digs into my arm constantly. Forget uncomfortable, it's downright painful. If the openings were in a different place so that the metal bar didn't poke out, these would be decent braces--not great, but decent.

Unfortunately, after and hour or so of wearing it, I started to feel a little itchy. I took it off and saw the two red lines from the seams the hold the metal bar in place. These should be on the outside, not the inside. Disappointing.",
