I gave him my newly arrived bottle of Tension Relief to rub on before bed. He said he really slept well and didn't ache and took the bottle with him when they left to go home. The Plant Therapy Tension Relief defiantly did what we needed it for. We received it by mail so quickly, especially for Christmas mail. I defiantly will buy another bottle.",

It seems like most 'relaxing' EO blends include a heavy dose of lavender and I'm not a fan of lavender scent so I really like the fresh, minty smell here, it's so refreshing and yet calming at the same time. I love it when I get a headache too, it really helps. One of my favorites from this line!",

I bought this, used coconut oil for a carrier oil, and I massage it into my neck when I start to get a headache. It always helps. I have tried just massaging my neck without this stuff and it doesn't do a thing. I like that with this I don't have to rely on medication all the time. I would recommend this and have done so several times. I would feel confident buying anything from Plant Therapy. They seem to have quality products.",
