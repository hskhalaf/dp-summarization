I am satisfied with the one Nyne Bass that (still) works, but generally I am not satisfied. Buy a UE. Great price; prompt delivery, as stated.

Somewhat disappointed with long tern build quality. I guess an equipment lifespan of 10+ years in todays manufacturing and marketing environment is asking too much.",

If you are within 20 feet, you have no problem hearing but when there gets to be a gathering of people, the chatter can drown out the music. Good quality product though and it comes with different plug attachments so you can use/charge all around the world!!",

The line noise is only audible between songs. Blutooth is very clean with no interference. The second thing that concerns me is that some of the reviews stated that it works great then suddenly goes dead... I am hoping that mine lasts 5-10 years.",

The sub is REALLY nice, descent volume, and has everything you would expect a bluetooth speaker to have. At higher volumes around max, bass distorts the music (probably eq tuning problem). Comes with a buttload of plug adapters so you can plug it into any socket, and also comes with an aux cord if something doesn't have bluetooth capabilities. Sleek look with rubber trim and big square rubber buttons along the top for ease of use. A little bit heavy (not complaining) probably due to sub magnet and internals",

Has GREAT bass and GOOD sound Quality! Its loud (for those bad reviews saying its not loud enough). Overall very satisfied.",

Perfect for basement parties and intimate outdoor gatherings don't get me wrong its not a block party blaster but small parties or jamming in your house this does the job..... Google to see the positive reviews from CNET and others... I never write reviews but this made me have to tout its praises",

Definitely loud enough, without noticeable distortion, to fill a large room or outdoor space. Good balance between highs and lows when playing older recordings that tend to be midrange-dominant (classic jazz, guitar rock). Connects reliably. Haven't tested battery life as I usually leave it plugged in in center of living space. Weird looking but I like it. Materials seem sturdy and well- assembled. A good modern replacement for worn-out old Bose Sounddock. I would purchase again.",
