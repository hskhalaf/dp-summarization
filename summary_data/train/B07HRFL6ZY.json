I have had tables double and triple this price so with that being said this table was a steal. I read a review that said the table moves when u bump into it and that is just not the case. Maybe they have uneven floors lol. The base is sturdy and the glass is pretty heavy for being an under 200 dollar table. I love the chrome look because most of my furniture has a chrome finish so it fits in quite well with my decor. I'm really pleased with this purchase.",

It mentioned each things with letters but the bolts and stuff were not labeled so I had to figure it out on my own. Some things didn\u2019t line up so I needed another person to stretch out the legs while I screw them in. Table is a decent thickness in the glass so it\u2019s a pretty good quality and the base is pretty sturdy.

Other than this, the table is absolutely beautiful and perfect for my apartment. In case you need a reference to the height: I am 5\u20192 and the table is just below butt level.",
