As with any lock, safe, or security measure it can be broken or cut with enough time and energy, but as I mentioned this is a great added measure in my opinion especially at this price point.",

It engages into the bolt raceway while holding the bolt carrier partially open, completely disabling the firing mechanism. This also prevents the upper from being disassembled from the lower. A high strength coated steel cable and pin are included that allow the lock and gun to be anchored to any stationary object such as a frame member in a vehicle. Glass reinforced Nylon construction is durable and robust, yet is non-marring or damaging for inserting in your magazine well. Two keys included. Works with any Mil-Spec type rifles and fully disables the firing mechanism Prevents disassembly of the upper and lower Prevents a magazine from being loaded into the firearm Comes with theft deterrent steel anchoring cable.",
