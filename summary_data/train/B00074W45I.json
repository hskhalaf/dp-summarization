Having no desire to put her through the horrendous experience of de-clawing, I sought out other options. My cat actually tolerated the process of putting them on quite a bit better than I expected - no kitty burrito required. She doesn't love them, but she tolerates them. She still grabs her side when cleaning, but I haven't found any scratches or giant sores since I put these on her. Over all I would say this was a great investment. Soft Claws saved me a trip to the vet.",

With regular vet care and daily at home care, he's been doing well except for the times he would start scratching his ear and breaking skin. We bought these caps and applied them to his hind nails and they've been wonderful. Now our cat can still scratch without hurting himself and we don't have to consider keeping a cone on his head. The first one came off yesterday and I trimmed the nail and installed a new one. Other than that, none of the others have fallen off in the 2.5 weeks they've been on.",

I called soft claws and they said that sometimes if you buy through amazon, it could of been on the shelf for a long time. It's better to buy straight from the site or even just order extra glue from the site. She also said keeping your glue in the refrigerator should help!",

THESE on the other hand, work perfectly! No issues whatsoever with them sticking like they should. I will be purchasing more!",

It was cheaper to buy them on here instead of at Petco or Petsmart (they're $25-$30 for the same ones) and the Softpaws ones are about the same after shipping and handling. $16 and he can't destroy anything because he didn't understand what his scratching post was for.",

If you put sufficient glue and prevent kitty from chewing them for 30 min. they work extremely well.",

I also worry that he may choke on the piece he is biting off. I don't know why the pink ones were more durable than the red, but it's a big difference, crazy as it sounds.
