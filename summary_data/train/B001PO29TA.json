I have been dealing with the noise for over a year. Trying everything I can think of to tweak and adjust so that it does not make so much noise. But it reverts to making noise in short order. Now when I turn on the heater, it sounds like a helicopter is taking off in my bathroom. It has become a quality of life issue. Proceed with caution. If you decide to buy this unit and it makes noise after installation. Return the unit right away!",

PROS Looks very nice; I like the round implementation, and the grill looks good Heater outputs very well; will heat up our bathroom quickly CONS As others have mentioned, the exhaust noise is really loud, especially compared to the Panasonic that I have installed in another bathroom Light leaks out of the seam where the grill meets the ceiling. We had to put special caulk around the seam to stop light bleeding If Broan could solve the exhaust noise issue I'd easily give this a top rating, as the light bleeding out is a minor issue that is easily solved.",

The only difference is that the 9093WH has a night light that would require an extra wire from the switch to the fan. However, with the old switch and wiring, the plug (in the fan unit) fits and functions, lacking only power to the night light. Everything else works great, and the fan sounds wonderful. No change of housing or electrical installation necessary. I was looking at vent fan motor and heater fan motor replacement, plus overtemp fuse replacement in the old 9093N. This was the cost effective and easier fix!",

Indeed, I very soon swapped out the working parts and now have a very quiet bathroom heater/extractor. The \"internal\" connector and wiring is exactly the same.

The second doesn't have a GFCI problem, but the exhaust fan makes an intermittent squeaky noise. Other than that, the exhaust is OK for a 70 CFM fan, the night light is a nice feature, and the cats like the heater. I'll try one more time with another unit.",

    "description": "Make sure your bathroom is toasty and comfortable in the morning with the NuTone White Exhaust Fan, Heater, and Light Combo. The fan vents moisture in bathrooms up to 65 sq. ft. to help prevent mildew from forming. It includes automatic-reset thermal protection and uses one 100-watt light and one 7-watt nightlight to provide a warm glow for nighttime use (bulbs sold separately). Its white grille helps provide a clean, decorative look for your bathroom. It includes a four-function wall switch to simplify controlling the fan. The NuTone White Exhaust Fan, Heater, and Light Combo is the perfect addition for your master, guest, or kid's bathroom.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, two aggressive young men emerged with two new products that would make major contributions to the housing industry. In 1932, Henry Broan developed and manufactured a kitchen fan called the Motordor Fan that provided quiet and efficient kitchen ventilation. His creation launched what is today known as Broan-NuTone LLC. Four years later, in 1936, J. Ralph Corbett developed a melodious door chime replacing the obnoxious door buzzer of the time. His development launched what is today known as NuTone, Inc. Both men, headquartered in the Midwest, started their companies with a simple product and a few employees. Each expanded their companies, creating revolutionary new products that provided unmatched conveniences for homeowners nationwide. Both companies quickly became global competitors and continued to provide innovative, superior products to meet the needs of consumers. In 1981, Broan Mfg. Co., Inc. was acquired by Nortek, Inc. and became the lead company of Nortek's Residential Building Products Group, which was named the Broan Group. During this same time period, NuTone was sold to Scovill Manufacturing in 1967 and was then acquired by Williams plc in 1991. In 1998, Nortek acquired NuTone, adding it to the Broan Group and renaming the group the Broan-NuTone Group. Then, in January 2000, Broan Mfg. Co., Inc. became Broan-NuTone LLC, with NuTone Inc., Aubrey Manufacturing, Inc. and Rangaire LP as subsidiaries. Today, Broan-NuTone LLC is headquartered in Hartford, Wis. and employs more than 3,200 people in eight countries on three continents. It is North America's largest producer of residential ventilation products such as range hoods, ventilation fans and indoor air quality products and also holds major market positions in chimes, central vacuums, intercom systems, medicine cabinets, built-in electric heaters, whole-house fans, attic ventilators, paddle fans, ironing centers, trash compactors and speakers.",
