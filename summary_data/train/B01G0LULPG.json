I was a bit disappointed that these weren't BLACK black...but rather a dark blue/black...or a dark grey maybe...? I'm not sure exactly, but they aren't the same color black as my previous \"black\" pair. I'm not going to rate it any less because of that though...just giving others a heads up in case they were expecting a dark black. The product photo of the black color online is actually a pretty good representation of the true color. It's just more noticeably \"light black\" when I put them next to my other \"black\" pair of chucks.",
