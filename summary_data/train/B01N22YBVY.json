      "text": "Purchased the Hybrid Cover for my Switch to give extra protection while traveling. It doubles as a simple stand, propping the Switch up at a few different angles, which is beneficial. Somewhat uncomfortable to have on the Switch while playing in handheld mode, as the cover flap is left hanging while playing, but it's usable. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, as I pretty much use this jist for protection while on-the-go, or disconnect the joycons while using the Hybrid Cover as a stand. Finally found a simple carrying case that accommodates the Switch while wrapped in this Hybrid Cover, offering the best of both worlds.",

Well made, feels pretty heavy duty for a faux leather case and does a good job of holding the switch standing. It does have the ancient type pattern on the inside which looks good. The only weird thing is that the cleaning cloth seems kind of stiff and plasticy.",

For example, the charger fits snuggly into the tiny port at the bottom, but if using the stand to hold up just the screen, you can\u2019t charge the device, as the charger will put the case off kilter.

I strongly recommend this product if you are a Zelda fan or if ya just want a nice comfy/sophisticated looking switch case/stand! Yes, I said (stand)! It has built in stand feature which beats the tar out of the tiny stand that is on the switch... This product is a no brainer for me!",
