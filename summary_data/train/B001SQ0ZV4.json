I call this my cheapskate tax. Hurts my ego and wallet.",

I also like the colored buttons. Makes it much easier to teach a newbie how to play when you can just say \"hit the red button\" instead of having to pause while they examine it to figure out which one is \"A\". All the motion sensory and stuff seems identical to the official Wiimote, so no worries there. Good controller, and cheap too. I'd recommend it :-)",

When it came time to buy a second (with the Wii actually) I wanted to explore my options. The Nyko has a different look to it with it's larger buttons and rubberized grips. The larger buttons work better for some games and the controller is enough like the Nintendo version that compatibility is not an issue with attachments, chargers, and sleeves. It's really simple, you have a Wiimote so get this one. Try them both for different games and see which you prefer.",

The Wand also sometimes turns the Wii consol off unexpectedly. I am assuming that it is the Wand that turns the Wii console off, because this only happens when the Wand is being used. If only the Wii Remote is used, the Wii console never turns off unexpectedly. I sure do wish I didn't try to save a few dollars.",
