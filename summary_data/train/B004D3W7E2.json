I usually get the variety pack and was excited to see a new flavor for them to try but I didn\u2019t notice it was a senior formula. My picky cat doesn\u2019t seem to prefer this flavor but the one that will eat anything didn\u2019t seem to notice. I won\u2019t buy it again as My cats aren\u2019t seniors and I\u2019m not sure what makes the diet different but I\u2019ll stick with the variety packs where surprisingly neither cat will eat the solid shrimp pieces in the shrimp one.",

Unfortunately my package didn\u2019t arrive from Amazon (I did receive a refund though so no worries). I took it upon myself to go out to the store and purchase a sleeve of lil\u2019 soups. My brown tabby wasn\u2019t a huge fan- more of a pa\u0302te\u0301 guy. My orange tabby loves them!! I let him lick the lid off then dig in. I\u2019ll be ordering some more, hopefully they don\u2019t get lost in transit lol but overall a tasty treat for my kitty!",
