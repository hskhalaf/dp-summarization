Pain in the... The extension table is kind of cheap. Even the ruler has to be aligned and glued onto the bar. Contacted seller through Amazon messaging and got no response. (edit- got a response after I posted a bad review) I expected a better product and better service after paying this price for an item. Thus, the low rating. I have had this item for several days now, and still have not gotten to a point where I can power it up.",

If you plan on moving it at all get the roller base with it. The saw is very heavy and it helps to move it and raises it a bit.",

Set screws are a joke and rail system is poorly machined. Contacted Fox Shop CS but have not returned my call after 4 hours. This thing should be golden coming straight from the manufacturer with the amount of money they charge. C'mon Fox Shop your engineering standards are certainly suffering when you ship out this fence system. Will try to get a replacement but may have to invest in a reputable fence system.",

I've found that it stays dialed in once you've done it, It has no power issues (cuts 2\" hardwood w/o issue) and is intuitive to use. My shipment was compromised when it arrived, but after a phone call all of my parts were sent. No problems or questions. I've used it for about two weeks now and haven't don't have buyer's remorse.
