I see some reviews saying it worked overnight...well, that didn't happen to me but I have melasma, which is extremely difficult to treat, so I wasn't expecting a miracle, I just wanted to improve my overall skin's appearance and health. Slowly but steady, this serum is working. Who knows, it might even help my melasma fade...fingers crossed! Update: it oxidized in less than three months so I stopped using it. Total disappointment!",

I chose this product because the skinceuticals one is $160 a bottle and that seemed way too outrageous to me. $80 for this one was also pushing it but a lot of websites said this product was the best cheaper dupe to skin ceuticals. Things I love: - The twist pump. Cool design - Not irritating for my very sensitive skin - Little goes a long way",

I kept it in a dark cool place, just as all Vit C serums need to be. But noticed about 3 days ago it went from a clear serum to yellowish. Today I went to apply it and the color has turned to an orangy color. Oxidation! BOO. This product should have lasted at least 3 months. I am returning it and will notify Drunk Elephant to see why that would have happened so soon.",

Then I decided to try this and it is the most amazing beauty product I've used. I put it on every morning, let it dry and then put on sun screen. Use it every day for several weeks for best results.

    "description": "THE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE\nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation.\n\nC-FIRMA DAILY SERUM\nUniquely formulated with pumpkin ferment and pomegranate extracts, C-Firma enzymatically dissolves dead surface skin cells for smoother texture. Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer quickly penetrates skin and provides intense hydration. The result is a noticeably diminished appearance of photodamage, replaced by incredible radiance and luminosity. Plus, it has a reservoir effect, which means it will stay active on skin for up to 72 hours and cannot be washed or rubbed off. C-Firma has a pH level of 3.3 - 3.5, which Drunk Elephant believes is the key to a non-irritating, effective formulation that delivers real results.\n\nNO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesn\u2019t have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent.\n\nCOMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skin\u2019s health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. You\u2019ll never find the \u201cSuspicious 6\u201d (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrances/Dyes and SLS) in their products.",
