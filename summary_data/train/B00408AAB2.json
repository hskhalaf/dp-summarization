The maps looked bumpy when the light would shine on the maps. I went out and bought two pieces of foam board and Loctite spray adhesive ($15 for 2 boards and adhesive, at my local craft store). I then used the adhesive to permanently mount the maps onto the foam board. They look absolutely amazing! Now they are very sturdy, they look great, and I can move them around my walls! Definitely worth the effort and price!",

The dry erase marker does not come off without the use of a damp towel. 95% will come off with a dry wipe, but it will leave behind a dark cloud that requires some dampness to remove.",
