It had comparable power to my corded one as well as lots of battery time, with the convenience of being cordless. I would definitely recommend this trimmer to anyone who wants to cut the cord for the convenience of just slipping on the battery and getting to work.",

The only thing is you have to purchase the batteries and charger separately since it doesn't come with them. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.",

The 22 inch blade is fine for most trimming and the cut speed is a little slower to conserve battery life. I maintain my blade with silicon spray after each use. This is a light duty tool and should last many years if you don't push its limits. What is nice, you can purchase heavy duty after market batteries which can double your work time.",

The batteries last a long time and the trimmer cuts at full power until the battery dies. I have three of these batteries (from weed-eater, trimmer, and the blower) which makes life a lot easier if the battery dies. My other B+D tools have aged well and I expect this to do the same. One safety concern, it's a little too easy to run this trimmer with one hand. You have to let the handle almost all the way out before the blades stop, so be careful when swinging this around.",

I did not expect much since the last hedge trimmer I had was a gas-powered trimmer and I never expected something battery powered could even come close but it sure does! It is so light weight and easy to use. Best of all, it uses the same battery as my weed trimmer, so I can interchange the batteries. All my shrubs are nice and groomed now, without the hassle and danger of storing a gas cans. Thank you again B&D!",
