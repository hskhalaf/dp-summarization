Need to drop a couple pounds to I can reach the 4th belt hole and make it tighter. So far, for the price, this was a great purchase.",

Very stiff at first. Supposed to be that way with leather like this. Pinches my flab a bit when I'm squatting or doing deadlifts. That's my problem I suppose. Fine after a few adjustments. Have to adjust it pretty tight for it to be effective, so you need a little muscle just to get it on and off. Belt feels like a lifetime purchase. Bought the knee sleeves too, love those as well.",

Greta price I think the other belts that are overpriced you're buying the name but they are the same grade as this. Sturdy tough built to last and the black color looks awesome too.

The belt is too wide for most people, especially women, to use effectively in a deadlift, but can still serve the purpose if a 2 or 3\" belt is unavailable; just loosen it and move it up on the torso a bit.

It is clear that everything is made very well and I plan on using the belt and wraps for a long time. I look forward to purchasing additional products in the future. Like many have mentioned, you should break it in a little bit before trying it on.",

    "feature_bullets": [
      "PREFERRED STYLE FOR SERIOUS LIFTERS - 4 inch width all the way around, 10MM thickness (with only 1.2mm of suede) providing you superior support. Non-tapered front dramatically reduces stress on the back from rounding on exercises like the squat and deadlift and over extension on exercises like the overhead press by allowing both the abdominal wall and back to firmly brace. Best used for heavy Powerlifting, Weightlifting, Bodybuilding, Strongman and even heavy cross training workouts.",
      "BUILT TO LAST FOREVER - Belt construction and value, second to none. High-end materials: vegetable tanned, full grain sole leather. Strong nylon stitching. Ultra heavy single prong buckle with seamless roller. The end result is a belt that lasts and remains supportive for years to come.",
      "A DIFFERENCE YOU CAN SEE - We\u2019ve eliminated the inner suede and left the edges of this high end belt raw and un-dyed because it\u2019s expensive leather needs no cover up. You can visibly see every belt is properly tanned and has absolutely no \u201cwet blue\u201d tone to hide.",
      "FOCUSED ON THE DETAILS - Our belt also uses only a single suede exterior, versus both inside & out. This increases support, longevity (and price) by eliminating nearly 2MM of suede wrap and instead using thicker core leathers; the material that aids in support.",
      "5 STAR EXPERIENCE GUARANTEE - We're confident you'll absolutely love our powerlifting belt - or any of our other products! If somehow you aren't 100% satisfied, just contact us!"
