      "text": "My 6 year old daughter was extremely disappointed that this toy did not come as was advertised on the packaging. She expected it to have more parts and shopkins dolls, the way it appears, but it only came with 1 shopkins doll and about half of the stuff in the picture. This is a classic example of false advertising and a product you need to buy in person in the store, so you know exactly what you are getting, because the pictures are so deceptive. Shame on the company for deceiving little kids that way. Will never buy another shopkins product again.",
