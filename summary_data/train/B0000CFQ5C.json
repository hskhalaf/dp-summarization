This bowl is even better, half the price and the plastic lid is more pliable, easier to put on, take off and feels more secure. The PC lid always felt like it might crack or tear when I struggled getting it off, this one is much better quality. I am super happy!",

This one is very similar to the old one, except that it comes with a nice lid. Other than that, it appears to be of similar quality. It just might be the only other one I will have to buy in my lifetime (assuming I don't drop it or something). Thanks for making consistently great products, Anchor Hocking!",
