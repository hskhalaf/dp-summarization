We had to tape the top lid down, and only open the secondary lid that is used to refill. The bad thing about that is that the wipes stick together, and it's really hard to separate them while changing babies diaper with the other hand (legs/feet tend to find poo on the table if not held). But overall glad to have a wipe warmer - she screams a lot less bc they are warm and not shocking.",

    "description": "The ultimate wipesWARMER by Prince Lionheart is the number one selling wipes warmer worldwide. Prince Lionheart wipes warmers all feature the patented Ever-Fresh\u00ae System which is guaranteed to help keep your wipes the freshest they can be to soothe Baby's delicate skin. The patented Ever-Fresh System works three ways: 1) Anti-microbial: Both the wipe warmer\u2019s tub and the Ever-Fresh pillow are treated with an EPA approved additive to inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may cause spoilage, odors and mildew. 2) Non-browning: Keeping wipes moist prevents most discoloration from occurring when wipes are warmed. Over time, additives typically found in baby wipes, cause discoloration as they warm. The Ever-Fresh System effectively insulates wipes from the warming surface, preventing browning. 3) Moisture Retention: The Ever-Fresh System keeps wipes moist by an evaporation and condensation process. Micro pores in the pillow trap and release water as needed to maintain moisture content. Ideal for use on Oily or Combination skin\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy",
