I bought this particular product because of that claim of the 30-minute time frame to use. I am very disappointed because it only lasts 10 to 15 minutes at a time!! I would not buy this product again nor would I recommend it. I gave it 3 stars ONLY because it does have good suction for a cordless machine.",

The battery pack also gets considerably warm. This product could definitely be better if it had a detachable battery that you could buy multiple of, for bigger jobs.

At that point it was nothing more than an expensive paperweight.",

After owning several small, inexpensive handhelds with little suction and failing batteries, I decided to invest in a quality Dyson vacuum. I already own a Dyson upright and a canister. This handheld has a power brush ideal for dog hair on the sofa and a brush to clean the dust off the cover of my seldom used pool table. Also great for small cleanups around the house. The power is exceptional and has exceeded my expectations. Amazon had a sale on this one and that only \"sweetened\" the deal. I am very pleased with my purchase.",

Also, like most vacuums, hair gets caught around the bristles and needs to be cut out which can be an annoying process (I have long hair so I have to do this once a month). Emptying this is a breeze and it holds a good amount of dirt for a handheld. Overall it's definitely a pricy investment... but I think it was worth it.",

Well, even if you are going to use it for a car, boat, etc., you still have to put it someplace when not in use. I didn't send it back because I didn't see a good alternative. I hung it awkwardly on a hook. Just plain bad design that they did not make it to fit existing brackets.",
