I love the look, however, i wish it had some holes in the top of each shade as I didn't realize how downwardly directed the light would be instead of filling the whole room with light. It's like standing in front of the mirror with three flashlights above me. Lots of shadows, which is fine in some areas but not great in a bathroom when that's the only light fixture in the room. Thank goodness I have a skylight for that extra light needed during the day! I will keep it but will try different bulbs to see if that helps.",

The only thing I will say that is different about it is that the shades are metal and the light doesn't go \"through\" them, so all light is cast down and the area above the lights is definitely darker. Not that you need it lit up above the lights, but it's a bit odd when you are used to having light cast more evening around the room.",
