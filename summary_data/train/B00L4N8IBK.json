      "text": "Nature Valley granola bar addicts know a thing or two about crumbs. But we gladly carry that mantle. It's the price we pay for a deliciously filling hearty breakfast/snack on the go. Putting these delicious little oat bricks on a UPS truck to deliver to your door really ups the crumb ante! Opening the package was like ringing in the New Year with whole-grain confetti. Still delicious. Will probably order again. Just don't open over your lap or in the car.",

So now I have to go through until I find ones with a little crunch to them. The only reason I still have a ton left is because I really don't want to have to go through them...they are here for when I'm very desperate now. VERY disappointing!",

      "text": "I do disagree with their changing of this product to be \"easier to bite\". I have bought these locally and off of amazon and every time I open a package, at least 1/3 of the granola bar is broken and crumbled. This makes them very difficult to eat over anything other than a plate due to the mess they create. The convenience factor is out the door. Unless you don't care about your clothes, furniture, work space, or car interior, these are a bad idea. I never found the original version of these difficult to eat. Why change a good thing?",
