It is also great for cleaning up cuts and scrapes without causing any sting or burn from using it. I recommend everyone keep a bottle on hand, if only for use after acquiring a cut or deep scrape to the skin. DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY!

I was impressed with how gentle Hibiclense is on my face and how well it works to clear up breakouts. My skin doesn't feel so dry now. My tattoos heal quickly when I use this soap as well. My surgeon recommended I use this soap on all my cuts, tattoos and piercings. I'm sold on this stuff. It has so many uses and I don't think I'll use another antibacterial soap after trying this brand!",

For example, I have an oily face, but I have eczema on my fingers so it can sting a little bit when I am washing my face. I use it like once or twice a week when I come home with a lot of oil on my face. I use it as a second cleanser, after using tea tree soap. Make sure you use moisturizer afterwards.",

I began using Hibiclens as a part of my daily wound care regimen, and though the ulcers will probably never heal due to the venous insufficiency, I have had no further infections since I began using it. It has been a lifesaver!",
