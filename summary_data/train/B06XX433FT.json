Mostly, testers were glad that they were able to use it for different purposes \u2013 walking, light running, and going to the gym. Some observed that the shape and length were narrower and longer than usual, causing runners\u2019 toes to feel compressed. Nonetheless, the shoe was still praised for its chic and stylish design.",

        "One runner\u2019s foot hurt when he wore the Adidas Alphabounce EM CTD right out the box",
        "Some testers agreed that it needed to be broken in first"
