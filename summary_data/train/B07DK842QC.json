This toy talks, giggles, purrs and vibrates while purring, shakes and sneezes. The eyes change color and it emotes differently for each press on different places on its head and it is just cute. It is a bit top heavy to wear on a wrist or something but I am sure I can figure out how to attach it to my bag.",

I just told her, \"the elves must be getting sloppy. She let it go and loves it. Phew! Hoping she continues to not mind. Great value because I paid $9.99 + tax and free shipping! It was $15 at the arts and craft store. I give it a 3 star because it's neither here, nor there. Great price and convenience but imperfections almost ruined it. Almost.",
