My carpet was dirtier than I thought. You can tell when you\u2019ve run out of solution because the window doesn\u2019t show any water moving even though you are spraying and then trying to suck up the water, there won\u2019t be any , so you know it\u2019s time to refill. So for now I\u2019m very happy and my carpet smells good.",

The tank system is easy to use. I highly recommend this machine.",

This means you have to wrap the flex hose around the front of the handle. Also, there is no way to remove the flex hose. Hope these design and QC problems are not indicative of how well this thing is going to work.",

It totally works to lift debris out of carpet and upholstery.

For assistance, we can clean our rugs while they still are on the hardwood floor and the hardwood doesn't get wet but the rug is much whiter. We previously had a larger capacity one but have never had an issue with the smaller water reservoir in this one and it's much easier to move around, carry upstairs, etc. The separate hose cleaner attachment is what sold us on this more than anything and allows us to clean our car seats and couches with the same cleaner.

I got out 4 stains that were red and well over a year old in my sons room. I will say I had to do my sons room, a small foyer, and a flight of stairs so I had to fill the machine twice. Guess what I didn't mind it's way less annoying than the Bissell 1548. I highly recommend! Excellent Deep Cleaning.",

As far as usability, the main criticism I have is that it somewhat difficult to tell when the cleaning solution has run out. You have to keep a close eye on the return flow - when it stops, it's time to refill. An indicator light would be a useful improvement. For occasional household use, consider this as a candidate.",
