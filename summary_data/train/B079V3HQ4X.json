      "text": "A good TV, fairly simple to set up. However I bought this for the Alexa connectivity and it seems to still be almost in beta. Half of the commands do not work. And was a huge pain to try to juggle all the apps to get it to work in the first place. Still considering if I should return it. After a while I have learned how to use it better. However this sentence pretty much sums the whole experience up. You can turn the TV off with Alexa but you cannot turn it on with it.",

Tv arrived and I was really excited to watch a UHD movie on it, everything was just very dark. Contrast is terrible. I've gone through the video settings and everything is almost too dark to watch. The display is super dim so it's almost like you're not even getting any of the 4K details. I'll probably be putting my 5 year old 55\" Samsung back out in the living room. Positives: Lightweight Cheap Thin perimeter Easy to connect my surround sound Smart functions work well Negatives: Not bright enough to see First came with a broken screen",
