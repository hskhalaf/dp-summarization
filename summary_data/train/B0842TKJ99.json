If it is laying on the side the video is sideways. When operating, there are no lights, however, there is a discreet light to indicate mode/operation. The packaging is very nice, definitely gift-quality. Overall happy with this I expect lots of fun times with this gadget.",

      "text": "It is not a $70k Red digital camera, but I was surprised at the image and the quality of the pen. For the price I should have bought more than I did...wait,I can order more. You really have to look hard to see the lens, and if you did not know it was a camera, the lens is not noticeable and invisible. I would have probably just used this as a work pen without the camera, it has a nice feel and better than the bics I use. Overall, with the quality of the pen and the camera, I would/will buy a couple more.",

Even in very Sunny conditions we have now in Seattle, the picture doesn't look bright at all. I really wish they had a lens cap, like many other competition on Amazon does.
