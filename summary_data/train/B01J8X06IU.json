He moved over to football and FINALLY I found a pair of cleats that fit and he will actually wear without complaints. Bravo!",

      "text": "I do not know how many cleats we've been through due to my son's thick, wide foot. I've looked everywhere, stores, websites, looked up ways to lace shoes to accommodate his food width. I bought these, hoping like all the other cleats, that they would be wide enough for his foot. I'm a life time customer now! He will be wearing these for all his sports! They are PERFECT for his width of foot! He has not complained once his shoe is too tight and he can actually run throughout the entire game/practice without limping!",

These are visibly wider than anything I have seen in stores and have held up well over the last 6 weeks of practice and games.",
