      "text": "My fish immediately went gaga over these micro pellets. I was surprised. It was like yelling \"ice cream\" in a playground full of children. Amazing. I currently have only Swordtails and guppies in my rain catchment ponds. One big surprise is that the package is so small. I failed to realize that 0.77 oz is a tiny amount. I wish there were a larger quantity package available at a lower cost. I have been using TetraFin Goldfish Crisps which work well and costs $.159 / gram. This Hakari product costs $.274/ gram. So I think that my fish kids are gonna need to stick with the TetraFin. Except, of course, for birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Hehe. ;-)",

If you toss them down with some momentum they will sink immidiately. By mixing up these techniques I can easily ensure that my different fish get equally fed in my community tank because I can easily control where the food goes without much effort. Hikari tends to know how to design food in ways that makes feeding more efficient and this is no exception.",

I like that they are semi-sinking, which means they float at the surface long enough for the fish who prefer to skim the top to eat, then fall to the middle for my tetras and minnows, and some is then sunk to the rocks. The fish can then forage for the remaining bits, and my bottom feeders can find some leftovers too (in addition to their boiled veggies and algae wafers).",

This stuff does one of two things: floats at the top or sinks. I was hoping it would at least sink pretty slowly, but that's not the case.",
