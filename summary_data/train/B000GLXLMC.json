It is just heavy enough to place on a flat surface and sweep into it, and it is so precisely made that it only leaves a minutiae of residue. I have used this for scalping weeds off dirt, as it has a nice, sharpish edge to it - it will cut. Really no real issues. I look forward to using this for the rest of my life - fur shure. \ud83d\ude00. I recommend a \u201cbuy\u201d!",

We heat our house with a wood furnace, and need to shovel ash out of the furnace daily. Those cute little fireplace shovels just don't cut it. This is all metal, so it is useful to shovel out live embers, and it is sturdy enough to lift out a lot of ash at one time. I can clean out the furnace with three scoops with this, versus 20+ with the little fireplace tool. For our purposes, it is perfect. It is sturdy and should last for years.",

      "text": "I love this pan, i have one for inside the house and one for the garden. It is great for picking up leaves and I also use it for shoveling the snow off the back steps. It is so much easier than using a long handled shovel and the large straight edge and oversize dust pan make the job quick and easy. The dust pan is sturdy and the hole in the handle is perfect for hanging. There are larger pans and I have one but I prefer this size for most jobs. This dustpan should last a lifetime, I'm very happy with my purchase.",
