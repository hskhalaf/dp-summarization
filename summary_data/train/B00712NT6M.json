My doc's office has a huge, vintage one made entirely of wood, and this was the closest I could find. If you can afford it, this is a great item to have. I could see putting it in my bathroom and my taking a quick shower while my tot busies himself wi/ this. And sometimes, it can get to that stage!",

This means two kids can sit and play on each side of it and there\u2019s plenty to keep a younger toddler occupied for quite awhile.",
