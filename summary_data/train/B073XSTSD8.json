      "text": "I originally bought this TV to replace an old hand-me-down Samsung TV that I\u2019ve used in my gaming setup while at college for 3 years now. From the way the product was advertised, I thought that it would offer a far improved picture quality than my current TV. Got it from my campus\u2019 post office and went through the pain of setting up the legs that it balances only to find that the picture quality was horrible. What should be 1080p resolution comes out as a poorly colored, pixelated mess even with adjustments. Do not waist your money on this product!!!",

      "text": "Photo shows DVD insertion and ejection at SIDE EDGE of unit, but the slot is actually well behind the edge on the back at about the 1/3 point of the unit width. As such, if the unit is mounted on a wall, one cannot easily insert or recover a DVD. Sound quality is poor, so auxiliary speakers are essential for adequate quality and volume. Packaging for shipment was inadequate to prevent damage to the DVD eject mechanism from a likely package drop on the opposite side edge. Picture quality is very good. However, the edge frame obscures a small portion of the DVD image all around, so some DVD graphics near the edge on the original do not show properly.",

So, at the end of the day, beware and also purchase a soundbar if this is your choice. RCA has always been deemed a premium TV when I was young so, where did they drop the ball?",
