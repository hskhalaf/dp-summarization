Love them though. I purchased 3 of these 8 piece sets for a 37 gallon aquarium. Plenty of hiding spots. I'm using the two smallest size stones in a different aquarium with smaller fish.",

Update: after months of losing fish when I never had a problem of fish dying, I kept having fish die. Even tiger barbs and the EBJDs(5). I reminded these 'rock' and after a month no more fish dying. These are of course manmade and they must have used something that's toxic to fish. I recommend staying away.",

Might be a problem for fish bigger than mine, but so far so good, and my fish appreciate having their little territories from each rock. Very natural looking. Definitely recommend and would buy again if we got another cichlid tank, although they are certainly cool enough to put into a community style tank was well. The big rocks are nice caves and even the little ones make smaller fish feel safe.",

I can't return it, but am going to try sanding it so I can still use it. Will update.",

The bigger concern is that it slightly raised the pH in my tank (5-gallon). This might not be a problem for bigger tanks, though.",
