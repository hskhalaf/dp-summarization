Personally, I use it with the band that attaches over the head and the earphone sits gently on my ear. You can adjust it so you can wear the headset on either ear. It also comes with a mute button, volume control and an answer button. I use this the most with my VTech business phone system so I can type while talking or pace while talking. I can walk far without any disruption in call quality (so far about 50 feet).",

What I got was a key-system complete with extension dialing internally, paging, intercom, auto-attendant, etc. The speakerphone quality is above average as well.
