I caught a bunch of stocked browns and rainbows in Maryland and then caught a half dozen keeper lake trout in northern NYS too. Respool it with premium 6 pound fluoro line and you\u2019ll be in good shape for whatever bites.",

      "text": "There is not a better ice pole for the money. These poles are strong but sensitive on the tip so you can see light nibbles when fish are either suspicious or not really hungry. I've caught fish over 5 pounds on the medium ugly stick ice pole and prefer it over most all poles I've used. I would not only refere a friend to this, but would refere this pole to you if you want a pole that is strong enough for hard hitting large fish, but want the sensitivity of a light action pole. Good luck and happy fishing!",
