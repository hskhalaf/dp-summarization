I'm using them on ceramic tiles with fairly wide, rough grout, so they tend to wear out in a year or so. I can pop off the worn out sliders and snap on the replacements. (I don't use the mounting hardware, as I had already installed those.) The included nails are not the best way to attach the sliders to chair legs. Vibration tends to loosen them. And, on a narrow chair leg, it's important to drill a pilot hole to prevent splitting. Instead of the nails, I use small wood screws and enlarged the hole in the mounting hardware.",
