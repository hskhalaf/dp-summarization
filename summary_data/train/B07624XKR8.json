Apparently they have a new design that lets you clip it, so I wish that when we ordered it, it recommended the new model and not the older one that we ordered...but overall it is very solid. The cable has a fair distance, wish it was a little longer but it does the job. One can always get an extension... still a fair length. My daughter loves the way you can set the brightness in different settings, from bright, to brighter, to really bright. Good quality.",

I used a thicker piece of drawing paper to trace on and it worked enough for me to get a good grade on my assignment. No complaints here!",
