The OS is smooth although can lag a little at times. Cloud storage is great, fingerprint reader, NFC, etc. Great phone for the money. Definitely needs a case as it is quite slippery since it's all plastic. Unfortunately the Robin is no longer being sold as they sold to RAZR but they are updating and providing support through Feb 2018 and honoring hardware warranties through the next 6 months so if you can get your hands on one it is worth it for the money.",

It's stuck now :( just cycling through the options. I just want to throw it at a wall or ninja kick it at this point. P.S.

It's a lovely little phone with a nice screen, good speed, plenty of ram, and NFC (So many phones in this bracket don't bother with it). Keep in mind: Hot, no OTG, you need to be conservative with the battery life (I've never noticed a problem).",

It has an intriguing ultra slim design, with sharp corners and a sleek look overall. The start up process for the phone was relatively simple.. required a couple updates but nothing that took too long (total setup time about 30 minutes). Offered all the basics for a customized phone (Google accounts, security features, location settings, etc). This is the first Nextbit Robin I have owned, and since having it I have absolutely recommended it to those looking for an inexpensive prepaid phone. (Currently used on T-Mobile)",

This phone has also warped and the microphone no longer works during calls or voicemails recording. It's another software issue.

But thats a big problem so it detracts a lot if you're a big music listener like me. The build quality is very good, nice materials used. And the screen is great, high res. The tactile feedback is very good. And the packaging is excellent. The buttons are also nice. And the cameras are great, fast and great looking.",

    "title": "Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Midnight",
    "description": "Color:Midnight Black\n\nMeet Robin, the First Android phone that makes running out of space history. With the cloud integrated into Android OS, your onboard storage is merged with the cloud, so you always have the space you need. Robin seamlessly backs up your apps and photos, intelligently archives the stuff you're not using, and easily restores items when you need them. Robin is designed to Stand out. It's simple and distinct in form and function: every port, button, and sensor is thoughtfully placed and easy to use. For example, why have two buttons when one makes more sense? press the power button, leave your finger there for a Split second, and Robin is unlocked. It's simple, the power button is a fingerprint sensor too. \n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n$1,362,343 raised with 3,611 backers. \n\n\nEvery Detail Matters Everything about the design is carefully planned to create harmony and balance. Square sides make Robin easy to grip while gently rounded edges are comfortable in your hand. Robin\u2019s weight is balanced so it always stays centered in your palm. \n\nRoom to Grow By merging the cloud and onboard storage, Robin seamlessly backs up your apps and photos, intelligently archives the stuff you\u2019re not using, and easily restores items when you need them.\n\n\n\n\nThinking Ahead Months before you ever run out of storage, Robin anticipates you\u2019ll need more space and continually syncs your apps and photos.\n\nGone but Not Lost When you need space, Robin archives the things you use least, so you always have space for what you want most. \n\nBack in a Flash In just a click any app restores just where you left off. The same is true for every photo you\u2019ve ever taken.\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t Just Take Our Word \"Robin is a fantastic phone for someone who wants something that\u2019s unique and well-designed, someone who takes a ton of photos, and/or someone who loves playing a lot of mobile games (and doesn\u2019t want to delete anything to make room for more.)\u201d - Nicole Nguyen, Buzzfeed. \u201cI really think the Robin has enough style and familiarity to be the tempting force that moves some lifelong iOS users towards an affair with Android.\u201d - Lucas Matney, TechCrunch. \u201cThe Nextbit Robin delivers a different, yet familiar smartphone experience. The outside is unlike almost anything you\u2019ll likely see on the street today.\u201d - Samuel Gibbs, The Guardian.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nYou\u2019ll stand out\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWe got fed up. We had all been in the smartphone world since the early days, and we missed the feeling of excitement and innovation. Instead of originality and big changes, everyone has been copying features and phone designs from each other the past few years. Everything is incremental now, but there is so much more that can be done. Big things. So we designed the Nextbit OS to take Android to the next level and show the possibilities of a cloud connected future. And we designed Robin as a phone that would stand out from the crowd.\n\n\u00b6 What makes your product special?\n\nYou don\u2019t run out of storage. By merging cloud and onboard storage, Robin seamlessly backs up your apps and photos. When you need space it intelligently archives the stuff you\u2019re not using. And if you ever want anything back you can easily restore items when you need them. Robin does this all automatically, so you never have to worry. And Robin does this in a way that won\u2019t drain your battery or eat up your wireless data. Plus, it looks pretty great.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nWhat people say when they see Robin, not just back on Kickstarter, but now every day in people\u2019s hands has blown us away. We set out to build a phone that we\u2019d be proud to use, something that wasn\u2019t just great software or specs, but truly different design. Being a startup means we didn\u2019t have to make the usual compromises that older brands face. We could take a new path. Everyday we get to come to work knowing we\u2019re making a cooler future for ourselves and our fellow users.",
