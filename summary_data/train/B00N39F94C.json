The second vest works, but there is a minor problem with quality control. The zipper is installed backwards! Instead of the pull tab being on the right, it is on the left. It works but takes some fiddling since that is not how I am used to having zippers work. This is the reason for demoting from five stars to four. The vest is very reflective. I used it for bicycling and walking which I often do before sunrise. Along with good lights, it helps make me very visible on the bicycle.",

Since I have just received these vests I cannot comment about their durability and washability. They are a little stiff, but they are also new. I like the zip front. As other reviewers have noted, the vests are made of some sort of plastic mesh, so they should not be dried in a dryer. There are warning labels to that effect.",

This is true by day and night and in inclement weathers when vision is compromised. Reflective vests aid in safety in high traffic areas for cyclists, motor cyclists, crossing guards as well as security personal.\n\nSafety vests are classified by Ansi into separate classes; Class 2 safety vests are for work areas where workers have to stand out against a multi colored background this includes construction workers, surveyors, security guards, safety patrols and forklift operators. Neon vests offer extra visibility and are highly beneficial to use when cycling, running or even walking. Fluorescent yellow vests reduce the risk of a collision crash by increasing the distance at which drivers will detect you.\n\nReflective Vest - Orange trim edging on the double horizontal reflective stripes is designed to increase visibility and goes all around from front to back. This is perfect for nighttime bike riding as the reflective strips are easily picked up by a car\u2019s headlights. \n\nZip It Up - Don\u2019t waste time with the easy on zipper closure, just zip it up!\n\nLightweight - This lightweight safety vest, made of 100% Polyester material, is perfect to wear while running or when riding your motorcycle. \n\nSizing - The GripGlo high visibility safety vest has a helpful size chart with the measurements for four sizes, medium, Large, X Large and XX Large this will ensure that you order the right size for men and women, adults and kids.
