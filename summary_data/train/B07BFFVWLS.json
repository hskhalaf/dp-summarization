Each cover comes as 2 pieces that you just put them around the door knob, put them together until you hear a 'click' and that's it, they are installed. They can be a little tricky even for adults to open, so they do their job when you are childproofing your home. That's the only con I can find, sometimes for me it's hard to open the bathroom door, as you need to put your fingers in the spaces which are not covered, and somehow, twist the door knob, then it will open.

      "text": "These are easy to install and easy to use. Taking them off is harder, but still do-able. They fit most of our door knobs - we have two older that were too big for the covers, but shaving the plastic down a little with the Dremel was easy and fixed the issue. I would recommend these to others.",
