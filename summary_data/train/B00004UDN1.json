This item came in bright orange which is no problem as I am more interested in the functionality. It measures 15-1/2\" long. Some of the info seemed to suggest it was nearly 30\" long, but that could only be true if this was a sledge. At 52 ounces it offers some real heft. I had one of these for years until I finally broke it after maybe 25 years of hard use. It is marked as USA. Seems like a very good item.",

Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Frederick\u2019s cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become it\u2019s famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products. Today, more than ever, Stanley continues to be an industry leader in tool innovation. In 2001, Stanley introduced more than 100 new products, bringing to 400 the number of new products introduced in the past four years. As a direct result of Stanley\u2019s commitment to excellence, Stanley was awarded the Prestigious Golden Hammer Award, presented for New Product Innovation in both 2000 and 2001.\n\nSee more",
