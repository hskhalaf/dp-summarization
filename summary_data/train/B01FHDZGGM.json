These tasers did NOTHING to this mastiff and my dog has a big hole in his neck. I ended up falling with one of them in my hand and the cheap thing is now broken. The red on/off switch came off. Completely useless. They were both fully charged during the week previous to the attack. If my return window had not closed, I would be returning these. I am so disappointed and frustrated!!!",

LOL I think that it will be a confidence thing more than a weapon, because we are too old to use it vigorously.",

I imagine an intentional stun really packs a punch! The sound it makes on its own is loud and scary enough to get people away from you! Overall super great!

It was difficult to discern the actual stooping power of the device (charge versus voltage) but it appears to be of high quality and strength. I will continue to research how quality stun guns are designed, knowing there is no real standard for their design in the marketplace. Thank you.",

    "description": "The VIPERTEK VTS-989 stun gun really packs a punch! Just test firing this unit into the air is often enough to stop an attacker. As the bright electric current pulsates between the test prongs and creates an intimidating electrical sound, an attacker with any sense at all will be stopped in his tracks. If the sight and sound doesn't stop him, a jolt from this stun gun certainly will bring an attacker down! When an attacker is touched by the stun gun it will disrupt the message the brain sends to the voluntary muscles. Simply touching an attacker will deliver a high voltage shock causing loss of balance and muscle control, confusion, and disorientation bringing him to his knees and making him incapable of further aggressive activity.
