We were worried that she'd not like it since it wasn't raised, but we were pleasantly surprised that she actually really, really likes it. Because the beam is on the ground, it gives her the confidence to try things she might not have dared to try if it were raised. It has held up well these past 2 months. A good buy for us.",

The material on the beam is soft but just like the gymnastics floor so she doesn\u2019t slip while bounceing around. The non skid bottom does exactly what it says, doesn\u2019t move on any of her tricks, on any of our floors! It\u2019s perfect for what I was looking for!!",
