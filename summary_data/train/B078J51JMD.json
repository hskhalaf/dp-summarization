      "text": "Wow, this club was a game changer for me. I can hit it almost as far as my driver and with greater accuracy. It makes long par 4's reachable for me again. I let some of my golf buddies hit it and they were amazed. It is important to get the correct shaft for your swing, though. I got the 40 gram senior shaft and it is easy to hit and the ball explodes off of the clubface. But if you get the wrong shaft for your swing you won't see the same results, so I suggest you see a golf club fitter to make sure you get the right shaft for your swing brfore you place your order.",

On top of that they wanted a $15 shipping charge and 10 day shipping time to get it to me. I took the chance on Amazon and won't be needing another 3 wood until I'm able to retire and play on a daily basis. My fairways are normally my most difficult club but after 2 practice rounds I am already hitting this club better than I ever hit my old woods. Callaway definitely got this Rogue set right for the average golfer.",
