It worked wonderfully with individual HDMI feeds plugged into it, has a great picture, bright clean, and the speakers even were loud enogh for covering a small room well. Contacted Benq and Pioneer about the issues. Both said it was a fluke and Benq suggested an MH 630, which I have swapped to try. Hopefully will handle this.",

Vibrant colors, clear and detailed images. No, I repeat, no rainbow artifacts. The only complaint is the HDMI source seeking is slow. This could be a handshake issue with the avr, I am not sure. If you are looking for a home projector for HT, I can highly recommend this unit.",
