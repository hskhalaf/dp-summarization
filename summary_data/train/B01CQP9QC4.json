At first it seemed these were very underpowered, but after using on some heavy tasks, I realize it is just quieter than my Makitas were and more powerful. The battery life on these is impressive as well. I\u2019ve been able to do several projects and only have charged them when I first got them. Highly recommend any Bosch product, this drill and driver are no exemption.",

The impact driver is good, but after a battle removing the seats out of a 38' bus it was feeling a bit loose in the free play when spinning it by hand when off. It still works to tighten/remove stuff. The quick release sometimes catches and does a wonky-broken thing for a second sometimes but then will re-seat properly after playing around with it. Great performance for what it is. Fights into tight places well. Charges up fast",
