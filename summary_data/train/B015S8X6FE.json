Finally can get my work while my wife watches tv. Noise canceling works great. Also use for my nintendo switch. Love that they wrap around the ears for comfort. Great sound to. Very solid feel martial used. Highly recommended",

I use these for hours during my studies for school or on the beach before a heat and they don't get uncomfortable at all which is a first. Features \u2013 I love the folding feature. For as much as I travel this is essential. I am not a huge fan of the metal because it gets scratched easily but the memory foam is awesome. Overall- these are unbeatable. Go look at beats or any of the other top name products and you cannot get this quality for this price! Excellent!",

The ANC works as advertised; reducing the ambient noise quite dramatically. And the sound quality will blow you away; crisp; clear; clarity; through all ranges. Jlab has done it again; quality product at a reasonable price (even without the discount, worth $150).",
