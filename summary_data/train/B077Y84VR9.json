Those come at a high cost. This Igloo BMX cooler is doing just as good as my Pelican at a fraction of the cost. It\u2019s a little lighter the handle and straps seem to be heavy duty. It\u2019s got a great look and works just the same ! Very happy with this.",

I gave it 4 stars as I was expecting better performance from the BMX, and it might benefit from a rubber lid seal which it lacks. At 10.2 lbs the BMX is significantly heavier than the Rubbermaid at 4.6 lbs, but less than the Yeti Roadie 20 at 15 lbs.",

Under these conditions, the ice did not last five days, but it lasted well over two and that is saying something considering the amount of times I opened and closed it to put things in and take things out.",

I took this out for a weekend trip, half filled with ice and half filled with drinks and all of the ice was melted in 2 days. Note that I was using it under \"standard\" conditions. Meaning I stuck cans and water bottles in there that were room temp, so my example is more to give you an idea of normal use situations.",

My only thought, is that it doesn't have a gasket on the lid, it a tongue and groove, which I guess works, but if it's full of water and you carry it, it will slosh out.
