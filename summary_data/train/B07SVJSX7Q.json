Within a couple weeks the part that plugs one side if you're only pumping one breast ripped. I guess I pushed the part too hard because I wasn't sure if it was plugging it correctly and punctured a hole through it. The pump itself struggles after the let down. The consistent, slower pump starts to sound like it's hiccuping which throws off the natural sucking simulation. I still get good sessions but I've only used it for three months, one month consistently after I went back to work, so it's kind of disappointing.",

And get multiple power packs to leave one by the bed and one downstairs (and anywhere else you want - p.s. get them from eBay as they're much cheaper).",

It's powerful, but not painful when you do it properly. The quality was definitely there. I would recommend this pump to any nursing mother who wishes to pump in addition to feedings.",

It comes with a standard size but you may need different size in every breast. Using the correct size shield will make all the difference! The bag has a lot of space for storing bottles, wipes, the storage bags, a permanent marker and other things you may need on the go. It has a battery charger that is great when you are traveling, you can pump anywhere anytime!",
