I did buy different straps then what it came with, which was like a rope. It's stitched very well and has nice carabiners that hook great into the strap I bought. I am 5'11 and there hubby is 6'2\" it held us both of us without any problems. However, if you're going to have two people in one hammock you better really like the other person. I think the price was great.",

Any way, I have had it for a few days and I've used it once so far, zero complaints. It held me and my friend as we talked for hours and had a small picnic. I will definitely use this product a lot, as summer is coming up and I travel often. Anyway, long story short, I love it.",

Used ratchet straps instead of buying the hammock ones and they work perfect made it even easier. I was concerned about being able to put the hammock and straps back in the tiny bag. But it wasn't even an issue. TOTALLY WORTH IT!",
