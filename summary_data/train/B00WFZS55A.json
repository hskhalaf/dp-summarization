I thought the directions may have an answer, but it only tells you how to tighten the screws. This doesn't help the upright slippage issue. This is another example of why I dislike buying so many products online. At least in the store you can put your hands on things to judge whether or not you really are getting what you're paying for. This will be going back to Amazon.",

It also looks very nice and doesn't take up any space on a small crowded desk. I do wish the base was made of something other than black plastic, not because it's provided any functional issue but because it's not as pretty as metal would be. Or wood!

It comes with two mounts which is not explained in the directions which are pretty useless, but make for entertaining reading. Sp even though there are two mounts, neither holds well.

I'd give this five stars if at least one of the mounts was more robust.",

      "text": "I wanted something that was well made, so I bought this based on the positive reviews, even though there were less expensive options. I am pleased with my decision. Two clamping options, perfect LED bulb for my application included in the package. The swing arm has a great range of motion and moves very smoothly. Much better than the crappy plastic one I replaced. Frankly, I would prefer the control switch to be mounted on the lamp shade itself or in that area, rather than the cord, but I really can't find any other complaints about this product. Well worth it.",

I normally clamp these lamps to the far end of a table. The cable runs down the back of the table and the switch is not convenient to operate. I understood this was the design when purchasing the product so I cannot dock them a star.",
