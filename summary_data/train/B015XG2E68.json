It's awesome and it helps me correct my technique by making sure I hit the bag right where the padding is. No matter how much I jump, kick or run, these definitely stay in place.",

Comfortable, fit perfectly, and I could kick the bag/pads as hard as possible with little to no feeling. My only problem with them would be the padding on the tops of the feet. The padding is slightly larger than expected, so it's hard to walk normally on them (where the tops of the foot pads and bottoms of the shin pads meet, they hit each other and make it slightly awkward to walk in). Other than that, these are great shin guards.",

    "description": "Meister's Cloth Shin Guards are designed to offer the athlete super-strong and lightweight protection for the whole leg. Exclusively designed and sold by Meister, these Shin & Instep guards are not the generic pads you will find elsewhere. Impact foam padding is ideally sized and positioned to offer maximum contact protection on the shins and top of feet. The elastic body of these shin guards is produced precisely to hug the athlete's leg tightly to hold the guard in place, but still allow you slide them off or on without a major struggle. The hook and loop elastic strap at the top of the guard further allows the wearer to secure the guard to the leg. Don't go for cheap knock-offs or mass-produced guards that don't fit or protect. Get your fight on with Meister.",
