He said he didn't even notice them. NICE! They look good and now my wife can get in. Also makes it easier for me to dry the top after I wash it. Still kinda meh about having running boards on a 2 wheel drive though.",

      "text": "Just installed these boards today. Took about an hour and 15 minutes. Seem very sturdy. Looks good on my 2017 Chevy Silverado crew cab. The only complaint I have is the same as most. The front passenger mounting bracket needs assembly, which was a little tricky. However, I took my time and that particular bracket was as sturdy as the rest. All the hardware needed was included. The product was packaged well. Would recommend this as an alternative to any $300 to $500 nerf bars or running boards. The installation was fairly easy and saved a couple hundred bucks on install charges as well.",

My biggest issue (and why I am not giving 5 stars) has to do with the number of brackets included. The unit comes with three mounting brackets for each side. That leaves a significant gap behind the last bracket and the back end of the running board. While the selling distributor stated that the boards are tested at 300 lbs and a fourth bracket is not needed, the appearance of the spacing leaves much to be desired. The selling distributor said they are not in position to send additional brackets, hence the review...",

      "text": "Product shipped immediately and arrived on the scheduled delivery date. Installing this item was fairly simple as long as you follow the directions. The boards look great, however, the brackets and hardware are not so attractive. The nuts and bolts are chrome, and highly visible on a blacked out product. I ended up spray painting them black for a quick fix. The brackets look, for lack of a better word, cheap. Just a flat piece of metal (thankfully those are black), that hang down approximately 3 inches below the boards. Fix the brackets and hardware... I would buy this product again. As is, I would not recommend this item.",
