This product checked all the boxes in terms of functionality, high CFM, stainless, \"Euro\" design removable grills, led lights, the works. However on receipt one of the three \"removable\" grills could not be removed as it would not unlatch.

It was tricky to install this hood and my stove seems to stick out more from the wall, therefore the suction from the fans is not aligned to properly suck the fumes when cooking. When the air conditioner is on in the summer, in my kitchen window, it blows the steam towards the fans and the hood sucks in the steam a little better. Was shocked to hear that when the lights burn out, you can not replace them with new ones. The bulbs are permanent and once they burn out, you will not be able to replace them.",

This can be installed for rear and top vent out which is one of the reasons I purchased it and you definitely need two people when you are mounting! Pros: Suction power and look of the hood. Cons: Noise level is higher than what I expected. Touch screen is not the best. Sometime I have to tap on it multiple times to power on or to increase/decrease the fan level.",
