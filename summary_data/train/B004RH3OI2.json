The first thing I noticed was the engineering. This thing has been through the testing ringer and user experience is obviously a priority. It's also super adjustable and comfortable. Last week I finally had the chance to test this harness in a real life situation: Descending the \"Pit of Death\" (ammo supply access way) on the USS Iowa Battleship. Harness did great and we were able to complete our mission on time and on target. Thanks!",

In the summer you will sweat a little more than in a really thin nylon bare harness but in my mind it's worth it for the features. I am 6'1'' and 185 lbs. Medium size fits me perfect.",
