We initially got it to avoid the fatty sunflower seeds and peanuts, the birds seem happy and the vet says their healthy so we've stuck with it. The only thing about this being \"natural\" I don't think it's treated to kill the mouth larva, if you leave unused seed in the bottom of the cage you can get those little pantry moths. Just remember to keep the cage clean and dispose of the waste food accordingly and you'll be fine.",

I would recommend this product for any type of parrot.",
