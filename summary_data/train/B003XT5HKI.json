It is a very versatile stability running shoe that can easily transform from a race day shoe into a rugged daily trainer that can do both distance and speed training. This shoe is praised by many because it is affordable and reliable.",
      "pros": [
        "A few testers coveted the Racer ST 5\u2019s ability to tackle the long distance runs, as well as speed trainings",
        "Several runners took notice of how responsive this model was when it came to their performance",
        "The low profile nature of the forefoot gives the shoe superb ground feedback",
        "The price is very affordable",
        "The traction of the Brooks Racer ST 5 is more than adequate on the road based on the reviews of a handful of runners",
        "The Diagonal Rollbar Technology allows mild over-pronators to enjoy this running shoe without adding weight",
        "It has an average weight that\u2019s agreeable to the preferences of most runners"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Most of the reviewers were frustrated by the quality of the laces, which tended to easily become unraveled",
        "A gender-specific fit is something a large majority of runners would have wanted from the Racer ST 5",
        "The 12mm heel differential, especially for a racer, did not sit well for forefoot and mid-foot strikers"

      "text": "This shoe lasts so long. I have never had a shoe wear so well. Years of races and marathons and it is still great! It is also light and wide enough in the toe box so I don't lose toe nails. The only thing I don't like is the shoelaces kept coming untied, so I replaced them. I highly recommend this shoe for anyone looking for something just a notch more cushion than a racing flat, and whatever they use to make this foam, it sure lasts.",
