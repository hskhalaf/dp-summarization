So I have to keep the 10's on the bottom center bar, since they won't even fit on the top one. Im practically picking them up off the floor at that point. It's just such an obvious mistake in the design, and it's incredibly annoying. Maybe if you use another brand of plates, they'll fit better. I wouldn't have bought this if I had read the other reviews first. Oh well. At least it's cheap.",

I was going to put 2 45s on the bottom center peg and 2 on the right peg, but the weights are too large for the bottom. So I tried to put them on the left side, but then the middle peg is unusable.

I would look for a better option to store bumper plates though like a rack add on.",

Paint scratches very easily too so if you want something to stay pretty, this isn't the rack for you. Overall, great and strong product.",

The 45 plates (and maybe the 35s too) are a little smaller than the average gym plate, but pounds are pounds to me. The set I have fits perfectly on this rack. I have a pretty decent home setup for when I can't make it to the gym. I think this is a solid rack for home use.",
