      "text": "The cooktop is well constructed with appealing design features. Controls are intuitive and simple to use. Noise level is low. As with all induction cooktops in this class, heat uniformity depends largely on the thermal properties of the cookware. The induction coil is approximately 4\u201d in diameter. Large diameter, shallow pans will develop a hot spot at high power settings. Lower temperature settings for these applications is recommended. Simmering, in large, mostly filled pots displays no such problem. At lower temperature settings, emulating a slow-cooker is simple and effective. I use, and recommend, heavy, induction compatable ceramic cookware, similar to that shown in the photograph (Vermi).",

There is a bigger circle around it, but it means nothing and was clearly added to for no other purpose than than tricking you into thinking the heating area is much larger. Heat will eventually distribute across a pan, but you end up getting a hot center and cool edges on any normal 10 ish inch pan. If you only use small pots and 6-7 inch pans, this will work well. Anything larger and you end up running into many issues due to uneven heat distribution.",

However, be aware that the coil is still only about 6.5\" in diameter so you need to use heavier pans or pans with triple ply bottoms and give it time to evenly heat before putting your food in - otherwise, you will get a ring of burned on food. I've seen it recommended that you should start at a low power setting and gradually raise it to more evenly distribute the heat.

We are using hotplate to stir fry, pan fry various cuts of meat and of course boil, steam and simmer. Comes up to cooking temps very quickly. That is what we were looking for and that is what we got. Very satisfied.",

So far I am a fan",
