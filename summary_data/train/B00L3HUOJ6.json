She has me digging this long 3' x 6' area, down 30 inches. She says it's for a hedge, but it looks like it would be just right for my body. If you see a novel with the title, Death by Post Hole Digger, you'll know the truth. Don't buy one of these. It makes it too easy to dig holes - even in the hard desert.",
