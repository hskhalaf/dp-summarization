Also the preparation of plants are pretty bad as well.

There is a section in the middle of the book that has colored photographs but then you have to look at the photo and try to find the matching description elsewhere in the book. Not the best lay out for field study. I would prefer to have colored photos right along side each plant description for easy identification.",
