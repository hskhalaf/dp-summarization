While these are more smearing than edging, I love these boots for mountain climbing as long as I don\u2019t need a technical boot. I just did an 8 hour mountain hike in the Southeast Alaska temperate rainforest, and these were absolutely awesome. I ordered another pair as I do not believe Hoka is still making these.
