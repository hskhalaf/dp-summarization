Sure, the ingredients may be organic and no chemicals but for the twenty-something dollars I paid... It really isn't worth it. It doesn't moisturize any better than plain coconut oil. Updated review 11/11/17 The more I have used this lip oil the more I\u2019ve grown to like it. The glossiness it gives to lips is nice and my lips are smooth with it on. I think maybe I was to quick to judge with my original review. I actually think I may be repurchasing! Plus I want to try the anti-aging face oil too.",

When my lips start to get dry, I put it on over my lipstick and it brings the color back to life. I cannot say enough good things about this product. I use a BiPAP machine at night (similar to a CPAP), and the constant blowing air makes my mouth and lips extremely dry. This product is definitely worth the cost.",
