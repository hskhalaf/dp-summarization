So much so that the reflection and fuzzy edges to text gave me a headache when I used it. I've returned it as a result.",

In its gone in the bin & the money written off.. It\u2019s junk. Definitely the worst purchase of my adult life & will never buy another amazon made product as long as I live.

There is no need to say anything because these little Tabs are quite simply Awesome. Been contemplating buying one for ages but so glad I decided to! They are a brilliant piece of kit. No need to worry about memory/storage, just equip yourself with a SD card, mine (256Gbt) and all your worries disappear. Cracking Tab, so buy one, you will not be disappointed \ud83d\ude00 \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\udcbb Joner (Electronics Engineer / HiFi nutter) 27/11/19",

However, I don't feel that it is as secure as my previous tablet and loathe to do my banking on it so still use my old tablet for that. I don't find it so easy to delete my old history as on my old tablet. I go into history to delete things I don't want left on there but when I next do a search the old history still seems to pop up. Also I usually order photos through FreePrint app but I can't seem to download it onto my Fire tablet",

Probably the one thing my 3 year old son uses the most and despite having bought him this tablet to save him using my phone all the time, he usually ends up just having to use my phone anyway, which avoids the point. Probably just as well it has a damage warranty, I would expect quite a few people would get irate with that alone. Despite being based on Android, There are other basic android features missing even in the adult profile such as screen pinning. Quality seems OK for the money but might be better off spending money on a proper Android tablet or a cheap used iPad.",
