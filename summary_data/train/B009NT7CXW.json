Using a touchscreen is, in general, surprisingly enjoyable. It's disappointing that OS X does not work nicely with this monitor's touch; this is OS X's fault, though, as it believes it's dealing with a single-contact-point graphics tablet. While watching videos, I noticed that occasionally the backlight does oddly dim. It might be my eyes playing tricks with me, but I somehow doubt it. Still, I really love the screen overall.",
