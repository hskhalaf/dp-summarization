The 3 wire connectors are easy to daisy chain your AWG. 3 pieces of advice: 1. use wire strippers, lost mine in the attic & found out the hard way that snips create a weak point in AWG that will break off inside connector. 2. Stuck wire unscrews out, the hole in the connector is not a release. 3.test your hole saw. 4.25\" dia. is a little snug getting past the bend, but will go with some force.

Price is great, quality great, only minor issue is locking them into the ceiling takes a little practice and getting used to, the electricians helper had a little challenge, but I figured it out as a DIYer so its not a really an issue",

I'll have to decide which instruction to use before cutting any holes. I'll probably do the 6-1/4 inch hold as it's easier to make a hole larger than it is to make it smaller.",

Hopefully it's 14 gauge (15 amp circuit); otherwise I'm not sure if supplied wire connectors will work with the heavier gauge.

My first row was only an inch away from the stud and it was a challenge to lock in the clips. One other thing... I used an adjustable drywall hole cutter with the plastic dust catcher.

You'll have to buy the correct hole saw. or be ready to open hole larger by sanding or other...I chose to use by 2\" expanded drum sander until my correct hole saw arrived. Everything else about the product is solid and sound. I will be buying additional packs to finish my project.",
