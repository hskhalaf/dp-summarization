(I'm writing this review from my work computer). At this point I just want to send it back. Edited. The Skytech suppot folks had me remove a stick of ram and it ran all night without issues. I reinstalled the ram this morning and it's running great. Now I have the PC I was expecting. Awesome job guys.",

First lets start with how it looks, to me it looks amazing inside and out it has a clear through panel so you could see the beauty inside. So far every game i throw at it can run it perfect on ultra-high settings including Fortnite Destiny 2 The Division Fallout 4 and many more. it has not given me any problems what so ever. I do believe this is the best prebuilt gaming pc in the market right now. I really recommend this pc to anyone who is looking into getting into pc gaming.",

      "text": "This is a mid-size tower with lots of flash. The price is good. There's 16GB ram, and a decent video card. Caveats: No optical drive (CD/DVD). No license key sticker on computer. Use freeware program Keyfinder to extract the license number if you want to swap out the hdd for ssd or larger hdd. Failing that, use a disk cloning program like Clonezilla to clone the drive. Limited expandability. Use your SATA connections wisely. There are only 4. Operation seems smooth enough, and it's pretty. I'll update as I continue to use.",

My only issue is that 2 of the backside usb ports are wonky and if the devices plugged into them are nudged they disconnect, not a gigantic issue and it could be a problem with just my pc, not all. Also the mouse and keyboard that come with the pc aren't trash like i was kind of expecting them to be so that's nice. Overall if buying parts separately is too expensive or seems to daunting to do buy yourself this is a nice buy. I've recommended this to friends of mine looking for pcs and i recommend it to you too.",

Remember to remove the protective foam inside of the desktop computer casing. ***** UPDATE The computer keeps crashing and giving me the blue error screen. Don't buy this PC, or anything else from Skytech. I tried contacting them to ask for a reboot disc (one wasn't included when I purchased the computer), but I found out that they changed accounts with Amazon and no longer receive emails on complaints on this PC.

We haven\u2019t had the need for tech support, but based on other reviews, tech support is fast, friendly, and knows what they are doing. I would definitely recommend this gaming pc",

      "text": "I have had this computer about a week and so far, it has met all my expectations. I have not owned a PC in quite a while, so the fact that this one did not have a cd-rom drive threw me for a loop. However, the components all look great, the Elgato capture card I installed went in easily with no hassle. I have only tried out some of the streaming sites like Twitch and Youtube and they all run at break neck speed and clarity. So far, I would recommend this computer.",
