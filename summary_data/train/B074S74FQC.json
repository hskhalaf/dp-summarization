About half or 3/4. Takes a little practice. I suggest trying alot of recipes and writing down adjustments you made. Ie, water amount and time in full sun and part sun ect. But, this is the best one for the dollar. This cooker or two of them and maybe a solar grill would complement eachother. Also, it almost weighs nothing.",
