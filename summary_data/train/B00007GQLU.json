It is a somewhat challenging lens, to take pictures.Due to its extreme shallow depth of field, one has to know exactly what he/she is doing under the risk of getting a blurry nose or part of the face. With that out of the way, I use to joke this lens is as fast as the Roadrunner and as sharp as a Ninja 's blade.On top of it, add the excellent price and voila\u0301!!...you have the perfect lens.",

Second test was after dark, comparing it to the standard 18-55mm zoom that comes in most kits. Shutter speed about 4 times faster under same lighting, as it should be since f1.8 is 3 1/2 stops bigger than the f5.6 of the zoom at full extension. The camera worked hard to auto-focus because it was so dark but it made a good comparison test. More tomorrow. Noticed it's REALLY heavy compared to the zoom. Yeah, big glass weighs more. That's why it's a superior lens. I'm pleased. Worth the price.",

If you cant afford a 70-200 I would recommend this as alternative option for sure because you will see results fast. Even though this lens is awesome and is super sharp the only problem it has which can be fixed is the purple fringing when there is lots of contrast between dark and light.

On a crop sensor it's field of view is still within the preferred portrait focal lengths, and when used outdoors it is easy to get the distance between you and your subject that you need. Indoors it's a little harder unless you are in a larger room. It's a useful focal length on both full frame and crop, but if you like head and shoulder portraits and shallow depth of field, I can't recommend this lens enough.

I am not happy with this seller. I will not order from them again.",

I bought it for portraits, and it's great for that. If you want to take pictures indoors, you need to remember it's a long lens (more so if you don't have a full-frame body). Also, if you're not used to apertures this big, you need to be prepared for the shallow depth of field - it's easy to get pictures where an object is in focus, but an adjacent object isn't, even though it's just barely further back or in front.",

      "text": "This lens is extremely sharp and has nice bokeh. The USM is extremely fast and quiet. The color saturation is beautiful. The 1.8 aperature is extremely helpful in low light. The lens construction is solid. This is a little tight on a crop body like the 7D. You can take gorgeous portraits of head and shoulders from a reasonable distance but for a full body shot you have to step back considerably. Its the equivalent of 135mm on a full frame camera. As long as you realize this upon puchase you will not be disappointed with this lens.",

If you find it changes your life, start saving for the L series.",
