I\u2019ve double checked that it\u2019s installed correctly so I have to wonder if it\u2019s a manufacturing error as I have to force the seat with a fair amount of strength to get it to turn and it\u2019s clear my baby will never be able to do it on his own. Also the leg openings are kinda small and it\u2019s very hard to get my babies feet through the openings. Overall pretty disappointing for how much this product cost.",

Being a music teacher, it was great to have my grandson have so much fun jumping to the music and me singing along as the songs played. Have some great videos of all the fun! Love that you can adjust the height of the seat as the baby grows taller. Worth every penny! It is not easy to take apart, so expect to primarily keep it in one room.",

On this one, some of the edges were waivy. Same issue with the smeared glue, this one also had a crack in the clear plastic. Stickers again misaligned. It\u2019s a shame because we had the old version 3 years ago for our older child, and that one was a completely different level of quality. This will be returned, we will try a different brand.",

This toy does not reccomend that the babys feet lay flat on the ground but that they are on their tip toes so the babies will outgrow it. Worth the money to entertain your little one. Plays music and has various toys. My baby loves the crunchy sound the toy fly makes !",

One sits in the seat and watches and \"talks\" to the dangling toys. The other bounces so high she can she can grab the toys and take them down. No destruction yet, but I imagine that's coming. The jumper itself seems quite durable and will likely last as long as the girls use it. Be sure you have limits on the movement of the jumper, as the jumping of our turbo child moves it around the kitchen more than we expected. Don't allow it to get close to an open staircase or things she could knock over.",

The bar at the bottom is able to collapse when you need to move it which is really nice when getting it thru doorways. Overall I was really pleased with it. She's about to be a year old and still fits in it when adjusted to the highest setting, but sadly she just isn't interested in it anymore though. I gave it four stars only because I think the price is a bit much.... I would try to get it on sale.",

Of all the musical toys we have this is the only one that really gets to me. It has a somewhat repetitive beat.",

His main activity is jumping, but he also plays with the various toys mounted on the rim. He also enjoys sucking on the animals hanging from the leaves. Those Fisher-Price folks really know babies and toys! One bit of advice: The padded frog that lines the seat is a little difficult to put on the pegs. I recommend you ignore the instructions, which are very confusing, hold the padded seat and plastic rim together and just muscle it on. Have fun! Makes for great videos!",

      "text": "Great product, perfect for my 3 month old with much time to grow into it. He can hang out in here entertained for 30 minutes or more, giving me time to get some things done around the house. He loves wiggling around and jumping and I think this toy has helped him better interact with his surroundings. He really enjoys grabbing at the butterfly piece that pulls out and has figured out how to start the music again by spinning the wheel. I\u2019d like to think this is helping with his cognitive development as well as hand-eye coordination.",

My daughter unfortunately doesn't really like it but at 6 months I think it's a little over stimulating for her with all the music and everything. She likes to eat the little crinkle butterfly on the side and hit the spin parts but gets made she can't touch the birds and cries when the music is on. My two year old however loves the music. Either way this toy was a great buy!",

After assembling, it was too large to get through the room door, so I had to disassemble it to get it out of the house, then into my son's house, before reassembling. My advice is to assemble in the room where it will stay.",
