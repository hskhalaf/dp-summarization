The lid was a cause for concern when I opened this up because of the lack of rubber siding but it did a beautiful job and kept the heat in. I definitely recommend Black + Decker slow cookers!!",

Didn't think much of it. Used it today and when I removed the pot...there was about 1\" of liquid in the base that had seeped thru the crock somehow. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the product and have never had this happen with any of my other slow cookers. Ever.",
