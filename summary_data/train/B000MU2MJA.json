Unfortunately, it kills moths too, as my hubby zapped the poor lil bugger instead of letting him out of the house. My husband runs around like a kid in a candy store, trying to kill everything.",

      "text": "I've had one of these for the past 3 years or so - a kid finally destroyed it by using it like a traditional flyswatter :-(. I liked it so much I bought another one! It works great against houseflies, wasps, & mosquitos, and brings out the inner hunter-killer in even the most gentle people. The easiest way to guarantee a zap is to wait for the fly to land on a counter or window, then swipe the Executioner across the surface. The fly will see it coming and begin to take off, so you will catch it in mid-flight. ZAP!! Very satisfying. Goes easy on the batteries - one change a season should do it.",

It's actually quite fun, especially to watch them light up and then explode with a nice pop. I've also used it to kill flies as well as get some wasps flying around my house. As others have mentioned, it takes a little longer to kill the bigger insects but it works great on small ones, which is what I bought it for.",

This unit you can touch and get a minor discomfort but my other unit was downright painful. Also it may take popping the fly a couple of times before it kills it. My other unit would take care of the fly in one contact. In my opinion, their advertisement that this is the most powerful fly swatter on the market is just hype. Most powerful sounding one maybe but not the most power through the wiring. Very entertaining \"POP\" makes this a joy to use.",
