I have 5 old vehicles in my household, and I don't have to take vehicles to a garage anymore, whenever I have battery problems. This tester is very simple and easy to use. It shows my battery level and determines the battery conditions. It also shows if the alternator is charging the battery. With this tester, now I can analyze myself that if it is problem with batterey, or alternator, instead of taking vehicle to a garage. I'm saving time and money. This tester is worth it.",

On first test it informed me that the surface charge had to be depleted.

I wish there was an AH mode, but even with CCA or any other test it will pretty much tell you what the state of your battery is.

Seeing crank time is icing on the cake. Seeing max load and load at idle on your alternator takes out a lot of guess work. It is easy to use. In fact you will probably test several batteries and do a full analysis on your charging system just for the fun of it.",
