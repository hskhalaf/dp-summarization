Something that can be improved is the cleaning tool, the mental likes to bends when you are cleaning inside the straws.

The light colored ones doesn\u2019t stain after sitting in cranberry juice. They\u2019re too thin to drink smoothies out of but this brand sells a fatter version. They are super bendy and don\u2019t stay compressed or become damaged when I chew on them. I do wish it came with a case to put one in so it\u2019s more travel friendly but I just keep them in a ziploc in my glove box.",

There was no noticeable chemical smell that comes with a lot of these reusable products. The cleaning brush works just fine with the straws, I would say the metal handle could be a little more sturdy due to a snug fit and the bend in the straw neck. They are very flexible, so if you are someone who needs a full glass of ice for their beverage, you\u2019ll probably experience some issues in stirring. Otherwise, I feel with just a few cubes they can manage to stir drinks just fine. Will definitely purchase again in the future.",

This makes cleaning so much easier. If you don't have a dishwasher, a brush is provided for you & works well too. I have run a few of them through the dishwasher & have not seen any issues. I would have given 5 stars for durability but since they haven't been used or washed often enough I gave 4. Though I do feel they will last much longer than those I purchased before. I highly recommend!",

The other thing I would change is there is a seam in the silicone that runs on the bottom of the straw, which is what your tongue touches. I would rather have the seam on the side. Not a huge deal but could be a better design. Thanks for donating to charity!",

They are definitely more comfortable than metal or bamboo or even hard plastic straws. The slight bend is perfect. I didn't have any issues with weird smell or taste that silicone sometimes has. I cleaned all of them (and the bag) prior to use and the cleaning brush seems to work well. The carrying bag feels like a nice material-it is breathable and dries quickly.",

They come in really pretty colors and they come with a bag and a cleaning brush which is really convenient for on the go.
