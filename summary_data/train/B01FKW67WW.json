Somehow my wife managed to turn off the rear speakers just from trying to navigate the menu. The only way to do this is to go into the alternate menu that is only accessible when the unit is off. Makes no sense at all. The USB connector rusted out within a year in the Hawaii humidity. Seems like they could have used higher quality materials on the USB port. The face plate connector also rusted. Sometimes the stereo cuts out from the weak connection. You have to push and jerk on the face to make it work again.",

It has about any choices and extras that most Stereos don't have. the DEH 6900BT USB port is only for charging your Phone or Ipad etc. This one has USB music playback like most others, and has enough Enhanced features that it will take me a month to find all of them. One real good thing about the Pioneer DEH-X7800BHS is it is user friendly, I think this is a great buy.",

BUT, the main reason i bought this radio was for blue tooth integration. blue tooth is horrible on this thing. i have a iphone 6 too. constantly tells me bt not connected. i even upgraded the firmware and none of these problems were fixed. oh and the pandora app is absolutely horrible. cannot change stations or anything from your phone. so once you connect to the receiver thats the only station that will play. buy something else i missed my 30 day window by 5 days cause i kept putting it off.",
