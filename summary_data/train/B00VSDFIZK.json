(I've been using sunscreen daily for over 20 years and am well-versed with how to apply sunscreen and the frequency needed for reapplication.) Despite the fact that it is cosmetically elegant, blending in nicely with almost no smell and very little white sheen, I will not repurchase and cannot recommend as it doesn't do its job to protect skin from burning. I am going back to my long-time favorite Elta MD products.",

I deducted three stars because it makes me break out in tiny pimples, they go away within a day or two if I stop using the sunscreen. :(",

But, I stopped using it because it made my face break out really badly. If you do give it a shot, be sure to shake well since it separates a lot.",

This is the only face sunblock that hasn't caused me breakouts. It's so nice to apply too, as very moisturising but at the same time is a great base for makeup, almost like a primer as holds my foundation for hours. Great for outdoor sports, doesn't sting eyes, non-greasy, doesn't leave white marks, waterproof. All round excellent product and a very good price.",

I also do not find it at all hydrating. My skin feels tight and dry all day when I use this. At night when I cleanse my face before bed, I do not feel like I have fully removed the residue of this stuff. I really wanted to love this but I am disappointed. I love other Avene products, but not this one.",
