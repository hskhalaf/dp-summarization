I love this fragrance, but this is not the same perfume I have been buying from the department store for the last 20 years or so. It seems to be a very weak version of the original, when I use Aromatics a little goes a long way, this stuff is gone almost as soon as you put it on! Lesson learned, there are some things you just have to pay the price for.",
