      "text": "Before we bought this smoker, we read some posts online about how people made smokers out of filing cabinets. The Smoke Vault *is* basically like a file cabinet with a burner. It doesn't retain or manage heat very well. To smoke something really properly you need to maintain certain temperatures, so this isn't it. (If you don't think this is important, then you may be fine with this.) We'll have to get something more serious eventually, but this was a learning experience.",

      "text": "This is the first smoker I've ever used, and it did not disappoint. Was easy enough to assemble with the instructions provided. Firing it up for the first time was also very easy. The thermometer on the front of the unit seemed fairly accurate the first use, but the second use my ThermoPro was reading about 30\u00b0F different. With that being said I wouldn't rely solely on the door thermometer. Plus the dual read ThermoPro makes everything so much easier. The temperature control is very consistent, but it's not easy to dial it to an exact temperature, which is really my only complaint with this. I would highly recommend for a first time BBQ'r. Can't beat this for the price!",

So far I have smoked chicken, salmon, ribs, and brisket. They've all turned out wonderful. The only reason this gets 4 stars is because it's uninsulated. Controlling the temp isn't always easy, like others have said, especially on windy dates. I think I'm going to pick up some of that reflective gold heat shielding. That should increase the overall temps, allowing me to use less fuel and produce a more consistent product.",

It just depends. I guess if you are a smoker this is VERY important, as my husband is the smoker not me and he tells me this. Boo!",

      "text": "I like having several shelves. Wish it had rollers to move around easier but its light so not too much trouble to move it. The door has no seals so it smokes a little out the edges of the door but overall I dont think it matters. It sometimes is hard to maintain the heat at a specific temp if your trying to keep it low but you get the hang of it. Would be nice if it had an automatic heat setting but you just have to check on it often.",
