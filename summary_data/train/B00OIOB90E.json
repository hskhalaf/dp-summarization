This comb finds mats that I didn't even know my cats had, and helps me take them out. If it's a really bad mat, it's not going to remove it, but it's effective on all the smaller mats. As others have said, start with the wider teeth, in small sections, then go over with the other side. It takes out a lot of fur. My cats behaved through it all. I wish I bought this years ago.",

After two weeks of brushing and finishing up with this tool, she's gorgeous and happy. Second photo is my dog. She is a well groomed Golden, brushed all the time, but this tool really got down into her undercoat and removed what was shedding and she is happily basking in the sun without carrying around all that fly away hair.",

It's a very good brush, and maybe you can prevent matting of cats with long hair, but you can get that from combs at less that half the price. You WILL NOT remove matted clumps of fur from your cat with this brush, outside of him/her scratching your face off. :D. it's being marketing as some wonder brush that removes hair mats, and the video for the product is useless.

The other ones always had the fur flying in the air - this one is more contained, the fur stays on the blade (most of it anyway). That is very helpful and much neater. Also, it looks dangerous but is really gentle with the curved tips. My dog does not like to be brushed and that has not changed, but for me, I enjoy it more since I am not breathing in dog dander, fur, etc.",

The mats were out of control. I was looking at a $130+ visiting groomer fee. Sundae got mad at me, but with soothing voice and determination - she is mat free and bathed. It took about an hour and a half but, working slowly, brush from undercoat with a small arc upwards and they start to shave off. I recognize that the sharpness of the blades is essential. Scissors are way too risky and I\u2019d never risk hurting her. It worked the whole time. Very pleased with this purchase!",

Although very comfortable, the material hangs on to a hair or two and that is very hard to remove. You can't just brush it off. I suppose I could wash it off, but nah.
