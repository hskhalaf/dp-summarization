This is the perfect wall decor in my room, and it makes me happy every time I walk in and see it. It's not overpowering with colors or brightness. It's relaxing and tranquil. I would definitely recommend if you like cacti and succulents like I do! \ud83c\udfdc\ud83c\udf35",

This tapestry is very large but it is also super light weight, I was able to hang it smooth after I ironed it (don't complain about wrinkles people it comes folded) with just a few clear push pins. If I had other walls needing a makeover I would certainly purchase more!!",

I decided to order this since I could return it if it didn\u2019t work out, BUT this is so cute. The graphics are good, the material is microfiber, and the price was awesome. I could have steamed out the wrinkles but wasn\u2019t in the mood, but they would come out easy enough. I\u2019d recommend you buy it!",

Has obvious creases due to being folded, but that doesn't bother me at all so I hung it up right away. Been admiring it ever since :)",

I have it against a window, and it does a perfect job of acting like a light curtain. The colors are not as bright as I thought they were going to be, but it still looks great. The image is very good quality, so it doesn't look blurry or anything.",

The only difference is the material i have a tapestry from UO and it is very thick this tapestry was made out of a silky material but it didn\u2019t feel cheap. The UO tapestry is like $40 and this one is much cheaper.",
