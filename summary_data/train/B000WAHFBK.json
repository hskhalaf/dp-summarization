However, after two sets of S4's (for convenience sake), I became solid fan of Klipsch and had no hesitancy trying the X10's. 10's have everything that makes the 4's great plus unbeatable sound, comfortable wear for hours, weightless, cables that are perfect in 4's but even lighter weight and possibly more durable in 10's. After several months of using both daily, the 4's and 10's are great purchases at their price points. My newest baseline for total value and earphone performance is the X10 and I don't anticipate a competitor raising that bar anytime soon.",

Yes, I can get premium ear tips, but still the sound IS disappointing. There are better earphones out there at half the price. Skip these.",

I enjoy using them . I would not have purchased them at the regular price but I was glad to take a chance at the discounted price and I'm glad I did.

The Klipsch Image X10's are very easy to seat in the ear. Unlike other in-ear headphone I own (Shure 535's or UE 10's), the X10's can readily be taken out and then re-seated in the ear. Even after several hours of listening, they are still very comfortable. They don't tug on the ear and keep a good fit when moving around. Their ability to isolate are the second best I own. The only better isolating headphones are my Ety 4's with triple flanges. They are a very comfortable headphone for day to day commuting.",

Other sellers might be doing this as well. Please take caution. Things to check: 1. The box should have a silver hologram sticker with a serial number on it . 2. You can check the serial number on Klipsch website:  Having said that, the actual Klispsch X10 are very good in clarity and maybe a bit heavy on the bass. But they are incredibly comfortable and I hardly notice them after a while. Happy shopping!",

Most of the ear buds only last about six months before they have problems, so, I brought the 3 year square trade protection plan.

I was busy for a few days and was about to order a new pair, and decided to try the old ones one more time. Apparently it took a few days for the X10s to dry up and they sounded great again!!!

      "text": "I saw these on sale for about 90 during Black Friday 2 years ago. I have better headphones and earbuds, but I use these almost daily. They have stood up to being wound up and placed in a pocket multiple times. They fit nicely and comfortably in the ear and the sound quality is very nice for this price range. You will get some noise when the cable rubs against your shirt or jacket, but I find most earbuds do this to some extent and I am able to usually block it out. I wouldn't use these for running though.",

So much so and because I am afraid I may not find these again in the near future - I intend to buy another pair as a spare. One never knows.",
