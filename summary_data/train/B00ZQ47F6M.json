It does not bother my sensitive skin, and it's only mildly irritating if I get it in my eyes. It does not sting or burn my eyes or skin. I started off the year using what I had left from last year, and it seems to have maintained its efficacy/potency. I highly recommend this brand of sunscreen.",

Ive tried every sunscreen but stick to my Dermatologists recommendation to use mineral (natural, minimal ingredients, avoid irritants) even if the trade off for the reflective sunscreen appears more white/chalky. Mineral sunscreens protect by reflecting damaging uv rays while chemical convert. From personal experience I would also recommend this effective sunscreen for others who have a sun sensitivity due to medications & those in hot humid weather. It\u2019s a good lightweight face moisturizer or combine with few drops of sweet almond oil (dryer skin types). Apply, enjoy & repeat accordingly!",

It definitely protects everyone from harmful rays. I highly recommend !!",
