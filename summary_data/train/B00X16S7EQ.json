Elevates the speakers to direct sound towards my ear. Stands are sturdy and does not flex under the weight of the speakers. Happy with my purchase.",

Mine are on a window sill behind my sofa where they serve as the rear L&R surround sound speakers, hence my need to angle them up. I would think twice if my speakers were on my work desk or somewhere they could be constantly knocked over. The stands are just little metal wedges and seem a bit overpriced, but they do they do look much better than the rubber alternatives.",

However, if you have limited headroom (like under my monitor shelf), they dont adjust. It's totally fine and I am still happy with my purchase. My setup requires the speakers to be slightly outside what I would consider optimal \"sound stage\" but they still sound great. Love these speakers and just ordered the sub (auditioned these with mostly acoustic music -anything more than that really needs the sub). Good price. Great quality and a perfect fit. Buy them.",

They can easily be bent back up to the desired angle, but it is going to sag. Maybe the stainless steel would be better, but it is still rated at 6lbs.
