Also has fun science experiments, history readings, music, art, math and tons of parent guidance throughout. It\u2019s a must for parents who are feeling overwhelmed by all of the mess going on right now in the education system.",

One tip I did discover the hard way -- definitely buy the paperback and NOT the Kindle version. We did start with the Kindle, but having the hard copy makes a world of difference for highlighting, taking notes, and reviewing chapters. Plus a 'Good' to 'Like New' one is cheaper than the eversion.",
