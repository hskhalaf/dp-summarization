I used the provided guide to find the right size and upon testing the fit of these chains I found that they fit perfectly. The chains themselves appear to be constructed well, with no missing or twisted links. They came packaged in a plastic-lined cloth sack, which was inside of a standard box. Would recommend and buy again, as I have no complaints.",
