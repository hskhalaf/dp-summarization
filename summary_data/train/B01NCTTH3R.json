The \"blaster\" attachment is just not enough for stubborn concrete stains. But for washing a car, motorcycle, etc. the power is more than sufficient. Also, there is only one detergent bin so you have to rinse it out to use any other type of detergent or cleaner. What I like: the electrical cord wraps nicely around the back. I wish the washer hose could do the same. You have to wrap the washer hose tightly to get it into the plastic tub down below.",

      "text": "I watched the obsessed garage reviews of a bunch of pressure washers and decided to try this one based on his reviews. I must say I haven't been disappointed with this yet. During the reviews he complained about air in the lines. I found that any air in the lines was easy to remove. Simple run the pressure washer in the off mode. Remove the tip from the gun and allow the system to bleed itself. On average it takes only a couple of seconds. Kinds in the hose affect the washer from maintaining pressure so make sure you remove any prior to operation.",

I bought this for my Summer home in Michigan which in early April often means snow, slush, salt and assorted contaminates. My Karcher offers enough power to quickly spray away the dirt, salt and muck while not harming the paint or plastic surfaces. Also, I love the thoughtful design; the foot controlled switch is great and I love the side mounted faux recepticle that safeguards the electrical plug. I have a similar Subaru electric pressure washer that I picked up at Costco but, design-wise, the Karcher is the hands-down winner.",

Both units are rated for 1900psi, however the AR was 1.5 GPM, where\u2019s this Karcher is 1.2 GPM. I had hoped the AR was actually over rated or both machines would be comparable. Sadly they are not! The AR outperforms this unit by a wide margin. That said, this Karcher model does come with substantially nicer wand and nozzle tips.",

The unit works as expected. I like the storage and the compactness of it for storage.",
