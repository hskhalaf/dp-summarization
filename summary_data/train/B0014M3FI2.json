They worked! I haven't clenched since I started taking them. I don't even take them every day. I'm very inconsistent. The rasberry flavor isn't bad! I mix it with water. After I cracked through my 2nd tooth and had to have it pulled, I knew there had to be an answer. I'm so grateful a medical professional shared this with me. Not sure it will help you, but for $12, they can't hurt!",

I'm still feeling some aches & pain but I think the longer I'm on it and probably increase my dosage (since i'm obese), then the better my health will get.

    "description": "NOW Raspberry Flavored Colloidal Minerals is a pleasant-tasting blend comprised of highly absorbable, water-soluble minerals derived from prehistoric plant deposits in Utah. Each 1 ounce serving has naturally occurring trace amounts of many major and trace minerals. These colloidal minerals were created ages ago when they became incorporated into the living plants, fruits and vegetables of that era. These trace elements helped to form the luscious vegetation which contributed to the vibrant life which flourished on this planet. The following minerals occur naturally in fulvic acid: Boron, Calcium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Phosphorus, Potassium, Selenium, Silver, Sodium, Sulfur, and Zinc.
