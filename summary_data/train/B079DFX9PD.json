They shouldn\u2019t be charging this much for something made in China that is just going to fail after a couple of months! I\u2019m sure Solar-Breeze is making a huge profit off of people like us!!!",

However, due to a poor design of the tray about 50% of the collected leaves are dumped in another spot because the device bumps to the wall! Then these leaves go to the botten of the pool. So instead of less work I have more work because I have to to clean the bottom of the pool almost daily instead of 1-2x/week with the old cleaner that had a better leave collecting system. One of the options (I do now) is to clean the tray every day, but this hels only a little bit. The tray should be designed differently.",

The only thing it picked up was beetles, but for $600+ I can pick out the one beetle per week that finds its way into my pool. It never failed to go, unlike many reviews I read.

      "text": "I first bought an earlier model of this solar-powered pool skimming robot in 2016. After 4 years of hard use, it gave out and I bought this year's model to replace it. The new model is a modest improvement over the original. It moves faster and does a better job freeing itself when it gets stuck, as in a corner of my rectangular pool. An added feature is a sliding tray for chlorine pills--especially useful since my salt system has never been able to produce enough chlorine to keep my pool clean. I haven't given five stars only because I hope that further improvements will come in the future. In the meantime, this model is very much worth the price.",

It's simple to use, easy to clean and wipes my pool surface of debris quickly and efficiently. The most exciting time to use the NX2 I've found is after the pool is first opened. Though the surface may be chock full of leaves and other nasty residue from the previous Fall and Winter seasons, the NX2 has no problem collecting the debris, again, in a quick and complete fashion. This summer has been the second season I've used the skimmer. I'm sure I will get many more seasons' use from the NX2. A great purchase indeed!",

The product does an absolute phenomenal job keeping the pool surface clean and requires very little maintenance on my end. Not only that I am now able to decrease the pool pump cleaning time and run the pump at a lower speed. I am hoping to see my electric bill drop too! So all I can say is I love the Solar Breeze and we have named it Poomba!",
