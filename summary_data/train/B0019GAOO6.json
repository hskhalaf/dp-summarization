I've flown with it; I've driven with it (including the the luggage of my wife and 3 daughters). It's taken a lickin'- keeps on tickin'. It's even been washed. Lots of room- the two side compartments and the one on time are SO handy for toiletries, phone, etc. The highlight for me was taking it out of my truck up at my cabin when some random dude walking on the street says \"Nice backpack.\" Yes...it is indeed a nice backpack. I expect it to last my lifetime. Peace.",

      "text": "I purchased this for a 3 day backpacking trip. From day 1, the straps on this thing were killing me. I had to wrap a towel around my shoulders (under the straps) to make it bearable. Also, the strap that goes around the waist is enormous so if you have a normal sized waist (32-35 inches) it will never be tight enough unless you make a knot or something in one of the straps. Finally, one of the plastic pieces on the top snapped before we even left for the trip. Bottom line, if you're doing some casual hiking this may be okay but I would strongly recommend against using it for anything else!",

The only thing that's wrong with it now is the top holders have started ripping, but that's cause I have a tendancy to pull it up by those straps.",

We've taken them hiking and not had any problems, and they've proven to be somewhat water resistant as well. I replaced a big military style backpack with lots of molle attachment points with one of these because the design and internal room just proved better and will stand out less in an emergency situation. I can't attest to how well this would work in a months-long excursion, but for casual or emergency use, well worth the money.",

Not a problem, though, since it doesn't influence the zipper or anything.

It would make a good bug out bag which I have also thought of using it for. It has two large side pockets. This bag will hold a lot of easy to get to gear.",

I can easily say that this backpack is of better quality and far cheaper than the packs I have looked at in several \"Outdoor\" stores. It would be a great deal at even twice the price.",

I ended up using my shoulders to carry the weight, making the waist strap essentially useless and making my hikes/trips much less enjoyable.",

The waist strap is strong, and the shoulder straps are really easy to adjust (even while wearing it!). I think if I had to find a flaw in it, it would be that there is no easily accessible \"pocket\" for things you may need without taking the pack off (i.e. water bottle, phone, keys, etc.).

For the price, it's a reasonable deal, but I recommend spending $100 and getting something really nice.",

I pulled on the drawstring top to close it right after I took it out of the box, and the tab pulled off and unraveled the crappy nylon rope. The shoulder straps are also poorly designed, with straps that are about 4 inches wide and have no room for your neck to fit between them, so it gives you a headache pretty much immediately. I got this for a backpacking trip, I'm really sad that I can't take it.",
