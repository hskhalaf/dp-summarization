      "text": "I've taken a zillion exposure-bracketed pictures (for subsequent HDR merging) and videos with this little guy and it's been great. It's certainly not perfect, but given the price, I have no regrets. The zoom is outrageously noisy when recording video and the autofocus during zooming is terrible, but I still consider this a great deal and keep it with me at all times. It's my first Fuji product and I've gained enough trust in their technology to start investigating their higher-end cameras.",

Other than the occasional macro photo of a flower where there is virtually no movement, this camera isn't worthy of having the Fuji name on it.

    "title": "Fujifilm FinePix F750EXR Digital Camera (Red)",
    "description": "Color:RedFujifilm FinePix F750EXR Red\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The FinePix F750EXR redefines what's possible with a small camera thanks to it's high-performance specification and 20x optical zoom lens. In addition to the wide-reaching zoom range, the FinePix F750EXR also boasts an improved 16-megapixel EXR-CMOS sensor, and stylish design touches, yet the dimensions of the body have remained small. With such a powerful performance in a pocket-sized package, the F750EXR will give both families and regular travelers the perfect camera to capture a diverse range of photographs. \n\nFujifilm FinePix F750EXR Highlights \n\nNEW FUJINON 20x Optical Zoom Lens Plus 40x Intelligent Digital Zoom\nConventional digital zoom basically only resizes the optical image data, often resulting in lack of definition, but the new Intelligent Digital Zoom uses the speed and power of the EXR Processor to instantly sharpen image edges and reduce noise for images with natural clarity and crispness of detail across the digital zoom range. \n\nFujifilm's proprietary super resolution technology offers an overwhelming 30x Intelligent Digital Zoom in a compact body. With more clearly defined outlines and reduced noise, you can take pictures of high quality. As the zoom can be used in the EXR AUTO mode, you can just leave optimal settings up to the camera, resulting in any photo you like. \n\nImage Stabilization (CMOS Shift + High ISO)\nLong telephoto shots usually suffer from camera shake and subject movement which can ruin photos by producing blurred results. The FinePix F660EXR's highly effective CMOS-shift and high ISO image stabilization ensures that your shots stay extra-crisp and clear, even at the full 15x zoom. \n\nNEW Fast Startup\nTurn the power ON from a cold start and FinePix F750EXR is ready to shoot in only 1.3 sec. \n\nNEW Improved Response\nFrom the quicker startup to a shorter shot-to-shot delay of only 0.8 sec, the speedy sensor and processor deliver faster response. \n\nHigh-speed AF\nIn as little as 0.16 seconds, High Speed Contrast Detection AF ensures even a spur-of-the-moment shot at maximum 15x zoom is captured in sharp clarity. \n\nHigh Speed Shooting Functions\nNever misses the decisive moment capturing 8fps at full 16-megapixels resolution. \n\nHigh Speed Continuous Shooting\nCapture action at almost 8 fps at full 16-megapixel resolution or shoot at 11 fps at 8-megapixel resolution. \n\nHigh Speed Movie\nSometimes things happen too fast for you to see them properly with your own eyes. The FinePix F750EXR can freeze the action at up to an amazing 320fps! So you can see every single minute detail and watch things happening step by step in slow motion. \n\nHigh Speed Movie can be recorded at the following speeds and sizes: 320fps (320 x 112 pixels), 160fps (320 x 240 pixels), 80fps (VGA 640 x 480 pixels). \n\nBest Frame Capture Mode\nTiming your shot is ever so easy with Best Frame Capture. Half-press the shutter and the FinePix F750EXR starts recording photos at 11fps at 8 megapixels resolution. When the moment happens, fully press the shutter button and the camera captures up to 16 frames including pre-recorded frames, giving you the opportunity to select the best shot. \n\nIntuitive Control Palette\nThe FinePix F750EXR delivers a powerful array of functions and features in a slim dynamic design. The sleek form molds to your hand with all buttons and controls just where your fingers expect them to be. \n\n * Mode Dial - Tilted and perfectly positioned for fingertip control. \n * Command Dial - Quick command selection using simple rotary dial. \n * Non-slip Grip - Ensures the camera is steady for long zoom shots. \n * Pop-up Flash - With Super Intelligent Flash for perfect flash-assisted shooting. \n * EXR CMOS - Powered by the FinePix extreme imaging technology. \n\n3.0-inch LCD with NEW \"Monitor Sunlight Mode\"\nWhen bright sunlight makes composing or viewing the monitor difficult, you can use the Fn button to easily switch to the new \"Monitor Sunlight Mode\" and enjoy comfortable framing and review of shots on the large 3-inch high-contrast 460,000-dot LCD. \n\nNEW EXR AUTO with Motion Detection\nThe new EXR Auto with new Motion Detection instantly recognizes 58 scene types, automatically optimizes every setting from exposure to white balance, and even switches to the ideal sensor mode: HR High Resolution for well-lit conditions, SN High Sensitivity/Low Noise mode for low light, and DR Dynamic Range mode for high-contrast scenes. \n\nStunning Stills in Low Light\n30% less noise at ISO3200. The enhanced performance of the EXR CMOS sensor lets you shoot dark scenes at high ISO sensitivity and capture them brighter, clearer and with less noise than ever before. \n\nBest Photo Shooting Anytime with Premium EXR AUTO\nJust as your eye strives to make dark scenes as bright and detailed as possible, High Sensitivity & Low Noise Priority takes advantage of high sensitivity and FinePix's original pixel binning technology to capture the subject with exceptional brightness and minimal noise. \n\nAdvanced Anti Blur\nWhen shooting dark scenes, Advanced Anti Blur adds the power of EXR CMOS and Multi Frame technology to combine 4 frames into a single, sharp blur-free image with remarkably low noise. \n\nPortrait and Motion x Greenery x HR\nDetecting and focusing on a subject in motion while optimizing brightness at the same time, the EXR sensor with 16 megapixel High Resolution mode depicts every finest detail of the scene from texture of hair to the vivid green grass in the background. \n\nBack Lighting x Sunset x DR\nDelivers the best results of the sunset as it intelligently recognizes the scene emphasizing the vividness of the colors and the depth of the scene with the EXR sensor mode automatically switched to Dynamic Range to capture the high contrast involved in the scene. \n\nAdvanced Scene Recognition\nThe pioneering new EXR AUTO with Night (tripod) capability to virtually reduce subject blur in lighting conditions. Thanks to new Motion Detection, available shooting types, come from recognized scenes and automatically optimized EXR modes, have expanded into 103 patterns in EXR AUTO mode. \n\nNew Face Tracking AF\nCombining Face Detection with Tracking auto focus, the new Face Tracking AF uses the accelerated auto focus of FinePix F750EXR to find and lock onto the face of your subject without any manual setting. All you have to do is keep the subject in frame and later amaze friends and family with the crisply focused results. By enabling \"Face Detection\" Mode, F750EXR will automatically detects and tracks them human face continuously. \n\nPhotos with Face Tracking AF\nFace Tracking AF keeps the subject in sharp focus, leaving you to free to concentrate on composition and finding the perfect shutter opportunity. \n\nFull HD Movie with Face Tracking AF\nIdeal for shooting movies of sports or capturing children at play, Face Tracking AF continues to track moving subjects even if the face temporarily turns away from the camera. \n\nSuper High Quality Full HD Movies\nThe FinePix F750EXR maximizes high sensitivity to capture exceptionally crisp and colorful full HD video (1080p; 30fps) with impressive stereo sound, even in low-light conditions. AF will instantly capture the object, even allow 15x zoom ups during your recordings. \n\nOne Touch Movie Recording Button\nA one-touch Movie Recording Button enables you to capture all the action in full HD. \n\nEXR Pixel Array & Color Array - Only Fujifilm\nThe unique EXR pixel and color arrays are key to image quality. Rotated by 45 degrees, the EXR pixel array increases both horizontal and vertical resolution. By using the diagonally-aligned twin pixels of the same color, the sensor can switch between HR (High Resolution), DR (Wide Dynamic Range) and SN (High Sensitivity and Low Noise) modes depending on the scene, ensuring that every moment is captured with the highest image quality. \n\nHigh Resolution (16 Megapixels)\nJust as your eyes see even the tiniest of details when looking at something in good light, HR (High Resolution) mode maximizes the full 16 megapixel resolution of the FinePix F750EXR to reproduce even the smallest details in bright, beautiful color. \n\nWide Dynamic Range 1600%\nJust as your eyes see the full range of shadows to highlights in high-contrast scenes, DR mode simultaneously captures two images to produce a single image with significantly enhanced dynamic range, revealing subtle details in shadow and eliminating washout of bright areas. \n\nHigh Sensitivity & Low Noise\nJust as your eyes strive to make dark scenes as bright and detailed as possible, SN mode takes advantage of high-sensitivity to capture smooth texture and natural brightness with minimal noise. \n\nThe CMOS Edge\nAdoption of a high-speed transfer circuit architecture enables fast data signal readout, which in turn makes the new high speed movie possible along with the high speed continuous shooting functions. \n\nBSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS\nThe BSI (Back Side Illuminated) sensor structure moves the wiring to the back side of the sensor, vastly improving sensitivity and reducing noise. \n\nEXR Processor\nHarnessing the high-speed performance of the BSI EXR CMOS sensor, the Dual CPU, EXR Core and Reconfigurable Processor power a host of functions including high-sensitivity HD movies and continuous shooting as well as expanded scene recognition and Pro Modes while the new Vector Graphics Accelerator drives the enhanced image quality of the rich GUI. \n\nNEW 3D Shooting with \"Individual Shutter 3D\"\nFUJIFILM brings high-quality 3D photography to compact cameras with an innovative 2-shot system. Just shoot the subject from one position, and then use the display overlay as a guide for taking the second shot from a different angle. FinePix F750EXR does the rest all in camera. You can view MPO format image data on a compatible PC, share your results as a 3D-Print, or display it on the 3D Digital Viewer FUJIFILM REAL 3D V3. \n\nMultiple Exposures\nMultiple exposure function lets you superimpose two different exposures in a single frame to create artful, one-of-a-kind photos. \n\nMotion Panorama 360\nJust sweep the camera right-left or up-down to shoot giant panoramas up to 360\u00b0. When you view the panorama playing back on your camera or personal computer, you can enjoy a seamless panorama image with both ends stitched together to create a \"cylinder\" view. \n\nSuper Intelligent Flash\nTake flash-assisted shots without flash washout. This new generation Super Intelligent Flash system ensures that all subjects are captured in bright clear detail over the full flash range (even in macro shots). \n\nPro Focus Mode with Face Detection\nThis focus-bracketing mode emulates the gentle, out-of-focus background look of a DSLR when shooting portraits or macro subjects. A single press of the shutter first takes an exposure focused on the main subject, then additional exposures at different focus points*1. This produces a final image emphasizing the sharply focused subject against a soft, out-of-focus background*2. \n*1 There must be sufficient distance between the subject and the background for this function to work properly. *2 Except for subjects where focus bracketing is unable to produce sufficient defocus. \n\nAdvanced Pro Low-light Mode\nIdeal for shooting non-moving subjects in low light, this mode automatically takes a series of four high-sensitivity & low-noise exposures and then combines them into an image with less noise than the single exposures. \n\nFilm Simulation Mode\nSimulate the distinctive look of 5 different types with just a touch of a button. Modeled on Fujifilm brands loved by professional photographers, each breathes life into your image with a quality that previously only film could capture. \n\nFace Recognition\nThe FinePix F750EXR not only detects faces in a frame but it can also recognize who is who!
