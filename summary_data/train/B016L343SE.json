They are still clunky but surprisingly comfortable. They help get the job done, Apple needs to equip their repair techs with these things. If you are contemplating changing your iPhone battery, you need these. My wife is going to use them for her sewing adventures.",

It comes with 5 different magnification lenses and they are crystal clear and the focal length is such that it will work great for the inlay tasks I have planned. The light is aimable so you can point it exactly where you need it too. It may be a bit of a challenge for me to wear this over my regular glasses, but luckily my eyesight is not too bad so I can get by without them.",
