It took very few messages to get the item returned and the seller was very easy to communicate with and unfortunately they didn't have a replacement so I had to go with a refund. I would definitely purchase another one of the robots from the same company, ecovacs, and wouldn't hesitate to purchase from the same seller. These robotic vacuums and mops are a God send for me being a disabled vet, it saves me time and effort.",

Cleaning wise, when paired with floor cleaning solution - don't do it. If you're looking for deep cleaning solution stick to manual labor or get a steam mop. Device will not connect to 5 GHz network.

I contacted the manufacturer 5x to fix and following all their troubleshooting instructions and NOTHING changed. The manufacturer is not taking responsibility because the warranty expired 2 months ago. I would advise you to pay a little bit more for a more trustful brand!",

    "description": "Tired of the mundane task of floor-cleaning? Now there's a solution: DM80: an advanced floor-cleaning robot from ECOVACS. Equipped with a large capacity dustbin and intensive cleaning functions, this product can clean more thoroughly and for longer time between having to empty the dustbin so you can keep your feet up for longer. The two in one mopping and drying stages are optional - the mopping attachment can be added and removed as required for complete customization over how your DM80 cleans. 1. 5-stage cleaning system DEEBOT M80 sweeps, lifts, vacuums, mops and dries in one pass with the effective 5-stage cleaning process. Of course, the mopping and drying stages are optional - the mopping attachment can be added and removed as required for complete customization over how your DM80 cleans. While mopping, the DEEBOT controls the amount of water used, which is minimal, keeping the wet mop damp, with the dry mop wiping it away after; protecting your hard floor from being drenched. 2. Multiple cleaning modes DEEBOT M80 has 4 cleaning modes to choose from to effectively clean up almost any mess. Intensive cleaning mode \u2013 increases the rotating speed and suction power for a deeper clean Edge cleaning mode - for cleaning edges and corners Spot cleaning mode - for a small area of highly concentrated dirt or dust Auto cleaning mode - for everyday cleaning 3. Can clean carpets for added versatility 4. Stair Safety Technology & Obstacle Detection Technology 5. Remote Control & Auto Daily Cleaning",
