I know it\u2019s rather costly, but I researched & given the weight of the dogs, I wanted them to feel comfortable. Unfortunately the snap that keeps the ramp closed was damaged during shipping. But I contacted the company & they were amazing & immediately shipped a replacement- their support & fast response alone would have me give 5 stars. But the product is well built to deserve it also.",

I weigh 200 lbs and walked down it and felt like it bows way too much. Overall the quality is acceptable. One minor nit is that the anti-skid covering is easily penetrated and scraped off by claws. I have two labrador retrievers that use this ramp for climbing into and out of our travel trailer. The very first use caused some of the anti-skid to scrape off. I will likely have to replace the anti-skid surface with some thicker skateboard tape or something.",
