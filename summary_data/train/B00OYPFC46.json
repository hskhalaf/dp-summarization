They are extremely fresh. You get to taste each of the 12 flavors. There is no way to reseal this package so have a gallon ziplock on hand or a box of snack size ziplocks to portion into. These are my new addiction. While definitely a gummy the are soft not hard and extremely chewy like most other gummy brands.",

They don't have that hard/tough texture that a lot of gummy candies get - they're soft and juicy. Each flavor is bold and comes through nicely - even flavors like grapefruit that I normally don't care for taste great here. I can also highly recommend the \"Ultimate\" flavors which have some unique ones like Blackcurrant. I haven't tried the Sour flavor set, but I would assume them to be of similar quality.",

Distraught, I turned to the internet to heal the gaping, gummy bear-shaped wound in my soul. And sure enough, Amazon delivered. Specifically, two days later (thank you prime!) they delivered five glorious pounds of the best gummy bears in existence. These gummy bears brought me joy at a time when no other food could.
