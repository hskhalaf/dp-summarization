Alexa works pretty well. Certainly not 100% but better than any conversational interface/voice recognition I've ever used. The speakers don't sound bad either. Unfortunately even though I love blasting music on a good system, I don't have one, and the Echo is a pretty good substitute. I'm thinking about getting another (or one of its smaller cousins) to put in the kitchen for listening to podcasts while cooking (and telling Alexa to set a timer instead of having to use messy hands).",

Usually Amazon has impeccable customer service but they didn't seem to care about this problem. Might be worth looking at the Google home option, perhaps their quality and customer commitment is better.",
