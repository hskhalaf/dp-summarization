Esp had problems with my elbows and knees. However, during my last contest prep and I added 500 mg nutricost Tumeric AM and another 500 mg in the PM and join pain is now a thing of the past. This is truly allowing me to push harder in the gym now that I am in the offseason adding size. Thanks again, nutricost. Highly recommend.",

I have no side effects in my stomach at all and I like that. Some can give you heartburn. They are very easy to swallow and I don't burp them either. Over all, I recommend this product for pain and inflammation.",
