I have used it to carry my projects around the house as I work, and occasionally out of the house. Maybe my 4th or 5th time carrying this out of the house, one side of the strap came off. No rips in the plastic or fabric - the loop connecting the strap to the bag just popped off. Today, maybe a week later, the second one popped off. I had skeins and a small section of what I was working on in the bag. If the handles would have stayed attached it would be perfect.",

The middle compartment isn't sewing to the bottom so little things can go under from one compartment to the next one.

If I don't stuff it full of stuff, it collapses in on itself which makes it a little difficult to work with as well, so I just put a lot of yarn in it.

They're the kind of zippers that go up or down with no end pieces like pants but this also allows them to pop open all the time.

The bag itself is very spacious, and the compartments and holes for the different yarns is a great idea. I love it, but again, it needs to be sewn more securely. The seller did an excellent job, I received it almost right after I ordered it.",

That why I gave it 4 stars.",
