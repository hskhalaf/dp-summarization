I had 10 devices streaming and gaming during evening hour, and it was really a pain, not even mentioning playing a game with lags. the bandwidth function controls download and upload speed for every device, but I found out the max speed limit is 12694kbs.",

I like the touch button that lets you share WiFi temporarily without having to reveal any keys to others. One feature I would like, but the AC1200 does not have, is the ability to assign a specific DHCP IP address to a specific device MAC. This is useful, for example, for backing up Android phones with ssh. My older Linksys DR-615 router has this feature. If you don't need that feature this product is perfect. Very powerful and fast.",

You can position the antennas to improve the signal to needed areas. I found the included printed instructions very simple to follow and had it up and running in just a few minutes. I really like the guest feature where you can just tap it to get a connection rather than having to repeatedly tell people at a party what the wifi password is. Definitely a good value that gives me wifi everywhere.",

      "text": "Purchased this to replace our internet providers router. I have to say I\u2019m very impressed, my bedroom TV used to get kicked off the WIFI with our old one and with this one I have been able to watch TV with no issues. Another plus, the parental control is AWESOME! With my netgear through our provider they advised we could use the app for parental controls and that was a LIE, with this router you put in the site on your search bar on your phone and POOF, better than an app. I also like that I can kick people off my WIFI (my kids lol) so it\u2019s definitely brought more motivation to my kids\ud83d\ude02",
