Now they don't mind at all, treats aren't necessary, and I save a LOT of money by not having to take them to a groomer every time they needs their nails trimmed. One of my dogs has long cuticles and his nails grow right before my eyes. This also leaves a nice smooth edge to the nails, so if you have hardwood floors, so scratching. No replacement heads needed...just clean with a wet washcloth. I would recommend this to anyone that needs to deal with pet nail trimming!",

First we tried to trim her nails with a clipper, which only hurt her when we clipped too close to the quick. So, we ordered the URPOWER grinder, followed the directions to get her accustomed to the sound (which is very quite!) and then at play time we filed those little nails easily. It's best to have two people: one to hold the dog's paw and one to hold the grinder, but it isn't necessary, just easier. Charging the grinder worked perfectly as the instructions indicated.",

And you have to keep switching nails so that they don't get too hot. But for the price, its doing the job ok. Not useful if you want to grind a lot off fast. We will likely move on to a more powerful one once my dog is used to it.",

I slowly got them use the the very quiet sound, turning it on (with the cap on) and letting them smell it and feel it on their back tummy, feet, etc, over the period of a week. Slowly I tried to grind 1 nail... then the next day 2... then a whole paw. EASY! They don't mind it at all, and they have become very comfortable with the grinder. It is VERY QUIET!, and well made.",

My dog did fine the very first time I used it on her. I would pet her and just touch the grinder to her nail for a second or two. Then I would stop and restart making the grinding time a few seconds longer. I would say this product would be great for small dogs with very small nails. Its OK for my size dog and I do not intended on buying anything different until this one stops working.",

But not even all the way through grinding ONE nail, the battery indicator light went from green to flashing red. I could feel it slowing down and losing power and effectiveness.
