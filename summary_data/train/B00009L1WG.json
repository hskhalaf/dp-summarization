After a day of punching papers, \"heavy\" duty equipment broke. Specifically, the handle broke in half. After I inspected the handle, its seems that the main reason why this happened is the very cheap material that was put in the handle. I am thinking to install a homemade handle but after going to the poor reviews of this product, I think I'll just buy another brand. Overall, I am very disappointed by this product.",

It took a lot of configuring to get it just right, which means I had to sit there and toy with it in addition to wasting paper. The heavy duty screws will ensure you get consistency once you settle on a paper dimension, but I still feel like common dimensions should be labeled for convenience when you purchase any hole puncher beyond the standard size.",

The paint is some kind of heavy glob stuff which pretty well covers all of the alignment scales. But, the worst is the material used on the bottom - it appears to be a hard rubber/plastic thing. It has to be totally removed to empty the waste paper and attaches by cheap molded prongs that are supposed to go into holes in the housing. This bottom will scratch a nice desk - had to put felt furniture pads on mine. Overall, not recommended.",
