I got the x2 because the controller is smaller than the x3, but I noticed the ear pieces are larger to accommodate charging. The x3 doesn't have a USB charger however, it uses a charging port instead. I'm not sure if it is worth the upgrade. My ears are very small so it is challenging to find ear buds that are comfortable. If get tired of adjusting these I may have to look into other brands.",

The only thing that I'm still getting used to is the fit with the wingy things that are supposed help with a snug, secure fit & guarantee the buds won't fall out of your ears while you are on the move. I was used to the over-ear memory wire fit on my wireless Jlab Epics. Other than that, these are a must have!",

I use the comfort foam buds, and one ear fits like a dream. My other ear however I still don't have perfect. I probably would not notice if the other ear did not fit so well. All that said, the buds sound great, connect right away and last as advertised. I have so many devices that I need to keep charge, it is refreshing that these easily last for several work outs/listening sessions. The carrying box is nice as well, closing securely and opening easily.",

Those headphones, like these, claim to make it to the 8 hour mark. The big answer to the question of if these do? No. At a full charge they didn't even make it to the 6 hour mark before dying. My belief is after I use them for a while they probably will only last to that 2 hour mark like my last pair. The charging cord for the last pair of headphones was also ridiculously small. I hoped they corrected that but it's just as small again. I'd recommend finding a different pair of Bluetooth headphones.",

Sound is good, build is good- but they need to accurately market the device. Direct emails to the manufacturer went unanswered. Avoid. Update 1/2017. Headset now disconnects randomly. Contacting Manufacturer for a return authorization. Cannot stress enough- AVOID- buy something cheaper- as this is not worth any sort of premium.",

These earbuds are much too large for my ears, even with the smallest silicone tips. The smallest size of sport clips also do not fit, and therefore the earbuds IMMEDIATELY start sliding out of my ears. They're extremely uncomfortable, and even more annoying. Trying to run with them was next to impossible. Compared to other earbuds I've owned in the past, these are much larger and awkwardly stick out of your ear. Will be returning soon.",

They either hurt while they were in or the fit would only last until you started sweating. 2. Once in use they would stay on. Something was triggering them to stop my music. I couldn't figure out what. Once I switch to another pair of Bluetooth headphone, no issues. So it has to be them.",

      "text": "Great headphones. Sound quality is awesome for listening to music. They work great in the gym too. Battery life is way better than expected. I use them on average two hours a day and I get almost a full week on a single charge. Cons: - To turn them off, you have to hold the button way too long - Sound quality for phone calls is quite average - Ear tips start sliding off easily after a while. They sometimes stay in my ear or just slip off until I lost one today.",

      "text": "an excellent bluetooth earbuds espcially at the discounted price. it sounds better than my son's powerbeats2. It takes a bit of time to find the right fit but it is quite comfortable while working out. Some reviewers compared the sound quality of the X2 to wired hearphones, but these people should have an understanding of the bluetooth technology before making useless comments. You get a X2 or anyother bluetooth headphone for the convenience - when I need an audiophile heaphone, I grap my Hifiman set. As a bluetooth headphone, X2 is one of the best without any question!",
