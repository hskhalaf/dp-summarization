I'm not sure why the earlier version is even still on the market, but these do fix the problem.",

By flicker, it literally turns on and sporadically turns on and off. Figured it couldn't be the lightbulbs this soon so had an electrician out to confirm it wasn't the light fixtures. Lo and behold, the fixtures are fine and the lightbulbs are failing. Hard to justify spending ~$20 per lightbulb especially with lifespan far less than as advertised. Can't return them at this point either. Buyer beware.",
