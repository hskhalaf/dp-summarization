I purchased this for her to use as a small carry-on for travel, but I'm finding that we use it much more frequently. It replaces a diaper bag or tote. I can use a small purse again for me and then we carry the things she needs in this. Large, easy pull zipper makes it easy for her to open and close on her own. Great size for a small tot to carry as long as you don't overpack toys, etc. (watch the weight). Keeps her busy when we're out. She loves packing and unpacking it.",

The straps don\u2019t fall off her shoulders and the zipper is perfect for her little hands. Much better than her Pottery Barn Kids backpack. Recommended!",

Type of backpack that if your young one comes across a puddle of water filled with tadpoles and uses their backpack as a mobile aquarium to take their new pets home and then forgets about it, you can easily hose it out. The violet/princess one is too cute",

Its a great size for her and handles artwork, drinks and her changes of clothes for preschool! She LOVES her bag so much and we expect it will last for a couple years at least! I will be ordering her lunch pack that snaps on to it which not only is awesome but I am glad that i can build on feature of the backpack without taking additional inside space! Love this product and will order again for my youngest.",
