Not only is it super easy to use, the curls stay even with very little product in your hair. The first time I used it, the curls stayed all day, I slept on them and they still were in the next morning. I'm in love with how easy it is and how great the curls look. I also tried this on my daughter's super stringy, fine hair....it works and stays all day\ud83d\ude0d We have never found anything that keeps her hair curled the entire school day. Buy this wand now, you won't be sorry!!!",

I have tried EVERY brand, and most wanda are more tapered than this one, which I hate-cus the tapered ones weren\u2019t making full curls. The size of this one is perfect. I do not suggest getting any wand over an inch (The 1 and 1/2 inch ones don\u2019t hold curls as well. This thing is great! my only complaint is that the heat isn\u2019t adjustable. But this made curling hair easy, and I normally suck at it! This one is the best. Don\u2019t waste your money on L\u2019ANGE, Conair or Hot tools! The search is over!",

Sometimes I leave the hairspray out so my curls are less crunchy. Even when they loosen up, they still look effortless and beautiful. This wand is great and for such a great price too.

    "description": "NO KINKS ALLOWED, JUST CURLS AND WAVES. This curling wand is all you need to create bouncy curls that last all day, even if your day keeps going all night long. The tapered barrel can be used to create volume up top and tight curls on bottom. High Heat up to 400\u00b0 F quickly locks in the curl with a clamp-free wrap-and-go design that leaves no creases behind and a natural-looking finish. Tourmaline Ceramic helps to reduce frizz and lock in shine for amazing body. The Bed Head 1\" Tapered Tourmaline Ceramic Styling Iron also comes with a Bonus Heat-protective Glove and a Tangle-Free Swivel Cord that make it easy to style with. HOW TO GET THE LOOK: Take a 1\" section of hair and wrap it around the barrel, with the iron facing downward. Alternate curling each section left then right for a tousled, natural look.",
