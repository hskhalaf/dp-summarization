I can hardly wait to see the look on my niece's face when she sees these decorations! I definitely recommend these!",

It brings a festive atmosphere to your house. The good thing is that the decorations can be reused because of the neutral colors (yellow, golden, white). These colors are applicable to boys and girls, what is very convenient. Balloons are easy to inflate; pom pom flowers are GORGEOUS! No damages or marks. I definitely RECOMMEND.",

I was slightly intimidated by the paper flower but was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out and glad I got to practice on one. So so excited to use these at the shower!",
