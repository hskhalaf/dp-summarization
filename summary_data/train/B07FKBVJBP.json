Those who like a spacious forefoot and flexible footgear will surely enjoy its confines too. However, it seems that its default laces were a cause of disappointment. To summarize, getting the Merrell Alverstone may require replacing its laces to optimize and perfect its trail performance.",

The heel felt really high and pushed my feet forward and flexibility was lacking. After trying Merrills twice with no luck I won\u2019t try again. Went out and bought a pair of Asics instead with no regrets. They might last half as long but they were also half the price.",
