I can fold it and wear it short, or leave it as is and it flows down to my ankles. The material is very nice, and I like the tassels along the two edges. I am 5'4\" and 175lbs and it fits perfectly with room to spare, I definitely will be ordering more colors in the future.",

However, because I'm 5' 3 (3/4)\" inches tall and 163 lbs., my sarong did not fit like how the model's did-it was tighter because of my hips, thighs, and back side. I will still give it a 5 star, but advise that if you are voluptuous and on the thick side, be prepared to not have the excess coverage like the models displayed. I also wore it tied like a dress so that it knotted at the back of my neck. It looked it I was being choked, but I still got compliments on it anyway. It does best being tied around my waist until perhaps I lose some weight.",

It folds up small and is easy to carry, and the thin material is perfect for covering a bathing suit without being hot in the sun or heavy when wet. If it does get wet, it drys quickly. It is just large enough to tie a variety of ways. I think that it is a little too small and thin to be used as regular clothing, but the black-and-red wasn't really see-through and the pattern was verry pretty. Overall, this sarong perfectly fit what I needed it for!",

A tad see through and I had to soak and rinse it 20 times in two days to get the water to be free from dye and to be comfortable washing it in the machine with other items. It is a beautiful print. Much more beautiful than the sarong I am replacing which was thicker material but which cost 35 dollars 20 years ago.",

My favorite part was all the things we used it for: coverup, towel to dry off, and beach blanket to sit on. It dries lighting fast because it is so thin, no sand sticked to it, and folds up to fit anywhere in your suitcase or beach bag. This is my number one beach item hands down.",

The material (thickness, etc) is perfect, something you'd be able to purchase in a department store.",

The only con is that it's a little faded along the edge (see the pic) but I'm okay with that since it's so soft. I highly recommend it and I plan to buy more from this same company.",

It was great to wear as a skirt on our way to the beach and when we wanted to eat in one of the restaurants with a no swim suit policy I just tied it up like a dress and voila no issues! I searched pinterest for different ways to tie it. I ended up only using it two ways but that was just my preference.",

If you're short, you'll need to bunch up or fold over the waist to keep it from being too long (tripping length). It has a fussy care label, but I just ignored it and tossed it in a regular load. The fringed edges looked a little tangled when it came out of the dryer, but they smoothed out when I ran my fingers through them. I would happily have paid more. :)",

Check the measurements before you purchase, that's what I did. Will buy more!",

She loves trying the different ways to wear it and I love that she has something to keep her modestly covered going to and from the beach or pool. She is a size 8, but I am an 18 and I can wear it as well. Highly recommend the coconut sarong ties, since tying it by hand can be bulky, doesn't stay tied, or if you knot it and it gets wet, it's really hard to untie. We now have 3 sarongs because we love them so much!",
