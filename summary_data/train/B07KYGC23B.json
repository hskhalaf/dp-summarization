Exams from my regular vet and three times from a specialist provided no answers for his bouts of vomiting and excessive diarrhea. Since he had been on ProPlan food for a while, I thought I would try their Grain Free foods. He's been on the wet and dry food for more than a month now and has had no issues and he loves the food. I gave a 4 star rating for the food but if this one proves to be the answer to his life long problem I'll will definitely add that 5th star.",
