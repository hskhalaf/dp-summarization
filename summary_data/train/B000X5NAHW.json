They are all made of sturdy plastic and can go right in the dishwasher. My only very small, infinitesimal complaint is that the little nub on the little ring that is meant to hold the cups together is a little shallow so the ring doesn't snap together securely and it's cups everywhere. This is a small thing, the cups and the spoons work perfectly well.",

When the sharpie wears off, we can rewrite it because the measurements have raised lettering instead of being printed. If you have difficulty reading raised lettering (same color as cup) and don't want to write on them, then these may not be for you. The hoops that hold these attached are easy to remove; I have attached measuring spoons up to 1 teaspoon on one loop and the larger ones on another loop.",
