      "text": "We typically love KitchenAid products so this toaster comes as an exception. Beyond being absolutely huge, the toasting quality is average at best. Only two of the toast duration settings are useful for bread, with the three highest settings burning the bread. Also, even though it is large, it still can't toast a large waffle evenly. Finally, the left most and right most toast slots are underpowered compared to the inner sections. Considering the price, I would absolutely not buy this again. This is no better than a $15 toaster.",

The lift higher function did not lift a piece of rye toast high enough out of the slot not to burn your fingers! Even on the # 2 shade, it took much to long to toast. The # 2 came out much too well done and the # 3 actually reduced burned toast. Don't know if I was unlucky enough to have received a \"dud\" or they are all like this. Returning it for a different brand and hope it will better. This was replacing a Breville, which after 10 years stopped working.",

The toaster we got cooks very hot and we found that even on setting 1.5 to 2 would cause our toast to blacken. We have it set on one and it makes pretty good toast. So if you want to lightly toast something, you may have to watch it and manually cancel the toasting process. Overall we made it work, but its not ideal.",

Toasts everything we throw in there like a champ, and the 5 timer settings are pretty evenly, well, timed... 1 is a very very very light toasting from frozen, 5 is pure carbon charcoal...

The bigger problem is that the settings go from 1-5 on dial for toasting preference but ALWAYS BURNS ON THE 1 SETTING. So only half the toaster works and the other side has to be monitored so the toast doesn\u2019t burn. Number 5 setting sets of the smoke detectors.
