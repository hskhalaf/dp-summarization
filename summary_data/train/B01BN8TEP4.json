It takes two to hold the 8lbs of kibble so I ordered the second one from Amazon after I found that it fit the bill perfectly.

Perhaps not all are as loose as the one I had, but even so, I can only see others becoming worn with use or cleaning and causing the same issue. Maybe if there was some other way of attachment, this would be a perfect product.",
