I bought it in August of 2016 and now, less than a year later, it's stopped working. I take very good care of it. It's never gotten wet or dropped. I don't overcharge it. For $7.50 a month it's a good deal given I've easily underspent my normal food buying because I use the fitbit, BUT I would have expected it to last more than 10 months. Will I buy another? Yes because it helps me keep track of what I do each day. But I think they should last longer than 10 months.",

Also I developed a little rash from use when exercising due to the lack of breath ability of the band. I resolved this by wearing the band a bit looser.",

The only negative I have and the reason for only 4 stars is that it also counts steps if you are moving your hand too much. I know you can expect that with wrist trackers, but I wish they could make it a little less sensitive.",

The first time it broke, I wrote into the manufacture who sent me a new one right away. Then, about 6 months later, it stopped working all together. The saddest part is, I bought three all together. None of the three work anymore. $300 down the drain. I should have listened to the reviews I read about it's quality. Overall, it is great if it decides to work, but most likely it won't last you long.",

I can be rushing around and lose track of time but then the alarm goes off and I know exactly what time it is and I get back on track. Lots of options to go along with the free app. The most helpful is the water tracker. You record it and it keeps track for you. A good reminder to make sure you're getting enough water.

Second, it does not register steps while used on a treadmill. For example, today I walked three miles on my Nordic Track and only had 1400 steps.

    "description": "Color:Black| Size:Small/LargeNever stop moving with Fitbit Flex. Wear this slim, stylish device all the time and get the motivation you need to get out and be more active. It tracks steps, distance, and calories burned and shows you how you\u2019re stacking up against your daily goals. At night, it tracks your sleep cycle, helps you learn how to sleep better, and wakes you silently in the morning. Access your stats anytime on your computer, tablet or from leading smartphones \u2013 both iPhone and Android. Flex is your perfect companion, it\u2019s with you everywhere even in the shower. Plus, it looks good no matter what you\u2019re wearing.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\u2022 Certain features like Auto Sleep Tracking and SmartTrack may be disabled when using this accessory. Classic accessory bands are the recommended accessory for high intensity workouts and sleep tracking. \u2022 Do not wear the Flex 2 Pendant accessory while sleeping or during high intensity activity, as doing so could create a choking hazard. \u2022 Flex 2 Pendant accessories contain magnets. Magnets may interfere with pacemakers, defibrillators, or other medical devices. Consult your physician and the manufacturer of your medical device before using to determine if these accessories are safe for you. If the accessories may be interfering with your pacemaker, defibrillator, or other medical device, do not wear the accessories.\n\nBUYING GUIDE\nMove it up: Since blood increases further up your arm, wear your tracker higher on your wrist to improve the heart rate signal during workouts. Start by moving the device up to three finger widths above your wrist bone, then experiment with slightly lower placement. Keep it secure: The less your tracker moves during exercise, the more chance you have of maintaining a heart rate signal throughout the activity. Do not wear the band too tightly, as this can restrict blood flow and goes against our wear and care guidelines. Hold steady for ten seconds: High intensity exercises or activities that cause you to keep your wrist bent (like push-ups) or move your arms vigorously (like dance) may interfere with heart rate signals. If you stop seeing a signal during these types of activities, hold your wrist steady for ten seconds during breaks to get your reading.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\nCustomers contact: support@fitbit.com\n\nSee more",
