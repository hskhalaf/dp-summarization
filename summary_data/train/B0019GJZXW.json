The stick can be banged around. It came with three plastic golf sized balls that I will not be using.",

The wiffle balls that come with the bat are a little brittle and don't resist wear as well as the impact balls.

Think about it.. the pipe is much thinner than a bat, it weighes more than 11oz more than his bat and he has to hit golf ball sized wiffle balls that are 1/4th the size of a baseball moving oddly through the air.
