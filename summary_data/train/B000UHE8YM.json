This is just going to slow you down. My first grievance was the keyboard tilt swing legs to give you a 33 degree tilt they broke off near as soon as I got it. Customer service said I would have to buy another keyboard that they would not sell those snap in plastic pieces individually. poor support... and so on. USB ports on rear of display are 2.0. clearly a legacy board. buy something newer.",

I can't recommend this keyboard enough. Great for gamers or just the average internet surfer. A++",

My only negative comment: occasionally, I hit the wrong key as it's layout seems a little cramped on the left side. I think I'll adjust to it with long term use though. I don't know that this is a problem, per se. It's just different the the Dell keyboard I use at work.",

I prefer a blue backlight with greater intensity. However, the USB 1.1 ports are a con, but then again most people have tons of USB 2.0 ports and HUBS nowadays.

      "text": "Since owning the older G15 gaming keyboard (version 1) for quite some time now, I would rate this newer G15 lower, as it has much less programmable macro keys and the color scheme is not as appealing as the older v.1. All the functions are the same, but much less of them. If you can get a hold of the version 1, the G15 with blue backlight keys, then consider yourself in luck as logitech as long discontinued them.",

(In particular, the Miranda IM client's G15 plugin is excellent and very useful for when you're playing a game or fullscreen movie.)",

Although I havent explored making macros yet, i would have hoped it had as many macro buttons as the old and well liked G15. Oh well...still a decent keyboard.",
