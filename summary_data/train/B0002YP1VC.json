I cannot stress this enough. Last night we awoke to an intruder in our home who had cut this off our main gate and opened it (likely following the easily googled how-to videos), using the keys inside to enter our home. Luckily no one was hurt, but trust me that you never want to experience that situation yourself. Find another solution if you're looking to store your house keys for use by others, preferably one that the entire Internet doesn't know how to open!",

That worked great. After opening the box 3 times the code no longer works and the box is locked to the plumbing. If I had time I would follow a simple video for breaking into it. Not worth your time or money. MasterCrap should be the name.",

They work great and are one of the few models I've found that have a sufficiently large internal compartment to hold a modern car key fob and comfortably fit some other larger car keys. I live in Colorado and have not had any issues with snow/ice/rain whereas I had another model freeze. The only drawback is having the dial system because numerous people don't spin the dials when they take or return keys. Anyone could walk up and steal the keys and/or lockbox. Obviously this applies to any lockbox with this design, but the button push models take up more space and have a relatively smaller internal compartment.",

This simple gadget gets it done without hassling me. It\u2019s easy to lock, weatherproof, fast installation and you wouldn\u2019t miss it. I guess what can beat this would be those Wi-Fi operated locks. With an affordable price and ease of use, this is a great buy!",

Setting a new combo was very easy and this holds probably 50-6 keys without a problem, which was perfect for my needs. I should add that the keys had a small label with them so it does hold enough for what I would imagine is a typical need. Overall: This is very nice and worshippers well.",
