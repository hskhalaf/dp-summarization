With 24.2 MP and a 300mm lens I can enlarge the image to a size in excess of a 1500mm lens and still have a reasonably crisp on-screen image. This model also has GPS. I have not tried it yet so can't testify to its functionality. Each one of these cameras has brought improvements over the the previous models and especially this '5300. My focus is on wildlife photography and it's as demanding of perfection as any other field of photography. I do confess that my camera exceeds my own skills - happily );-).",

Great for someone teaching themselves photography, because it gives you the option to adjust all the individual settings like a pro, but also has fantastic quality pictures on the automatically selectable settings based on what kind of picture you're taking (portrait, outdoors, etc). We've been thrilled with the quality of both the pictures of family, as well as some nature photography. If all you want to do is point and shoot, the entry level SLRs are probably a smarter choice, but if you want to learn some more complex photography and have more setting options, this is an excellent choice.",

If you're buying a camera for video capability, it isn't a Nikon anyway. This is a great still camera.

Maybe Nikon will provide a firmware update that fixes this issue. Wirelessly sending pictures to PCs and smart phones is not as good as it sounds. Read the advert/spec carefully. It would be nice if the camera had an automatic power off (if it does, I have not found it as yet).",

      "text": "Such a major upgrade from my superzoom. The quality of the photos are amazing. I would consider my self to be somewhat of an advanced photographer, and I bought this camera for many reasons. One of which was to capture photos my old camera could not. So needless to say right out of the box I went for advanced features that are taking some time to learn. But buy the third day i could find buttons and take the shot I wanted.(with great results) The HI ISO shots look great! I would recomend a book on this camera to go with it as the manual is sparse. All in all I love this camera!",
