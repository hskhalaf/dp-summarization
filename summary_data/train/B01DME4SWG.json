      "text": "Lifespan of Epson printers in my household is about 6-9 months before it decides it no longer wants to print. I am done buying Epson. I have three junk printers all with clogged printheads, even after using only Epson ink and the printhead cleaning kit. I use the printer at least weekly to make sure the ink pigments do not settle, so...thanks Epson for the poor quality of printers you are putting out there nowadays. Anyone looking to Frankenstein a printer together with these spare parts?",
