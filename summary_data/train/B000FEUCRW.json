Suunto has the best (and universally good) reputation of all but a few very expensive boutique compasses. It would be hard to beat this combination of accuracy and durability.",

Don't cheap out and waste money on sub par equipment. If only one thing needs to be flawless on your next hike it is your compass. Great compass.",

The Suunto MC-2 Global proved to be at a much higher fit and finish than the other models I tested at a lower price and it shows. Attention to detail is obvious on this model just by watching its needle in action. Would a $20 dollar Asian import due the trick? Probally, but I don't see it lasting up to a few years in the field. You get what you pay for I suppose. Hope for many years of use from this Finnish made compass.",

It should have been designed so the lanyard could be wrapped around it for storage, and it wouldn't walk-off' an end, or unravel when you set it down. I wanted to like this, but I don't.",

    "description": "The sighting Compass for global mountaineers. The advanced navigation Compass. When venturing out into unknown territory, these sighting compasses offer precision navigation with a variety of carefully engineered and dependable features for challenging conditions. Fast, globally balanced needle with jewel bearing. Sighting tools for accurate Direction taking. Adjustable declination correction.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nHailing from Suunto's MC series, the top-of-the-line MC-2G global compass is an invaluable tool for people who require highly accurate and reliable directional measurements, such as surveyors, miners, architects, rescue patrols, hikers, boaters, and the military. The MC-2G boasts a fixed declination adjustment system--standard throughout the range--that's especially useful when working in areas with large magnetic variation. The tool's additional sighting hole, meanwhile, ensures superior accuracy, as does the jewel bearing. Add in a mirrored lid, a baseplate with a round magnifying lens, a clinometer that measures the ground slope, and a luminous bezel and markings and you have a versatile, practical compass for a variety of applications. \n\n The real star of the MC-2G, however, is its global needle, which works anywhere on the planet. Previously, most compasses functioned well in only one of five geographic zones. That's because the compasses were balanced differently based on the zone's inclination, i.e., the vertical intensity and direction of the Earth's magnetic field. However, as people began to travel more, it became clear that globe-hoppers needed compasses with a greater geographical range. Suunto responded by developing two-zone systems--which work in either the northern or southern hemisphere--and one-zone systems such as the global MC-2G. Now there's no need to purchase several compasses before embarking on your around-the-world eco adventure. \n\n The MC-2G, which also sports a red nylon lanyard for around-the-neck use, measures 2.5 by 0.6 by 3.9 inches (W x H x D) with the lid closed and weighs a mere 2.65 ounces. It's also backed by a lifetime warranty.",
