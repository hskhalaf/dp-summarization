Update: return accepted but cost of return is mine until refund!!! This item will be expensive to return and I've just got to hope that the refund includes postage. Really bad purchase.

Easy to use no timer etc but for \u00a324.99 I can't complain also it comes with a year's warranty that you have to register so that's useful to have.",
