After buying the much smaller D-Link DOCSIS modem I took both modems to an Xfinity store, where they registered my new modem and deregistered the rental one. When I returned home I connected the cable and power cord and hit the power button. That's it! After about a half hour of various flashing lights, I was connected to the internet.

Though it took me some time to find the coaxial outlet that had internet connectivity in my apartment (only one of three outlets did, and the one that did was somewhat hidden), once I found the proper outlet simply screwing the coaxial cable into the modem and plugging in the power cable got everything working great. This is a much better alternative to renting a modem from your cable company and this modem will work with all the major providers so it will ultimately save you money. No complaints thus far!",
