The first year, we used it 2-3 times only so it's not been heavily used. Also the low wattage made it hard to follow recipes from air fryer groups where the norm seems to be 1700-1800 watts.",

Food comes out perfect almost every time, some of the cooking guide timing kind of too long or not long enough, so, I learn to cook shorter time and check in between. I am buying another one, so I can cook 2 things at once. Hopefully, I don't need to buy the 3rd one, lol!",
