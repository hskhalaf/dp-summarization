I typically wear a women\u2019s XL, or 2XL if it is a \u201cfitted\u201d item. I ordered a 2XL as the description suggests ordering slightly larger for a more relaxed fit. I like the fit, but I also had a \u201cswim bra\u201d and high-waisted swim bottom on. For ladies worried because they are large-chested, I felt plenty accommodated (38G-40F). If I buy an additional rash guard, I may try an XL and see which I prefer. I will update after I try it in the water.",
