The fact that it's so dark makes the plate/lid look very off and sort of ruins the whole look. That's the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars, because I didn't receive what I expected. Even the box it comes in has the compartments looking lighter than this. It's nice, though - heavy, the pieces stack well with no issues.",

But definitely keep this in mind if you are looking for a smaller jewelry box. I also like the felt on the inside of the box and the color of the lid is super pretty. Other than the size, the item is exactly as pictured. This box is also heavy and sturdy.",

      "text": "I like this product very much. It is convenient to use and I can keep my frequently worn jewelry downstairs in the sitting room. As far as appearance goes the product is much darker than the picture on this website. It looks like wet concrete but surprisingly it works because of the copper toned cover. The cover is heavy so it anchors the whole thing and makes a nice tray to hold pieces of jewelry. So this product is a win. It's unique.",
