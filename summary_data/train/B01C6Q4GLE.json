They have cheaper alternatives that don't have all the extras, so if you don't need it all then opt for one of the cheaper alternatives.",

I do wish, however, that they had included a \"real\" user manual to go with it, outlining some of the possible uses for the items included. The thin booklet that comes with it has minimal information - enough to plug-in and start the machine, but stops short. Although I can't complain about the company, as it delivered the described items and the Pi works, perhaps another supplier would include a little more in the way of helping a new user get started.",

A pre-loaded sd card, power, hdmi, etc. It gets you going right away. If you have seen Ubuntu Linux, you have a feel for what is available on programming side of Raspbian Linux. What the Pi3 adds from say a Laptop running Ubuntu Linux is the GPIO electronic possibilities and that is why you might want this kit. You will want a HDMI TV or monitor; keyboard and mouse; and Internet. I would suggest buying The book Programming the Raspberry Pi Getting Started with Python.",

It's like the OS or the hardware just can't make use of Bluetooth correctly no matter which keyboard we try. Very disappointing experience so far.",

Unfortunately this time the Pi 3 we obtained came with defective software on the card and the supplied card-to-USB adapter mounts in read-only mode making reformatting the card impossible (on Macintosh). We purchased a third-party adapter to fix the bad software rather then go through the hassle of a product exchange. In support forums, we encountered another user with the same issue but unknown if it is CanaKit related or if the OEM sdhc card is sourced through another supplier. Overall, we think this purchase is \"okay\" given the useless USB adapter.",
