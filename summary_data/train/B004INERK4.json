The parts all feel solid with no leaks or any issues of any kind, really. I only wish the smaller canister had a lid as well. I honestly don't know why it doesn't, but the large canister satisfies all of my needs, anyways. Would absolutely buy another if anything happens to mine.",

It sprays as good as any 4-500 dollar airbrush I have bought in the past. You can't really go wrong with Iawata anyway. I love the gravity feed cup myself. A little more work to clean between colors, but worth it in my opinion. I can't believe this brush sells at the price it does.",

I also found that this brush felt sloppier and less controlled than my badger 150, so would have returned it anyway.

And for the better result blow it with an airbrush cleaner or all-purpose cleaner from Lysol with needle removed to clean up nozzle from the paint residue.
