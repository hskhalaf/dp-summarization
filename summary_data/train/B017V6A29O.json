      "text": "Great quality! I own a small gym so my top priority is to have the proper equipment my clients need but finding those space saving, multi-functional, safe, sturdy and quality pieces. This fits all of those requirements! I love that we can use this one piece of equipment for three different jumping heights, and that it is lightweight and can be quickly & easily changed between the three heights for our fast paced group classes and personal training sessions. We were so impressed with the first one we bought, that we purchased another one right away a day later! Highly recommended for both personal and professional use!!",
