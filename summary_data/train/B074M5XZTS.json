I didn\u2019t necessarily want to spend $70, but I thought \u201cmaybe the convenience is worth it\u201d. I am so glad I gave it a chance. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this sterilizer. The drying feature works INCREDIBLY WELL and even gets all of the nipples completely dry. Much bigger than I was expecting (that was a good thing) and fits absolutely everything I need to steam for the day in one go around. Extremely happy with this product!",

Not a single drop of water on my baby's stuff (unless you don't know how to follow directions and place the items in the wrong direction). Worth every dime! I feel bad for parents who don't have a dryer in their sterilizer.",

The drying part is pretty loud, but only because a fan is involved. Everything is dried with the \u201cextra dry\u201d setting. I previously had another model which only sterilizes, and it was a pain to wait for the bottles to hang dry over several hours, which leaves water marks if the water droplets are not first washed away with warm water. This sterilizer and drier is only slightly more expensive than the one without the drier. I highly recommend this one!",

Also, for the bottles to come out clean with no residue at all you basically have to completely scrub and hand wash them so at that point you might as well just hand wash them and not even bother with this. Bottles do not always come out totally dry, they are either still wet or have water spots. Not happy.",

I assumed all sterilizers would disinfect and then dry the bottles. I was wrong! It is a pain to run them through the sterilizer only to have to hand dry the pieces! I love that this sterilizes AND dries all the pump parts and pieces. I can easily fit three sets of 8oz Medela bottles and pump pieces in the sterilizer, and they all come out perfectly dry. It saves so much time compared to having to hand dry every piece before pumping!",

I upgraded to this for #3 With my old microwave steriliser bottles/pump parts were always in a system of waiting to go in it or sitting on a drying rack having come out of it and been wet had to air dry. And I used to burn myself at least once a week being impatient to empty the stuff out when too hot to get another load in. I love this one I upgraded to for baby #3 - takes decent size load and stuff comes out dry ready to go away. Kitchen is less cluttered.. saves time and space.",

The fact that it can dry it as well is huge! It was ao annoying that other sterilizers leave bottles still wet and you have to dry them which is an extra step. The only comment i have is that when you sterilize tall dr. Brown bottles you wont be able to close it if you put it on the installed racks. However you can still put the bottles and run them fine but not on the racks. Overall, this is worth the money! Love it!",

We\u2019ve had it for about 6 months now. It can\u2019t fit about 10-12 bottles, we use 9 oz Avent bottles and 8oz Medela bottles. We just take off the little position markers and you can fit it all there. Cleaning of the heating pad is easy with a vinegar/distilled water mix. I recommend to all my new mom friends and family. Has a great design that\u2019s simple and clean as well.",
