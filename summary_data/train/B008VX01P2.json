I asked the company to honor the warranty and replace the defective unit and they have gone silent. Terrible customer service and failure to honor their warranty.",

Check the voltage at your battery, and check it at the cigarette lighter socket (with your cooler pulling a load.)

The handles broke so I replaced them with rope loops. They cannot handle the weight of a loaded fridge getting moved around routinely. Interior light is a nice feature.

Kept ice for drinks and food frozen in the small compartment. Food stayed perfectly chilled in the refrigerator side. Very quiet. I do suggest buying the cover. I had to upgrade the power wiring to the rear of the Jeep and used the ARB wiring kit. I just replaced the ARB socket in the molding with a heavy duty standard socket. Just after buying it our home refrigerator packed up and we used this one in our home for about a week and it worked great.",
