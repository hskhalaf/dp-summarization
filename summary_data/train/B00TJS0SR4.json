The new design is shorter, bulkier, less easy to pick up and move ESPECIALLY if slightly damp from shower mist. It's boxier and more square and does not fit the hand well at all. The biggest complaint is the sound quality, REALLY TINNY speaker. We played both models side by side to check, and the difference is VERY noticeable. All-in-all...this is a redesign gone bad, and a redesign for no apparent reason. And for $80, I'm sure we can do better somewhere else next time.",
