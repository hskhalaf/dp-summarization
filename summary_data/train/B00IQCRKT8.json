The bad: The Batmobile Tank Battles are overused and that has broken up the great pacing of the first two games.

But it is so predictable and I am getting way to good at taking down whole screens full of bad guys because the combat system is so predictable. Maybe I should just play less Batman games....",

It is near impossible to do a mission without somehow having to use the Batmobile in this game. On the plus side, the story is wonderful, and it may have caused me to shed a tear or two.

Most of the game is fairly repetitive, go find a Riddler trophy, search for kidnapped fire men, but i had a blast just flying around Gotham as Bat Man, launching off buildings and gliding. Its fun for what it is, a decently open world with the Batmobile thrown in for kicks. The rain effects are sweet. I got it for $30.00 and its well worth the price.",
