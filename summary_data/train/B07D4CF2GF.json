What a potential buyer must be aware of is that the center of the blinds is totally black but as you get closer to the ends, some light from the outside is visible.",

They were easy to install, probably took all of 15 minutes, and they're easy to use as well. I bought the white ones as we have light gray curtains and they do a great job of blocking light. We've been using them for several months and I don't plan on replacing them until they break because I'm lazy.",

We have air vents on the floor though which may be why were having issues with it.",

I returned asking for replacement and they sent me black this time but STILL CORDLESS! only good thing I can say is I got a full refund",

I installed snaps at the top, bottom and center of the leading edge, mounted the shades on a very thin piece of wood (painted white) and used velcro to attach it to the window jamb. I also installed snaps on straps attached to the wood support to hold the shades in place when not in use. I think the project came out quite well, and the quality of the product help me succeed.",
