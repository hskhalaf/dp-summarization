Tasted it myself. Okay but on a serious note, this is a good value. My birds haven't tried it yet, I'd never eat a bird treat myself, and what even IS the thickness of this thing? What does it want to know? Whatever, it's fruit covered in something sugary, my birds will lose their minds over it I'm sure. 5 stars.",
