      "text": "I bought this to replace an older induction cooker with way fewer features that was beginning to show its age. I had no idea how big of an upgrade this would be and am very impressed. In particular, temperature controls are very steady and accurate. It will be a while before I get around to learning and using all the other stuff. One thing I didn't realize when I bought this is how HUGE it is. I should have gotten a smaller size because I don't need one this big and it takes up a lot of space. Not a negative, just something to keep in mind.",

      "text": "I love this! We rent our home and the gas stove is not very good. In addition it heats up the kitchen awfully. I recieved one of these for Christmas and have never turned on my stovetop since!!!! It cooks very evenly. It heats up quickly and precisely. The cooktop really does stay cool where the pans aren't touching and it cools down very quickly once they are removed. I have small children and like the safety feature of auto pause (to shutoff) when a pan is lifted off or removed. The timing function is very helpful as well. I liked this product so much that two weeks after Christmas I purchased another.",

With a minimum setting of 100\u00b0F and an upper limit of 575\u00b0 (Sear), the PIC offers a wider temperature range than competitor models.

It offers state-of-the art programming technology with 100 hours of memory that allows you to save and recall favorite cooking procedures. Different functions or stages, including varying cooking times and temperatures, can be recorded and repeated at a later date, no matter how complex. A Delay function allows you to initiate cooking when its most convenient for you. The NuWave PIC was engineered with a circular design scheme, doing away with excess space that serves no cooking function. also offers top-of-the-line safety features that promote safe and healthy cooking for individuals and families, including automatic shut off when cooking time is completed. Despite its portability and compact size, the NuWave PIC offers a large cooking area, measuring 9 inches in diameter.
