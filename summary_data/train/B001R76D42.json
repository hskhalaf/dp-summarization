      "text": "Using this in addition to an Audiotechnica ATH-M50X as a gaming headset. It works very well and has a 3.5mm jack to plug your headphones in where you can hear yourself talk over the mic which is nice. It can also be used without headphones, people understand me fine in directional mode even when using loud PC speakers. There's a bit of feedback when a cell phone is near. Not sure if this is an issue with all mics, or just this one. Maybe since it's so small it isn't shielded as well as it could be if it were larger. Overall this thing as been great. Would buy again and would recommend.",

It's compact, convenient, and is a giant step up in audio quality from a $15 desktop microphone. Would definitely recommend for any teacher looking to post video/audio instructions or examples.",

This means that all output will be sent to the Go mic.. In order to hear anything you have two choices: 1) you need to plug a speaker or headphones into the 3.5mm plug that is on the mic body. 2) use a separate bluetooth speaker/headphone and then in Settings on iOS 13.3.1 change Accessibility-Touch-Call Audio Routing to Bluetooth. For video conference purposes I just wanted a better microphone and get output from the ipad speaker so this is not the product for that.",

Once you add gain you will hear a whine at 1kHz, 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, etc in the recording. It's really obvious in a quiet room. This is not standard white noise but digital noise most likely due to poor isolation of the ADC from the USB bus. It can be removed with a notch filter in Audacity but not without affecting the recording quality. Sadly, the Samson Meteor has the exact same issue.",

The only thing missing is a more soundproof room in my house!",

I am definitely impressed with the rich sound quality. It fits so nicely on my crowded desk. I love how it is portable - folds up and fits nicely in the black semi- hard zip up case that is included. In my opinion this mic is an excellent value.",

For everyone else, this microphone is by far the best bang for your buck. But as with anyone looking to buy a microphone: Don't just take my word for it.

      "text": "I wanted a small, usb mic that I could use for video conferencing with clients and for recording a/v tutorials. This one has good pick-up, worked right out of the box, and (as long as I set it to uni-directional recording) is about as free of background noise as you get get without an actual sound booth. The base is nice and versatile for setting either on the desk in front of me or clipping to my laptop if I'm on the go, and it folds up compactly enough to fit into my (admittedly rather long) desk-caddy when not in use. I'm quite satisfied with the price I paid and the quality I got.",

Also, comparing to other mics (like my Razer Blade built-in mic) works great not having background noise signal (natural background and silent) and capturing the sound of your voice and surroundings. You will definitely hear the difference on your recording with this simple upgrade.",

What I like about it: 1) It attaches to any thing you want it to attach to using a clip. 2) It frees you from having to use a headset all day long. 3) Dragon performs as flawlessly as you could possibly imagine and when there are mistakes, it's just a function of the fact that no voice recognition software is completely accurate. In fact, I'm dictating this entire review using Dragon.",
