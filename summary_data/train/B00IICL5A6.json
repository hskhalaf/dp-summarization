It fits better than the factory battery with no wiggle room. I've got a battery maintainer (for the winter time) hooked up to it so hopefully it lasts much longer than the factory one did (< 3 years). If this battery exceeds 3 years - I'll be very happy and will order again. # Pros - Price is right. - Bigger capacity compared to the factory (15Ah). - Fits better than factory battery. - Handle makes it easier to move around. # Cons - None",

Mower had been sitting with the dead battery quite a few months, so it took a while to get happy enough to start, but once it had cleaned itself out, no problems after that. I put the trickle charger on it to keep it happy and I also am quite happy with this battery. We will see how long it lasts.",
