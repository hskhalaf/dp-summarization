It is indeed a comfy gear, but one with a kind of waterproofing that works surprisingly well, and enough stiffness that inspires confidence. What people might find a little worrying about the boot, however, is its weightiness. All in all, the Meindl Bhutan MFS may not be the lightest boot there is, but with its towering reputation, it simply is something that should not be missed by any means.",

They're strong, sturdy & I get the immediate impression that they'll go to extremes. Sadly too narrow for me although unable to return them. So I'll be selling these on. Seriously, try before you buy rather than risk purchasing & testing them - I fell foul of that & ended up with a \u00a3180 pair of boots I can't use.",

Found them to be very comfortable straight out the box offering excellent ankle support for when you misjudge the edge of a path and your ankle tries to twist. So far waterproofing has been excellent. I bought a half a size up from my normal size and they fit perfectly even with thick walking socks. Can\u2019t review long term durability yet but so far, best boots I have ever owned. Love them!",

The first is that it is difficult to remove the laces to clean the boots,as recommended,especially with cold hands.The second is that that application of the Meindl wax,again as recommended,gives the boots a 'cruddy' appearance,and it is difficult to see how the waterproofing spray would work on this.",
