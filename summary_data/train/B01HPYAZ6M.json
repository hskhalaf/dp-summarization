      "text": "This was ordered as a replacement to the one I bought that came with a reel. That first one broke after I hooked onto what appeared to be a large drum - but the rod broke and while I was dealing with that the fish got away. Thinking that it was perhaps due to the size of fish and perhaps an overly high drag setting I ordered this one. Unfortunately the same thing happened as with the first one, but this time with a smaller fish (~3 lb) which I actually landed despite the rod breaking not far above the reel. I bought this purely because of the portability but do not waste your money on this!",

      "text": "I can see why these rods are getting great reviews. I bought a 7.87' rod and I was so impressed with it, I purchased a 5.91' rod a day later. I was a bit worried about the quality of a telescopic rod, but these are fantastic graphite rods. The sections are loose until you pull them all the way out, so they give you a nice cap to hold the sections down when not in use. I bought both rods for ease of traveling and packing around, but I can see they'll become my go-to rods for most of the time. Comes with a so-so cover that that was unexpected and appreciated. Highly recommend.",

In Europe and Asia the top companies like Daiwa and Shimano offer some pretty amazing, high dollar telescoping rods, but for whatever reason the idea hasn\u2019t really caught on here in the States. Even knowing all the above, I have mostly ignored these rods....until now. I bought the 8.8\u2019 version, and I am sorry I never tried these until now. It is a great rod, with terrific action, and casts perfectly. Plus it shrinks down to less than 2 feet! Perfect for traveling by car or motorcycle, and tops for backpacking. Try one, you will be delighted.",

I flew to California and fished these rods vety hard for a week 9ft and 7ft. They work well for non finesse fishing styles. I. E. Throwing bait in the surf or catfishing with a 1 to 3oz. Weight. The rods travel well are made from respectable materials and didn't fail. They are no magic bullet to replace real tacle options. But for an airplane/cross country family visit with alot of fishing mixed in- its just what the Dr. Ordered. Solid rod choice for less than ideal fishing/traveling options.",
