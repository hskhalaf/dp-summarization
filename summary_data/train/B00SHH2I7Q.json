It may be wise to use it more often on tamed trails though.",

Is this a good deal, bearing in mind the cost of these boots? I know other walkers who have had their traditional style walking boots last up to 10 years. Is it that the stuff we buy is just crap? Is it that the manufacturers can't afford to make stuff last a long time? Whatever, I won't be buying Berghaus again.",

      "text": "Nice looking pair of cross-country walking shoes with a high front to cope with puddles and wet plants. However, unlike my last pair of size 9 UK / 43 EUR from Braisher / Berghaus, these are too narrow for my wider than average feet. So it seems that Berghaus have taken on the Braisher brand but made the shoes narrower. Will have to return them. I also see that the collar padding is less substantial than on the Berghaus / Braisher Hillwalker II GTX shoes, which are in fact a touch lighter and the pair of those which I have just bought, which look rather scuffed like old stock, are in fact wide enough for me.",
