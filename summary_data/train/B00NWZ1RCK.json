That brings me a little more comfort considering you are using this for drinking water. I also purchased this Apec faucet to compliment my stainless steel faucet: Water tastes great. With the minerals added back I am at 20 PPM. Regular tap water is reading 190 to 200 PPM.",

I feel this is a fairly significant design flaw by omission and should be corrected. Finishing touches for me were a slide-out mechanism and mineral 'filter' as a final stage.

Our water is pretty good as is, but when I discovered that both my water service line and the authority's supply line were lead, I knew there was no way to replace them. Problem solved with the APEC system. Easy to install and no more lead worries. I also have a house in the city of Pittsburgh. The water authority there is in terrible shape, with lots of old lead supply lines and intermittent boil water orders. Bought another APEC system and again problem solved. BTW I think the extra $ is worth it for the optional remineralizer. Tastes great!",

The color coding of the tubing is a great idea and is easy to follow. Quick Tip 1: Don't use a standard masonry drill bit. Buy a 1/2\" diamond-tipped hole saw. It'll cut your drill time by a factor of 10. Quick Tip 2: Use Plumber's Putty to build a little well around the drill area to fill with water. This keeps the bit cool while drilling.",

Installation was not as easy as reviews stated, which I anticipated anyway. Very pleased with the unit so far. I saved over $300 over the cost of our water specialist recommended unit. We expect continued savings each year with reduced filter replacement costs. If you're not handy around the house this you may find this difficult to install, don't be shy asking a friend for help.
