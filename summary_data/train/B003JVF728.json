This one can't seem to run for long without crashing. It's frustrating because I'll get to a point in the game, it crashes, then have to start all over. Not sure if I'll be able to make it through the whole campaign since I'll probably just get too frustrated and quit playing it.",

There are not as many servers as there used to be, but you can still get into some consistent TDM servers (and other game modes if you play hardcore/crouch). I found that the stutter that many people complained about in the past to be nonexistent when I play and I would say that the game is pretty decent today. You can still get into a zombie match with only a couple minutes of wait and the campaign is stable.",

It's easy to get right back into the game, but its very annoying. I don't worry about it because Treyarch will probably come out with a patch sometime soon. Good game, crashing needs to be fixed by Treyarch with a patch. Very good otherwise.",

Given other reviews, I was very hesitant but, decided to 'risk' it anyway. As it turns out, couldn't be happier!",

You buy the game, you put it into your PC, it loads stuff.. Then you have to down load the game on STEAM. This game took over 24 hours to download. Granted my internet speed is not all that, but I think there should be a better way to play without STEAM involved.",
