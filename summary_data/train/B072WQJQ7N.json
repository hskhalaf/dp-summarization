She\u2019s not a fan of the fanny pack style that most others wear to carry theirs but she LOVES the lanyard style. We plan on buying more in different colors so she can color coordinate the lanyard with her outfits! Great job!!",

One note of caution, be careful when applying the silver \"button\" to your phone; it is not forgiving. If you put it in the wrong spot, it is not easily moveable. Once it's there, it's there!",

(but this is a good feature ..especially to ease your mind for the potential to lose it due to coming undone) It would be nice if it had the option to shorten the lanyard. I am on the shorter side and it hangs to my belly button. But, overall it seems to be a sturdy product and i do believe i would buy it again.",

There is a small button that you stick on your phone, then the lanyard piece slides over it. I've used it quite often and I find it was a good buy on my part. I would purchase another/again.",
