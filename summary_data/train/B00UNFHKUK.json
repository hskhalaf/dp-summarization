You can buy extra sensors instead of swithching them on your clubs, but switching is easy. I learned from tech support that any Blast sensor works with any other Blast product, like baseball, softball, basketball, performance, and golf. I found basketball cheap ($30 complete) and used the sensor (and extra charger) as an extra for Blast Golf. A very good product. Not perfect, but worth it. Easy to switch clubs with it.",

Also the sensor and the rubber fitting doesn't fit my putter or my driver and tends to slip and shift after a few swings.",
