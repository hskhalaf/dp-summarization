Love the different tips that came with it but the case is a bit on the cheap side. Definitely practice a bit with these, like all the locking retaining pliers they take a bit of getting used to and make sure you use the right setting for the internal/external rings!!",

They can do internal and external snap rings. Comes with all necessary tip sizes for each pair of pliers. Case is well made. I figured better warranty and tip replacement if ever necessary by going with the reputable CHANNELLOCK branded set. Yes these are USA made too!",

From kind with replaceable tips like these to the preformed type that you have to have several types of to complete a set. While I've never like replaceable tips in the past, I think it was because of the quality of them. These have been outstanding so far. No issues with the tips slipping out of place or twisting. Having the three different sizes helps as well to keep the most used setup ready to go at all times. Caught them on a good sale and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a set.",
