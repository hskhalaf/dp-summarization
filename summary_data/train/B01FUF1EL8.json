Battery life is excellent even with high drain apps/games. GPS is accurate and doesn't kill the battery too badly like older phones.",

Now, however, the battery life is very poor and the phone randomly shuts off at 30%. If it's slightly cold the battery is drained almost instantly. It's become nearly unusable.

UX is terrible, battery life is meh, the screen's awful touch detection makes simple typing a miserable chore, and it appears to have many issues with multitasking, with background streaming apps shutting down while in use every few minutes. Fingerprint scanner only works about half the time, many settings are hidden, and other settings have been replaced with nonfunctional proprietary solutions. Even for this low price, it is far from worth it. Don't fall for the decent hardware- the software makes this phone unusable.",

Only minor issues are the capacitive button don't always respond to the touch and GPS reception could be better. Sound is outstanding. No problem with phone calls. Very fast. For the money don't know how you can beat it.",

Major issue is with the capacitive buttons - not very responsive and does not illuminate in the dark. There is no on-screen navigation button either, hence switching between applications could be annoying. Hope ZTE seriously considered having the on-screen navigation button on this model, just as they have it on Axon 7 mini.",
