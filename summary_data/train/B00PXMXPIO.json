There is some slight distortion but it's a \"thinning\" distortion just a little bit toward the bottom of mirror so it doesn't bother me (actually a little helpful on a rough morning to look a little thinner!). I'd recommend for typical bathroom/bedroom use but it isn't a \"high end\" mirror so know what you're buying.",

I promise you the hooks to hang the mirror on the door will bend because it's like they are made out of tin foil. The metal they used is that soft. Plus, the mirror will bang the door every time you open or close it. So I suggest that you put it on a door you don't open that often. I'm keeping it b/c it's going in a guest bedroom and hopefully I won't have to hear the rattle against the door....just my guests will :-)",
