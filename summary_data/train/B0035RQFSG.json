But still I don't want to bash these(no pun intended) cause they sound good for the price.",

This, along with a PDP hi-hat stand, is the perfect hi-hat for his mini drum set. This replaces the awful \"child's\" hi-hat that came with his drumset, so this is a HUGE step up. They would probably be too dark for a full size setup, and for someone who plays out in clubs or other live settings, but they're perfect for me and my son.",

They sound better with thick wood sticks, I prefer nylon and this increases that dull resonant sound.",
