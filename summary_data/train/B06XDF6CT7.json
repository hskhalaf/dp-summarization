I have found out from reliable sources that this is synthetic vitamin K, that even in small doses can be very harmful to our pets organs such as their lungs and kidneys. I will not be buying any pet food that contains this ingredient. Most high end pet foods add actual green leafy foods to supply vitamin K, but it is more expensive to do this, so the more inferior brands add the chemical instead.",

It was. Royal Cain is expensive and kitty started having dandruff issues. I tried this food and he is dandruff free AND his ears are still clear.",
