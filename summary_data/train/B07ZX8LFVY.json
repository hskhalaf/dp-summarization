Just keep it and we\u2019ll send you a new one.\u201d The sellers are fantastic to deal with. I got the the new replacement one Saturday, charged it and love it. It\u2019s so heavy which is one of the main features I love, besides all the lights. It\u2019s a super cool lighter. Thank you for being great to deal with. Highly recommend! \ud83d\ude11",

I'd love to tell you what it was like on the 4th charge -- but now it won't even charge! I've tried several different cables, charging bases, charging from a power bank, from my PC's USB port; \"safety switch\" on/off...nothing. Absolutely worthless piece of crap.",
