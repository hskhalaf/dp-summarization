Last night, after 4 months after purchase, I noticed the front of the bag is shredding at the seam.

Use it for so much... bringing in groceries, pick up packages, take heavy stuff from one room to the other. Great product!",

We love it! We will certainly continue to use it when we are going out to do our own shopping.",

However, the handle heights aren't adjustable, and, at 5'6\", I have to walk at an uncomfortable angle to push it. It's also not great if you have a lot of stairs in your life, because you can't lift the inner bag out if it's full - the bulk gets caught on the metal frame. You have to carry the whole cart, or unload in a few trips. After several months, I'm unfortunately regretting the purchase. I'd recommend for shorter folks who don't have staircases, OR who have someone to help.",

      "text": "Nicely built cart that has met our needs to a \"t\"! Holds more than you realize at first. We keep it in the trunk and it's so useful at the flea market or vegetable market or any place. Anywhere you might buy things and don't want to haul bags around in your arms you can have the luxury of rolling this like a stroller. It's not bulky and weighs about 17 pounds. We love using it. It even has a top cover if you need to protect something or you get caught in the rain. It's very helpful from car to kitchen with grocery bags! Very happy with our purchase!",

I even have 3 large steps from my garage into the house and I can maneuver the cart up those steps with very little effort. What used to take me 3-4 trips to carry everything from my trips to the local big box store can now be made in 1-2 trips and it's much easier on my arms and back. I would definitely purchase this item again. I've only had it about a month, but I've transported some really heavy loads (bottled water, soft drinks, etc) and the cart has held up beautifully.",

I can fit a full grocery run for two (and we go big on groceries) every two weeks, and get it up to my upper floor apartment. I pack the main bin of the cart, and then hang bags on the handles. It takes a lot of bags that way. It's also easy to steer. This is the best grocery cart I've bought yet.",
