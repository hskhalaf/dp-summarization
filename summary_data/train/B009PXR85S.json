It hurts more then you think and if you're not careful, you can break or sprain something. Other then that, they do look pretty nice and were a good deal.

My cabinets are old and awful and need to be changed eventually so while I preferred other styles of pulls, I didn't want to spend a lot just to improve what I plan to get rid of. They're a solid, heavy metal and the screws were actually the right length: 1 inch. Vast improvement over the old brass handles I had, and for very little money.",
