      "text": "Took 1 hr to assemble. Side was bent .More like super light duty. Dont get it. I wonder if engineers know that fire happens inside? Material quality is a joke. Flimsy and thin. One of the nuts used to mount the box broke at the twist when tightining. Grates are too far apart and thin. Hot dog will fall thru. The whole box is out of square. Stainless steel was scratched in several places. Charcoal basket is too far apart waisting half of the bricket. I dont see this grill lasting more then 3 seasons of moderate use",

The grill rack is heavy duty and easy to clean. Build quality is really bad tough... Putting it together was a pain as some screw holes didn't match the holes on other pieces. The lip latches are stamped on crooked, so it closes crooked. Lid has bad gaps which let out smoke and heat. Overall do not recommend. At this price point I was expecting much better quality.",

The features make this grill easy to use and adjust to cook your food as you like it. It's also very attractive on our patio. It was not difficult to assemble as long as you have 2 people to hold and turn it as you go. My husband and teen son were able to complete assembly in 1 hour 15 minutes without any trouble. I suggest covering it when not in use as we found some water in the bottom tray after a long rain.",
