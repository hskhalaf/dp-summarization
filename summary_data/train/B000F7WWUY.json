The insulating jacket withstood many drops and falls and I don't believe any condensation developed when I'd stick it in the dishwasher. That's another plus, you can fully disassemble it and stick the whole thing in the dishwasher. The insulation is nice but not infinitely efficient. If you leave cold water in a hot car all day, it'll still get hot. But I really like this bottle most for the durability and ease of use. It's pretty cheap and an excellent value.",

These water bottles (as you can see from all the reviews) are great and keeping water COLD. I normally freeze half the bottle with water and then fill the rest up with refrigerator water and it stays cold during my entire ride in the sun. Sometimes it won't even melt the ice block by the end of the ride so i carry two just in case. These bottles are not the lightest, but they do the best job at keeping water cold which is more important to me!",

I would recommend both of these, but if I had to pick one I would probably go for the Camelback. Bit better quality but you pay a few dollars more. Well worth the extra money. The Polar bottle keeps your drink cool but it makes this crinkling noise when you squeeze it. The Camelback is easier to squeeze and delivers the water in a nice stream. If you want to save a couple of bucks, buy the Polar, you won't be disappointed.",

Pros: - Keeps liquids cold for 2+ hours with it's dual-walled construction. - Lid and spout are easy to open/close yet secure. - Fits most bike bottle water holders. Worked on mine fine. Cons: - The pictures of the Polar water bottles look darker than the actual product. The colors in these water bottles are from vinyl inside the dual-wall. That means the colors are much lighter than in the product pictures.",
