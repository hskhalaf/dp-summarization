This made for an intermittent connection with the battery. The light would flicker or turn off on bumps/bounces. Poor design IMO, maybe this will get fixed in later versions. Illumination was good however when it was working, and the rubber felt like good quality long lasting rubber.",

We had it for a few weeks and it has taken a beating, from hit tree branches to how high can we throw it in the air and it landing on bricks, concrete, and hard dirt. The ball still works great and has no tears or cuts. We are very pleased with the ball. The plug for the light works very well, I rinsed the ball off a few times and the light still works great. Would love if the company would make an official size.",
