Shaw recommended large wheels, adjustable brush heights and adjustable suction power. The Oreck Magnesium fit its' requirements so I purchased it online from Amazon. Since the Oreck was not from a dealership, I also purchased a 2 year warrenty for about $14. The Oreck is very lightweight, with a long cord, and is easily manuevered. The suction is gentle on the carpet but picks up all lint and dirt, The key is to sweep slowly. I am very happy with this Oreck.",

My 13 year old version has the speed adjustment built into the handle for one hand operation. The stupidity of the non friendly design of the Magnesium does not out weigh the fact that it works well. does a superior job and is Oreck quality",

      "text": "Used a lot of different vacuums and this one is the best. When you unbox it you will say WTF, did I just buy a $300 toy? The base is not as wide as other Oreck vacuums, but the machine is very light and has extremely powerful suction.and its smaller size makes it very easy for vacuuming under and around furniture. I have two other uprights, but always grab this one. Drawbacks; cord is too stiff and location of power button is in odd place, but these are small faults compared to machines' performance.",

      "text": "This was my favorite vacuum, but now this is the 2nd Oreck Magnesium I have purchased, and it broke just after the 1 year warranty. Super frustrating. Especially when I paid $400 for it. When it worked, it was the best. Sadly, I cannot endorse this anymore because this is the 2nd time this has happened and they want you to mail it to them at your cost, and then they charge you to fix it, and keep for about 2 weeks. And no local places in Michigan to have it fixed.",

      "text": "Oreck does NOT honor warranty if Vacuum purchased from Amazon. Pros - Wife loves the vacuum, light weight, worked great for 10 months. Cons - Sucked up a sock, got the blinking blue light, circuit board burned out. $50 repair, no warranty since I bought from Amazon. (Oreck at least did not charge me labor, which I would not pay for since I'm handy) Amazon needs to take down the warranty info for this product. Will I buy this again, probably, I'll buy whatever the wife likes. Buyer beware, no warranty if bought on amazon, go to their store and buy it.",

      "text": "I purchased this vacuum for my wife to use in our new home with a heavy thick carpet. It works perfect. The magnesium frame is super light weight eliminating the need for a self propelled, plus carries oreck quality. Two speed suction feature is also a nice addition allowing sweeper to conform well between hard and carpet surfaces. The only downfall of the vacuum would be the top portion of handle just above the bag. This part of the frame could stand to be beefed up more.",

As far as carpet goes, it just does not cut it. I am very disappointed in this new one. I have a bad back so have to have something light or I would have sent it back. I have a different brand heavy vacuum that I use on my carpet.",
