The quality of this model is no where near what my friend's shoes were and considering they cost over $100, I'm returning them. Another small issue I also have this this model is that there is no 'loop' on the tongue for the laces to got thru, which prevents the tongue from sliding down or around... seems like that should be shoe design 101.",

And they are.. The tread is perfect for all the gravel, mud and dirt... The most surprising feature about these shoes is that they are ridiculously light weight.... I'm probably gonna buy a second pair just to have for back up, there worth the price and worth having 2 pairs... So far the best hiking shoes I have worn... Hands down..",
