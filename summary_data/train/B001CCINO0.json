It is very simple and professional looking, and very lightweight! For the most part, the sounds are very clear and distinct. I have only come across one issue, being the end of the tube directly connected to the diaphragm. If twisted (which is very tempting if you are bored), it can partially disconnect from the tube and create a deafened sound. Twisting it again is a quick fix. Overall, quality product!",
