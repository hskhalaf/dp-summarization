The face color could best be described as bright violet/purple rather than the blue you see in the photos online and the bezel is *much* darker than the face. And this thing reflects light like crazy. Shiny everything. In a normal office, it's actually hard to read the face because it seems like everything on the face reflects light.",

That said, the watch looks absolutely fantastic. blue dials looks great and reflects lights very neatly.basically it looks good enough that i didn't bother sending it back for the slight marker misalignment.
