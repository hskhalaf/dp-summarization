Unfortunately, the motor is attached by torx screws and requires a special bit to unscrew the attachments. It is disappointing that the company claims the grinder is 'user repairable' and then uses an attachment which is far from anything most people would have in their tool box. The grinder when it works is terrific. However, I cannot justify spending over $200 for a grinder which breaks in 2 years. Advice to the company: -- Use better parts .. the plastic gears and weak motor are cutting it -- Avoid torx attachments -- Follow through on your commitments to make the grinder repairable.",

We couldn't be more pleased with the Virtuoso (has a faster burr grinder than Encore and adds nice looking brushed stainless trim) and are getting an even, consistent espresso grind on the \"5\" setting. It's also very quiet and looks great.",

The warranty only covers parts so we're contemplating whether or not it's worth fixing but we were really hoping it would last longer. we finally took the time to talk to their service department and they were great to deal with and we were able to fix the problem.",

I find that compared to my cheaper Burr grinder, the Baratza Virtuoso is much quieter, faster and consistent. And I love the drop thru feature where I can catch the grind live in a small container to transfer it to my Aeropress. I used to hand grind for consistency and one Aeropress cup took 2-3 min of hand grinding. Now I can get that in 7 seconds :)",

Why the manufacturer has not either used a smaller bin for beans or at least a suggested \"fill line\" on it is beyond me.
