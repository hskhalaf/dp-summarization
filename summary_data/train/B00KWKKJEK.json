      "title": "Outstanding lightweight multifunctional boot",
      "text": "After putting over 200 Miles on them I feel like I can talk about these boots a little bit. First off they are the most comfortable boot I've owned, glove-like fit. They are super lightweight compared to most hiking/backpacking boots out there, just a bit heavier that a trail running shoe without sacrificing stability. Totally waterproof, the only moist that builds up inside them is because of my profusely sweaty feet. The grip is ok, I prefer Vibram all day long but they get the job done. Breathability is pretty decent, it's getting HOT out here in Texas so we'll see how they behave in temperatures over 100 degrees. Overall you can't go wrong with these, they're just awesome!",

They fit like they were custom made (although that's an assumption as I've never had anything custom made before). I worked at a country club over the summer and had to mow grass at super-dangerous angles where slipping would result in anything from total embarrassment all the way up to serious injury. These things grip like they're for climbing freakin mountains. When you see the traction pattern on the bottom, you'll see why. I had some Salomon snowboard gear when I was a kid and it was good stuff but I forgot how good. Worth the money.",

For the first time, I didn't have any pain or discomfort with our long hikes. These kept my feet warm & dry even though we went through mud, puddles, & creeks. The only time my feet got wet was when water went over my boot through a river. The toe box was big which was great for my wider foot. I highly recommend these.",

      "text": "Hands down the best out of hiking boots I\u2019ve owned. I normally wear a 10, but had heard to get 1/2 size smaller, so I bought 9 1/2. That idea worked fine. I wear Rocky SV2 socks with the boots. Great fit. What I like; - Light Weight - Great fit - Comfortable walking several miles out of the box - No hot spots - Shoe laces stay tied - Great ankle support Cons; - Warm for hot weather but not overly so - The colors to choose from - A little tight on my small toes on both feet, but they are new... they should form to my feet with more use.",

I do use a custom arch support though. I wear them for casual shoes, knock around shoes, and for working at home, when safety toes are not needed. I have three pairs.
