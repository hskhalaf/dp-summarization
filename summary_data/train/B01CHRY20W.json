I let them know that although I loved the apron, I couldn't use it because the ties were too short. Their response, much to my amazement was to send me another apron with longer ties that fit perfectly. I am delighted with this purchase and with their extraordinary customer service. I highly recommend dealing with this company and encouraging others to purchase their quality products.",

They are very attractive and make a nice gift for the cook who already has every gadget, but doesn't buy themselves anything to keep their clothes nice and clean. It's very comfortable to wear. I like the pockets and the adjustable strap around the neck.",

Regarding sizing, it sits about 2 inches above the knee on one who is 5' 5\", and fits well enough on both slender and curvy forms (long back straps and a generous enough amount of cloth make this possible).",

The professionalism and kindness of their Customer Service is beyond reproach, and I look forward to ordering more from this company.",

After I washed and dried it, the fabric wrinkled all over the place to the point where I must iron it to look good again, even the hem curled. So the fabric wasn't well-built it was the amount of starch in the product that gave it the well-built feeling. The fabric is not well-built after washing. It is just a run of the mill apron, but with an exceptional print.",
