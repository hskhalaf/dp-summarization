On reading about how it uses batteries quickly, I also bought some rechargeable ones at the same time but haven\u2019t had a problem. The images are clear and the camera fits my needs although I\u2019m no expert. Surprised at how effective the zoom is although a tripod helps to stabilise the image in lost instances.",

      "text": "Easy enough camera to use, so no problems there. The downfall, It came with no memory card of worth, it stores about six frames and complains memory is then short. It refuses to connect to a laptop, and is therefore more or less useless for downloading images. Presumably it works best with a Kodak printer. Will never purchase another Kodak camera. Give me an Olympus every time, which is slick to use in combo with a laptop.",

      "text": "Got this for my daughter (8) with her birthday and pocket money. First camera for her nature walks. Fine from that point of view. But I would reiterate comments from other reviewers that you will need to purchase a battery recharger and a bag full of rechargeable AA batteries. The camera has had 15-20 minutes of 'on' time on its first couple of uses before dieing. Come on Kodak - you can design a better power system than that. Likewise with the camera's internal storage - half a dozen photos at most. SD card is also mandatory if buying this camera - so factor that into your purchase budget.",

Each round consumes 4 batteries. All in all, it's a good and sad product, because it takes nice photos, but drains batteries extremely fast.",
