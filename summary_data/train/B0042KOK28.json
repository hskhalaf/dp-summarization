Why does it only let me leave feedback instead of giving me the info to contact the seller? I just spent 200.00 and it won't help me without spending more money? What a waist of money. I think I am returning it",

So far we have used it on multiple years and models of Jaguar, Land Rover, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, VW, MINI, Lexus, Acura, Bentley, Volvo, and Porsche. Has worked perfect everytime.
