      "text": "Been using this for 3 weeks now. Coupled it with a Boston Acoustics SoundWare XS 5.1 speaker system. The YPAO sound optimization for automatic speaker setup is easy to do. I had an existing center channel speaker so we're running 6.1 sound and it sounds great in our space. It takes some reading of the manual to make the tweaks, but the answers are there if you look closely. The only problem I had was getting it hooked up to the internet. I had to manually enter our network settings and it has worked great since doing that. Lots of interesting radio options available via its netradio. This is out of production unit so you can enjoy a nice discount.",

My previous post still stands, it was great for the time that it worked, not spending more money to try to get it repaired. This was an awesome deal, one of the specials on Amazon that was really worth it. I have had it for a few months now, still working great, really makes the whole entertainment system sound great.",

Disconnected everything from it and reset the protection circuit. Tried again. tripped again. It's now outside the 30 day warranty period, so can't return it. My subsequent research indicates that \"Warehouse Deals\" is a subsidiary of Amazon that sells open box or refurbished items (apparently without properly testing them). So I'm stuck with a brick.",

INTRODUCING THE RX-V573. ENJOY.\nSeven discrete amplifiers provide versatile speaker options, including 7.1 channel surround, Bi-Amp to double power to main speakers, or Zone B for extended audio coverage. The Yamaha AV Controller App works with Apple and Android devices and provides simple yet powerful network control. Enjoy your new receiver with CINEMA DSP 3D, which offers an enveloping home theater experience. Expand connectivity with Apple AirPlay and versatile USB input for iPad compatibility. With included futuristic technologies like 4k video pass-through and ECO mode, the RX-V573 puts the power in your hands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4K PASS-THROUGH FOR NEXT GENERATION SUPER HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGES\nThis AV receiver provides advanced HDMI features including 4K pass-through. 4K refers to four times the resolution of a 1080p display. While not yet available, 4K displays and sources are sure to become popular in the future. This receiver is capable of passing the 4K data from the source to the display, for image clarity far beyond present standards. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI WITH 3D AND AUDIO RETURN CHANNEL\n3D means the receiver can handle 3D signal data. The Audio Return Channel function enables data to be sent and received via the same HDMI cable, so you can hear the sound from the TV via a single HDMI cable, with no need for an extra optical cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNETWORK FUNCTIONS\nThis AV receiver provides a variety of network functions that enable you to access more sources and also enhance operation. You can connect the receiver to a PC to enjoy Internet Radio. The AV Controller app (from iTunes App Store or Android Market) lets you control various functions from your iPod, iPhone, iPad or Android phones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the Kindle App AV CONTROLLER APP FOR EASY, CONVENIENT OPERATION\nThis AV Receiver lets you use the Yamaha AV Controller app that is downloadable from the Amazon App Store, iTunes App Store or Android Market to control power on/off and volume, select input and DSP modes and operate other functions from your Kindle Fire, iPod, iPhone, iPad or Android device. A tablet version is also available.\n\n\nCONTROL YOUR YAMAHA NETWORK RECEIVER WITH FREE KINDLE FIRE APP\nWith a Yamaha network receiver you can now control your music and media with our new app designed specifically for the #1 product on Amazon, the Kindle Fire. This application is FREE, and available for download on the Amazon App Store for Kindle Fire and other Android devices. Click here to check out the Kindle App for Yamaha Network Receivers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIRPLAY ALLOWS STREAMING MUSIC TO AV RECEIVER\nThis AV receiver supports AirPlay, which means they can accept wireless music streaming from iPod touch, iPhone or iPad, as well as from iTunes on Macs or PCs. This makes it easy to enjoy music from your mobile devices or computer on your home theater system. You can use view metadata such as song title, artist name as well as album art* via AV receiver's on-screen display. *Some models don't support album art display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZONE B OUTPUT PROVIDES 2-CHANNEL SOUND IN A SECOND ROOM\nZone B output capability allows the receiver to send 2-channel sound to a second zone, so the main zone now has 5-channel output. This means that users can enjoy stereo sound in a second room. The same source will play in both zones (cannot use two sources).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI CEC FOR EASY OPERATION\nAnother benefit of HDMI is the availability of CEC functionality. When the unit is connected to a CEC compatible TV, it will turn on and off together with the TV, and you can use the TV remote to control the volume. CEC also provides advanced functionality with other components. For example, you can use the receiver\u2019s remote unit to control player functions like Skip and Stop. \n\n*All connected devices must be HDMI CEC compatible. Some CEC compatible TVs/players may not work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYPAO SOUND OPTIMIZATION FOR AUTOMATIC SPEAKER SETUP\nYPAO analyzes the room acoustics and adjusts various audio parameters for optimum sound in just a few minutes. It\u2019s like having a professional installer calibrate your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB DIGITAL CONNECTION FOR IPOD, IPHONE AND IPAD ON THE FRONT PANEL\nA USB port on the front panel allows convenient connection of an iPod/iPhone/iPad, which also charges when connected. Because the digital signal from the iPod/iPhone/iPad is transmitted directly to the AV receiver, there is no signal loss or interference, so you enjoy the best possible sound quality. In addition, you can use the receiver\u2019s remote control unit to operate the iPod/iPhone/iPad music playback functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE FOR ONE-TOUCH START\nPressing a SCENE button powers on the AV Receiver and selects the input source and DSP mode. You can re-set the buttons for different sources by selecting a source and DSP mode, then pressing a SCENE button for more than three seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHD AUDIO WITH CINEMA DSP 3D AND VIRTUAL PRESENCE SPEAKER\nCINEMA DSP 3D provides a wide, high and dense sound field. HD Audio format decoding lets you enjoy HD Audio sources. Virtual Presence Speaker delivers 3-dimensional sound without actual use of presence speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINPUT SELECTION IN HDMI STANDBY THROUGH MODE\nWhen the AV receiver is in HDMI Standby Through mode, the input source (Blu-ray\u2122 Disc player, game console, etc.) for viewing on the monitor can be changed via the remote control. There\u2019s no need to turn on the AV receiver in order to switch sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBWOOFER TRIM FOR IMPROVED SOUND IMAGING\nThe Subwoofer Trim control enhances the low frequencies by avoiding overlap with the front speaker output. This will result in a cleaner, more focused sound stage while providing a seamless frequency response. When subwoofer frequency overlap occurs in conventional systems, the overall sound is \u201cpushed\u201d toward the subwoofer. Subwoofer Trim takes care of this by separating the low subwoofer frequencies cleanly, thus stabilizing the front stage while providing a well-balanced enhanced bass sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPRESSED MUSIC ENHANCER\nWhen music is encoded into a digitally compressed format like MP3, the frequency response suffers. Yamaha\u2019s Compressed Music Enhancer employs sophisticated digital signal processing using exclusive algorithms to restore what was lost, so the music always sounds the way it should.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADAPTIVE DRC (DYNAMIC RANGE CONTROL)\nAdaptive DRC automatically adjusts the dynamic range of the sound according to the volume level. This ensures that you hear clear dialogue and vocals, and all sound effects at comfortable levels. There is no need to adjust the volume level as you listen; everything from whispers to big explosions will be heard clearly and comfortably at the same volume setting. It also tones down loud TV commercials, and is ideal for low-volume, late-night listening, when you do not want to disturb others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECO MODE LOWERS POWER CONSUMPTION BY 20%*\nYamaha\u2019s new ECO mode reduces power consumption by about 20%. It can be set from the top of the GUI menu. \n* Compared to power consumption when ECO mode is off (Yamaha measurement).\n\nSELECTABLE AUTO POWER DOWN\nAuto Power Down lets you save energy by selecting to turn off the power after 2, 4, 8 or 12 hours. \n* Compared to power consumption when ECO mode is off (Yamaha measurement).\n\n\nLOW STANDBY POWER CONSUMPTION\nYamaha makes its receivers eco-friendly with a low standby power consumption of 0.1W in IR Standby mode (1W in HDMI Standby Through mode, 2W in Network Standby mode).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER NOTABLE ADVANCED FEATURES\n * Charging of iPod, iPhone and iPad via USB when AV Receiver is off \n * iPod/iPhone song titles displayed in English and Western European languages on the front panel \n * Multi language color OSD for improved visibility \n * Audio input assign capability for HDMI and component video input \n * Front panel mini jack input for connecting portable audio player \n * Audio input assign capability for HDMI and component video input \n * 9 selectable subwoofer crossover frequencies \n * Subwoofer phase select / Subwoofer out \n * Initial Volume Setting and Maximum Volume Setting \n * Audio Delay for adjusting Lip-Sync (0-250 ms)\n * 40-station preset tuning / Auto preset tuning\n * Background Video feature (for Radio only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHICH YAMAHA RX-V SERIES RECEIVER IS RIGHT FOR YOU?\nYAMAHA RX-V373\nCheck out the Yamaha RX-V373 YAMAHA RX-V473\nCheck out the Yamaha RX-V473 YAMAHA RX-V573\nCheck out the Yamaha RX-V573 YAMAHA RX-V673\nCheck out the Yamaha RX-V673 YAMAHA RX-V773-WA\nCheck out the Yamaha RX-V773 POWER\nWatts/Channel 100 x 5 105 x 5 110 x 7 90 x 7 95 x 7 Discrete Amp - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Amp Assignable - - Surround Back/ Bi-amp/Zone B Surround Back/ Bi-amp/Presence/ Zone 2 Surround Back/ Bi-amp/Presence/ Zone 2 CONNECTIVITY\nMade for iPad/iPhone/iPod iPhone/iPod inly \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 HDMI In(Front)/Out 4in 1out 4in 1out 4in 1out 6(1)/1 6(1)/2 HDMI 4k-2k Pass-thru Pass-thru Pass-thru Pass-thru & Upscale Pass-thru & Upscale & HDMI Zone B EASE OF USE\nPanel Height 130mm 140mm 140mm 150mm 150mm/Aluminum front On-Screen Display \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Graphic-User-Interface - - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 YPAO Speaker Setup \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 PLUS RSC \u2714 PLUS RSC Multi-point Multi-Zone - - Zone B Zone 2 Line out / SP out Zone 2 Line out / SP out NETWORK FEATURES\nWifi Smartphone App Control - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Apple AirPlay/Internet Radio - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 DLNA Certified - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Network Receiver - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 PLUS WIFI ADAPTER INPUTS/OUTPUTS\nHDMI 4/1 4/1 4/1 6(1 front)/1 6(1 front)/2 USB 1 1 1 1 1 Network Port - \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Digital Optical 2/0 2/0 2/0 2/0 2/0 Digital Coaxial 2/0 2/0 2/0 2/0 2/0 Analog Audio 4(front 1)/2 4(front 1)/1 4(front 1)/1 4(front 1)/1 4(front 1)/1 Component Video 2/1 2/1 2/1 2/1 2/1 Composite Video 4(front 1)/1 5(front 1)/1 5(front 1)/1 5(front 1)/1 5(front 1)/1 Preout Subwoofer 1 1 1 2 2 Headphone out 1 1 1 1 1",
