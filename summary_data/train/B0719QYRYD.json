      "text": "I am very impressed with this lamp! The light settings alone are worth the cost, but the fact that you can adjust the height (by unscrewing 1-3 separate poles that attach to the base) makes it a great buy. It lights up a medium sized room in my house on the second lowest setting! I do a lot of needlework in the evenings and the different colors of light make a huge difference in seeing details. NOTE: the power cord plugs into the control panel, not the base. I have found that the 6 ft cord is a little short for my liking when the lamp is at the tallest height, but a plug strip solves that problem just fine.",

The cord is also so short and connects over halfway UP the pole, instead of being at the base.. you have to put it directly beside an outlet for it to reach. I\u2019m definitely returning!",

Using only 12 watts, there is no way they could get 1815 lumens out of it. We measured about half of that. It also seems to be just over twice as bright as a 400-lumen TaoTronics desk lamp, which agrees with our measurement. The external cord with velcro ties is not elegant, but it is fine for most locations. I might not want it dangling down if I used this light in the middle of my living room, however.

So many choices as to brightness of light, intensity of light and the touch panel is very sensitive. Did a lot of research with all the other light offers and think I chose the best.",

The switch is touch enabled, light goes stronger or dimmer using touch buttons. Good looking lamp that doesn\u2019t compromise on quality. My only minor comment is that the instructions could be ever so slightly clearer and dumb proofed. But it takes only a bit of common sense to figure out that the wire goes inside the pipe! :)",

One more nice thing is that in the dark the switch button is lit for us to know exactly where the switch is in the dark to on the light.",

The lamp is well constructed, and the parts fit together to form a solid, attractive light. I am using the light to illuminate my keyboard, and it looks great, and performs flawlessly. It provides excellent light output, and it can be dimmed at the press of a button. The light can be changed from cold white to warm softer hues, and varied to any color between the extremes. I am completely satisfied with my purchase, would purchase it again, and would recommend it to my friends.",

      "text": "I've only had this lamp a week or two and so far I love it. I am a crocheter and need ample light which this lamp produces. One of the best features of this lamp for me is it doesn't give off heat like most lamps which I find most uncomfortable. The range of light control and variation is more than I'll probably ever use but there is sure to be something to suit everyone. The cord on the side seems to bug some people but not me. I would recommend this lamp and would buy a second one if I ever have the need. The product came very well packaged.",

First of all, it is well made mechanically, with the various parts fitting together easily and tightly. The base is solid and heavy, and it doesn't rock. The LED lighting is amazing, and I have found that it is great for reading, which is why I bought this. I also have a Taotronics desk lamp, which has worked perfectly since I bought it two years ago.",

The buttons on the panel should be raised and be very distinct, in color and in shape and size.",
