Sound is clear but can't seem to set volume high enough. Attached a small set of computer speakers I had lying around and sound is much better. I bought the first to use as a bedroom TV but have occasionaly hooked it to my computer for Hulu and other webTV. 23 inch is a good compromise (not too big, not too small). The second one was for my daughter's college dorm room for dual use as a TV and as a monitor to use with her laptop.",

This did not fit our purpose. We might have placed the unit in another location but for the problem with the power connection which was intermittent. The plug-in was far from secure. We sent it back as faulty.",

It seems you need to adjust the overscan to display the entire screen other wise you will chop off a bit on each side. This is useless as a second or shop monitor where you occasionally plug in a Raspberry Pi, a NVR, a laptop etc. Real pity since I have been using and loved SyncMasters for many many years. Complicating this is the fact that Samsung decided to hide all the controls on the side. If they have room for a \"Samsung\" (advertisement) on the front, they have room for volume and menu controls on the front.",

Trust me, they're loud enough. Its not like you should be expecting surround sound theater quality, but they definitely get the job done, and that's what matters. I'd also like to point out that this is probably the cheapest name brand TV you're going to find for the size, and it has all the neccessary output/input connections that you would be expecting to see on the back of most TV's. My advise to you, go to Samsung's website and view the back to know what connections are available...",

This might be because I'm plugging the cable directly to the tuner, rather than using a box. The cable is set up for non digital TVs and the monitor has a digital tuner. I use headphones while watching the ballgame while my wife watches the HD TV. It's also handy while waiting for downloads etc.",

To solve any confusions about this is, just put like a foam like material underneath the cord in place so the tv doesn't black out once in a while whatever u r watching, other than that this tv/monitor is great. Bought it for $221 w/ free shipping back in the beginning of the year on Amazon of course, great price.",
