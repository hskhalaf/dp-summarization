Its broad base and generous cushioning have been lauded by many. However, it may not be the best option for those who need arch support in their footwear.",
      "pros": [
        "Most purchasers are happy that the Ryka Nova feels comfortable right out of the box",
        "The shoe provides ample cushioning for all-day walking and standing, according to multiple reviews",

        "The model offers a balance of warmth and breathability which makes it perfect for fall and spring",

      "cons": [

      "text": "These are great comfortable sneaks. I love ryka, made just for womem. I have a mesh ryka for summer walks which i love as no lining under the mesh so very cool but needed a heavier warmer one for colder fall into early winter then spring and these are perfect. Extremely comfortable right out of the box, good arch support. Very well made sturdy shoe. I actually returned this one as i found a bit cheaper and in a color i wanted more that the gray but its a great sneaker!",

Either heel is low or size is too large. Thing is, grey fits great save for slight heel slippage. Black fits better with additional insole. Both still flip, so gave 4 stars.",

Looks more like a running shoe with the wide soles. However, the picture was accurate. These look nothing like the usual Ryka shoe. Tried them on and wore them for about an hour before I realized I was still wearing them. Guess that means they are comfortable. Time will tell.",

The width gave my toes room to wiggle, the heel was perfect after lacing correctly. The inner sole is what was awesome. Not to spongy that it gives an unstable feel, but not hard to make the bottom of my foot feel uncomfortable. This is my first Ryka shoe.",

I've added my Dr. Shoals inserts for added arch support. My other Rykas are a blue mesh for walking in Spring, Summer, Fall and a pair of water shoes for onboard cruise ship on slippery decks and to the beach. Ryka are my go to sneakers now..",
