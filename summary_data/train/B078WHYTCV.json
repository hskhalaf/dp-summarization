      "title": "Thought I was getting good jecs. Apparently not",
      "text": "The only reason why I'm not giving it 1 star is because it didn't completely fail at pressing IN bushings. Pressing out bushings is impossible. Ram rod crushes easily. Space between Arbor legs is perfectly inconvenient for everything I've tried so far. Ram spins on bed plate. Build quality is ass. Cast iron Arbor plates shatter. No spot to put the handle lever. Have had good luck with jecs in the past but this one is just terrible. update, tried using again today to push out small on rear knuckle bushings, absolutely failed. this tool is nearly useless",

      "text": "The box came very battered and the bottle jack leaked and wouldn't pump up. After assembly (easy, although not the greatest construction), I found that the bottle jack was no good. I contacted JEGS and they were quick to ship me a replacement bottle jack (at not cost). Unfortunately, this did leave me with scrap metal (the bottle jack) to deal with but at least they didn't have to send me a whole new press! In short, this is a great deal but if you're pressed for time you might find yourself up a creek waiting for replacement parts to make it work.",
