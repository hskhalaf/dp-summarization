      "text": "The service was good and delivery was quick. The ski bag was a nice size for youth skis or skis for shorter people (I'm a 110 lbs 5'2 female), they fit my 150 skis JUST barely but I prefer that to carrying around an extra long bag that has to be folded over and gets in the way. I returned the bag because the fabric is way to thin for this purpose. It's like a windbreaker almost, it doesn't offer the skis and poles much protection at all. Zippers and straps looked good and well stitched. I returned for a canvas-type fabric and am quite happy with that.",
