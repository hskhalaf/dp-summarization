Can you REALLY not use a sticker that will peel off easily, OR put the sticker on the plastic wrapper? Come on manufacturers! Have a heart!",

And for $15, that's quite a bargain. Far, far, far better than buying some cheap 4-piece set at Target that will bend and end up misshapen. The big concern with these cutters, however, is rust. They need to be dried well. However, if you put a bit of cornstarch in the bottom of the tin, these WILL NOT RUST! Guaranteed. Just wipe them off before using. Wash and dry normally, but don't stress about whether or not there's a still a drop of water on them. Highly recommended.",

BUT - the best feature is the little can, in which they are all stored neatly, concentrically. Why not 5 stars? - I would have preferred larger crinkles (especially for the larger sizes).",
