My Alpinestars Stella jacket didn't come with a back protector, so I added this for more safety and it fits perfectly in the dedicated pocket in the jacket. I was worried it would feel stiff or bulky or be visible through my jacket, but it is very light and flexible, so it forms to your figure when you put it on and does not change the look of the jacket at all when wearing it. I would highly recommend adding this to your jacket if yours didn't come with one. Always better to be safe.",
