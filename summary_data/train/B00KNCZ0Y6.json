This is heavy duty and your UPS man will be happy you don't order one of these everyday. Even if you have a single project, worth it to buy long lengths from your local Steel Distributor and bend/cut to fit. Resale this any day of the week after your done. Ton of guys looking for one and glad to pay cash to get one at a discount.",

Maybe for a beefy 20 yr old it would be OK but at 175 lbs and 5 decades, I have to literally put all my weight into it. And when it finally gives, it snaps so hard that I almost got whiplash. I ended up renting a demo saw to cut the #5. The snap ring came off one of the rollers in the second day. The roller needs something much more substantial to hold it on. Fortunately, it's an easy fix with a loop tie.",
