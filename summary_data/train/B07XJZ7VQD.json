Have not found it yet. Overall I would buy again because there is very little at the same price point that can match it. I use it to surf news and to read Kindle books. Works fine for those activities. I have not played any games on it.",

We haven't had any issues with it, and it's been fun for me to use during quarantine for zoom and Skype meetings as the screen is bigger than my phone's. I would definitely recommend this!!",
