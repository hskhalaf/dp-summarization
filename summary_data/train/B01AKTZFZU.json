When I was out I went searching for it in a regular size. Happened upon this one and purchased it. It was great... for about 2 weeks. Then it was clumped, dry, and just really gross to try to apply. In reading a few more reviews it seems this is a fairly common problem. I feel like this particular mascara from this seller is being sold VERY close to it's expiration date (and this is why it's inexpensive). Will not purchase again from them. Completely disappointed with the quality",
