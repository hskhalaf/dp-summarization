I was starting to get a little annoyed that my son only seemed to be interested in playing with trucks and wanted him to find some other toys to play with. We got him this and he was so pumped! He now LOVES all things legos and spends hours building towers, robots, trucks. I am so happy to see him being creative and building vs just pushing cars around all day. Plus, I think my husband has just as much fun as my son.",

So to operate the crane my grandson must get someone else to hold the cab of the crane in place, meaning he can't play with it by himself. If it were not for this significant flaw I would rate this toy with the highest ratings across the board.",
