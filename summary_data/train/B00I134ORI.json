I had to be a little bit careful when installing them because I really wanted them to all be aligned since they're sort of flat. The quality of the light was surprising to me, it's somewhat more orange looking than other soft white lights, definitely warmer than I'm used to, but everything looks great in the light these produce. Given that the light temperature is so much warmer than most other lights i've seen I would try to avoid putting these in an area with other soft white lights.",

I've used it daily for about a week and have found nothing to criticize. Light output (lumens) easily is 40-watt equivalent.

We thus, have had to find a different style of lampshade for a couple of our fixtures. The labels also discourage putting these bulb in a full-enclosed fixture (e.g. recessed lights with a globe or cover-pane). I definitely like how much more durable these bulbs are in closets, as we were often accidentally breaking those toxic CFLs.",

The dimming functionality is not amazing, but unlike non-dimmable versions, they will work on dimmer switches, and can be dimmed to maybe 50% of the normal brightness. Although they look weird, they perform great in fixtures, as the light shines both up and down from the rim of the bulbs. I recommend getting the 75w equivelent (~1100 lumens), unless you are quite sure that your home is bright enough. The soft white is the color you are probably used to in your home, the Daylight color will probably remind you of florescent or office lighting. I do not recommend mixing them within a room.",

The flat-bulb shape is very handy and fits more fixtures than the round LED bulbs with the large bases. This bulb fits in shallow fixtures where other LED's are too large (girth-wise.)

I also like that the bulb is made of a thick plastic in order to prevent it from shattering or breaking. They might look a little funky if you have them bare, but once you put them behind a shade or cover it's virtually impossible to tell the difference. I don't have these bulbs on a dimmer so I can't comment on their performance there. Overall I am very happy with these bulbs so far.",
