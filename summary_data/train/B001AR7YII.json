I drive a suburban and the ramp length is just right, making it not too steep for my older dog who cant jump in there anymore. Wide enough for her big-boned 80lb self, and the rubber traction is great on her paws. Happy I decided to go with this one!",

It is made of a heavy material which makes it a little cumbersome but I am a pretty small person. The material will hold up in rain or snow or whatever. It is made so that when you put it up to the tailgate, etc., it stays perfectly in place and won't slip. After use, it simply folds in half and has a clip that will lock it into place. Be careful of pinching your fingers is my only criticism. I recommend it to everyone",

We now use the ramp to load her into the backseat of my CRV. I have a harness with a handle, so I stabilize her with that, but the ramp is sturdy and fits perfectly. She walks right on up.",

One of the threads was not threaded but my husband was able to bolt it together. It made the process harder than is should have been but we figured it out.",

We stood along side so he'd not look down or jump on/off. Works Great! Also use now for full size truck & travel trailer.

      "text": "This product works as advertised and after researching it\u2019s the best I found, but it\u2019s very heavy and big and bulky. I purchased this for my 70 lb dog to get in and out of the back of my small SUV which I bought for him to be able to ride in the back. The ramp is SO big, it takes up like half of the back where my dog rides. In a few years when he will really need this, I hope I\u2019m able to still lift it!",

    "description": "Color:Graphite/Gray\n\nThe original PetSTEP Folding 70\" Pet Ramp is the perfect accessory to help pets climb in and out of the back of vehicles as well as on and off tables/furniture such as exam tables, sofas, beds or even up and down stairs with ease. This ramp has a gentle slope that provides assistance to pets that cannot leap onto high surfaces. \n\nThe Folding 70\" Pet Ramp by PetSTEP is made from high-quality plastic materials, which makes it sturdy and durable. The ramp has several safety features including a unique non-slip ridged surface that is not found on other ramps. This surface is soft on pets paws and helps pets maintain grip and traction. Plus there are no materials used such as carpet, tape, or sandpaper that can trap in odors. A soft heavy duty rubber universal non-slip grip is found on each end that fits vehicles and edges. \n\nThis lightweight (18.5 lbs) portable ramp can be folded in half and has molded ergonomic handles built in on each side making it easy to carry and store. Easy to setup and low on maintenance, this ramp can be cleaned with soap and water. The base of this ramp maintains traction which helps secure the ramp in place as pets use it to climb up or down. The total weight capacity for this ramp is 500 lbs. (for use with 4 legged animals only).\n\nTo use, simply unfold the ramp and prop one end against a truck bed, vet table, or top step. Animals can walk up or down at a gentle incline, instead of struggling, jumping, or being lifted. With its sturdy structure and rubberized surface, the ramp helps reduce arthritis and dysplasia pain, lowers the chances of injury, and cuts down on back strain.\n\nThe Folding 70\" Pet Ramp by PetSTEP is an excellent item for newborn or older animals as well as for pets that require special care and attention. This ramp makes an excellent addition to any home with pets.",
