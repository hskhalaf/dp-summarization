I recorded myself using the windows 10 voice recorder and on play back instead of hearing me say \"Hello\" 10 times, I hear the same Buzzing noise instead. It May be so comfortable and high quility material but the Mic is broken and does not work. I returned the item within a hour of receiving it. Very disappointed with the Turtle Beach and especially for the price \u00a384.99 which is not a budget headset.",

And my experience so far is they are not living up to their hype. They will need to be returned. Time to search for another set.",
