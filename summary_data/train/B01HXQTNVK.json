Yes, I bought this to place vegetables and other items that would other wise fall through the grates, it works well for that. Is it easy to use? Yes Pros: Works as intended Cons: None Note: Be careful when handling",

      "text": "I decided to try these after using (and liking) the Kitchen Home brand mats because these were far less money per mat. I was expecting junk but HELLO, they actually work better and clean up much easier than the more expensive brand. They come five in a pack and my first pair (enough to cover my grill) are used almost daily and are showing no signs of wear. Very good product, very fair price; fast, free, delivery. What's mot to love??!! Five stars.",

Previously I used steel trays and sprayed them with Pam... no amount of scrubbing gets them completely clean.. Highly recommend the Grill Mat.We have even found an addition use by lining the bottom of the oven from time to time with dishes, like casseroles, that have a tendency to boil over. The price was right, the packing was great, and the shipment time was right on time. No complaints here for sure! 3 people found this helpful.",

What I like most about the mats is that they prevent flame flare ups from grease drippings. Nothing falls through grill. Large enough to cook 6 hamburgers at a time. Easy to clean. 5 pads should last you a lifetime'",

Been using the same two sheets over and over and have had no problems. I do use non-stick spray to help it out but it browns the food well and cleans up easily. The grill stays quite clean and that was the purpose of using the sheets. Some foods should be cooked in foil but not all. Have paid more for other brands but this one is the best so far.",
