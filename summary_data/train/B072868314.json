However, it's super small and fits my gf's wrist perfectly. She loved the watch a lot and wears it when we go out on the weekends. You can also easily adjust the band itself by taking out links which is great. No tool required. If you're not sure if you want this watch as a gift, do yourself a solid and just buy it. Well worth the $ and looks awesome!",
