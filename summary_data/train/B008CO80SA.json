Only easier way to turn the car is to lift the front wheels by applying pressure on the push handle and having the car turn just on the two rear wheels. Kiddo likes it a lot.

The folding handle is a great idea, but the screw that holds it in place buzzes loudly while in use. The cup holder on the handle is too narrow and easily tips over. When it does tip, it pours the beverage directly on your child's head. This is such a great concept, it is just very poorly executed. A collapsible radio flyer wagon can serve a similar purpose, but with more space and an actually quiet ride for the same price.",

I don't know if it's the width, angle, or height of the handle, but after a while hurts my upper arm/bicep/tricep region. Also, the cup holder for the adult ONLY fits a plastic water bottle. Not a coffee travel mug, not a soft drink bottle, not even your own water bottle (mine is glass). It's inconvenient. Other than that our son loves to ride in it and give other kids rides.",

      "text": "This car is hands down the best! When I was purchasing it, I didn't know why it was called whisper rider... And now I do! Because it's actually quiet when you're pushing it! Our neighbors have the other version, but it is so loud that you have to almost yell when you're talking, while pushing that one. But this one, the whisper rider, you can talk normal and be just fine! It's a quiet, smooth ride and it comes with 3 cup holders! If you're in the market for a car like this, I would recommend the whisper rider! The fact that's it's quiet makes it definitely worth the purchase!",

A few things to note: - The steering wheel does not turn the wheels - The wheels do not rotate or turn. - The cupholder is too small for a regular-sized beverage (Starbucks, beer, etc.) I expected a bit more out of a $60+ plastic buggy. On the plus side, the buggy seems safe and sturdy. Also, as I mentioned, my nephew loves it when we go on walks.",

One thing I would love to see is that the front wheel can turn because during a turn it's a bit tough especially with a baby on it.
