The belt it\u2019s self seems durable and has three different rings to clip the leash into. The leash is heavy and stretchy. I took Ghost out for a quick test run and it was so amazing to run hands free. I also like that the leash length is adjustable and the built in handles are a huge bonus. Now we just need a running harness for Ghost. Highly recommend this belt as it holds more than enough gear and is super comfortable :)",

I wish i had room like the other pouch. Also the head phone hole is pretty much useless as there is no room. Would be nice to have room and put a poop bag dispenser there instead.",

Only caveat is that for my stronger, more active dog, I actually use carabiners on both ends (to attach to his harness and to the belt) because he somehow manages to Houdini out of typical leash clips.

I was also screwing down subfloor the other day and used just the waist belt part to hold the screws as I moved around-MULTI-USE! Good quality and versatile with or without dogs attached!",

There is a metal loop about halfway down the leash that is also nice for more restricted areas where the longer leash could be problematic. Would definitely recommend!",

      "text": "The pockets can hold everything I need to go on a walk. The leash is made of an elastic cord which makes pulling or any sudden changes feel less abrupt for both me and my dog. I wish the leash felt a little stronger though. I ended up replacing the cord with another one. My husky is a strong puller but this belt has held up. The water bottle holder ripped but it still usable. Besides that, I am very happy with this multifunctional belt.",

I\u2019m a dog trainer and will recommend to people with multiple dogs for sure.",
