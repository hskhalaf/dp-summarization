I mixed the food half and half with their old food just to change the type of protein. After a few days of diarrhea, they ate the mixture with no apparent problem. However, when the mixture ended and they started on the pure CANIDAE, they stopped eating it and lost quite a bit of weight. I have tried this food twice with similar results (just to make sure it wasn't a bad batch). I can't say it is a bad food, it is just bad for my dogs.",

Initially, it gave her bad gas and loose light colored stools, but after a few days she was fine. She loves this stuff so much and I feel better giving her this rather than something with preservatives and chemicals. I have a terrier/German shepherd mix",

For our yorkie mis it is a little large, so we just add warm water to soften it for him and he loves it as well. I would recommend this food!",

I can say that after a couple of years, we have been very pleased with the cost and quality of the food. Our dogs have been happy and healthy ever since the change. They run to eat each day and gobble it up. Definitely the best food for the price.",
