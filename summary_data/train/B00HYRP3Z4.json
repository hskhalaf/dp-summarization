We have put fresh watermelon in it, and we have used frozen peaches, and both have been delicious. It adds just a hint of flavor to the water, which is exactly what I wanted. Will prob be getting this as gifts too!",

The stains come out if you soak it with vinegar, but then you have to try to get the vinegar smell out.

The fruit basket area is a nice large size and the plastic does have a nice heavy feel as the item is sturdy but it's just a bit awkward in putting back together and not worth the effort.
