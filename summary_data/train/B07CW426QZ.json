BUT, and a BIG BUT - Amazon ships using UPS Box came beaten and open. Was missing the cold water isolation valve. (Amazon offered a credit equal to the cost of a replacement valve) At 70 pounds the item was probably tossed, kicked, rolled, dropped and pushed during the delivery process. This is not an Amazon problem but a common problem I have seen when ordering large , bulky or heavy items.",

Finding someone willing and capable of installing the unit was difficult. Getting it installed took me almost 3 weeks - super complicated because of BTU, distance from tank, other gas demands from heater, stove and dryer as well as the gas meter which was restricting gas flow. Just to complicate the issue, fresh air intake and exhaust had to be newly installed while the old exhaust was capped. So total install cost about $4000. The unit is a bargain. Other than that I'm super happy with it.",

This unit is quiet and efficient while providing endless hot water. No more waiting until my wife gets out of the shower to take a nice hot shower immediately. Dump your old hot water tank and upgrade to the future of hot water heating.",

The only thing I didn\u2019t take take into consideration, before I purchased this, was the amount of gas this really draws. I ended having to call the utility company and install a larger gas meter. Also, had to add larger gas lines in my house. Again, this was my fault that I didn\u2019t add up all the BTUs for my gas appliances ahead of time. Just want to give you a heads up if you\u2019re looking to purchase this. Highly recommend it and my wife loves not worrying about running out of hot water!",

Edit: After contacting rinnai, they sent me out the missing valves, albeit begrudgingly. The unit fired right up and I noticed no difference in time to receive hot water at fixtures. VERY quiet. The most inaudible gas appliance I have ever owned. Instructions were clear and very descriptive.",
