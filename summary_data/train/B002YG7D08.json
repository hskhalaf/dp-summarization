It's not identical, but it's across the bathroom from the Kohler fixtures, and looks enough alike that any difference is not noticeable. This arrived super-quickly, and with the nice paper template for marking where to screw everything in, it was easy to install. My only complaint is that the bar fits a little loosely into into the wall anchors, so it jingles and rotates when you put a towel onto it. Pretty minor.",

The mounting holes on the old one a horizontal screw pattern, but these new ones have a vertical pattern. So I had to drill new holes only to find out the anchors that are provided, did not work with drywall. A trip to HD and I had good drywall anchors. After I installed the bar, I noticed the bar was loose and would rattle. A little Loctite fixed that problem. Bottom line is that I would not buy these again.",

A bit disappointing, but hey, they're only towel bars and they will serve that function quite well. If my wife really notices the difference and doesn't like them, back they go!

I did run into one tiny problem when trying to get the screws/anchors out, however. They are held in by a tiny screw, and although I have many screwdrivers (and different sizes at that), I didn't have one small enough for this. I had to pull out my inner MacGyver and improvise. I ended up using a sturdy nail file, and it worked fine.",

Though the video is very educational... it should not provide false advertisement of the included tools.",
