This soap is what I was looking for. I tried other brands, but they didn't satisfy me. I'm glad for finding this seller. Please keep selling, I don't want to waste my money trying soap out there. P.s. Real olive oil soap doesn't smell like regular market soap. So some people might think \"something is wrong with that soap\". Believe me, this is a REAL olive oil soap.",

I'm still on the first bar and entering my 3 week of usage. The soap has no real scent to it and does a decent amount of lather. What really floored me was the pricing. Since it was my first timing buying this brand, i thought it was suspect, but after using it, I can say its the best value imo on amazon.",
