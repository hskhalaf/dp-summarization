      "text": "Best quality umbrella I've ever owned. You can tell from just one use how solid it feels, and that it should last for years. I got tired of the mini folding umbrellas that always end up not working due to the many sections that need to expand, and compress when you use them. This umbrella pops open in a second, and is very easily manually closed. It arrived securely packaged in a box that was filled with packing materials. I highly recommend this umbrella if you are looking for a large quality umbrella.",

This is truly amazing service and thoughtful. I wish other companies cared this much. Nice work EEZ-Y customer service team!!! Original review: First...in a moderate to heavier rain the rain will begin to drip on your head through the material. Second...everytime you close it the little plastic endcaps covering the spokes fall off the ends of the spokes. So when you open it the next time you have to bend the spokes to fit back into the endcaps which spreads the umbrella be out. Terrible design and performance.",

Also, there is a contrast in the colors when it is opened which I really like. It makes it look classy",
