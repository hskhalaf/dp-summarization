Almost all of the UA shoes I've purchased in the past have a wide base. This particular one unfortunately is very narrow and is uncomfortable for someone like myself who has wide feet. I would still recommend UA as a brand to purchase.",

While it may of stretched a little with use, the back was so stiff, like a hiking boot, that I knew it would rub the back of my leg raw if I attempted to play in them. I returned them.",

These are a tight fit as a lot of people say, but they feel a bit better once you start to break them in. The best way I can describe the feel is that it is akin to wearing a steel toe boot. The plastic at the front makes the shoe heavy, and you can really feel the impact on your toes during sudden cuts or stops.",
