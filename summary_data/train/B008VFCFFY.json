The pillows at my hotel were sub-par and they didn't have anymore to offer to guests, so I used this every night for 10 days and it totally helped me get some actual sleep despite a bad hotel bed.",

If you fly anything but first class this can be the difference in enjoying your final destination or being achy by the time you get there. It's soft, firm, and supportive. There's a space for ear plugs or stowed earphones and with the toggles it doesn't fall on the plane floors.
