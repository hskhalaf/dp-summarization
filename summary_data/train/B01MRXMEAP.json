However, it was next to impossible to put them on without completely unlacing them, and then wrestling my foot into them. The calf/shaft of the boot was plenty wide. However the space at the ankle into the foot was too small. I had to twist the boot sideways to get them on. I don't have huge feet (size 8), but maybe someone with a size 6 or 7 would have better luck with these boots. They really are great quality, and I wanted to love them. But I also don't want a workout each time I want to wear these boots! :)",

I argued the boots have only been warn 3-5 times max and briefly because it doesn't snow that frequently in my area. They REFUSED to even repair them! Crappy boots with crappy customer service.

Also, as some reviewers mentioned, they rubbed on the back of my heels and caused a blister. I think this could be remedied by breaking them in and wearing band-aids in the meantime, but I'm sending them back because of the waterproofing issue. All I wanted was dry warm feet. NOPE",

These are so gigantic and bulky (and I'm not talking about the foot size, which I ordered in a 9), that I highly doubt they are real Sorels. While I don't have another pair for comparison, I will say that when I see other women with Sorel boots, they certainly don't look so cartoonishly big. It's like I'm walking in clown shoes. Mainly, it's the front rubber part - which is very, very wide (why?). Also, the stitching isn't neatly done. Which is all characteristic of something fake. That or Sorel just isn't up to my standards, especially considering the money. Too bad.",

The straps are not made for that. I find them fairly comfortable, as far as bulky winter boots go. I park about a mile away from my office, and I don't have any comfort issues walking back and forth. I wouldn't be taking them on a 10 mile hike or anything, but for your basic winter use, they're fine.",

Have read a couple reviews that peoples toes get cold in these boots but others LOVE them and say there very warm. Anxious to get some snow so I can find out for myself. So far, LOVE THEM!",

So after getting to my desk and clocking in, taking off my boots to dry out and to dry my socks more quickly, I ordered these boots to save my feet. Say goodbye to wet cold feet with these booths. For the remaining months of winter my feet were warm and dry. I should have ordered them sooner.",

I hiked with them and they were pretty supportive, but it's not suggested for that kind of use. Mainly stick to wearing them on less adventurous days.",
