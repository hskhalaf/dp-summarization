Upon installing the game will try to do a Release Date Verification and will fail, rendering your copy of the game worthless. It took me two weeks contacting both WB games and steam support in order to play the game I rightfully bought. Finally, and begrudgingly, WB issued me a code so I could download the game from Steam. I give the poor review not for the quality of the game but for the BS I had to go through in order to play it.",

The side quests and the cat woman episodes help in game length and quality. I'm glad this game saves automatically and often or the occasional crashes every hour would be beyond tolerable.",

I would recommend getting the Game of the Year version, which has all of the DLC, including an extra mission with Robin and more challenges with two additional characters.",

Amazon took it back, no questions asked. I like that about them, they realize that \"stuff\" happens, and are interested in making sure that the customer is happy. I will likely purchase this again down the line, and hopefully get one that is clean.",

I love how there are about 12 story lines running so even when you finish the main Joker mission, there are still more to do. It's not just finding Riddler trophies either. I recommend this game as it is an increase from the original Arsylum game. I have this on both the PS3 and the PC now.",

The game has nice action sequences, some detective-mode time and it is fun to try to solve all the Riddler's riddles, and the others secondary stories. The only tricky thing with this game, at least for me, was installing it because I didn't know that I had to have the \"Games for Windows Marketplace\" to run it and I didn't understand why it wasn't installed with the game's setup... Besides that, I recommend it!",
