Mice had resided in it over the winter, so I was especially happy to be able to steam every nook and cranny. This size steamer was easy to maneuver in a small camper. I also like to use it in the kitchen for grease build up. I was not disappointed with the Vapamore MR-75. I let the steam do the cleaning and then would wipe with a rag. So far the tools are holding up. I hope to be able to buy a larger one in the future.",

Maybe I'll update this once I do that. Stay safe everybody. Don't be \"that guy.\" Wear a mask!",

Love all the accessories and the bag, but would be extra nice if there was a storage container for them. And some more info on using those accessories. I've gone to the company's site which has some helpful intro videos but I'd like more. Normally I'd knock out a star for those shortcomings, but I like the style and purpose and price enough to leave the 5* rating.",
