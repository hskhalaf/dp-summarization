I added a few drops with my serum in the morning and night. Only a couple week, I definitely can tell the difference on my skin. It looks more radiant and healthier. Because the price of the famous brand is too expensive for 1 oz, I decided to try this brand instead. The quality is pretty good. It works great on my skin like the same oil and there are no preservatives and no other additives added. Happy deal for me! Love it!",

That worries me that the company sending is emptying some of each to fill other bottles or not legit 100% oil as described.",

I moisturize my skin with a drop of Marula oil after using the serums and before I put on my face cream. Then, I apply make-up. It looks good all day; it doesn\u2019t hurt that the underlying skin looks great all day. No, this is not the only thing I am using.
