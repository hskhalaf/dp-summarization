Set-up was fast and easy -- instruction booklet is well organized with useful diagrams. Am completing the 1st week of daily use: so far so good. The C65 produces excellent coffee. Controls are less complicated than my old F7, and it is easy to adjust to fit individual tastes -- strength, cup size, temperature, etc. Only fret is reliability -- will it match the duration of the F7?",

It would have no way to know how much beans to grind until those two factors were input. Lastly, it has one knob to select the type of coffee, strength, and amount. That is frustrating because you have to keep rotating the knob in different directions to make the different inputs. It should allow separate input options before making the coffee.",

      "text": "I have been using this machine for a few months now, and I am very disappointed. I owned a similar model in the past and loved it (the one thing I've regretted losing in my divorce). The main problem is that the coffee beans will not slide down to the grinder, so even if the receptacle is full, you will have to push the beans manually after a few coffees. This machine should actually be recalled for that very reason. Also, I've paid more for the C65 \"Platinum\" model, only to discover that the C60 model is EXACTLY the same, but without the silver details.",

With coffee typically priced at Starbucks and Pete's I will have to factor in the math when looking at future maintenance cost so other than that I am happy with my Jura. Hope this was helpful.",

One should just fill the bean hopper and only be concerned that there are beans in the hopper. This appears to be in a design error. I am not sure if Jura is aware of this but they should be.",

Strangely as well, the coffee doesn't come out piping hot, like the manual says it does. It also states the temperature even affects the flavor in a positive way, and then makes coffee that's 115*f.
