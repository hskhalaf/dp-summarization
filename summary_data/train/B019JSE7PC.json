      "text": "This item suffers from two problems; the sound quality is absolutely horrible. In this day and age such poor sound quality is unacceptable. Adding another $20 to the cost could have upgraded the sound - if not for even less. Also, sometimes the unit does not respond to the 'Alexa' wake up call. Even yelling doesn't trigger the system. I'm disappointed in this unit. Even though I want to support young entrepreneurs, this one need a re-think. May return it - not sure. Amazon is at fault here for allowing a product to share their technology with such poor audio performance. Where are the standards??? This product makes the entire Echo line look bad.",

It's never worked very well with any of our phones, Samsung or Apple. We've gone through multiple modems in our home as well. The connection during calls is always choppy and freezes constantly. It's so frustrating we had to tell our kids not to call us unless someone was dying. Now Nucleus is saying they are going to a subscription based service. So we are officially done with this device and will find something else. It's been a big disappointment.",

After setting the units up, it was clear that I could have saved my money and bought a megaphone. The audio quality is poor (think CB radio circa 1985) and the volume was so low, that unless the person you were speaking to was directly beside the unit, they wouldn\u2019t hear your voice. We cranked them both up, and they were still worthless. Kudos to Amazon for allowing me to return despite missing the return window by a day.",

The included \"instructions\" are refreshingly brief. That is good news. Of course the Intercom guided on-screen introduction augments the printed instructions. But, how will this work with the ingenue who can read the instructions but fails to connect? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for more comments after we have lived with this for a while.",

We have a good strong home network, I gave priority routing to the devices, nothing helped.

I purchased 15 of them for video intercom throughout my house and 2 of them the camera stopped working and now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying I have to have a subscription for them to continue working!?!?! What a scam! On top of all that if you have a power outage you have to go through and turn each one back one! Ridiculous! Please save your money and find an alternative to these!",

Ring doorbell is no longer available, I\u2019ve emailed them 2 times and still no one reached back out to me, some devices are offline then reappears when it wants to, Alexa doesn\u2019t work unless you wake her up by walking to the device and turning her off and then on, and my final comment.... they are now moving into a subscription service. How about if you fixed the first few problems and you would have had our subscription. This device is garbage I do not recommend.",

      "text": "Very simple to set up and it works exactly as described. I am especially fond of the ability to have my cell phone receive video calls and allow me to view my kids' rooms when I'm away from home. I was shocked to receive a personal email response from Morley Ivers to a suggestion I had regarding the camera's low light performance and even more shocked to learn that a software upgrade is going to be released in a few weeks that directly addresses my concern. There are constant free updates / upgrades that painlessly install themselves, just like the Echo.",

The Android and iOS apps are very good and the video quality is, again, surprisingly good. There are a few minor glitches but nothing I don't see the company being able to address as they move forward and get customer feedback.",

That's helpful when, as is sometimes the case, you ask Alexa to play music only to end up yelling at it when you want it to stop, or having to unplug Echo to shut it off. Nucleus solves that pesky problem by letting you shut off or change the music by clicking on the screen if Alexa doesn't hear you.\u201d - Inc. Magazine\n\n\n\n\nNucleus connects to Alexa, Amazon's cloud-based voice service. Just ask Alexa to listen to your favorite music, hear the news and weather reports, connect your smart home devices and more. Alexa is always getting smarter and adding new features and skills. Too busy to make dinner between work and picking up the kids? Ask Alexa for your favorite take-out spot's phone number or even order a pizza from the Domino's skill. Together, Nucleus and Alexa make the home front a little easier to manage and a lot more fun. \n\n Note: When active, get Alexa's attention by tapping the Alexa button. Nucleus does not currently support Spotify and Pandora with Alexa at this time. The Alexa Voice Service is available in the US only. \n\n Learn more about the Alexa Voice Service on Alexa-enabled devices.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup How did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWe\u2019re building Nucleus for our families and families everywhere. Jonathan developed Nucleus to keep track of his kids around the house and to create a simpler way to stay in touch with his relatives near and far. We\u2019ve since heard from customers that wish they could see their family members more often. ow, thanks to Nucleus, they can. \n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nNucleus enables you to spend more quality time with your family, no matter where they are. We\u2019ve heard from families all over the world that use Nucleus to call their kids down to dinner, or check in on an elderly parent that lives alone. It was designed to let you tap one button and feel like you\u2019re in the same room with the people you love, whether that room is upstairs or across the globe. \n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nThe best part has to be the wonderful and amazing stories we\u2019ve heard from customers. We\u2019ve had customers buy Nucleus for an aging parent in a rehab facility; for a young child that lives in a different city than her father; and for plenty of families that just want a better home intercom to make their lives a little calmer and more sane.",
