Because we lived in Manhattan, NYC, at the time, my wife bought the watch from Bulova's original shop on Maiden Lane, in lower Manhattan. The original Bulova watch is long gone, but, when I saw the brand on Amazon, so many fond memories were brought back that I have since purchased two Bulova dress watches on Amazon, including one that resembled the gift from my wife.. Every time I wear these watches, I think of the early days of our marriage; it makes me smile.",

The lugs curve inwards, which is nice for those with smaller wrists. However, the inside edges of the lugs are squarish and a bit pointy. They pressed uncomfortably against my wrists and left marks. 2. The leather strap seemed extremely thin and flimsy. I wanted to like the watch, but I simply couldn't wear it comfortably because of the lug design. I returned it for a refund.",

There was no real \"break-in\" period either, as the leather band was immediately comfortable. Over all, I highly recommend this watch for anyone who needs a dress watch on an occasional basis.

Not too shiny, but not as matte as it looks in the picture. It's a classicly subtle minimalist watch. For the price, you can't go wrong. I've owned Citizen Eco drives, tissots, sturhlings (mine sucked), old seikos, timex, and more I wear a lot of brown, khaki, and beige but this looks fine.",

      "text": "Overall, this is a very nice watch. It's very thin and lightweight, so it fits very well under shirt cuffs and jackets. It also looks very classy and can be worn with almost anything. The face isn't white like the picture suggests, but is more of a silver sunburst pattern. At the same time though, the fact that it's so light makes it feel a little cheaper when it's on your wrist compared to heavier automatic watches. The band that comes with the watch isn't great, but it's relatively easy (and cheap to replace), if desired.",
