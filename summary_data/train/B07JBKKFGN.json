On day two it wouldn't work, we replaced the batteries and nothing. We checked the batteries, tried putting in different new batteries, looked for a reset switch, nothing. If I had reviewed this yesterday, I would have said it was amazing and just what we were looking for, but now, I am definitely returning it. Unless someone has a suggestion I can try to get it going again. The toy is getting no power, none of the features work, no lights, sounds, or movement. Such a disappointment!",
