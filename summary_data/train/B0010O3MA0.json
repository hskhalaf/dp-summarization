Now that they are made in China, I say, DO NOT BOTHER!!! They have no arch support, as the old ones did. They are also at least 1/8 \" thinner in depth than they used to be.",

I know this isn't a guarantee of quality but I generally prefer footwear made in Italy vs Asia -Cheap enough to pick up a few pairs -Easy to slip on and off -Smooth footbed doesn't squeak as I walk Cons: -It'd be nice if the felt liner under the cross-strap wrapped around a little bit over the edges, especially the front edge. I can feel the vinyl material sort of dig into the tops of my toes. It doesn't bother me but we'll see how it is after extended wearing.",

These are the ones that last well over 10 years of continuous use.",

    "description": "The Adidas adilette is the sport slide that started it all. Inspired by that timeless look from 1972, these men's sandals are easy-to-wear and come in seasonal pastel colors.\n\nOriginally launched in 1972 to the joy of grateful feet everywhere, the adilette is the most famous apr\u00e9s-sport slide on the market today.\n\nadidas is a name that stands for excellence in all sectors of sport around the globe. The vision of company founder Adolf Dassler has become a reality, and his corporate philosophy has been the guiding principle for successor generations. The idea was as simple as it was brilliant: to provide every athlete with the best possible equipment. It all began in 1920, when Adi Dassler made his first shoes using the few materials available after the First World War. Today, the adidas product range extends from shoes, apparel, and accessories for basketball, soccer, fitness and training to adventure, trail and golf.\n\nSee more",
