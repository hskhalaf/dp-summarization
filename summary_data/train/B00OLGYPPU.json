The unit I received is sturdy, the shelves are well made, and the bottom is perfectly flat so it will stand flat on a table. I didn't put anything fragile in mine so I hanged it using two 5 pound command tape hooks and it's holding up just fine. I own all kind of organization tools and racks and this one is by far my favorite in terms of quality. I highly recommend this.",

I mounted it (myself without any problems) on the wall right beside the vanity and it doesn't stick out or seem crowded. It fits her deodorant, body sprays, etc. perfectly. The little ledges keep things from falling off. The black color is appealing. (I have oil-rubbed bronze fixtures and this doesn't clash. It's not the same color, but complimentary.) I would definitely buy this again. It came fully assembled.",

I managed to get it attached but am not very confident in its sturdiness. Very disappointed with the new design that requires assembly.",

      "text": "This rack is quite sturdy and if good quality build. I wish it were just a bit deeper so that it would hold two rows of spice bottles, but that's on me for not paying closer attention to the dimensions. My only real complaint is where they placed the mounting tabs. They are directly behind the wire shelves making them difficult to get at with a power screwdriver. Make sure you have a long bit extension when you go to put this up or be prepared to screw it in by hand. They could have moved the tabs up about a 1/2\" and this wouldn't have been an issue and wouldn't change the sturdiness of the unit in the least.",

They come already assembled, complete with hardware to hang them... Upon hanging them, we found they wasn't hanging straight... We found the frame on both was a bit shifted, making it hang crooked... My husband just used his hands to straighten them and all is golden. Pretty design and I can reach my spices with ease... I would definitely buy them again... When we get our new house built, I will buy more... Thanks!",

It's really nice that the shelves have a front edge/lip so that nothing falls out. Installation was easy. Each shelf needs 4 screws to be attached to the wall, and with each shelf they send you 10 screws - 5 that can be screwed into drywall, and 5 that can be screwed into wood. Very nice that that would be provided. We love how they look and keep things organized.",

But the mounting holes are pretty close to the edge of the shelves so I had to screw in the screws by hand because my drill wouldnt fit. To mount two of these perfectly it took about an hour. Aside from slight installation pains in my fingers I am so happy with them. The shelves are wide enough to fit my jars of cream and sturdy enough to hold multiple products. I will be recommending these in the future.",

You have to nail the separate racks on the wall (hooks don't fit) to make a 3 tier rack. Completely different from what is shown and stated in the description. I was expecting a one part item, not this. Beware.",
