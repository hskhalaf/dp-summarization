It's a manufacturer error, and since the webbing where the handle is joined to the rest of the strap is joined sewn, there's no adjusting it. I'm hoping the manufacturer contacts me--I'd love to exchange the piece and get it right, because otherwise this looks like a great addition to the home gym.",

On the other hand, you can also do some very demanding advanced routines. Well made, grips and stirrups are comfortable. Well worth the price.",

It also mimics the TRX single point anchoring system simply by placing the straps next to each other resulting in decreased stability thereby challenging your core strength. All this and approximately $120 cheaper than the TRX Pro 4 (also owned).",

This is a nice feature if you work out alone. It is much easier to get your feet in an out of the stirups. I think it would be near impossible to do this with regular loose strapping. The hand grips are also very comfortable. Changing strap lengths is a snap. This is a well thought out product. I would recommend the Jungle Gym to anyone who wants to add a new reasonally priced element to their workouts.",

I attach them to my pullup bar, the simple door frame kind works but be careful, and I do backpack weighted dips and body weight rows with them. I do a lot of hiking and when hiking on large rocks you will find your self doing a lot of body weight dips. These help strengthen those muscles while working your core stabilizers at the same time. Just be sure to start small and light so you don't hurt your self. There are many more exercises you can do but the ones above are my favorite.",

Although not as portable as the TRX (and less than half the price) I think this is better for someone using this at home. My only con is that on one of the straps the \"strap end adjusters\" (part E) was too loose to prevent the slack from getting in the way of an optimal workout. By sticking a small piece of cardboard into the loose strap adjustor the problem was resolved. If not for that problem I would have rated this 5 stars.",

The only disadvantage is the accompanying training materials.

While a functional training machine would be ideal, this is a really inexpensive step towards that. Makes for a lot more options when it comes to functional training.

Some exercises, where your feet are suspended are harder than non-suspension training because your little core muscles have to do more work to balance and hold the line you want. This is great for your workouts but weird to get used to.",

Easy to use and durable, the hand grips are great and as comfortable as possible. I have large hands and have zero comfort issues. Highly recommend these!",

The handles and foot slings are also an improvement from TRX. Buy it.",

They might not pack down quite as small as TRX due to the rigid foot cradle, but if there's much difference, it's fairly minimal. I highly recommend these if you're comfortable using a TRX type suspension system but don't want to fork out the dough for the brand name.",
