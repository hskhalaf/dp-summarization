I have been wearing them for a couple weeks now and I am sad to say the have a rip in the seem between the wrist and the thumb. I am hoping the Copper Compression Company sees this and can help me replace them. Other than the seam rip the gloves are very comfortable and are the perfect fit. UPDATE I received an email right from one of the company owners. He was very apologetic and took care of the problem right away. I recommend these gloves as I have been wearing them for almost two months and I feel a difference for sure. Great customer service!",

These are also very comfortable, I got a different pair as a gift and those ones have a seam on the thumb that literally rubbed my thumb joint raw in one night! Took days to heal and I never wore those gloves again. These ones rock! Comfort, compression (gentle) and ride of pain.ill take it!",

At the same time they are very snug around the fingers and wrist and help me when I'm typing or using my hand a lot. I recommend them.",

Yesterday I did six pieces of jewelry and my hands felt like I\u2019d done nothing w my hands. The compression is good, not too tight, true to size, not to thick or bulky but pretty slim yet sturdy fabric. No slip gripping on the palms which I appreciate. And effortless mobility. 10/10 will buy these again and recommend to anyone! Very satisfied!!",

      "text": "At 74 and with rather severe arthritis in my hands, I had hoped these gloves might enable me to play the piano again. In younger years, I played at concert-pianist level, but for past decade-plus have been unable to continue, even at a recreational level. Unfortunately these gloves were absolutely useless in relieving pain or enhancing range of motion (can't even stretch to an octave). Additionally, they were quite difficult to remove, and it was obvious the material would start to ravel in short order.",

The very first time I put these on, my hands stopped hurting. I wore them for hours, and felt better as time went on. Now when I wear them, it isn't immediate pain relief. And if I wear them for a few hours in the evening, or overnight while I sleep, my pain levels in the morning are nil, compared to hardly being able to move them previously. These gloves are helping a lot. Maybe they'll keep me moving until some cure is found!",

This is probably due to the odd proportions of my hands though, as my palms are large and my fingers are kind of skinny? I don\u2019t know. The point is, they work well for what I need them for!",
