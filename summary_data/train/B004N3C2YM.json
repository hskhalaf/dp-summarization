That means we end up with lots of sheets shredded or torn in half, and thus, wasted. It's kind of like those big rolls of clear packing tape that you lose the end to and as you try to peel it up you end up with shredded tape. They work well, but I would not purchase them again, especially when there are other brands that separate just fine for the same price.",

However, they do seem to work better than the kushies ones someone had given me as a gift. They are also softer. They don't completely rid the mess, but that's not the point in my opinion. They make it much easier to plop the nasties into the toilet. I still use my sprayer, but it's much easier! I would repurchase these if I decide to continue using liners.",

It is possible that when my baby is bigger, and the inside of the diaper is bigger it will be a perfect size, but for now we have to fold it with a wiggly baby sometimes this can be difficult. They do protect the diaper just fine and don't break down immediately when they get wet which is nice, and so far we haven't had any plumbing issues, so their being flush-able seems to be correct.",
