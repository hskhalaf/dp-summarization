She ate a small amount and became very ill - ended up in the emergency. Her blood glucose plummeted and was very lethargic. It's hard to say if it was the dog food but it was the only difference so Am throwing the rest of the bag away and will not buy again.",

I have read so many reviews of dog food brands and this is always up there with stuff that costs much more. The variety of flavors is great, but there is only one for small breeds. Since I now expect to keep my little one this for the rest of her life, I bought several flavors of freeze-dried dog treats (Purebites brand, I highly recommend), which I crumble and mix into her meal, alternating flavors. She is much more excited to eat now since it's not the exact same thing for every meal.",

The itching can be caused by an over growth of yeast which is fed by sugars that the body makes from simple carbs so stay away from foods with grains,rice, white potatoes, and feed only complex carbs like peas, lentils, sweet potatoes. Also, meat like turkey, duck, venison, bison, and fish are better than chicken and beef.",

I wonder if it wouldn't stay fresher if it was divided up into two 14 pound bags, one of which could remain sealed until the first one is empty- given that it is made for small dogs and small dogs don't eat a lot daily.",
