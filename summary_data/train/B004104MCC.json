      "text": "I like the product for the most part. The casters are crap, but bought new ones and now it works great. Also, you need to oil all moving parts!! Otherwise the friction will stress the crank and bend the assembly. I am using it on a commercial drywall project over 7000sqft. and once I performed the mentioned modifications it was excellent. It worked great on walls,12' ceilings, easy to change the height post. On to the next project of building my house.",
