It held up very well and was able to hold all of the misc items we needed in the parks. It rained at various times every day and we were able to brush the water right off with nothing seeping in! This was the only bag we carried consistently all week! Highly recommended!",

Perfect also to carry my Mavic Pro drone along with all its accessories. And then take everything with me on my bike to a hike somewhere.

Padding on the strap that goes over shoulder and collar bone is very comfortable but if you want to carry this with bag on your back, the un-padded part of the strap and place where the clasp and length adjustment lays is across your breast bone in the front making it awkward and uncomfortable. Regardless of length you give strap, it still dangles with no place for the surplus strap to go. Everything else for this bag was thought of. That's why I'm disappointed.

But everytime i travel or do something sporty i feel the need for a backpack.. so i bought this on a whimp while vacationing.. it was on a lightning deal too so i thiught why not. I. Love. It. Wore it to a fun run event today. While i did not take it running, i did use it for the rest of the day. I had a huge battery pack, thick wallet (thick with coins i might add), 2 bottles of water, and other things. Not only that they fit, it didnt feel like it's making my shoulder tired too. Too bad it doesnt come in other colors.",

I'm a professional landscaper, I lift and carry heavy stuff all day but this bag hurt more than a day's work. The strap in the front also doesn't stay put and slips put easily after you've tightened it to your desired length. You're walking along and suddenly, the bag slips down.",

Needless to say, I can put more stuff in the new bag compared to the old one. I also like that you can switch to left or right shoulder if you wanted to. Time will tell if this will be a durable bag.

Its dimensions mirror the one made by Quechua that I have owned since 2014 and have thoroughly enjoyed. Though its capacity is large, it is very lightweight and carries easily across the body. It enables one to carry it across the front of the body and simultaneously carry a backpack as a carry-on. I am hoping this bag will last as long as my Quechua did. If so, I will highly recommend it.",

This hardware feels and looks cheap, light plastic(y) and almost like the metal color is painted on? The plastic piece that adjusts the strap is also very small. Hopefully it holds up well and he uses it. Otherwise it's a nice bag for the price !",
