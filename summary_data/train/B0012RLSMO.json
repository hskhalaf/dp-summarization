You need to cut the metal liners our of each side, which is the tough part. Then screw these into the power wheels tires as flat as possible with short screws and your kids will be blazing around in no time with much better traction and no more expensive replacing power wheel tires. I have done a power wheels dune racer and a mustang with good results.",

The only downside to this is that it treks a lot of mud in the garage. I can't say how these would hold up for \"true\" BMX'ers, but for my son's youth sized bike, it was perfect for the price.",

For the money, I think you can do much better. Again, if this is for a bike that's only for neighborhood riding it should be adequate and safe. I would not recommend it for someone trail riding or competing in BMX.",

Be aware it raises the bike a little higher than most tires (in our case it sat about 1\" higher off the ground) once inflated, but in our case that was a benefit.

My son can now easily move the grass, leaves and sand. The rear tire traction improved so much that the truck would understeer due to the lack of front traction. I fixed that by ordering more tires and screwing them onto the front tires. Now, all is right with the world.",
