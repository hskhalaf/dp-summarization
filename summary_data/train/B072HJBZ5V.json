Assembly was not difficult but it was quite time consuming. I also had difficulty with not over tightening screws and such. (Which is opposite of my normal problem of not having enough grub to tighten stuff enough). I have also noticed it is easily scratched so take extra care to avoid that. I highly recommend this product.",

This table is beautiful, well priced and very elegant looking in the space we put it in. It was very easy to assemble it, 2 of us did it in about 1.5 hrs. The instructions are clear and the parts are labelled very well. The box arrived in very good condition (was very heavy) i couldn't move it inside alone! The pieces were absolutely fine, no damage at all. I loved this table and have not one negative comment about it. I will post better pictures, but this is all i got now.",

      "text": "Looks good once put together but the cam lock system on this unit sucks! Most use the posts that only allow them to go so far into the wood. This unit does not. If you screw them in all the way you will not have enough room for the lock to grab the post. Some you have to loosen so much they only have a couple threads holding it which allows the plastic insert to pull out of the wood. If they would upgrade the cam system I would give a better rating as the rest of the parts are adequate for the price.",

My next two major purchases were from area retail shops. If this could be resolved, I would give the furniture a higher rating.",

I had to unscrew them a bit, which leaves me a little nervous about moving it. Other than that, It looks nice and fits the space well.",

It fits our 50\" TV easily, with plenty of room on either side. I don't see why it wouldn't hold a 60\". It's very sturdy and classy -looking. Con: I couldn't fit my DVD player or my Dish TV box inside. I had to place them on the bottom shelf.",

The doors seemed off and wouldn't close well until I realized that I could unscrew a small screw on the hinge to adjust and now they fit like a glove.
