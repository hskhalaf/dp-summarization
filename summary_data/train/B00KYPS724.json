I have tried a variety and spent more money than I should on slippers but I love to have them because of my hardwood floors. I don't walk around my house in my everyday shoes. So I wear mine probably more than most people do. The top of the slipper is soft and completely adjustable. Great slipper!",

The most recent pair have the most obnoxious odor from the sole that we have ever smelled. We washed them, soaked them, washed with scent beads etc - but they still stink. Clearly, the company ISOTONER has gone to a different china manufacturer with no standards or quality control. Stay away - you will end up with some sort of disease from this smell (or at least get sick to your stomach).",

But, the adjustable strap does not take this into consideration. The velcro does not extend far enough to make the slipper fit properly. As a result, my foot slips through to the front as I am walking, and my toes hang over the edge. This is not comfortable. If the adjustable strap could make the fit more snug, it could be a great slipper. Also, I do NOT have narrow feet. I take a wide width in shoes.",

There's not enough support and that's dangerous because I almost fell a couple of times because my feet were moving around too much. Since then, I have washed them and gave them away as donation. They wash very well as advertised, but that's the only good thing about them.",

My foot is a medium width and not narrow so these are really wide. After moving the strap over using the velcro for a about 3 months, it stopped sticking and would come undone easily and be a tripping hazard. I threw them away after 3 months.",

      "text": "While not the height of fashion, these are really comfortable and provide good support. I have very high arches and most running shoes don't even come close to the arch support of these slippers. One thing to note if you have narrow feet - due to the aforementioned high arch as well as a high instep, I rarely have a problem with shoes being too wide - usually quite the opposite. But these are a little loose around the sides of my foot. It would be good if they had more adjust-ability. But hey, I'm not jogging in them so I can live with it.",
