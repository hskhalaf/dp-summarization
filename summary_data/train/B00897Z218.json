If you get this game, get it for Wii-U, not for XBOX and ESPECIALLY not for PS3 because there are far more bugs and game breaking glitches.",

It is also much more convenient to have the map on the game pad than the little circle on the right bottom corner in AC II. The gameplay itself is similar, with same mechanics of movement and assassination. Fits nicely on Wii U and I will recommend this game. It has the DLC and Wii U also getting AC IV. Ubisoft has been supportive of Wii U, nicely complementing Nintendo.",
