We have covered it with a plastic lid for the moment, and are keeping it because the rest of the cage is so great, but others should be aware of this rather important defect. We are writing amazon in hopes that they will send us another cover like that on the other side of the cage, and will update with further information depending upon their response.",

Our hamster nests in the labyrinth, we can watch her tend to her baby through the clear panel, she rearranges her nest and food stash spots frequently; moving her piles of bedding around the labyrinth as if rearranging her furniture. The wheel is silent, bonus points for that. Only suggestion is to make the labyrinth detach easily from cage to make cleaning easier. When we open the labyrinth panel, the bedding falls out uncontrolled (This occurs because our hamster hauls all her bedding up the tube and into the labyrinth). Overall a great product providing a personal and entertaining view into our critter's life.",

Although I dont know if my baby is a little crazier than others but she loves to pee and poop up top part witch means I have to clean it at least 2-3 times a week the bottom part unclips and emptys pretty easily all in all I think that if I ever need to buy a new home for one of my babies I'd get this one again oh my baby is a classroom pet so this cage is perfect for the small space I have free",

Maybe she will get the hang of it someday, but for now she hasn't made it past that first level.",
