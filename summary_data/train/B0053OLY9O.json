Good battery life(rechargeable) and always has great sound and changing settings for voice/chat, volume, mute, and Virtual Surround is flawlessly easy while still wearing headset! I've also used a OTG cable with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and ZTE Axon 7 with this headset for listening to music or while watching movies from these phones, sound is rich, clear, and not distorted...A must have for anyone with a PSN habit and more!",

The reason i'm not getting a replacement is because all audio goes through usb to the headset. So you can't have tv audio. I also record my game plays so this is a big issue. With Astro a40 tr I can record chat and audio fine. I really liked the separate volume rockers for chat and audio. I paid $175 for this product in 2019. It definitely is not worth $175. That is why I gave 4 stars.",

These are hard to find and cost a boat load of $$$ so i decided to keep them either way",

Great to improve awareness, gamers will definitely have an advantage with their awareness using this headset. The only negative I have about this headset is it frequently loses its connection. This is frustrating as it takes about 30 seconds to restart the headset and get a connection again. I didn't seem to have a problem with interference from Wi-Fi or other Bluetooth devices, but maybe it was because of those? Once connected again it seemed to work fine though.",

Pros: Great build quality. Great sound and design. Comfortable for long hours. Cons: Not very good range. Disconnects instead of readjusting when signal is weak in about 20 feet. So this is not very good for VOIP purposes. Besides, it's uncomfortable chatting when you can't hear yourself speak with headphones that seal your ears. The logitech H760s that I've owned for over a year now, are considerably better with range and pretty much set the standard for wireless freedom imo but those are not very comfortable for longer hours.",

Cons: -Battery doesn't last long with high volume. -Microphone it's only telescopic so it can't bend to be near your mouth. -Microphone has feedback.

This headset is infinitely better. Game & VOIP is clear. I haven't lost connection to VOIP yet & I've never depleted the battery with hours & hours of use between charging. It's also VERY comfortable with thick, plastic-framed glasses (so long as they don't stick out behind the ear AT ALL). I am annoyed that it doesn't come with a USB charger. The mic picks up wind & other ambient sounds. I remedied the \"AC vent\" sound using a small windscreen (slightly larger than a lapel mic). Overall, I highly recommend this headset.",

The sound quality is really good for my tastes. They fit comfortably over my ears, and they even cancel out about 60-70% of the noise at my house. Be advised, though, that it does NOT come with a charging cable, as Sony expects you to use the USB cable you probably use to charge your controllers with.

That aside, this is a very good product in my opinion. I play all my games and watch most movies while wearing them. I played L.A. Noire with them and i could hear conversations happening in the street while i was inside the police building. They work, and like some reviews mention, they are not audiophile material but they give awesome results. i Don't regret having purchased them. Nice buy.",

If you love PS3 gaming then you can't go wrong with these. EDIT: I should point out the USB connection on my headset is very sensitive.

Not to mention I got it refurbished for ~$60, best purchase I've made all year in my opinion. Syncs with ps3 with ease, plug and play.

The controls work great and i love how them deigned them to be used. Microphone sound goes through the game amazing as does the sound coming through the ear pieces themselves. A little on the high side for a pair of gaming headphones, but worth it and I would buy them again.",

Good bass, and very comfortable. Voice and game sounds are adjustable as well as overall volume. Tap power and mute button and extendable boom mic are some smooth touches. When the headset is turned on, it automatically mutes the tv. A feature my wife is very fond of. Nice job, Sony",
