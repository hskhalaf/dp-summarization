      "text": "Picked this bad boy to upgrade my Xbox One S storage. This thing is a beast! I play PUBG, NBA 2K18, and Destiny 2. PUBG: Buildings render and weapons spawn before I land - it's a beautiful thing and is my biggest plus with this drive. Loading times were very inconsistent on stock Xbox storage. NBA 2K18 - MyCareer games load MUCH faster. Noticed a slight improvement when loading the Playground from the start menu. Destiny 2 - Player menu (UI) loads a few seconds faster. Load times when traveling to the Tower from Orbit have improved. Overall, I'm very happy. A great (and cheaper) alternative to a spendy Xbox One X upgrade.",

It was only 2 and a 1/2 years old. I installed this drive and loaded windows 10 in about 20 minutes from a usb 3.0 flash drive. It definitely does boot up quicker than a stand rotational drive, but it is not as quick as the SSD in my i5 laptop. Bios times boot are usually around 13-14 seconds. Installing programs you can also see a somewhat notable speed difference. I'll have to see how it handles some heavy audio mixing, video rendering, and gaming.",
