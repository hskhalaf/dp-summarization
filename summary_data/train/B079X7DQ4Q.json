Still, it's lovely phone, finger print sensor is better and faster then S8 & S7 but wish it was on the front. Still getting used to the camera but can't as yet distinguish much difference to it's predecessor ie very good. In reality i should have skipped this generation and waited for the S10?. Anybody not upgrading from a S8 will be blown away and be very pleased.",

After all, if it doesn't last - then no use. Full of bloatware. Common issue with this brand. So many preinstalled apps I didn't ask for and no way to remove. Horrible sound. Super late critical security updates and Android OS upgrades. Mainly due to their customisation. Over saturated colours. List goes on. Pros: Really nice screen and resolution.
