The f/5.6 fixed aperture is fine outdoors and even usable indoors in low light thanks to the excellent Pentax Q in-body image stabilization and decent higher ISO performance. This lens is cheap, fun and surprisingly capable. Go for it!",

I'll let other reviewers go into the technical details, but in my few weeks with this little lens I find that it takes great ultra-wide images and is pretty easy to focus. Just as with most fish-eye lenses, though, you gotta be careful not to scratch the front lens element. I'm loving my little Pentax Q -- it's so easy to travel with!",

To give you a point of reference, my favorite 35mm lens is still the spectacular Pentax 135 1.8 ED; these days it lives on my K20d. On the Q, I have the 01 Prime, 02 short zoom and 06 long zoom, along with the 03 Fisheye. The latter, while slow, is sharp and glorious. And addictive. Bought a second for my daughter; otherwise, I'd never have gotten mine back...",
