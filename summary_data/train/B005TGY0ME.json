And don\u2019t believe the reviews that says it rusts... it\u2019s cast iron people, iron rusts unless you dry it with a towel or cloth. You can not leave anything cast iron to air dry. The proper cleaning method is just water and a sponge. Use kosher salt to scrub. Rinse and towel dry and you will never have a rust issue. But other then that, this is a heavy press and well built. It\u2019s not a griswold so don\u2019t expect the absolute best but a great press nonetheless.",

      "text": "Bought the cuisinart grill press to go along with my cast iron grill pan and it is the perfect match. After doing some research I decided to go with this one mainly because the long spaced out ridges on it, most of them have tiny little squares which I didn't like, I wanted to be as close as my cast iron pan to allow the juices and fat to flow out of the meat. The Couisinart is very nicely made cast iron press, it's perfect. It has the perfect weight and size.",
