Despite that, the fleece is somewhat soft, but the overall quality is not good. If one of my cats hadn't already claimed it as her own (she's a cloth-sucker, and loves anything remotely fuzzy/furry), I'd return it.

It\u2019s easy to wash as long as you follow the instructions (by itself, hand wash cycle, and cold water) It keeps me warm at night in South Florida where the coldest temperature is 58 at night so if you live anywhere colder you\u2019re going to need a thicker blanket than this one. I\u2019m 26 years old and I treat this blanket like I\u2019m 5 carrying it around all over the house. It looks just like the photo and came in perfect condition. I\u2019m beyond happy!",

Also, I see that the description states that it's reversible; I haven't tried that and I don't think I would since the fleece is so comfy.
