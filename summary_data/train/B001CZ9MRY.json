Sometimes nothing comes out at all. Given its inconsistent performance, I wouldn't rely on it. Since the attacker will likely just laugh at you, I suggest that the manufacturer make a little scroll with the word \"Boo\" come out of the nozzle. That way, by causing enough laughter, you might get away and not even have to clean pepper spray off your hand.",

I've been sprayed with at least 4 or 5 types of mace in my life and this one is by far the worst. My eyes was runnin' and I felt like I couldn't breathe.
