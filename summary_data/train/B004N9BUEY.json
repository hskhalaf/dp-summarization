      "text": "If you buy this rack to install in your garage, you may want to skip the instructions with regard to the holes to drill and change the length of the screws. For example, you obviously don't drill 3/8 in holes for 5/16 in screws. However, that is what the instructions state. Further, most drywall in garages in 5/8 in. Therefore, the enclosed 2 in 5/16 in screws will not have the length properly engage the stud. You need 5/16 in 2.5 inch screws. With these changes and similar changes to the screws for the lower tire rest, the rack is great. So the one star is for the instructions and the hardware.",

Installation was simple and I am using them to hold a fairly heavy E-Bike along with a couple standard road bikes. Because they swivel, you can install them at 16\" centers and will have plenty of room for each bike. One note - the instructions call for 10mm and 8mm drill bits to install the lag bolts. This is incorrect. Take a close look at the bolts that come with your rack and make sure you choose the correct drill bit size. In my case, using the sizes specified in the instructions would have been too big.",

      "text": "Very clever engineering that results in extra walking space in your garage. Only funky thing -- and this is so minor that I chose not to deduct any stars -- is that you can't use the bottom tire cleat when you pivot the bike to one side or another. They recommend you place the tire to the side of the cleat before pivoting. Well, if you do that, you're going to leave tire marks on the wall. So I had my guy install 6\" x 10\" aluminum plates BEHIND the cleat as you see in photo. And that took care of that. (I'm guessing the manufacturer will pick up on this and start adding their own backing plates.)",

I looked into ones that hold the bike horizontally flat against the wall, but that took up a lot of usable wall space. I also considered the fixed vertical holders, but the bike simply stuck out way too far. This holder is great because it lets you maximize the vertical space which would typically be wasted in a horizontal mount, but the folding action lets you keep it from awkwardly sticking out. On top of this, is really solidly made and was super easy to install. I put it in cinderblock in less than 10 minutes.",

When your bike sits on the rack for the first time the rack opens more than by hand and our bikes sat on the floor. We raised them up a couple inches and then they were perfect)",
