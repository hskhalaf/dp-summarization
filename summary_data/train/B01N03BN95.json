      "text": "I never played any of this series, my Grandson was playing it and recommended this edition so I bought the download from Amazon. I like this game very much. I do save my game (And often, which is always a good idea) and get advice sometimes on line and luckily there is plenty of it out there. This Special Edition is massive and immersive and the graphics are fantastic ( I think the graphics is why this is called Special Edition). There is so much to see and a lot of quests. All I can say is I'm enjoying it! Oh yeah, and my Grandson tipped me off to the best Mods!",

It is an open world RPG with loads of options for gameplay and combat style. The world is massive, and the included DLCs are all great expansions including new locations, characters, and quests. It reminds me of an MMO minus the people and the ghastly load times. This is a must have for every gamer.",

Just another game company doing a money grab by re-releasing a game with a few quick upgrades but no real game improvements. If you buy this game you better have a duel monitor setup so you can have the game on one monitor and a help site on the other monitor because you will need the programing codes to enter into the console so you can get quests to clear. If entering special codes into a game constantly to get it to advance is not your thing then avoid this game.",
