I will definitely buy this again if need be!! Last night I dropped my phone on the pavement and not a scratch on it. I was so sure my screen was gonna be cracked.... IT WAS NOT!! Definitely a decent case for the price!!",

So far that has not been an issue for me. My previous case was the Lifeproof Next case which was great but had its downfalls. The protection was awesome but the rubber lining on the outer edges started coming off and it collected dust inside the case on the back of my iPhone. I looked at other protective cases and they are all too bulky so I opted for something lighter. This case does the job and for a great price too.",

The difference is the back of her case is rigid and the back of this case is flexible. I don\u2019t know how that wi compare over time and if it offers the same amount of protection but so far I love the case. It has the 4 raised bumpers on the corners and is easy to pull on/off",

Thankfully, I've never had to test how well it holds up to drops, but the corners seem very sturdy and seem like they would hold up. It fits my iPhone 7+ perfectly and is raised up so that the camera doesn't sit directly on surfaces. My only complaint would be that it scratches somewhat easily. Overall, it's a great case and I would recommend it if you're looking for a simple, clear case to show off your beautiful iPhone.",

This case slips right onto the iphone 8 plus and grips nicely. The case itself has a bit of grip to it, but not so much that it sticks to your pocket as you put your phone in. It doesn't impede the volume buttons in any way. For the price, I got just what I hoped, and a little more!",
