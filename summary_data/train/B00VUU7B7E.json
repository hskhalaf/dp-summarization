Also, make sure you download the manual from the Mackie web site so that you can use the mixer to its fullest potential - what comes in the packaging is lacking.",

    "description": "Size:12-channel| Configuration:MixerThe Mackie ProFX12v2 12-channel USB mixer means you can stop sacrificing sound quality for portability at your smaller band and solo acoustic gigs. You get six of Mackie's Vita preamps for your mic, guitar, keyboard, or anything else you need for your show. After you've plugged in, tap into the powerful ReadyFX effects engine to add excitement to your mix. Show your audience you care by giving them the best sound you can with the Mackie ProFX12v2 USB mixer. Like the name says, the ProFX12v2 is a professional mixer, with convenient features and sound that rival some larger format mixers. Mackie designed the Vita preamps with live sound in mind to provide the quality of sound that is lacking in some compact mixers. Each channel features its own individual 3-band EQ and 100Hz low-cut filter for shaping the sound of your inputs. The ReadyFX digital effects engine gives you access to 16 different effects including reverbs and delays - Mackie even added chorus effects for your guitar. A 7-band graphic EQ can be assigned either to your main outputs so you can fine tune the PA, or to the aux output to easily get rid of feedback in your monitors. If you perform with backing tracks, there are inputs (including USB) for your laptop or MP3 player, a headphone output with individual level control, and even phantom power for your condenser mics. With the added convenience of a hi-Z input for direct instrument input, you have no reason NOT to own a ProFX12v2. The ProFX12v2 is exactly what you need for mixing when the gig calls for minimal inputs, but that's not where its usefulness ends. Since you'll be mixing from the stage, keep the ProFX12v2 right next to you, and you can use the headphone output with a set of in-ear monitors for your performance and just leave your floor monitors at home. Drummers can use it for monitoring, too - take the aux mix from the front of house board that would have gone to your wedges and plug it in to a channel on the ProFX12v2.",
