Well for some reason I decided I would try this Tripp Light 1300VA battery backup for my big screen TV... I had only used for around 9 months and yesterday I noticed it had started making this humming noise, It wasn't very loud at first but now it is much louder and actually overtakes the sound from my TV. I have reached out to the Customer Service department at Tripp Lite to see what they are willing to do about this problem. I will post their reply once I hear back from them.",

Originally purchased it for a house with bad wiring so that when the AC kicked on there was a sag in my room which would shut my computer down. My current dwelling does not have this problem so its just been for peace of mind mostly. However after 3 years this thing is making a relatively loud buzzing. I considered the fact that the batteries could be dead or on their way out so essentially it is always charging them but after getting replacements it still buzzes. I am replacing it with a power strip because I honestly can't stand to hear that constant buzz.",

I asked my IT contact about this, and he said it's common knowlegde amongst himself and his peers that this software is junk, and always has been. Wonderful. Wish I knew that before. Tech support at Tripp-Lite is useless as well. No solutions for these software failures, tries the usual \"must be something in Windows\" crap.

Now within 4 days of one another, both of them failed. Battery shows full charge but when voltage drops below 120 volts, one of them shuts down. the other one never takes over load, it just turns on and off as voltage goes above and below 120. I live in a rural area and the voltage fluctuates from 112 to 124. Bottom line is I'm going back to cyber power. I have one of those that's 3 years old and still works great.",

      "text": "So far this has been a great ups. The price for what you get was outstanding. My gaming pc has a 1000 watt power supply so I needed to get a UPS of this caliber. It was easy to set up and I like the informational lcd screen as I can now see how much load my pc is pulling. During normal windows activity im at 122 watts but during gaming Im at about 600 watts. What prompted me to buy this is that my apartment complex seems to have frequent outages especially during the summer and I dont want to risk my over 2000$ pc being damaged. Seems like money well spent to me for the peace of mind",

When the battery kicks in, a fan turns on and you can very much hear it, but that doesn't matter to me since if I need to use battery power fan noise is the least of my worries.",

      "text": "This is a replacement for a Tripp-Lite Smart1500XL. According to the specs, this unit's output is 900 watts. So far, it has performed as good as my old Tripp-Lite. The digital readout is a cool feature. I am currently running two towers, 5 monitors, speakers, and a digitizing tablet. The current load is at \u00b1300watts. I tested the time it took before completely shutting down, and it was around 30 minutes.",

      "text": "Tripp Lite was highly recommended to us all by Jerry Pournelle, the ex-BYTE columnist in various articles. I took him at his word this time around, and am not disappointed (yet, anyway). Unit is doing just fine at this point with multiple PC's and external drives (though not all up at the same time). Too much plastic in the case for my taste, but not surprising. Otherwise appears sturdy, has nice 'telemetry' (front panel Voltage and other info displayed), and stays a fairly steady 122V output so far. Recommended",

I really wish there was better support/drivers for us with remote shutdowns or controlling equipment state during power outage. Other then the above this is a solid stable unit.",

I was then able to calibrate my generator frequency and solved the problem.",

In a way with a power or UPS product the wrong manual (SMX15000LCDT) could be a bit scary at best, and deadly dangerous at worst. I actually read the manual (it is VERY similar), but things in that manual didn't make sense. Such as setting the input voltage range..........first clue - wide is \"170V-280V\", whereas on the 1500LCDT, voltage is not setable! So easy enough to download, print and staple the correct manual. All seems well and unit is bone simple to use.",
