In my case I have two different flash light from Milwaukee, both use the same batteries, and I have another charging capsule. So One battery is charging while I work. When the flashlight runs out I gust flip the battery with the capsule, and keep on going. Good job Milwaukee.",

The batteries for these lights are inadequate, as they start flashing (an indication that the battery is weak) after only a few minutes of run time. As a professional, run time is paramount. The spot/flood telescoping feature sticks, and does not stay put either. If you buy this light, lower your expectations, as it is not the typical Milwaukee product.",

The only way to get the focus to stay is if you unscrew the battery compartment, which defies the purpose of it being dust or waterproof. And even after that, the spot light is absolutely crap. Not a spot light at all!",
