Some of the plastic is still stuck under the button as well. Also, there are few pockets in this thing. The puter compartment has none, and the big zippered portion has 3--two open pockets, cell phone sized on one side, and a small zippered pocket on the other, just big enough to fit a few pens. The bag itself is a nice size and versatile, but I'm a pocket fan and was disappointed.",

After receiving it I do wonder how long it will last but for now it's good. It works great for carrying an IPad, cell phone and chargers with IDs, and whatever else women shove in their bags, while going to the Gym or a coffee shop, the beach, whatever. It's not very expensive so you don't have to worry about it being a thief magnet and it accomplishes the job. Good purchase.",

I use the larger one for my wallet, my checkbook, any medications I need to carry with me. My mother is in love with this bag.. She keeps threatening she's going to steal it. Santa may be bringing her one!!",

You can totally see the glue around each buttom which makes it look a little cruddy. My other issue is the way it closes. So the flap part that folds over is too long. So when you clasp the buttons, there is extra fabric that bubbles at the top. Maybe that's why it doesn't sit well. I still cant decide if its worth keeping.",

Plenty of space to carry lots of stuff but doesn't look awkward! It's made of durable canvas and the stitching on mine is super strong. I would recommend this bag to anyone!",
