We chose a dark blue color to increase sun absorption then we purchased one of these kits and turned off the gas heater. We were happy with the increase of degrees. Pool temp range was in the mid eighties and low 90s during this year\u2019s hot summer. We will probably add another kit next year to extend the season.",

      "text": "Well, my old solar panels sprung leaks, and could not be plugged. I tried to order similar size and brand, but they all have been replaced with these smaller size units. They may be easier to handle, but they are much smaller and you need more space to get the same surface area. I'm trying out various configurations to get better heat out of just 2 units, by enclosing the units in an insulated greenhouse type box. I'll let you know how it works.",
