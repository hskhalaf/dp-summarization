The item description said \u201cfrustration free.\u201d Nope.. also, these handles have the yellowy hue to them, so it won\u2019t match your stainless stuff exactly. I wish these manufacturers would get together and decide what brushed nickel is supposed to look like. They were banged up a little. Just careless handling by the manufacturer I guess.

I bought these to go on a custom cherry 6' double vanity and I bought the 4\" thinking they would easier to operate with more room to grab but I was worried they would be too large. They weren't overly large at all and really made the cabinet look nice. The finish isn't as rustic as I thought it might be but they still look amazing.",

I ended up ordering roughly 12 different bar style pulls from Amazon to compare them in hand. I chose these as the quality was unmatched. The finish and weight was more consistant throughout than its competitors. Had no issues with the threading of screws, did buy 1 1/2\" screws for the drawers. The top of my cabinets have a slight curve as do my appliances so these tied in very well. Will be ordering from Franklin Bass for my next project.",
