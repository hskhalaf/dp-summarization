They are lower to the counter, so a nice compact piece.",

I am a cabinetmaker so probably could have filed the handles down to fit but I thought if they can't even get a basic handle system right what else did they mess up. Skillet is big and looks great but can't do much with it without a way to pick it up. So very disappointed . returning it tomorrow.",

Where Presto needs to improve however is their thermal protection. The handles get hot during use and need to be used carefully if you are draining grease out (after frying bacon for instance). In addition the heating control gets very hot during use. Better thermal protection would allow me to make this a five star rating.",
