So I went with this one. I must say the pictures don't do it justice! It's even cuter in person! It's a brighter pink. Light weight and is easy to get in and out of the base. It's actually got some cushion to it. Unlike the one I had for my son 3 years ago. My baby girl isn't here yet, but can't wait to put her in it!!",

I am seriously disappointed.",

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and this will be used on occasion for my granddaughters so won't get put to the test really.",

The only thing I would say surprised me is that the buckle to the 5 point harness was a little different than the more commonly used buckles, but is self explanatory and still totally worth the buy. I saw another comment that said it would need to be put together, mine was completely put together in the box when I got it, just so everyone is informed. Love this carseat. Would definitely recommend.",

It also keeps coming apart from the inside of the cover (hood) and you have to keep pulling the two plastic pieces out and putting them back together. It's such a pain!!! I bought this way too early and now can't return it. We HATE this carrier and can't use the hood. I do not recommend this seat!!!!",
