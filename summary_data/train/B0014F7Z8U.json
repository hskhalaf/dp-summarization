      "title": "Review of Panasonic DMR-EA18K DVD recorder",
      "text": "I was looking for an easily programmable fairly basic DVD recorder with upconverting capability to use with network programming primarily. My last recorder (Sony) was very complicated to operate and never functioned properly from the get-go. I haven't used this recorder much to date but it's very easy to program, handles formatting, recording and playback very well providing good to excellent video and audio. I would note that I don't see much improvement using an HDMI cable and upconversion over standard recorded material but since this is my first converting recorder I don't have much to judge it against. All in all, it does its job very well and I would buy another from Panasonic.",

      "text": "A very good DVD recorder -- unfortunately Panasonic - Technics - (parent company - Matshuta) is slowly discontinuing home DVD recorder production. The DMR-EA18K offers an unusual clear picture quality especially in the 4 hour record mode -- yet sadly, it offers no eject option of DVD/CD on the remote control as does my other two Panasonic units. Thus I use my older remotes and they eject or load DVDs with ease. Otherwise, a very good model, however, appeared to be better built previously in Japan as it is now built in China. .",

And indeed, once I got used to its interface I forgave it. ;) However, after about two months of operation, it wouldn't come on again and has resisted all efforts to recover. I tried all the suggested recovery methods in the owners manual without result. After reading a few of the reviews where the unit quit working and seeing how little help they got for all of their efforts, I have decided to simply throw the unit in the trash and replace it with something that does not have 'Panasonic' on the box.",

But if you copy the pics to a USB flash drive and display the pics from there, it will be ok. May be my CDs cannot be read at high speed? - Slow turning on. Even if I set it to quick start it is a little faster but still annoyingly slow getting in ready mode when turned on.",

My one criticism is I do not like the look of the IR transmitter that has to be placed in front of the cable box to allow the unit to control the cable box. Everything else is great.",

One thing I noticed that is strangely unwieldy is how you title a program. My old recorder simply displayed the alphabet across the screen and you moved up/down and left/right to select each letter. This one is much more complicated and time-consuming. But it does a good job of editing, which was one of the features I was looking for. Like all recorders, it is particular about the brand of DVD disc you use, so be sure you consult the manual before buying discs.",

Sadly, the upscaling quality is quite poor - it bears significant artifacts, in particular vertical banding on primary colors such as red or green. Also, it seemed to crash more often than I'd like, and wouldn't always handshake correctly over HDMI. As such I returned it, and instead purchased a Sony VX535 from Costco for 199 - the Sony has substantially better upscaling quality, easier to use menus, and is an overall better product. The panasonic menus are cumbersome and not well laid out. Overall a very disappointing product. A",

    "title": "Panasonic DMR-EA18K Tunerless 1080p Upconverting DVD Recorder",
    "description": "Style:DMR-EA18KThe Panasonic DMR-EA18K DVD recorder is equipped with an SD Memory Card slot and USB terminal, which makes it easy to view photos from your digital camera. By interpolating video data using proprietary algorithms, SD format data is up-converted to 1080x1920p HD format video data. This conversion increases the richness of the original data by almost six-fold, producing the highest possible image quality when viewing content on a large-screen HDTV. Just slip the SD card into the slot or use the cable to connect the camera to the USB terminal, and you're ready to enjoy a spectacular big-screen slideshow with family and friends. You can even listen to music recorded onto a USB device while viewing your photos. Connect your Panasonic DVD recorder to a flat-panel HDTV via an HDMI cable and the TV channel setting information is automatically downloaded to the recorder. Once the Auto Preset Download is complete, the DVD recorder will keep whichever TV channel you're watching as its receiving channel. This means you can record the program you're watching by just pressing the Record button on the VIERA remote. With VIERALink, you don't have to worry about setting the recorder to the right channel every time you want to record something. Frequently used buttons, such as Power and Open/Close, are located at the top of the main unit (this makes them easier to see when the unit is placed in a rack, where you need to look down when operating it). SD Image File Format - JPEG conforming DCF Image File Number of Pixels - 34 x 34 to 6,144 x 4096 Inputs and Outputs - 2x LINE (pin jack) Analog Audio (2 Ch) Input, 2x Line (pin jack) Video In, DV Input Terminal, 2x S Connector S-Video In, Built-in SD Card Slot, 1x LINE (pin jack) 2ch Audio Out, Component Video Out (Y, PB, PR), and 1x S Connector S-Video Outputs Dimensions - Height 2-3/8 x Width 16-15/16 x Depth 9-13/16 Weight - 6.16 pounds",
