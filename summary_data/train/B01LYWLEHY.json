A little google search and I found them in PDF format. It is pretty straight forward though to hook up. The only part you really need instructions for is the wifi hook up. BTW it will ONLY run on 2.4 ghz. It will not connect to your home wifi if you are running 5 GHZ. Also I found when setting up I had to turn off my cellular data connection to get the wifi to work on the controller. Also there is no back light on the display.It's 2017 right? Over all its ok.",

Even used same mounting screws as old one. Connected to Wi-Fi no problem, added a few details about our location and was up and running in under 30 minutes. Hint: set the time and schedule for the hottest/dryest month and activate the automatic adjust feature for weather and seasons. We live in Vegas so no problem setting up in July for hottest/dryest. The controller takes over and no problems. Will send all kinds of messages including completion of cycles, errors, schedule changes etc.",

After a reinstall it seems like it is working, but later you invariably get a communication error message which requires a reinstall. My router is within 30 feet of the box and the wifi signal at the box is strong. I think the plug in module must be bad. In any event I am ready to return the product for a refund.",

Would not recommend this timer BECAUSE of the bad customer service. I still believe ST8-WIFI is a nice product WHEN it works. They were not interested to fix the problem.",

I did not give it five stars because Rain Bird advertises that the controller can be managed from \"mobile devices\" when the truth is the \"mobile devices\" are just two different flavors of smartphones. This is a pet peeve of mine: \"mobile devices\" includes smartphones, but also tablets, iPads, and even laptops. If you don't have apps for all mobile devices, don't advertise that you do. Just say works with Apple and Android phones.",

    "description": "Size:Obsolete Old Model Indoor 8-StationRain Bird ST8I-WIFI Smart Indoor WiFi Sprinkler/Irrigation System Timer/Controller, WaterSense Certified, 8-Zone/Station. The Rain Bird Smart Irrigation WiFi Timer places control of your sprinkler system in the palm of your hand while saving time, water, and money. EPA WaterSense certified to provide at least a 20% water-savings over non-certified timers. The Rain Bird app allows control of multiple timers located anywhere in the world; install app on multiple devices, or securely share control with family members and landscapers. Compatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple iOS 8 or greater, and Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later. Connect to timer programming functions via: mobile device through a WiFi network, even away from home; directly from mobile device when in range; or through timer\u2019s front control panel. It\u2019s simple to customize watering schedules which can be automatically adjusted all year. Each watering zone may be set with a different name, picture, frequency, start time, and run time to ensure healthy plants and a lower water bill. Automatic Seasonal Adjust feature will adjust daily watering schedule based on season, local weather, temperature, and humidity. This data automatically downloads for your specific ZIP Code and is calculated every night. Each zone is customizable for Watering Days, Start Times and Run Time: allowing watering on custom days of week, odd or even calendar days, or cyclic (every 1-14 days), 6 Start Times per zone, and Run Times from 0-199 minutes. All timer settings are stored indefinitely in memory; no need to re-program in case of power outage. Enabling Notifications in the Rain Bird app keeps you informed of what\u2019s happening in your yard even when you\u2019re away from home. Know when someone enables a watering delay; Automatic Seasonal Adjust is applied; date or time is incorrect; timer disconnects from WiFi network; valve malfunctions; or of a possible freeze. Watering Delay feature allows you to suspend watering for 1 to 14 days; normal programming resumes automatically once selected delay has ended. Connects to a master valve or pump start relay and supports a wired Rain Sensor to automatically turn timer off when it rains (rain sensor model CPRSDBEX sold separately). Compatible with most 24 VAC irrigation valves. Sealed case protects from moisture, insects and grime; timer designed for use in a weather resistant location like a garage or waterproof shed. Includes transformer with 6\u2019 cord, mounting hardware, and installation guide.
