      "text": "I was very skeptical, but it was a positive surprise! The suit is a little bit sticky rubbery inside (Riffe has the silver reflective surface that is pretty slippery), so don't try to put it on dry. I think getting waxed might feel like it! However you just get yourself wet and it just slides up easy. It is very comfortable (I am 6'2\" and 230lbs - XXXL) and I seen a huge improvement with Calicos, I can sneak up on them easy. All over it is a great suit for the price.",

Make sure to lube the suit up before putting it on each time. The 5mm is also very buoyant, so you'll need at least 8-9 lbs on your weight belt. I read that you should order a size up... I'm 5'10\" 165 lbs and got the Large. Fits great.",

I'm 5'8\" 165 lbs and a large usually has plenty of room but this one is a bit tight. It is warm but not quite as warm as the other spearfishing suit I bought. I dive every day for work so I buy a new suit every year.",

It\u2019s really tight at first and difficult to get on (definitely wet it down) but I think after a few uses it will loosen up and fit nicely. I\u2019m quite muscular so if you\u2019re any bigger than I am I\u2019d definitely recommend that you order a size up I haven\u2019t dived with it yet but the material and feel of the suit is surprisingly nice for the cost.
