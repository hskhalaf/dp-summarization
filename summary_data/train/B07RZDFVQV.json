I tried cooking chicken with this Mealthy lid in my Instant Pot for 15 mins at 400F. The results were horrible! Chicken was not cooked inside. In my Air Fryer the chicken would have been crispy and done by then. Beware, this Mealthy lid is not a real Air Fryer and does not produce the same results as real Air Fryers do. In my, opinion people would be better off buying a small Air Fryer for the same price as this Mealthy lid.",

This lid will turn your instant pot into an air fryer. And one of the best parts is that the it can go up to 500 degrees! Most air fryers can't because it's made of plastic. But with your steel pot from the instant pot, you don't have to worry about any plastic melting. Having it go up that high is perfect for crispy pork belly and other delicious things that you want GBD (Golden, Brown, and Delicious!)",

Works great for browning a whole chicken or other large cuts of meat to get those tasty crunchy bits you don't get when pressure cooking.
