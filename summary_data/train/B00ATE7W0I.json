      "text": "The only good reason to consider this camera if you already carry a cell phone with a half-way decent camera is for the XS1's 5X zoom lens. A high-end 2018 iPhone or Android phone's camera will produce better quality photos, especially at low light levels. Since this camera was already out of production when I purchased mine in December 2015, the non-removable battery will be suspect. Mine bleeds away its charge in a month or two on the shelf.",

Camera performs okay, it's not the greatest but not surprising as it is all crammed in such a small package. Overall great for parties and anywhere where you want to be able to stuff a camera in your pocket and not worrying about it. Better than my phone camera, but not as good as a full-size compact camera.",

The great advantage with this camera is that it will truly fit into your pocket comfortably (even with fairly tight pants on), it has a nice alloy build, it looks great, and it takes reasonably good pictures. For what it is (you wouldn't expect DSLR quality images from this camera), it is a steal.",
