      "text": "Bought these as they were the highest recommended wireless gaming headset on the market, unfortunately, the SteelSeries software wouldn't work with the headset and just caused errors when trying to do so. I contacted SteelSeries support about this but they were unable to resolve the issue and advised buying a set directly from them (don't do it!!) I went ahead and bought a second set from SS but unfortunately these also wouldn't work and I got the luxury of paying to return them (\u00a330 with insurance as they don't have a location in the UK). This will be my first and last SteelSeries purchase.",

They are super comfortable and the battery charge/swap system is great. I use a Blue Turtle mic so I can't talk about the chat quality from these but the audio is great. I really like the way that you can mix the chat / game sounds. I'm using this with PC and PS4 Pro and have had no problems apart from the cut out.",

      "text": "To summarise: Pros: + Great headset for gamers on a budget + Comfortable (after initial break in - demonstrated in video) + Great overall sound stage + Designed with gaming in mind + High quality mic + Same build ass the other Arctis lineup + Price Cons: - Could do with deeper Bass - Requires propitiatory cable to connect (included) - Takes a while to 'break in' to your head shape (well it did in my case) That's it for my brief review - will update if any issues occur in the meantime. Will definitely recommend the Arctis 3",

Used mainly with phone (Huawei Mate 20 Pro). I am getting constant reconnects and beeps from the headset. After about 20 mins all audio is lost. The phone continues playing music but I get nothin. I have to turn the headset off and back on and reconnect the dongle to the phone (neither action alone fixes the issue). My wired usb c earphones work flawlessly. Haven't tried more than 5 mins with the switch. Can't speak about the mic, as I never tried it. Pity as they are excellent when they work.",

The build is solid you don't get the metal hinges and yoke like with Pros but I wouldn't say it's a bad thing given it's less weight. Sound quality of both the Pro and Actis 7 are fantastic. Both have quite a flat frequency curve which enables them to reproduce fantastic audio quality. The Pros NEED some EQ love but the 7s are good straight out of the box. Overall if you don't need bluetooth and don't really need changeable batteries then the Arctis 7 is THE headset for you.",

The software steel series engine is great and easy to use and i have had no trouble with it so far. Some minor things come to mind when i think of other people wearing this, is the size. If you have a very large head i could see you having some trouble as the headset does not have adjustable sides like most, instead there is this tension strap that can be adjusted slightly for different user\u2019s although not as much as a sliding sides are able to. Perfect for my needs and i would recommend to anyone.",

I really like them is the long and short of it. The sound quality is really good in comparison to the 35 pound wired pair I was using before (not a major brand). According to my friends, the mic quality is infinitely better and improves their experience when gaming with me. Set up was super easy and they also work on my galaxy s20 ultra and will, I guess, with any USB C device. For 80 pounds, I'm really chuffed and would happily recommend.",

However, I found the cloth strap (underneath the hard plastic connector between ears), to be annoying. The ear cups felt really tight and I wear eyeglasses, so that was uncomfortable. In the end I had to return these because the microphone mute/unmute button stopped working. It worked great at first, then started only working intermittently. For a set of headphones at this price, the quality should be extremely high and these should least for years. The switch that controlled the mute button obviously gave out well before its intended wear-out date.",

After several emails back and forth with their technical support, they have advised that it may or may not work with docking stations and there's nothing they can do about it. I bought this mostly because my previous headset was getting worn out and u wanted to upgrade to a better one. Unfortunately I've had to go back to the worn out cheaper headset which at least works with the docking station. My advice is to stay away from this headset if you plan to use it with any kind of docking station, which is a shame as the audio quality isn't terrible.",

They are light and comfortable, and have a good quality microphone that is detachable. The thing I love the most, though, is the two batteries which means you can instantly swap them around (takes about 10 seconds). Just remember to turn Sidetone down or off in the hub settings if you don't like hearing yourself or your surroundings. The only downside is that they have a tendency to slip off if you have shiny hair like me and move too quickly.",

Very easy to set up and use, the firmware updated immediately and then I played destiny 2 whilst listening to some drum and bass and they are AMAZING! every note is crisp and down low the bass was excellent with no distortion.

      "text": "At first, I was disappointed with the sound quality and the headset having no bass like a lot of other reviews point out. However after replacing the ear cups with zmf sheepskin ones I love this headset and there is plenty of bass now too. If anyone else has this problem I'd recommend changing earcups. Brainwavz I'd more affordable than the ones I got and not as thick. Also this headset is very very comfortable for long periods of time. Just a little bit annoying you have to buy different ear cups when the headset is so expensive already.",

The sound quality is very good, and the pc software lets you tweak the equalisers and mic settings etc. The cloth cups are not as nice as leather, but are comfortable none the less. They connect to the pc wirelessly pretty much instantly and I have yet to experience any disconnections or drops. They fall down a little when using on the Xbox, and they must be plugged into the controller and the chatmix dial will not function. Microphone is okay quality, however you have to talk a bit louder to get them to register than other headsets i\u2019ve tried.",

One small thing on my headset is that the right adjustment makes that adjustment click when you extend the headphone band and the left one doesn't but it still works exactly the same.",

As I wasn\u2019t desperate for a microphone, I ended up returning for a more music - orientated set of headphones.

The microphone is acceptable, maybe not as amazing as claimed, but I like the fact it retracts into the headset so it stays out of the way, and it avoids a hinge mechanism which is likely to fail after a few years of use (or a few weeks, in the case of my old Logitech headset). You can definitely find better sounding headphones for the price, but they won't be wireless - you're paying a premium for that feature. For gaming, these are perfectly fine.",

The Gamedac included in this product requires your headset to be attached directly to it, and in turn attached directly to the console, which means that you can only be a few feet away from the console at most. This is pointless for a PS4, as a console is attached to a TV which is almost always across the other side of the room from the user. No-one wants to be sat with their nose pressed to the screen and physically tethered to their machine.",
