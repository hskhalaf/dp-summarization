The new device works well. Be careful when installing the batteries though and ignore the instructions. Negative sides touch all 4 of the springs as you would expect. The instructions caused confusion. The customer service was great though and overall I'm happy. Original review. If you install the batterys the way the instructions show, it shorts them out and causes the contacts to overheat. This device is dangerous. I will be returning mine after burning my hand on the battery cover with the device off.",

The cold smoke immediately poured out of the tube as I filled the dome of a glass bowl, covering 4 nice tenderloins. I let them sit for 1/2 hour before grilling, and enjoyed a great smoked flavor, with this handy tool. I would take this camping, over to friends...any time I want that smoked goodness. Its a snap, with its own black bag.",

Old Review: It might be a one off, but the first time I used it the device overheated. All I was doing was smoking cheddar cheese for about a minute. Judging from the burnt plastic smell, the fan inside must have melted.",

I\u2019m so happy I did! It takes just a few small chips to get a lot of smoke! Usually 10 seconds or so is all I need. The smoker is very well built, and while I thought the bag it comes with was gimmicky, it\u2019s actually a really nice touch. I can unbag the smoker, pack it with wood, light it, and smoke what I need in under a minute. It takes about a minute to cool down and then back it goes in the bag. I\u2019d definitely recommend this smoker!",

Will be returning and purchasing the brevile/polyscience I wanted to begin with.",
