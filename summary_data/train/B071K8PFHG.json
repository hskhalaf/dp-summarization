At the slightest lip tingling sensation or lip swelling you start to feel, use this. Majority of the time, if I can use this treatment early enough, I can avoid having a cold sore all together. Otherwise, using this cold sore will tremendously decrease the length of your healing time by about half. No joke, any person who gets cold sores should legit get some always on hand. It\u2019s expensive but a tiny little goes a very long ways! Very highly recommended!",
