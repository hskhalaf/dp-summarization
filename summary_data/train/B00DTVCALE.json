The shower gels foams beautifully, rinses clean, and is lightly scented but fragranced enough that you can smell it lightly on your skin after your shower. I wish L'Occitane could capture this *exact* fragrance in the lotion versions of Verbena (which are lovely, but not quite the same) but the whole collection is still perfection.",

But it's really runny. Not gel like as you would think of most shower gels or washes. And I'm pretty sure this one is making me break out. The container is also a lot smaller then I was expecting. It's more like a $10 bottle size like from bath and body works. Definitely not $20. And since its more runny you go through it faster.",
