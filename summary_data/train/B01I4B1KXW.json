They fit my price range and I saw that the reviews were good. I've installed this sort of wall lamp before (I used the plug-in option, not the hard wired option), so I knew it'd be easy. Lamps arrived, packaged well, with all of the needed hardware and everything in working order. There is one dent in one lamp's hinge, but you can't see it and it didn't impede the works of the arm, so I didn't care. Easy to install, and worked perfectly. I purchased 3-way LED bulbs, and good to go. Happy customer.",

Make sure you move the arms back & forth a few times before you mount these to make sure they are easy to adjust. They're a little tight right out of the box probably designed that way to avoid loose joints and sagging which is common in these types of lamps. Total taste! 5 star hotel quality.",

I've installed them above both sides of my bed and they immediately gave my master bedroom a quality look. Important! follow the directions: swing the arms back and forth several times to loosen them up because they are quite stiff out of the package, so glad I did. The adjustable arms swing smoothly and the lamps are very sturdy. Great for my nightly reads - which I've switched to instead of TV - sleep has improved greatly.",

We wanted black swing-arm, plug-in wall lamps for the guest bedroom that didn't take up floor space, and so guests could escape our presence and read quietly in bed. We wanted columnar white shades. These come with the typical flared shades, in a light brown color. So, disappointed we didn't have a choice of shades, we bought the white shades separately, and will give away the brown(ish) shades. They installed pretty easily - an electric drill helps.",
