It performed perfectly after being used on Dunn\u2019s River Falls in Jamaica and snorkeling underwater in a few other countries. People who bought other brands were disappointed when their items got wet and the containers leaked. This one scores a 100 percent thumbs up for me, so stop your searching and buy this product.",

I didn't notice it popping out but I did notice a bright yellow box floating about 10 feet from me and knew right away it was my electronic ignition car key. Needless to say the bright yellow color was chosen so it would be easy to spot - it was, and it definitely floats. I should have used the lanyard that came with it to tie it inside my PFD pouch. Now I know.",

It's small, but large enough to hold a credit card and a few bills for tip money. And waterproof, so we feel safer taking it on beach excursions.
