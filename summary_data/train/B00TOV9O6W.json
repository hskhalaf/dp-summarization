This is one of those rare products that nails it, and could not possibly be improved. I can't recommend this highly enough for men looking for a lightly scented, superior after-shave balm.

      "text": "I have been using this for about 2 weeks. The smell is very faint, unfortunately, and it only occasionally smells like a hint of sandalwood. If you are looking for a strong scent, I would highly recommend getting a sandalwood cologne. That being said, I really like the product. It doesn't feel greasy and a little goes a long way. The smell is light and subtle (wish it was a little more) but the relief is great. My only gripes would be that the pump often spits out a lot more than you want or need and the scent is a bit misleading, otherwise you are getting a solid product.",

Second, the sandalwood scent is quite pleasant. I don't think it lasts all day, but it does for a little while after applying it. Third, and this is most important, the balm conditions the face all day long. It keeps the face soft and smooth. Fourth, every ingredient is all natural, so you know you're not putting some harmful chemicals or synthetic ingredients on your skin, which ultimately absorb into the body.",

I frequently shave my face and entire head, and find myself constantly running low! I understand the business aspect of things, but from a consumer perspective, is there any way to access an increased quantity? Say maybe a 4 fl oz container or larger? I enjoy and use the product so frequent, that I am willing to buy a larger supply! Keep up the outstanding work!",

The spray mechanism is also not smooth at all, it splashes on my vanity a few times. I would save some money and go back to buying regular $2 dollar gillette aftershaves.",
