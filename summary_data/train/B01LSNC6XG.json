Very soft silicone easy to squeeze, 3 oz perfect for airline travel, suction cup is wonderful. just stick them to the wall in shower perfect. then to top it off they have pre made labels in cap that you can change to whatever you put in them. Last, the cap is flip top so no need to unscrew anything and it has a spilt seal in the cap so when you flip open the cap you don't have product running out. They could not have designed it better, I have to buy more as my wife, Daughter and Myself just loved these after our 4 day trip to Vegas.",

These suction cups are strong and I just smack the bottle onto the wall, and, bam, wall mounted product! Now I want everything suction cup-able :-D",
