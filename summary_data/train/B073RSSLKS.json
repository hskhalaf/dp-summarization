They are a little thin, so a few times they would rip/tear on the ride, but nothing too bad. We have a few left over and I will throw them in the car for emergencies. Would purchase again.",

They do tear fairly easy so, you need to be careful. My niece ripped hers and had to use the child\u2019s size. It was a bit small but did the job. She\u2019s 12 and it came to her lower waist area. A child\u2019s size is for kids 10 and under I\u2019d say. I would buy again. Definitely worth the money.",

During that time, I only got one small rip rip (not bad enough that I couldn't use it); the kids were more likely to get small rips in theirs (the younger the kid, the more likely rips will occur).
