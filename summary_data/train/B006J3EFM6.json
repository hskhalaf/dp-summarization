It is collapsible so not a hassle to put in your back seat. If you have any mobility issues or you just need the support. Works better than most wooden canes I've used. Easy to take every where. Easy to keep clean as well I recommend this pole you can take it everywhere",

But if someone else grabs the pole to use and over extends then the pole is forever locked in an unusable position. Poof! Surely, a fail- safe of some type could be built into the pole to prevent this. Until then, be very careful with adjusting the length of the pole!",
