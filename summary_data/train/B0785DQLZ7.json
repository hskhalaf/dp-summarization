Their Thunderbolt 3 docking station was the 3rd attempt at a product that promised a lot but didn't deliver much. To be honest, non-apple (windows based) laptops took a a long time to include a truly functional thunderbolt 3 port. Luckily, Razer was ahead of the power curve. Luckily, \"threes the charm\" as the saying goes. Out of the box to fully functional...would you believe 10 minutes. Everything worked on the first try. Amazing! Thanks for making this plug and play, instead of plug and pray! cb",

Not a big deal for me, as I was aware of the charging limitation before my purchase.

    "title": "Kensington SD5200T Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station - 170 Watts with Power Delivery - Dual Monitor 4k for Mac and PC (K38300NA)",
    "description": "Kensington has engineered the game-changing SD5200T Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station for Windows and Mac. Whether you're a video editor, graphic designer, content creator, gamer, or just someone who wants to simplify a 4K workspace, you get more speed, more pixels, more power, and more possibilities. The SD5200T Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station is a power user's solution for hyper-productivity. For over 35 years, Kensington has been The Professionals' Choice for desktop productivity Q: Is there a setup and usage video? A: Yes, at the left side of the page with the collection of images; also view it at customer. Kensington/a/328383. Q: Does the SD5200t docking station work with both Windows and Mac OS?A: Yes: Does this dock require new driver installation on my computer? A: We recommend you ensure that your computer\u2019s Thunderbolt 3 driver is the most up to date version. Q: Does this dock support USB-C Power Delivery (PD)?A: Yes, the dock supports USB-C Power Delivery through the Thunderbolt 3 connector, up to 85W. Your laptop of course needs to accept Power Delivery over USB-C. Q: Can I use a non-Thunderbolt 3 USB-C cable with this dock? A: The cable used for the dock must be an Intel-certified Thunderbolt 3 cable. A . 5m Intel-certified TB3 cable is included. Longer cables can cause performance issues. If you lose or damage the included cable, our can check the official Thunderbolt website for certified cables. Q: Is this Thunderbolt 3 dock backwards compatible with a non-Thunderbolt 3 USB-C port, Thunderbolt 1 or 2 ports, or a USB-A portal: No. Q: Does the USB-C port on the front of the dock support video over USB-C?A: The front USB-C port is a data-only port and supports 5V/3A (15W). Q: What video standards are supported through this dock? A: The Display Port connector on the dock supports DP v1. 2 + + , or Display Port dual-mode, where passive cabling to Display Port, HDMI, and DVI standards are allowed. The Thunderbolt 3 ports are fully compatible to USB-C Display Port Alt mode standards, where a USB-C to video adapter can be used to connect to a second monitor. We recommend using Kensington CV4000H USB-C to HDMI adapter (K33993WW) or CV2000V USB-C to VGA adapter (K33994WW). Q: What is the maximum resolution supported by the dock? A: Up to two monitors at 4K/60Hz: both the Display Port connector and the Thunderbolt 3 ports support Display Port v1. 2 standards of 4096 x 2160 @ 60Hz. The dock can also support a single 5K/60Hz monitor. Typically, the 5K monitor would use two Display Port inputs to achieve this; alternatively you can use the dock\u2019s Display Port plus one of the dock\u2019s Thunderbolt 3 ports to a monitor\u2019s Display Port input (using a USB-C to Display Port cable or adapter). To support 4K @ 60Hz, ensure that Display Port 1. 2 or MST (multi-stream support) is enabled on your display. Q: What should I do if I am getting inconsistent video performance when the dock is connected to a 4K monitor at 4K resolution? A: The video performance may be affected by the quality of the Display Port cable used in the setup when using 4K resolution. We recommend that the user try a different cable to see if the problem persists. A cable less than 1. 5M in length is desired. Q: Why is the audio still coming out of the laptop instead of the external speakers/headset that I connected to dock? A: Sometimes the computer will not automatically make the audio channel coming out of the dock as the default. In this case go to Mac OS: System Preferences - Sound - Output, and select USB Audio as the default audio channel.",
