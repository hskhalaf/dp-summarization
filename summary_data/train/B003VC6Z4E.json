But the TX7 is very similar, the main 2 differences are 1. that the TX9 has an extra 3D mode which is gimmicky, it looks like crap and so I don't use it and 2. The sensor is 1/2.4 instead of 1/2.3 which translates to virtually no difference in quality (yes there are more pixels). Save yourself the $100 and get the TX7.",

    "title": "Sony TX Series DSC-TX9/H 12.2MP Digital Still Camera with \"Exmor R\" CMOS Sensor and 3D Sweep Panorama",
    "description": "Photographic brilliance meets styling designelegance in the Sony\u2019s DSC-TX9. Capture impressive landscapes with iSweep Panorama and in 3D.10 and Get clear and crisp images in low light thanks to Sony's Exmor R CMOS sensor. You'll also Bbe impressed by Superior Auto, Background Defocus and Full HD 1080/60i AVCHD movies.8 Enjoy it all on an easy to view 3.5\" touch screen1.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Photographic brilliance meets pure, elegant style in the Cyber-shot DSC-TX9 digital camera. Capture impressive landscapes with iSweep Panorama and enjoy 3D shots as well. Sony's \"Exmor R\" CMOS sensor delivers impressive clarity and crisp detail in low light, and the Superior Auto mode takes the guesswork out of choosing the right settings. There's also an innovative Background Defocus feature and Full HD 1080/60i AVCHD movie recording that looks great on your compatible HDTV. Enjoy it all on an easy to view 3.5-inch (diagonal) touch screen. \n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-TX9 Features \n\n3D Sweep Panorama\nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your compatible 3D television. \n\nIntelligent Sweep Panorama Mode\nCapture expansive landscapes with Intelligent Sweep Panorama Mode. Press shutter and sweep and the camera does the rest, continuously, shooting images and in one second stitching them together. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion. \n\n12.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated \"Exmor R\" CMOS Image Sensor\nThe DSC-TX9 features a 12.2-megapixel \"Exmor R\" CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera's Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined \"Exmor R\" CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes. \n\n1080i AVCHD Movie Mode\nRecord movies in 1080i AVCHD high definition at 60i. The AVCHD format captures a high degree of detail and smooth movement, and when footage is burned to disc, can be played back on Blu-ray Disc players, Sony PlayStation3 systems and compatible PCs and HDTVs. The convenience Movie start/stop icon makes it easy to access this mode via touch screen. \n\n3.5-inch Xtra Fine LCD touch screen display w/TruBlack technology \nA large 3.5-inch Xtra Fine LCD touch screen display w/TruBlack technology (921K pixels), the largest of Sony's Cyber-shot DSC line makes it easy for viewing and sharing images with simple and fun touch screen operation. With its Ultra AR film coating, which reduces reflections and increases contrast and brightness, viewing images on the LCD even in bright light is possible. \n\nSuperior Auto mode\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. \n\nBackground Defocus\nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on your subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background while keeping your subject crisp and clear. \n\nHigh speed shooting\nThe DSC-TX9 can capture full 12.2-megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that you capture the decisive moment such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, the DSC-TX9 employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 25mm equivalent wide 4x Optical Zoom\nThe high-performance Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 4x optical zoom lens brings distant subjects closer for video recording as well as for outdoor, sports, and travel photos, and Close Focus shoots close-ups up to just under 1/2-inch from the subject. A wide angle of 25mm equivalent wide-angle lens allows you to take wider shots of the scene or group in crowded spaces. \n\nHDMI output (with stand)\nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload your content.HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). \n\nSoft Skin mode\nYour portrait subjects will thank you for this. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. \n\nTracking Focus\nHelp keep fast-moving subjects in precise focus. Just touch on your subject in the LCD monitor and the camera will keep focus even as the subject moves closer or further away. \n\nNatural Flash\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images. \n\nSweep Multi Angle mode\nIn Sweep Multi Angle mode, the camera takes 15 images at different angles as you sweep across the scene. By tilting the camera during playback, the camera's Gyro Sensor detects motion and displays the image in a 3D-like view on the camera's LCD. \n\nAnti-Motion Blur Mode\nCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-TX9 captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and dramatically reduce subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras. \n\nHandheld Twilight\nCapture cleaner and sharper night shots without using a tripod. When set to Handheld Twilight Mode, the DSC-TX9 captures six images in a fraction of a second with one press of the shutter, and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and low noise. With these modes, you can capture images in low light, without flash, beyond the capability of traditional cameras. \n\nBacklight Correction HDR\nShooting high-contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and/or details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking two pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of both into a single image for more natural looking shots. \n\nTransferJet technology\nTransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows you to transfer files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing9 . \n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 125, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nSelf-Portrait Timer\nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture. \n\nStylish Ultra-slim Design\nMeasuring at just 3 7/8 x 2 3/8 x 23/32 inches, the DSC-TX9 is slim enough to slip into a pocket or purse, so you can take it with you wherever you go. \n\nIntelligent Auto (iAuto) mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, and faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clearer images, faces with more natural skin tone, and less blur. By incorporating advanced features such as Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, iAuto mode lets you take advantage of the latest Sony Cyber-shot technology without leaving auto mode. Whether you're shooting landscapes, capturing a beautiful flower, or taking pictures at an in-door birthday party or wedding shower, iAuto mode will optimize your camera's settings to help ensure you come away with a great shot. \n\nScene modes\nThe DSC-TX9 features 13 convenient scene modes. Intelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects nine different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape, Macro, and Close Focus. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nEasy Touch Screen Interaction\nThe DSC-TX9 offers intuitive functions to the multi-purpose touch screen, such as the ability to select the focus point with a simple touch, scroll through images by sliding your finger across the screen and one-touch access to the MENU. The display also features improved readability with list view and index view. \n\nDVDirect DVD recorder Compatible\nWith AVCHD capabilities the DSC-TX9 is compatible with the select DVDirect DVD recorders, allowing playback of high definition footage. Simply connect your camera to the DVDirect to burn a Blu-ray Disc for playback of your HD movies on a compatible Blu-ray Disc player. (Recorder and media sold separately.) \n\nHD MP4 Movie Mode\nIn 1080p MP4 movie mode the camera shoots 1440x1080 high definition movies at 30 fps, which is the format when working with a PC. Users will create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in their Cyber-shot DSCs in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac. Once transferred to your computer you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube., Dailymotion. (Internet connectivity required.) \n\nCompatible with PC and MAC Systems\nThe high definition, AVCHD/MP4, video captured with the DSC-TX9 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems. \n\nFace Detection technology\nSony's Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. \n\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nAnti-blink Function\nIt's frustrating to think you've captured that perfect shot, only to review it later and discover one of your subjects blinked just as you pressed the shutter. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \n\nIntelligent AF\nThanks to Intelligent AF technology, capture fleeting moments like a child's adorable expression with the ultra-quick AF which locks focus in as little as 0.3-sec. \n\nPHOTOMUSIC\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish). Select from pre-loaded tracks on the camera or transfer your own from your compatible computer (sold separately). \n\nViewing modes\nFind your photos using the simple folder or calendar viewing modes. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\nWide zoom display\nTo use the entire image area of your compatible HDTV screen, Wide Zoom display automatically expands standard 4:3 and 3:2 images to 16:9 LCD display. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. \n\nBIONZ Image Processor\nThe BIONZ image processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. Fast processing enables unique Sony features such as Intelligent Sweep Panorama, Hand-held Twilight, Anti Motion Blur, HDR, etc to take and combine multiple images in less than a second to create wide panoramic images. Images have reduced grain and appear less washed out. \n\nPhotoTV HD\nBring your photos to life and enjoy highly detailed, high definition images with PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTVs. PhotoTV HD optimizes settings (such as sharpness, gradation and color )on your PhotoTV HD compatible BRAVIA HDTV so images on screen look as beautiful as printed photos. \n\nCreative painting tools\nDecorate your photos with words and drawings using the included paint pen or your finger. Have fun using more than 30 stamps and 15 types of picture frames and save new images at up to 5-megapixel resolution. \n\nLithium-ion battery\nIncluded lithium-ion battery provides added convenience with longer lasting power than alkaline batteries (capacity of 115 minutes or 230 images when viewing still images with the DSC-TX9). \n\nMedia card slot \nFor convenient storage and sharing of your images, the DSC-TX9 accepts Memory Stick Duo/Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo media (sold separately) and SD/SDHC/SDXC media (sold separately). \n\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.32\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony's Personal Space). Using the new 5.3 version also enables playback of 3D images taken on the Cyber-shot camera. \n\nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software\nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable 5.2 software the DSC-TX9 makes it easy to pre-select images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites without the need for any additional software or install.",
