      "title": "The Unwalkable Walking Shoe",
      "text": "These shoes looked nice and I've had good luck with Reeboks in the past. They fit OK, but when I tried walking I was stunned by how far the bottom juts out behind and to the outside of the foot heel and how high the heel is in relation to the rest. It's like trying to walk in high heels with something large stuck to the back. You end up leaning forward and can't use a normal walk. The images do not sufficiently show how bizarrely unbalanced and clunky this thing is.",

Total trash. Between these and the Crossfit Reeboks (HIIT Tr Cross Trainer) I got in August 2020 ... I can honestly say to serious walkers/runners: avoid Reebok. Under Armour provides better quality than this (and that is saying something).",
