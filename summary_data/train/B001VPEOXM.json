I got this arm to go across the entire table so I could put a harness on the neck and a flank harness for the back. This works exactly as I hoped. There are 3 connectors on the top to attach a harness and one on each arm that comes down to the table. Many options of hooking up your harnesses based on your needs. It is very easy to raise up or down to get the correct height for your dog, and is extremely sturdy when installed. Definitely recommend.",
