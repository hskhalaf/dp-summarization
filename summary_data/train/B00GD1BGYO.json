The bright side though, compared to phones lasting 8 hours of non-stop use, this keyboard lasts weeks before you need to change the battery.",

I don\u2019t like Apple\u2019s attempt to thin their products down and then redesign their keyboards with a simulated feel. This feels like Apple\u2019s older, real keyboards.

      "text": "I bought this last semester when I needed a cheap keyboard for my iPad. The keys feel good enough, and it definitely works. However, the lack of a built-in battery was inconvenient, the Bluetooth was a bit spotty, and the build quality is definitely low. After just a few months of usage and being carried around in a backpack, multiple keys had broken off. If you need a really cheap keyboard, it does work, but I'd recommend saving a little more to get a more trustworthy option (I recently got a great deal on the Logitech Slim Combo keyboard case, and it's miles better.)",
