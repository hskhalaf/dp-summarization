So, I\u2019ve been a little uneasy, especially at night, since I moved in 3 months ago. Not any more, I sleep like a baby and feel very safe. This alarm was easy to install, will scare away any intruder, and was the right price for my budget. Thank you for this product.",

This alarm is LOUD, like ear piercing. I can\u2019t even use the \u201cdoor open alarm\u201d because it\u2019s too loud. I can also active/deactivate from inside my room with the door closed so the range is good. I would definitely recommend purchasing one, it\u2019s super easy to install as well!",
