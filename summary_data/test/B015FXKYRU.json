The sound quality is fantastic and the set up / attachments feel sturdy but also ultra light weight with 2 different ear cups, i guarantee you will find this a gaming headset you can wear for hours. The headset offers Aux option for basic sound and the ability to plug into a controller and a USB option plus headset button for 7.1. Great job Plantronics",

Also people complain about mic quality onilne. Avoid.",

Either they would put too much pressure on my ears or headband and feel too heavy in general, giving me a headache sometimes. This headset is perfect because its very light and I can literally wear it for as long as I like without it becoming a chore to wear. Highly recommend.",

The sound quality is great, especially if you tweak with it's eq settings (via software). The mic is very clear but can distort your voice. Overall it's a great headset but I'd say wait until the price drops below \u00a3100 before purchase.",
