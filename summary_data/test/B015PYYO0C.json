They even fixed the buzzing sound issue that was heared while scrolling in late driver updates. It seemed to be caused by some driver. Overall the laptop is great, thermals are good, battery life good. For anyone looking for good ultrabook, XPS 13 (particularly newer one, with upgraded hardware) is a something to consider strongly.",

Do effectively the notebook has turned from portable to a desktop. Very disappointed with Dell. Six months later the battery died and wont even charge with the wire any longer. Since I bought it from US store and imported it to Saudi I can't return it nor take it to a service center here as it is registered in US only. For past six months communicating with DELL service to have my product registration changed to Saudi Arabia but they cant fix it. Feel disgusted. what a waste of money!",
