This device solves both problems because it only boils the amount of water that you require for your cup of tea. Just pour the right amount of water inside, burn the switch on, wait about 15 seconds (that's how fast it works), and brew your tea. A must-have for hot-tea drinkers.",

      "text": "Trouble. Sunbeam must have switched suppliers. I had one that was great for a dozen years. Then, new one. #1: power switch stopped working. Ordered #2: after 2 weeks wouldn't dispense. Replaced by Amazon #3: lid kept falling off; after six days dispense lever fell off and wouldn't stay on. Conclusion: I think I'll try some other brand.",

The dispensing lever is made of plastic. After a few uses the lever deformed and the rubber stopper would no longer engage the opening. Save your money for something better.",
