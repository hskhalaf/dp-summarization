The only problem I have is that when I washed them before a first use, 1 large towel and a hand towel, looked like I had bleached them to some extent. There was some discoloration from the gray to an orange color. :( I will continue to use them because I LOVE the feel but they are not pretty to see in their current state. And just to be clear, I DID NOT bleach them nor was there any chance of them getting bleached because I do not use bleach in my laundry.",

I now see why people say they make them wanna get back in the shower just to use them again. No regrets on the purchase, be sure to give them a good wash before first use they will shed a lot of lint. Might wanna do 2 wash and dries just to get it all imo.",

After washing and drying on low with wool dryer balls they came out fresh and soft. The finish on the edging and stitching is excellent, as far as I can see. The proof comes in how well a towel dries you after bathing and how soft it is on your skin. This towels dries well, not great and is very soft on your body. The tag says they are made in India of 100% cotton. I feel for the quality and finish, they offer very good value.",
