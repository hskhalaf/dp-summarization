      "text": "As a programmer having a great keyboard is important to me. I've been a longtime user of the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard series. That keyboard has great ergonomics and key layout, but the membrane keys are really subpar. Until now the closest mechanical keyboard you could get was the Kenesis Freestyle series, which has a similar split design but compromised on the extended keys. Today I unboxed the Cloud Nine C989M and I couldn't be happier with it. It has the same layout as the Microsoft keyboards, but the keys are Cherry MX mechanical keys.",

The RGB options will make your jaw drop. My cat is currently mesmerized.",

I only have two complaints since it was an expensive keyboard I was shocked to find that the keys are loud compared to other keyboards- not sure why they lacked on this... quiet keys should be a basic thing now. Also, I\u2019m one of those people that like to feel the bump on the F J and 5 key, well the bump is barely there. Other than that this keyboard rocks!",

After looking at a number of different keyboards, this one really caught my eye. The product is very well built: it feels sturdy and it's also incredibly aesthetic. It had some connection issues with my Dell G3 laptop in the beginning but I realized that you just need to make sure that your drivers are updated and that the USB is connected to a 3.0 port. Love it and would definitely recommend it!",
