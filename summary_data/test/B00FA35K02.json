It comes wrapped in plastic along with a plastic case that is nice to store it in after a shave, and to protect it from damage. It stops bleeding from cuts and prevents razor burn. No chalky mess like you\u2019d get from a styptic pencil. It helps tremendously against shaving irritation as well. It\u2019s very solid, and it\u2019s very generous in size compared to ones I\u2019ve paid a lot more for with the same results. I wish I had found this a lot sooner!!",

I used the Gentleman Jon block this morning on some weeping razor rash, and I will never use styptic again. The alum block is very effective, easier to apply and far more gentle\u2014no painful stinging. It leaves a smooth, clean sensation; a great finish to your shave.",

Secondly, the cool refreshing feel of alum against razor burn or a freshly shaved face is as good as any aftershave in my opinion. This stuff works wonders, indulge. As far as the design and the case, it's a nice tight seal that keeps the block dry. I personally enjoy the squared off block design, because as you use it, it rounds out to your face as the alum is worn.",

It may or may not sting, and it will take several passes before you start to see any indication of clotting.",

      "text": "Gentleman Jon alum blocks are of excellent quality. The block itself is rounded on the edges and smooth. It is a little smaller than a typical bar of soap and comes in a well built plastic case. After a shave simply wet the block and rub all over your face. You will notice a mild burn followed by total calm. Excellent if you easily get razor burn from sensitive skin and will disinfect knicks and stop bleeding. It leaves me feeling smooth with no more burn.",

I hope that the next one I order is not the same case.",
