The VTech ErisStation works great in small conference rooms or offices, but with the 4 wireless \"puck\" remote microphones, it also works well in multi-row training rooms and other larger meeting rooms. Sound quality both ways is excellent. Did I mention the wireless pucks? SO nice to expand the room so the people you call can hear from everyone in the room. Why don't the \"real\" conference phone guys make them like this? I have bought many of these for different locations mostly to replace less versatile Polycom sets.",

Now the calls are clear as a bell and no complaints. The only problem we had was with the Ethernet cable that came with the phone. It was not the right fit and we unable to get a replacement cable from the seller. They were generous enough to give us a partial refund to purchase our own cable but for the convenience I would have preferred if everything came in the box correctly.",
