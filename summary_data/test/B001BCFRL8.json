They are extremely pretty, however mine will not sit flat on a table when the two birds are linked together, the one that curls around the other was a little bit shorter. Since they will be on a cake this does not really matter as the frosting will help make it a non-issue. However for the price I would have expected a better fit. This will not really matter in the end, but I do have to take off 1 star for it. Overall a great piece and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to add a classy topper to their cake.",

We received many compliments on this topper-- great for any couple who doesn't feel properly represented by the bride & groom ones. Non-religious and non-denominational, what you see is what you get. Please note, however, that the birds CAN come apart... if this will bother you, perhaps you should find another top for your cake. When I (eventually) get a hutch, these birds will go up on display. I hope other \"love birds\" enjoy this topper as much as I did!",

It was really light weight though, so would have been a perfect cake topper. Looks well made and classy in person. I would definitely recommend this.
