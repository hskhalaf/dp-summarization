So based upon his reaction and his verbal assessment of the product after opening is how I was able to give this the much deserved review.",

It will fit easily: the AC adapter, the switch w/sides attached, the DOCK, a PRO controller and a JOYCON controller.....and plenty of room left for an HDMI cord. It's semi-hard sided with molded slots for everything. I don't plan on dropping it, but if I did, I wouldn't cringe. Nice adjustable shoulder strap as well. Only gripe would be it having two zipper pulls instead of just the one...but if that's my only complaint, then that should say enough. Would definitely recommend.",

Only drag is that the top portion of the case is not as hard as I was expecting it to be, but as long as I am not flinging the crap out of it when I take it with me it should be okay. Additionally, the mesh inside is not that tense. the HDMI cable can occasionally slip out if you move the case a *little* more rough than normal. But it's all right, not that big of a deal. Cool this is that the case can fit my GameCube control inside, so that's a big plus!",

If you need a case to take all the Switch components with you this will certainly do the job well. My only complaints are the slot where you can put the joy-con grip is made more for a pro controller and the grip will likely slide around while carrying it. Also wish the carry strap could be a bit longer.",
