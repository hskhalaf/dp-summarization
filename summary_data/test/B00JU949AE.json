Really nice product! my only downside to this which makes it a 4 star rather than a 5 star is that i wish there was an easier way to fold it down or make it more compact so that we can move it from room to room without maneuvering it through doorways in awkward angles. Other than that, great jumper for kids!",

It's big, if you have a place to keep it without needing to store it away, this is a great activity seat.",
