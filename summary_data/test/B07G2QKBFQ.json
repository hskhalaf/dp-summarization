    "description": "Our ultralight survival water purifier weighs in at just under 3 ounces and measures only 7.5\" long making it perfect for everyday carry or a bug-out bag for emergencies. The chemical free filter uses a multi-stage filtration process making your drinking water safe and healthy by removing 99.9999% of waterborne bacteria and parasites including: E. Coli, Staphylococcus Aureus, Salmonella Typhi, Cholera, Legionella, and more. The first stage is the Pre-Filter System which removes larger objects like sediment, bugs, dust, algae, and other suspended pollutants in the water, reducing the turbidity value of the water, instantly making it more clean. Next is the MIR High Iodine Bactericidal Resin Filter Layer which thoroughly kills pathogenic bacteria (E. Coli, Staphylococcus, Salmonella, Cholera, etc.) with a sterilization rate of more than 99.9999%. Then comes the Coconut Husk Granule Active Carbon Layer. This layer removes poisonous substances from the water and improves the smell. Finally, the Activated Carbon Fiber Layer helps absorb chemical pollutants in water, improving the water taste and further reducing the turbidity value of water. (Turbidity is the cloudiness of a fluid caused by large numbers of individual particles in the water). Within each of these 4 layers are multiple levels of filtration, bringing the total number of filtration levels to 10 for superior water purification in outdoor or survival settings .Our Aqau-Marine Personal Straw Water Purifier is perfect for camping, hiking, and to keep in your bug-out bag for emergency situations.",
