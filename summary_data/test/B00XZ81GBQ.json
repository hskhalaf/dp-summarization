Clearly all stainless, and good heavy gauge wire. The only drawbacks are slight warpage and I had to file off a few sharp edges on wire. Overall, way better than most. I would buy this again. I did NOT receive this product in exchange for my \"unbiased\" review! I paid full price and feel free to speak my mind!",

The racks fit my jelly roll pans perfectly. I have attached a photo, because after reading the reviews and getting different answers, I still wasn't sure if the rack was even with the top of my pan, above it or below it. The rack sets about 1/4\" inch below the top of my jelly roll pan. This is exactly where I wanted it to fit. The rack is very sturdy and strong. Thank you for a GREAT product!!",

They come out very crispy, like fried chicken but no fat or high sodium. I found a low sodium bbq sauce that we can dip them in. Or I cut them up and put the pieces in a salad. No need for an air fryer. Don't have room for one anyway.",
