They did offer to let me return it but I had already spent 3 hours assembling the bike and the packaging was destroyed when removing the parts.",

It does have a number of preset programs and a place to program a custom workout of your own. The fan is better than I expected. It is super quiet. I'm glad I went with the recumbent style instead of getting a new treadmill.",

I called the manufacturer as stated in the assembly instructions and they sent me out a new assembly right away. I also requested a whole new set of hardware since mine were pretty stripped after trying to tighten. After installing the new seat assembly my bike is now super quiet. I really love this machine.
