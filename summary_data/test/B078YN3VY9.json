Beautiful screen, touch screen and pen are ultra responsive especially when used for drawing apps like sketchbook. Sound is great with an amazing surround simulation and the speakers being at the bottom are not muffled at all, you might just have to go in the settings to tweak them to the full potential. Fingerprint has not been an issue for me personally, very responsive and accurate. Very fast laptop whatever the task may be. Tried light gaming and Photoshop and they were running smoothly. Very satisfied with it overhaul, tablet mode is very convenient.",

Even a complete windows re-install on a new hard drive had no effect. Nothing wakes it from sleep. Very irritating. Additionally, I regularly find myself wishing it had a thunderbolt port (the usb-c port is not \"thunderbolt-equipped\") and a HDMI 2.0 port (the HDMI port is HDMI 1.4). Both the Intel and Nvidia GPUs can support 4k at 60Hz, but because the only video-out port is HDMI 1.4, you are limited to 4k at 30hz (which is really bad). FYI",

The lower power hardware leads to great battery life, and the 1440p display makes for a great browsing or programing experience, but definitely falls short in games. The versatility is awesome -- tablet mode is great just like a tablet, and bending the hinge at odd angles can make it more comfortable to use when lounging or sitting in a confined space (like an airplane). But my next laptop will probably be more focused on graphics performance.",
