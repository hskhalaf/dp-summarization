      "text": "While it took a little while to get used to having them in, I usually experience that with in-ear earphones. The sound from them is very good, and the in-line microphone is more than adequate for calls. Not sure about them in terms of longevity, only had them a couple of weeks. Both the clip and pouch that they come with make it easy to carry them around without getting tangled up. EDIT: Nearly 6 months down the line, they're still working perfectly. EDIT: A year down the line, the left ear began having problems - cutting out and more static than sound. Overall very happy with them!",

As with most skullcandy products, these have very punchy bass, while also delivering clear highs and mids. They look good and don't fall out. The only negative I have is the lack of a flat cable.",

Also the button to play and stop music ect is hard to push at times because it is a small button but bass is decent and OK money for a skull candy product.",
