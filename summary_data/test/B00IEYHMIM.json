But, without fail, it gets slower and slower as the days go by. Initially I thought it was a brief power issue that caused the problem, but every time I reset the clock it continually falls behind the actual time. I last reset it about 3 months ago and it's currently running 5 minutes slow. That's pretty unacceptable for an alarm clock.",

I probably am much more emotionally invested in this black cube than I should be. If I could give it 19 stars, I would.",

But the main issue is that there seems to be a fundamental design/build flaw (described above and in other reviews) that will likely render the clock a brick in 6-24mos. I've had very cheap clocks last longer and perform better than this one. I seriously doubt Sony will warranty or resolve this one...",

Buttons on the top and back, knobs on either side. Wow, not functional. Sound quality is fine, build quality is not fantastic. Just not what I was expecting for something purported to be worth $70.",

Also, alarm isn't nearly loud enough for hearing impaired people.",

But I listen to talk radio to fall asleep and wake up to as well. It's a disk tuner, which was a surprise, but my station comes in just fine. It's very easy to change/reset the alarm. It takes up very little space on my bedside table.",

The only problem with this one for me is that it has old fashioned dials for radio tuning and volume, which makes it a pain to change them in the dark. The radio dial is even difficult to read in the light, so I would not get this again.",
