The clarity of the pics is not up to the old quality; the auction mode is no longer there; and overall it is a disappointment. There are more issues with it but to get to the bottom line: i would not recommend this camera.",

      "text": "This was a great camera while it lasted, but I thought it should have lasted longer than 3 1/2 years for the money that was spent. Bought Feb 11, 2012 and in July 2015 it started slowing down. It still works, but now takes longer to display the picture on the screen and makes a whirring noise when you take the picture, almost as if it's groaning from old age. Yesterday, August 22, I began having a little difficulty convincing the shutter button to capture the picture as it would take 2-3 tries before it did so. I will continue using this camera until it dies, as I can't currently afford to spend another $200-$300 for another camera.",

As a video camera it only shoots 720px HD, and the zoom (which loses focus while filming) isn't useful. As a still camera, it's hard to beat for the money. I especially like the viewfinder: viewfinders are a necessity in bright sunshine. I hardly used the LCD (for shooting) at all. Au revoir, Dear Fuji. You did a great job.",

The controls are logically located and very reachable. One particularly practical feature is that it automatically pushes off the lens cap when you turn it on so no more completely black shots. Do yourself a favor and get one if you're looking for an easy to use high quality camera. I'm very satisfied with my choice. Clifford Graham",

    "title": "Fujifilm FinePix S2950 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 18x Wide Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LCD",
    "description": "The Finepix S2950 camera boasts a high resolution 14 megapixel CCD, a bright 3.0\" LCD screen (460K dot resolution) plus viewfinder, and award winning Fujinon optics equipped with a 18X Optical Zoom.The Finepix S2950 is also intuitive and easy to operate, and packed full of useful features and technologies. With its mega 28mm wide-angle to 504mm telephoto lens, the S2950 can capture a wide variety of shots. The S2950 also features a mechanically stabilized 14 megapixel CCD sensor and high ISO sensitivity settings which combine to offer Fujifilm\u2019s Dual Image Stabilization technology.This combination reduces the blurring effects in many shooting conditions. Also Panorama mode, HD movie, Face Detection, and Easy Web Uploader combine with a host of other features to make the Finepix S2950 a feature-packed and versatile shooter for virtually any photographer.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Fujifilm's SLR-style FinePix S2950 digital camera delivers 14 megapixels, a FUJINON 18x zoom lens, as well as dual image stabilization. It also features a large 3-inch LCD, an Electronic Viewfinder, plus a number of image and social features allowing enthusiasts and professionals alike the ability to capture crisp, clear shots up-close, wide and far away. \n\nFujifilm FinePix S2950 Highlights \n\nFUJINON Zoom Lens and Dual Image Stabilization for Sharp, Clear Shots\nThe FinePix S2950 packs an 18x zoom with an impressive wide angle 28mm-504mm high-precision FUJINON optical lens in a simple-to-operate zoom lever, allowing a huge range to capture every detail, whether shooting stills or movies. With the combination of the mechanically stabilized sensor and high ISO, blurring effects of both hand-shake and subject movement are reduced to provide superb pictures. \n\nStunning Panoramic Shots\nThe FinePix S2950 features the easy-to-use Motion Panorama shooting mode, which takes three successive shots with a helpful tool which automatically releases the shutter once the images are fully aligned to seamlessly stitch the shots together in-camera. No matter how basic the photographer's skill, this feature allows users to get creative and see impressive results with no fear of uneven landscapes or shaky horizons. \n\nHD Movie Capture\nCapture stunning movies in 720p with sound at 30 frames per second with one touch ease. With a mini-HDMI output connector, it is easy to connect and view images on your HDTV (HDMI cable not included). \n\nPerfect Pictures Every Time with Smile and Blink Detection \nSmile Detection recognizes the moment your subject smiles and releases the shutter only when this happens, ensuring a happy photo every time. Additionally the Blink Detection function warns you if any of your subjects have blinked so that you can re-take the photo if necessary. \n\nSocial Networking and Photo book Features\nIn-camera tagging capabilities for both Facebook and YouTube, allowing you to select photos and movies for upload on either of the sites, making for easy upload once you connect to a PC and launch MyFinePix Studio. The feature saves you time and enables you to share your special moments with your closest social network. \n\nThe FinePix S2950 also allows you to tag in-camera the images you want to feature in a Photo book, which can be viewed separately in-camera and later created and ordered in a Photo book quickly and seamlessly. \n\nAdditional Features\n\n\n * Tracking Auto Focus (AF): Tracks fast moving subjects so they don't escape from the frame in a blur. Subjects will be tracked automatically for as long as it is kept in the frame and the shutter is half-pressed; when users fully press the shutter button your subject will be in the centre of the photo in perfect focus. \n * i-Flash Intelligent Flash: Offers a flash control system which efficiently controls the level of flash for a given exposure to produce beautifully balanced flash illumination across the foreground and background. Gone are the ugly washout shots where the subject is blasted with light and the background dark and unexposed. \n * Full Manual Controls: Gives the user the choice of direct access to manually control the settings and shooting features, and the specially designed chassis includes dedicated command buttons for quick and easy key functions. \n * Instant Zoom/Zoom Bracketing: Useful for high level photography. The Instant Zoom function captures moving subjects at high zoom settings. After zooming on a subject, a single button gives an additional 1.4x or 2x digital zoom. Zoom Bracketing automatically captures the same image three times with zoom ratio settings of 1x, 1.4x and 2x with a single shutter release. \n * Continuous Shooting: Allows up to 8 fps for 20 frames in S mode. \n * AA-Battery Power: Using AA batteries is convenient for on-the-go digital camera users as it eliminates the need to charge battery packs, allowing for lots of picture-taking and the ease of battery replacement.",
