      "text": "My pup transitioned to this food and he likes it. It doesn\u2019t upset his stomach or give him any kind of allergic reaction. His poops are also normal and predictable. One thing I will say is that my dog is a bit underweight and this food doesn\u2019t quite help. My pup is bored of this food now which is normal so I recommend buying a smaller quantity to see if it sticks for your dog before splurging on a large bag.",

      "text": "I bought this food hoping that it would provide better health for my dogs. They were previously on Science Diet which has grain in it. I have done a lot of reading and research on how grain is not good for animals. I heard nothing but rave reviews about this dog food in particular. So I made the switch. I am not pleased. We have gone through a 30 lb bag of the food and my dogs have had nothing but runny awful smelling bowl movements from the get go. They have also been going a lot more frequently. I do not see any improvement in their overall health. I will be switching back to Science Diet.",
