I maybe used it three times and the bristles are not durable at all as can be seen in the picture. When you extend the broom, it doesn\u2019t like firmly and keeps falling while you are cleaning which is also very annoying.

Thankfully, the designers realized the dustpan needed the teeth spaced more closely to actually be effective at hair and dust removal.

Gets everything from large debris to dust and animal hair. Love it.",

When it's fully extended, the broom and dustpan are great for sweeping large areas, and then the broom retracts with a quick twist to easily sweep dirt piles into the dustpan. The broom has flagged bristles resulting in a larger surface area and a soft, feathered texture that effectively grabs dust and dirt. The dustpan features teeth to comb out dirt and a flexible lip that conforms to surfaces so dust is not swept underneath it. The dustpan also locks open for easy emptying. The lightweight, aluminum pole with non-slip grips is easy to maneuver, and the broom snaps into the closed dustpan for upright, compact storage.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy OXO",
