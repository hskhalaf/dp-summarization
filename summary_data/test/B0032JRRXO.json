I won't bore you with the technical specs, that I don't understand. I do wish that the camera and memory card had been shipped together. It was tough having to wait for the needed memory card to arrive by 'snail mail' while all I could do was read the user's manual for the camera. Off hand, I will have a steep learning curve it seems. This camera has little resemblance to my 35mm SLRs or 4x5 view cameras. Hopefully this camera will make up for some of the lost enjoyment of photography.",

Good: Easy to use for basic point-and-shoot pictures and zooming Quick to turn on Picture quality is good Not so good: Several of our outdoor zoomed pictures had a noticable streak/lens flare if the camera was pointed in the same general direction as the sun. As with most digital cameras, the instructions are skimpy and the features are indicated by cryptic little icons. The screen seems fragile, although nothing has damaged it yet. Maybe not a problem. Overall, not perfect, but quite worth the price.",

I would rather have a rechargeable battery that I can slide into an AC wall charger than have to worry about buying batteries all the time. With active use, the camera would like 1.5-2 weeks on a set of batteries. TL;DR - for $100, just spend a little more and get a better camera",

You can never complain anything about A490. Too bad I can't post here stunningly beautiful pictures taken with my A490 that I recently purchased from Amazon.",
