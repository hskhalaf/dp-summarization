By days end a good 11 hours later the second photo shows about 1/3 of the ice remaining and my water was refrigerator cold all day .

I purchased the bright yellow tumbler, and to my surprise, it kept it's pretty yellow coat.

      "text": "Love this travel mug. The 20oz is the perfect size for me. Keeps my coffee at a pleasantly warm temp for at least 2-3 hours. Recommendation is handwash only, so if you refuse to wash dishes this may not be for you. Reason I gave it a 4/5 instead of a perfect score is because sometimes right after I pour my coffee (black with a little heavy whipping cream, delicious) and I put the lid on and the mouth piece is closed pressure builds up and the lid will actually pop up. Probably due to the way it\u2019s insulated, I don\u2019t know. Overall a great travel mug...liked it enough to write a review, which I rarely do. Thanks",

If you watch my video, you'll see that all you have to do is open the flip top before trying to put it on. If you don't open it first, you're basically pushing against the vaccum seal it creates and will never stay on. Common sense folks. This cup is great and the lid DOES STAY ON.",

Idk if I'm just stupid but I've never had issues with a seal before on any of the RTIC cups or even Walmart's Ozark Trail cups.
