Fits into a small corner space so that space isn\u2019t wasted between a couch and a large bookcase. It is sturdy enough to use as a book case. I like the white and light tan color. The price was reasonable. I don\u2019t have any complaints. Would purchase again if I need another.",

So if it is just going to sit in a corner and not get bumped or knocked into it is great. Super easy to assemble. The parts fit together tightly so it sits very solidly with no wobble. I think it is a good value for a small price.",

Assembly is a breeze with this unit -- took about 90 seconds with two people screwing the pieces together. It isn't the world's most solid piece, but for the price, it holds up nice and isn't shaky. (If it's going in the corner, it shouldn't really be shaken much anyway, right?) Each shelf holds about 10lb I believe, although it's not advised to put anything heavy on the top for safety's sake. This unit really maximized a small amount of space and gave me so much room - I'm so happy!",

Basically, if you are using it for decorative purposes, and you don\u2019t care about the quality, you will love it.
