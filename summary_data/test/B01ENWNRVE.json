It's ok for a regular measuring tape with a magnetic end, but I already have 3 of them. Had to return it. Tried replying to an email from the company, but after 2 days, no response update..company let me know I got sent the old model, the fixed it right away..thanks",

I love the dual-sided measures, the metric and English, and the very large (EZ to read) numbers. It is bigger than I expected. But my biggest disappointment is that there is no auto-lock -- you have to put your finger on the tape or hit the lock button to keep the tape from going back in. It does not have (nor does it need at all) an auto retract feature, but it retracts so easily and solidly, that really is not a demerit. Overall it is a very high-quality unit.",
