      "text": "This kayak is portable, easy to transport, easy to inflate, durable, and is quite maneuverable on the water. The oars are pretty darn good for the price of this package. The only bad thing I can say - and I can't emphasize enough just how bad they are - is the inflatable seats are horrible! They are next to absolutely useless. Seriously, the inflatable seats included with this package ARE GARBAGE. They offer ZERO back support - NONE!! You will have to purchase better seats if you value your back at all. Other than TERRIBLE SEATS, this is a good value for the money.",

Easy to inflate. 10 min for 2 kayaks. between my 10 and 12 yr old, we have a system and can have the 2 kayaks ready to rock and roll in 10-15 min. The foot pumps are truly awesome to a point we don't even use the electric pump we got as a back up. Tracking is a minor issue, but it is an inflatable, so expected. The carry bags are cumbersome and would have been nice to be back mounted like back packs rather than a satchel.",

Last weekend we even towed a two-man raft behind it with our camping gear and camped on a little island in the Sebastian Inlet (Florida). It worked famously! I would recommend this kayak to anyone. We have had absolutely no problems. Well, actually, the foot pump (included) did not have the necessary nozzles when it arrived which made the first attempt at inflating the kayak a challenge. However, we notified the seller, and the missing nozzles were mailed out immediately.",

Me and my girlfriend tried it out twice on a river. Inflated great....the kayak once inflated is light...very easy to carry and move to the water with 2 people. The deluxe seats are very comfortable. We noticed that it is hard to paddle straight....but we expected that with an inflatable. Overall it functions as advertised and we love it...no roof racks, no overhead lifting. Fits in the back of our Kia sportage with extra room left over!",

      "text": "The Sea Eagle inflatable Kayak has 2-person and 3-person models, we bought this SE370 specifically to get a 3-person one but the package we got has only 2 seats. It was pretty confusing that on the production description it says 2-person and somewhere else 3-person. I thought the place where it mentioned 2-person is probably because they just copied it from the 2-person model and thought it would have 3 seats when we get our kayak. So what do they think, I buy this 3-person model and I order an additional seat separately? If they had said so I might have done it or not order this kayak at all. This is kind of misleading.",
