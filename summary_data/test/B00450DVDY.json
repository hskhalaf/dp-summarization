My family and I are able to easily take care of our business without having to go anywhere.

I bought a roller assembly but Brother would not give me directions for how to install it (directions for this particular printer cannot be found on the web, either) and told me to take it to one of their service centers. It's out of warranty so a repair would likely cause more than just buying a new printer. I'm very disappointed in Brother. I thought they made higher quality products that would last longer.",

When I print envelopes, same problem getting the envelope square with the printer and if you open the back door so the envelope doesn't get wrinkled the envelope comes out the back and dumps on the table or floor. When printing on legal size paper the regular path has a hard time not pushing the already printed pages onto the floor.",

The print quality is consistent, on both single and double-sided print jobs. Easy to change the toner cartridge and paper. Network setup is fairly straightforward. Cons: Expect the toner cartridges to wear out much faster than advertised. Double-sided printing with 3-hole paper has been a real challenge (for my printer, anyway). Printing disabled when toner cartridge reads \"empty\" (firmware setting that can be disabled, but annoying nonetheless). Would I buy it again: Absolutely. Despite the minor annoyances, it's been a great little printer. That's why I have two of them. :-)",

Granted, it worked wonderfully for most of that time, with it's fast printing and relatively cheap toner. But for about a year before it's death, there was a period of slow decline in which, occasionally, paper jammed and pages of gibberish printed continuously until I killed the power. I continued to experience these annoyances more often than I think is acceptable even with constant driver updates and re-installings. Still, it gets more than one star for being the best printer I've ever owned, but that's simply because I come from a long history of inkjets.",

      "text": "So far, so good. Was no problem connecting this to WiFi. I have printed 1 couple hundred sheets. So far, so good. I am pleased with the speed and quality. Instead of letting all of the software install onto computer, I download the driver only to my computer from the Brother website, then used the Windows 7 printer detection feature to find the printer. (instructions on how to put the printer into searchable mode are in the manual). Once Windows found the printer, I directed the install process to the drivers folder downloaded from the web, and everything installed fine, printer works great. I just don't like bloatware that gets installed from those 'installation disks'.",

It was an inkjet, used a lot of ink when printing and had a gravity type paper feeder that would never align correctly and usually cause a jam. I then decided to get a B&W Laser as all I usually printed was pages that didn't require color and with online photo printing being relatively inexpensive I didn't see a reason to have a printer that could print a photo a requirement. I specifically looked for a laser printer with a bottompage feeder system and this one fits perfectly. Easy to setup, easy to print and it works when I click the print button.",

(1) When the printer is printing, yes it makes noise, but for a brief moment. It's not the leaf blower that the Debbie Downers say it is. (2) I was able to connect three computers on my network to this printer within 5 minutes. Mac, Win7 & Win8 machines. Don't be intimidated by the poor reviews, this printer works great. It's also FAST - once you hit the print button the page comes out within seconds. We love it.",

It had excellent reviews, and the one feature that we really wanted: duplex printing. I ordered late one night, it arrived two days later, and I had it completely set up and running in about 20 minutes, hooked up by USB to an iMac and shared among all the laptops and wireless devices in the house on the Wi-Fi/Mac network. The print quality is excellent even in Draft Toner Saver mode, duplex works well and saves us a lot of paper, and it's only noisy when it's awake, which is only when it's printing. Otherwise it's completely silent. Great printer.",

      "text": "Love the printer. We loved the first one so much we bought a second one. I think we've had the second one seven months, the first one probably a year. The first one I use at home and keep refilling the toner cartridge myself so it's dirt cheap to run. Wife uses the second at work and we've had zero problems out of both of them. It's so nice to be able to print over the wireless network, how did mankind survive before network printers? And it'll print both sides of the page, what is not to love? It was $116 and refilling toner cartridges costs five or six bucks if you buy in bulk.",

      "text": "I've never loved... or even liked... a home printer before. This printer is awesome, end of story. It's easy to get hung up on it being monochrome or not having a scanner, but since I bought it over a year ago I've needed to scan two sheets and the few things I've printed in color I wouldn't want to do on a hundred dollar printer anyway. This printer is perfect, you can get refills very cheap online, the duplex function works perfectly, the wifi takes about 15 minutes to set up. Perfect for home or light office use.",
