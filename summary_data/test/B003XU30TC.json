But I stopped trimming my nose hairs for awhile because it pulled hairs out and I didnt like using it.

This has been a good product so far. I rate as a 4 instead of 5 because it leave some short (very short) stubble I can feel. I can not see the stubble, so it has to be very short. I would recommend this product to friends",
