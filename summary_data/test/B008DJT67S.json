I installed this on my 09 rsr 800 with the pyle hydra amp and was pleased with them. You get food sound but not a lot of bass which I'm good with. And it's nice that I can add 2 more and only be at 200 bucks for everything. I have yet to have it on the woods with them but I'm happy so far",

I should have returned them upon receipt, but I kept telling myself, I can make them work. I wanted to try these to save some money, headphones would be a better choice that these.",
