      "text": "This is a very rare beast, with its 2/3\" sensor in such a small camera. It handily outperforms, in terms of image quality, all the other small pocketable cameras on the market. How they got the same sensor used by the much larger Fujifilm X30 into this little body I can't imagine, but it was a stroke of luck to find it. Operations are smooth and fast, and construction is first rate...typical for Fujifilm. Image quality is wonderful. This model is a few years old now, but it's a real gem if you can find one.",

Sony cuts corners there as the lens sharpness is not something they can easily market. And so on, like fast focus, fast flash etc... Turned out the lens on XQ1 was the same as on XF1, AND IS STILL THE SAME, on XQ2. Crappier than the one rx100 got. Good, Fuji was able to save on some thickness so they can compete with Sony. Well, XQ1 was a bad competitor, this will be a bad one as well.",
