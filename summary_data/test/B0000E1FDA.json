Update: the stone randomly started smoking everytime I went to preheat my oven. Tried cleaning it as per instructions with no change. Tired of my fire alarms going off so I am officially over this stone and am switching back to pampered chef.",

Just follow the instructions on care and storage and you will have a long lasting pizza/baking stone. Notably, you will get stained from grease and cheese melting on it so there's not much you can do other than scrap what you can off. This is normal. The stone is pretty heavy and I suspect it will break even at the slightest drop so be careful not to drop it.",

Classic no frills, great size, substantial enough to hold the heat well and evenly, but not too thick so that it's too heavy to handle. I expect we'll get another 10 years out of the new one! We do use it for baking bread mostly, with the occasional pizza thrown in, so there may be some stones designed for pizzas that are round, or glazed, that we skipped over... so if you want a stone JUST for pizza, then there may others more appropriate for you.",

    "description": "Size:14\" x 16\"| Color:natural clayWhere there\u2019s a party, there\u2019s pizza\u2014and tonight the party\u2019s in your kitchen. It doesn\u2019t matter if the only guests are this Old Stone Oven Rectangular Pizza Stone, a bottle of Valpolicella and you in your finest sweatpants. You\u2019ll be making pizzeria-worthy pies with delightfully textured crusts. In the blink of an eye, this large pizza stone bakes up your dough, draping it in a gooey blanket of cheese you can wrap yourself up in or actually eat. The best part? In addition to being the best pizza stone for your oven, it doubles as the best baking stone for happenin\u2019 bread parties, too.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nProfessional pizza and traditional European bread ovens are often lined with stone or brick. This is so heat is stored up and redistributed evenly. The resulting blast of heat from the Old Stone Oven rectangular pizza stone gives bread and pizza a nice chewy crust. The rustic French tarts called galettes are also well suited to a baking stone. To use the stone, place it in a cold oven and preheat to 500 degrees for pizza, or according to the recipe for bread or galettes. The stone is made of the same material that lines blast furnaces and kilns, so it can handle ultra-high temperatures. \n\n Wait until the baking stone is entirely cooled before attempting to clean it. Let it dry completely before using again. Some discoloration will occur over time; this is natural and will not affect baking. Using baking parchment may help delay that discoloration. Do not bake cookies, turnovers or other high-fat items on the stone; the stone would absorb the fat and proceed to produce smoke and bad odors. The stone comes with a flyer that contains detailed use and cleaning instructions, as well as recipes for bread, pizza dough, and two pizza toppings. --Garland Withers",
