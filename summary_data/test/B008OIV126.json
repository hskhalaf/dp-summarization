Would love to be contacted by the supplier to get new shelves to replace, and we would use shorter screws! Disappointing. I had several other pieces from this manufacturer on my wish list but probably won't take another chance.",

The top is edged by 4\u201d pieces of wood but the main section is the same as the shelves. I left one shelf out to make room for my PC and the dog chewed the shelf. It\u2019s cardboard. Really nicely done though and it would have been really hard to tell it wasn\u2019t solid wood. 2) there are two different length screws. They really should make this more clear as you can damage a shelf if you use the longer ones. Other than that I am very happy and do recommend this desk!",

Assembly took more time than I expected, with lots of screw/bolts to assemble and attach, and the top would be heavy for a small person, but complexity was low.",

      "text": "Solid shelf that looks nice at a great price. Its not steel but light aluminium tubing (still solid). Bump out detail on tube near top is not smooth but rough welded in a few spots only. I wish that part looked better. Wood looks nice and rustic but a bit darker than I thought it would be. Also wood is very light weight...maybe not solid plank? Smelled of heavy chemicals out of box but dissipated quickly. Box was beat to hell on arrival but product was fine. Packing material wasnt the best so maybe I got lucky. Fast shipping and easy assembly. Overall satisfied with the product and would buy again for same price.",

The metal frame isn't too heavy that I can't move the shelf by myself and it also came with felt pieces under the metal legs that keep my wood flooring from getting scuffed. An added bonus, the shelf came with hardware that allows you to anchor the shelf to the wall should you have small children that might want to pull on it. How nifty!",

      "text": "Very easy to put together and looks great. I was concerned it would be wobbly like ikea furniture, but it is very sturdy and holds all our glassware perfectly. It did come with a slight defect in that the wood was broken by the notch where the leg was suppose to fit, but we had wood glue handy so didn't worry about it. Once the glue dried you can't even see the crack",

Had to glue them and are waiting to see if they hold up. Other wise I'm going to try and return it. Good Luck !",
