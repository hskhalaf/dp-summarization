The bass is really impressive, I have to say it totally compete all my existing head phones and earbuds, including Sennheiser HD598, Denon D1100. The bass is strong but still clear and fast, it won\u2019t mess everything up, you could still hear the details. However, the mid and high is just average. I can\u2019t find any defect though. There is one thing I would like to mention, never ever wear it during a workout! The control on the cord is not water-proof! All in all, this is a great head phone if you like bass very much!",

Since it is the first time I am wearing them, you can get the feeling of rigidity, putting a little pressure on your ears. It does not bother me since I am sure that in time they will loosen up. Other than that I feel them really comfortable, no problem with overheating my ears. I like the yellow cable, looks funky and the jacks feel good quality. I would definitely recommend them! :D",

But soon I realised that the Dolby app for Android glitches in the middle of the songs and after 2 months of very careful usage the \"tested 15 kg cable\" has been broken inside around the control box. Such that the mic and the buttons are not working anymore and foreign noises can be heard in the headphones from time to time. Also some part is moving inside the band, which is probably not good neither. Beside the quality of the app and the cord, I like the sound of these headphones and the foldable design is quite good.",
