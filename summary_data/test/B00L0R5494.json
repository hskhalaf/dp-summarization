That may not be saying much (I own very little makeup), but the shadow is pigmented (especially when wet), easy to apply, and seems to last despite my oily eyelids and prominent hood! I will say that it creases a bit in my hood -- but that's to be expected. I only wish they would offer singles too haha! The shimmery golds and bronzes are nearly tapped out for me because, of all the colors, they are my FAVORITES. I wear them practically every single day. I don't want to buy a whole new palette just for those three though.",

The packaging is great, none of my colors have a cracked or broken, and I think it will last me a long time. Plus there is a gold shimmer in the palette and it is so beautiful, I absolutely love it.
