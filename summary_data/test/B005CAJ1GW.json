Too soon to tell if anything down the road will need repair, but am counting on that 2 year warranty that comes with bike One con is motion range of the bars, but not so bad to reduce rating. The range is good, but just not like some other longer motion range fan bikes I have seen.",

It is a little loud, it sounds like a window fan, but that's to be expected and I can still hear my tv if I need/want to.

It doesn't much bother me since I am satisfied with the product as a whole, and I'm glad it's fixable without tools.

Yeah, it makes a little wheel fan noise. So what, it's an exercise bike not a piano. You can watch TV or listen to music while riding and the air from the wheel fan helps keep you cool. My bottom line: This exercise bike offers the best value for the money.",
