My only gripe is that the battery takes a long time to charge, and then doesn't last all that long. It's a refurbished camera, so maybe that's a factor. I also subject the poor thing to long periods of continuous use in cold outdoor temperatures, so take from that what you will. I will include some of my best photos taken with this camera - and with a bit of processing applied to them, of course. The images speak for themselves what this thing is capable of.

But it is a good camera that's a bit cheaper than the T6, which I bought after returning this. The principal differences in the two cameras are this one doesn't have WiFi (which in the T6 is practically useless anyway), it has a somewhat slower processor, and the LCD isn't quite as high a resolution. If you don't care about these features, this is an excellent value camera, and is very well reviewed on lots of photo sites.",

This camera also proves that you don't need the best camera to take excellent photos, which it's not. But combining great glass with this camera results in a winning combination. Also, even though its technology is slightly older, you can't beat its price point here on Amazon!",

All photos attached we taken in VERY low light, two with flash and two without flash to give you a sense of how it performs (obviously better with flash). I still need to figure out how to optimize focus and zoom on this camera, so the lack of sharpness in the photos is most likely due to this.
