The mug is bigger than I expected it to be, which is a great thing because I like big mugs! The self-stirring mechanism is actually pretty unique and works quite well! I think this mug is a little hard to clean just becuause you have to be careful not to lose the pill looking stirrer and not to get the batteries wet. Otherwise, I am happy with this!",

The magnetic stirrer kept falling out of place half of the time which made it a hassle to get it back to the center while you have hot liquid in the cup. Would not recommend. Just use a stir stick if you have to, at the very least use a spoon. Not worth the purchase!!",
