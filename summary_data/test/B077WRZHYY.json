The storage cubes are easy to put together but the slightest movement and they fall apart. Once they fall apart you have to remove everything that was in them and rebuild them. The other disappointment was it doesn\u2019t come with enough corner pieces to join them together. I have 8 metal squares with no appropriate parts to join them together. I am very disappointed.",

The wire appears to be a thinner gauge than my older set and a couple of the ends are loose. Even the little wood hammer included was cracked with a splintery handle.

My best description of this is that it is a little worse than a tightly-assembled Lego set. What I mean is that things snap into place, and with some force you can force it together fairly tightly, but try to pull on it and it comes apart. If you put books on it, the structure will also deform a little. In general, it does what I want, and I think I'm happy with the stability, but like I said, it's not rock solid or anything.",

These arrived in a timely manner and packaged decently! All 69 panels arrived and aside from one panel that had one piece loose, they were all perfect. The clips that are meant to hold the pieces together are very sturdy, but I chose to use cable ties, to make it more durable for my rabbit. I am absolutely impressed with how much these cubes are able to hold and the price was the best that I found! I would definitely recommend these to anyone!",
