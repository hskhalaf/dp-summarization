Here's why: It Stinks! Literally. The first time is got slightly damp, it developed a smell, which transfers to your hair when you use it. Several washings were not enough to remove the smell from the brush. I have been much happier with the $5 Conair Boars Hair Brush that I picked up from my local store (and unlike this brush, which has half nylon bristles, the cheap Conair one is made up of 100% boars hair bristles, and is smell free!).",

If you don't need it so big perhaps the smaller version of this same GranNaturals brush (which is also on Amazon) is better for you. It's good quality apart from a slight burnt tire smell of the slightly curved rubber pad that holds the base of the bristles in place. The bristle hair itself is very firm which I like because I like the scratchy feeling on my scalp. If you don't like scratchy bristle strokes on your scalp when you brush your hair, you should probably look for a softer brush somewhere else.",

I had a Denman boars hair paddle brush and bought this brush because while I was cleaning the Denman I accidentally pull a lot of the bristles out rendering it unusable...and glad I did. I LOVE this brush. If you need a paddle brush and want the best, get this one ''''''''''''",

It does take a little bit of effort to get the bristles all the way to my scalp, so I just work in sections. Occasionally I get a little static, and occasionally I get a bristle that falls out. I've never used a boar bristle brush before, I know some people that have and their hair always looked amazing and healthy, but I've got nothing to compare to as far as if this is a good brush compared to what else is out there. I haven't really noticed a difference in my hair yet.",
