Smaller than I expected but sturdy with a solid build. The guide notch behind the charging port makes dropping the Switch in very easy. Although smaller than I thought, I love the size for its portability which is what the Switch is all about. Going forward, Nintendo should just include this in the box. Highly recomended",

It's small enough to fit most Nintendo Switch cases, so if you have a case that doesn't have a \"built-in stand\" and you don't want to use the console's built-in stand, this is a something to consider. I don't recommend charging your Switch with this thing because the stand can easily get moved around by a charging wire, which may cause your switch to fall down. However, the stand is completely stable for holding a Switch as long as you don't connect it with a wire.",

Although it doesnt fall out and continues charging. It hang in a very precarious fashion and i feel is unsecure. With that said its still a great product and much like the seitch itself has a few minor flaws. (The switch charging port being on the bottom).",
