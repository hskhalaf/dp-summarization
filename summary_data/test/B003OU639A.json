At 18mm, I can take a full body image of a person standing three feet in front of me, while zooming out to 135mm allows amazing clarity and focus on far-away items. The focus is fast and quiet, and the lens is intuitive. This is a great all-around lens for someone that only wants to use one lens on their camera, and shoot in multiple areas.",

      "text": "I bought this to improve my range and image quality over the stock lenses - 18-55mm and 75-300mm and the result was visible from the first shot onwards. As with any IS/AF lens, it amazingly fast on focus and handles very well in moving object. I am a pilot and the IS feature is must have for me and believe me compared to Nikon's VR, Canon is a lot better, but that's just my opinion. One suggestion I give it on all my reviews on lenses is to purchase a good quality UV filter to go with it. I also have a lens hood for this lens. These will really protect the lens and you will thank me later :))",

I had the original lens it came with, EFS 18-55mm and a lens which I bought along with it a year later, EF 75-300mm III USM; both are not IS !!!!! Stabilization makes a big difference!!! Even when your hand is shaking a little it helps tremendously! For $300 this was a no-brainer to get immediately!!! If anything happens to this lens I will update! If no updates, means this lens is working superbly! Hope this helps! p.s. It is no more heavier than my second lens; does not bother me!",

I sure don't, so I bought this lens. I have used this one a lot and I'll use it more. The only reason I give it 3 stars is that it's so freaking heavy. Holding this thing for 300+ shots for a photo shoot, you're going to feel it afterwards. I do wish that I skipped this one and bought the 85mm f/1.8 instead. I do portrait photography, so the 85mm would work better for me than this one. I like fixed lenses more than I like zoom.",
