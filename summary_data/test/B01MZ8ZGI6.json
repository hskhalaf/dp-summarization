We put a very little amount of time into this title before selling it off. Perhaps if we had stuck with it longer, we would have gotten a better sense of how the controls worked.",

It\u2019s a fun game, it\u2019s unique and shows off the Switch\u2019s abilities with the joycons and being able to take the system and play anywhere. However, the novelty wears off after a couple play throughs and since the game only has a couple single player mini games you\u2019ll find 1-2 Switch sitting on your shelf more than it\u2019s getting played. It reminds me a lot of Wii sports, cool at first, but how many times can you possibly play motion control bowling without it getting old? At least Wii sports was a pack in title.",

The party mode is just a simple board game that randomizes the mini games and has two teams fight against each other, but it's more fun to just pick your mini games from the screen.

      "text": "Most of my friends wanted to play what we saw on the ads, weird things like milking cows, breaking into a safe, runway model... But when we first started up the game, we didn't see any of those games. And we couldn't play the ones we did want in the limited roster. So, we just ended up not playing it. At all. So, tis game is a dud at first. We are guessing we can unlock the other games but we've just not gotten to it yet. It's not inspiring us to try.",

Unfortunately you cannot refund games, which is silly because it encourages developers to not even try. Seriously! My 5 year old did not even have fun. The only reason I had fun was because it was so funny laughing at how dumb and repeptive the games were. Example, milk a cow....)",
