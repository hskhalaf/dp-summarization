Single units are the way to go. The overall quality is very good. These are aesthetically pleasing to look at. The one design issue I have is that they failed to make the locking detent significant enough to ensure the unit stays attached to the mounting plate so it can easily pop off the mount and fall. I came up with my own fix for this which solves that problem.",

Once up and filled, they need to be primed. They're not going to just immediately start giving you product. I suggest pumping and holding a finger over the hole and that creates the suction and you'll soon be enjoying their convenience. Just make sure the bathroom is moisture free and stays that way for a few hours afterwards. Stuff needs to cure after installation. Totally recommend.",

Luckily it didn't break - props for solid workmanship. We then installed into the grout using screws and anchors and they're very solid now.

Normally that would allow all the suction to draw thicker soap into the chamber. This allos air to come back in through the output, and obviously the air is easier to pull in than soap.
