      "text": "I love Drunk Elephant and use them every day and my skin glows. I'm 46 and have no crows feet etc. Alot of that is thanks to Protini which has a growth factor. I was done with face oils until I tried DE Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil. I was absolutely amazed with how it disappeared in my skin and now I'll never go without it!! I'm so thankful to have found Amazon's Quiverr as they are the only place verified by DE so anyone wanting authentic DE products I only recommend Quiverr or DE site.",

I used to think that way too because of adult acne. I've tried other oils, but this is far superior. I use this at night and when I wake up in the morning, my skin is glowing. Some of their products may seem a bit pricey, but the quality and results are enough to justify the price. I only wish I would've tried this line sooner. Highly Recommended",

      "text": "Love everything about this oil. I normally hate oil on my face, but this stuff absorbs pretty quickly! And you only need a drop or 2 for your entire face. After using this at night, I woke up the next day and my face had such a healthy feeling. I can\u2019t even describe it. It felt so soft and supple. I\u2019ll only use this twice a week since I don\u2019t have extremely dry skin. But it\u2019s well worth the investment. Just a tip to save you money...if you use the entire drunk elephant line, don\u2019t waste your money on this! Every single product contains Marula Oil. So you\u2019re getting the exact affect by using their other products.",

I'm not going to say I look younger or less wrinkled. But I do look a more awake and rested version of me. Plus a very little goes a long way. I use it morning and night (and whenever I clean my face) and a container lasted 5 months.",

I thought it was great at first, but after a few months... disaster! The 30 day window is not enough time to give this product a thorough try. So, my first bottle poured $40 down the drain!",

It came out balanced with no dripping and immediately I was feeling great and peacefully fell asleep..This Drunk Elephant facial oil is amazing. I suggest trying this facial oil because I didn\u2019t feel greasy when I put it on and couldn\u2019t see it when I woke up. This is a luxury I can afford just because I\u2019m worth i and it works.",

    "description": "Size:0.5 Fl OzTHE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE\nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation.\n\nVIRGIN MARULA LUXURY FACIAL OIL (30ml/1 fl oz)\nVirgin Marula Oil is cold-pressed using a patented process of unheated water extraction, ensuring the oil remains nutrient-dense and stays fresher longer. Drunk Elephant doesnt cut, bleach or deodorize, nor do they add scented essential oils. Highly absorbable, Virgin Marula Oil delivers advanced defense against environmental stressors and free radicals.\n\nNO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesnt have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent.\n\nBREAK THE CYCLE\nYour skin is left vulnerable with the overuse of harsh exfoliates, chemical peels, expensive laser treatments, Botox abuse, layered foundations and powders, and chemically-laden beauty creams. Theres nothing wrong with an occasional beneficial beauty splurge here and there (when appropriate), but it can be a vicious cycle that is hard to stop.\n\nCOMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skins health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. Youll never find the Suspicious 6 (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrances/Dyes and SLS) in their products.",
