They took two weeks to respond to my initial \"case\" and only offered basic solutions like unplugging and resetting the device. Nothing worked and when it finally came time to get the unit repaired I was told they could not help me because I bought it through a 3rd party retailer on Amazon. Their product failed and they should stand behind it. How could I possible know that the manufacturer wouldn't cover the product if it was defective?

So I asked for and received another rsb-11 soundbar. The second one was as defective as the first. Only now a high pitched whining sound came from the far left speaker. So Amazon has no more rsb-11 soundbars available. I have ordered one directly from Klipsch but have to pay for two-day shipping. We'll see if the third time is a charm.",

This is probably not going to meet a true audiophile's pallet, but these are good enough to where you can really hear some quality sound.

It would have ample volume when streaming from an iPhone through a BT connection, so no problem with amplifier power, but could not handle the decoding of digital audio with the same HDMI ARC connection that Klipsch has no problem with.

      "text": "Well based on all the 5-star reviews I purchased this Sound Bar. Very disappointing. Straight out of the box the Sub-woofer didn't work. It only made a static-scratchy sound with an occasional pop. While trouble shooting the problem I just listened to the sound bar. Very underwhelming, my TV speakers sounded better. I tried different programs, dolby, non-dolby, TV programing, DVD, all very poor sound. I had never tried Klipsch before but had always heard good things. I'll never try them again.",

It connected to the bar, but the sound was terrible- crackles, noises, that\u2019s all I got after 3 attempts! The subwoofer was BROKEN! Called Amazon- they have no problems taking the whole system back, but all I really wanted is the working system- maybe sending me a new subwoofer should have been an option???",
