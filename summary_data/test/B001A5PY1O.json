I have put about 50 single track miles on it so far and there is no visible wear even after going across multiple sharp edged rocks. I would recommend this tire for loose over hard pack, and rocky areas. while it does not have a high roll resistance, it is not a great tire if you use your bike on streets.

The rear tire lasted me about a year and a half and I still have about half the tread on the front tire. I ride often, around 600-700 miles during this time-frame. The tires hookup well when climbing and hold in tight turns. Just bought a couple more for replacements.",

Long story short, I wanted to try this tire after using Kenda Nevegal (26x2.35) for three years because of the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, the tire of same size (26x2.35) is considerably smaller than the Kenda one. Now, I guess tires depend on one's designated bike usage, but I would not use this tire for any attempt of fast descending. Kenda, in my perspective, provides much better support for moderate DH, jumps, roots, etc.",
