      "text": "I bought this automatic food feeder as a birthday gift for my daughter, a busy young woman being away from home a lot. The biggest worry she had was her two dearest cats being hungry. She was super excited to get this and deeply impressed by all the functions it has. It is easy to set up and schedule the right portion size and time as your own desire. It can record your voice by calling their names. It has plug in or battery choice. And further more, it is easy to clean. Looking at my happy and worry free daughter, I bought the second one for her!",

I keep this by my cats litter box for the stinky poo and it works perfectly. I ordered another for my back bathroom. I have a septic tank and if u throw feminine products down my toilet it will clog. I will have one of these in the stall for that purpose. I host all the holiday dinners and the gals will know what to do or they can write me a check on the way out for the plumber! lol..",

      "text": "It matches the oil rubbed bronze hardware in my remodeled half bath. We have dogs, so we have to have a covered trash can. It is small so it fits nicely. Has an inner liner that can be removed and washed, and you can purchase simple human bag liners that fit perfectly if you wish. There is only one feature it doesn't have that I miss--I had an older chrome, similar style trash can that had a handle in the back for lifting it up. This can does not have that. It's not a big deal, but the addition of that handle would make it more perfect for me.",

Apparently, the 6L version doesn\u2019t get its own individual box, so you\u2019ll want to check for dents/dings when they arrive. Otherwise, the cans look great! I had read that they are loud when you close the top, but with the plastic bags they are fairly quiet. The plastic bag cushions against / dampens any sound. I give the product 5 stars but the shipper 3 stars, so the product will get 4 total. The trash can company should provide 6L version with its own box, just like they do for 10L version.",
