      "text": "Like other positive reviews here. This came in flawless and the trackpad works like a dream! I had one of these brand new from a different website and that one had not only a bad trackpad, but it also had problems with the screen. In dark scenes on any video it was pixelated and there were artifacts. I watch the same videos with this and they play perfectly. There's not one thing lacking from this laptop as far as features and specs are concerned. For this price, its's a steal. Although, it did jump up $20 since I bought. I got it for $599. Give it a shot!",

I have been using it for about two weeks now and it seems to have started showing signs of the mouse freeze issues. Reading suggests that this is an issue with a grounding wire that can big fixed. I am going to try and contact the vendor for assistance on this if it can be fixed will update the rating to a 4. Not sure yet if it does deserve 5 but it could seems like a nice machine and it is very portable and comfortable to use.",

Very little exposure on this device which had me concerned at first. Until, there was a unanimous word of caution that i kept seeing in tech support forums. The touch pads grounding wire had a bad solder joint. The original owners that paid full price ran into this defect and returned the laptop and was eventually repaired and resold as refurbished. What does this means for me and you?? A beautiful and flawless laptop for half the price! this machine exceeded my expectation.",

Otherwise it is an awesome laptop that runs well and fits my needs perfectly. Also as a side note the build quality is fairly cheap so do not buy it for clumsy people or children. if you have ever cracked a smartphone screen i would be wary of buying this since they used cheaper build materials to keep the price low. I got it for the 4k screen and the 4-8 hour battery life with a convertible option and these 3 features i am happy with the most.",
