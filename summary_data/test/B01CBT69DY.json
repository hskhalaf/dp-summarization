The downside is the coals are close to the grill plates. You also cannot adjust the distance from the coals.When cooking meat that needed slower cooking. I compensated by searing then using indirect heat on one side of the grill plus using smoking chips to get the flavor I like. The gas worked really well.",

Once the trays are in place with bolts, then go back and tighten up all remaining nuts and bolts. This way your assembly will be strong and firm.",

      "text": "First...this item comes completely disassembled. You will need to have two people working on it so when one of you becomes frustrated the other can forge ahead...only to storm off later in the approx 3 hour assembly process. Once it's put together, it's awesome. Seriously, it's a great grill for the cost. Once it IS put together it feels sturdy. The lid is solid. The side burner is actually quite stable and a great flame, though I have never every used the side burner. I'm sure it's fantastic. I am happy to have purchased and would certainly do so again.",
