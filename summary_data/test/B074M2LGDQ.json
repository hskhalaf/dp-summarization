      "text": "I've purchased two of these sets for our children over the last two years. It's one of our favorite family toys. That said, the newest set contained only 2 real, glass marbles. The rest were plastic! You have to put them together yourself and they are too lightweight to roll freely down the run. The plastic \"marbles\" are a cheap waste of materials and utterly useless in my opinion. If you buy yourself a bag of dollar store glass marbles to go with it, you'll be all set to have hours of fun with your kids. It would get 5 stars from me if the manufacturer provided all glass marbles and eliminated the plastic marbles all together from the set.",

Some pieces don't fit together tightly but most of them do. Kids have to be gentle or it falls apart at the looser joints. Kids are enjoying it and I think it is fun too. My only real complaint is that the 5 glass marbles are really tiny and the plastic snap together marbles are worthless so buy real 5/8 glass marbles if you don't have any. I am already thinking of buying another set to expand it.",

      "text": "I got this for my son for his 5th birthday and he really enjoyed building the track and running the marbles down. He was the one begging for it because he has one at his preschool that they have to share. He spent at least couple of hours on the first day ... 30 mins or so everyday in the first week, then got distracted by his Nintendo Switch (Mario Cart) and hasn't touched this since.. Grandparents always get the better toys, that's all I have to say. :P p.s. the marbles come with the track are of smaller size, I would be careful if you have toddlers or pets at home.",
