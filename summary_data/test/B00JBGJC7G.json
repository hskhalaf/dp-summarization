      "text": "I enjoy detailing my SUV weekly, but dragging the buckets around gets old fast. Most of the 2 bucket carriers are pricey. The Bucket Buddy works quite well to move full/heavy buckets quickly and easily. I would have given it 5 stars, but the design of the base, with the buckets sitting on a single cross piece, is not as steady as I would like. I added a couple of inexpensive foam pieces between the bucket and the ring which helps a lot.",

This is my 2nd set, I had to have two more for Pea Gravel. Assembly was fairly easy (I am 75 but do a lot ) the only thing I found was that when you need to file because I found burrs and when I tried to screw it together it would not fit, just go around each hold with your file.",

      "text": "This is a phenomenal tool. I use this performing a two-bucket wash when detailing my cars. It reduces the time required to perform a wash by not wasting steps returning to the buckets and not wasting effort lifting and moving buckets. I used some Loctite 242 (aka Blue Loctite) on the bolts when I assembled my unit to assure they would not come loose over time but still be able to unbolt them if needed. Note that the tires will initially have a strong odor when you first unpack the unit, so I recommend assembling this is a well-ventilated area. The odor dissipates after a few days. If you enjoy detailing your cars, buy this!",

Inside are a few metal pipe pieces and three nuts / bolts to assemble. The item was easy to assemble. The holes for the bolts are slightly too small and some hammering had to happen to get them to fit. A little bit poor quality control on that avenue. Other than that it was fine. It took maybe 10 minutes tops to assemble. The cart works great and is exactly what I imagined it would be. The buckets do not come with the kit.",
