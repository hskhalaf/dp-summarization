I compared these to the Gel-Nimbus I am currently wearing and there really is no comparison. These look like my Nikes which cost me 1/3 as much. These are going back. Way overpriced for what they have become. I am continuing my quest to find an athletic shoe closer to what the Gel-Nimbus used to be.",

The fit was about right since I've learned to buy these a size larger than I need. Plenty of room by the toes without being sloppy. What surprised me though was that these weren't as cushioned as my last pair (which were 16's), but since I went a size large there is plenty of room for an insert. They feel good and I'll buy another pair when these are used up...just hope the \"21's\" are a little softer in the heel.",
