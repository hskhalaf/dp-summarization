      "text": "UNBELIEVABLE! Read this first before purchasing ANY Shark Vacuum products. I purchased a new Shark on January 22 of this year. Less than a month later, the roller brush stopped working. It is frozen and no trouble shooting tips would get it to work. So, I called Shark. They had no fix for this but they are willing to sell me a replacement part - replacing the entire head of the vacuum. Apparently, this part of the vacuum is not covered under their warranty and it makes no difference at all that I have owned this vacuum for less than 3 weeks. I will not be purchasing from this company again.",

The brush stopped working prior to that so I was just checking the belt but it was fine. Their best offer was to sell me another unit at a discounted price of $130 but I declined. I believe the switch went bad but they will not service that and part is not available from the manufacturer. It all seems a little rinky-dink to me.",

The brush won't turn and the suction is still too high so it is very difficult to move. Even worse- my other area rug is a higher pile- nowhere near shag but still high pile; essentially plush carpet. My Dyson Animal will vacuum it with no problem. The brush on this vacuum kept turning off. Essentially, this product is made for commercial carpet or Berber. I'm not keeping a $190 vacuum just for my stairs.",

So, when I went looking for a replacement I didn't want to break the bank but still wanted one that would hold up for more than a year. This Shark is the best vacuum I have ever had!

The only things I don't like about it are the cord (you have to manually wrap it up) and the fact that it's a bit unwieldy. It doesn't always stay upright and I end up dragging it around, and it's a bit awkward to carry and otherwise move. It also doesn't include a small surface cleaner, which I really need.",

Super easy to clean and maintain. As long as you maintenance the wheel (cutting off long hair/string/etc) and wash the filter regularly, it is ALWAYS amazing at picking up hair. I have a husky and a cat, and this thing is a godsend. It's great for hard to reach areas, as it's detachable in so many different places. Four stars for the hardwood floors as I still have to go back over with a broom to get everything, but it still does an awesome job!",

I may update this review, once i have been able to contact the manufacturer. Remains to be seen if I will be satisfied. Called Shark this morning, and the \"hero\" should have indeed been included in the packaging. Company sending out at no charge. Could not be more satisfied at Shark customer service.",

The twisting head gets under raised bookcases so I don't have to move furniture. It also cleans right up to the baseboards so there's no hand sweeping required. No appliance I've ever owned has lived up to expectations as well as my new Shark. I highly recommend this vacuum cleaner.",
