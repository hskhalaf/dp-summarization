Ill keep it throw it in a shave kit but I don't think Ill use it much.",

The scent is probably the big selling point. If you like cedar wood, you'll like this! Has slightly more control than just beard oil alone. Was hoping for a little more control of a few stray hairs, hence the 4 out of 5 stars. Maybe I just need to go with a wax or something with grit instead? Anyway, my beard looks and feel great!",
