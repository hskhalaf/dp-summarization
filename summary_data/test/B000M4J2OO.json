      "text": "I've purchased and returned 2 used DSC-T100's from the internet. I own one that I broke. It is such a good camera and since I have all the accessories, I wanted to replace it. Both cameras that I bought used should have been listed as \"Abused\". But, the camera itself that I had was really easy to use with excellent quality photo and movie modes. The tiny memory stick makes it easy to carry extra memory. From what I have seen, the price of this camera for a brand new camera has went up a lot since I bought mine. Be very careful if you buy used. I've spent too much on shipping for nothing.",

I am not a big fan of the touch screen lcd, so I opted for this model and couldn't be happier. If you are not careful with the camera settings, it can create some blurry photos. I highly recommend the box wave anti-glare lcd protector for this camera.",

Extremely compact to fit in your pocket. Everyone that's seen it has been jealous. Absolutely no complaints - except one tiny, tiny thing which is that they should do a little rubberization of the case to allow for surer grip, specifically the sliding lens cover (which is also the on/off switch).",

      "text": "I watched the reviews for this camera, and picked it up since it was so well reviewed. While it was working, it was a great point-and-click camera that we used regularly for travel and real estate work. However, just recently, about 8 months after we bought it, the camera just stopped working. After sending it in to Sony, they claimed it was corrosion damage and not covered by warranty. Given that we are very careful with our cameras and keep them in cases unless they are being used, I was very disappointed with Sony's product and handling of the issue. If the camera is corroded within 8 months of normal use, then it seems it's a product issue.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T100 8MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot (Silver)",
    "description": "Sony Dsc-T100 Silver Dig\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe ultra-slim vertical design of the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T100 camera creates a dramatic fashion statement -- and its 8.1-megapixel resolution, high-powered 5x optical zoom lens, Double Anti-Blur Solution and huge 3.0-inch LCD screen give you great shooting and sharing abilities in compact dimensions that go anywhere with ease. Hi-tech innovations like Face Detection, in-camera retouching and red-eye reduction, D-Range Optimization, and 9-Point AF expand the possibilities of digital photography -- and the HD output lets you share memories with family and friends in spectacular high-definition clarity and detail on compatible HDTV screens. \n\n Cyber-shot DSC-T100 Highlights \n\n Sleek, ultra-slim vertical design With silver-accent case in matte silver, sleek black or chic red, the DSC-T100 looks like no other digital camera -- and fits your lifestyle as easily as it slips into your pocket, briefcase, purse or handbag. \n\n 8.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD More megapixels give you more detail and definition when you make big prints or crop in tight on your subject. The advanced Sony Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. \n\n Carl Zeiss 5x optical zoom lens With 5x power to zoom in on our subject, this ingenious Carl Zeiss lens design brings you closer to the action -- and optical zoom also operates in movie mode, so the DSC-T100 can follow family sports action with ease. Macro and Magnifying Glass modes are also provided for super-sharp close-ups and miniature hobby photography. \n\n Face detection By automatically controlling focus, exposure, color and flash, this new Sony feature reveals faces in shadow, makes skin tones look more natural and eliminates harsh facial glare -- to help bring out every expression on every face in every shot, so you\u2019ll capture the personalities and emotions that make memories come alive. \n\n Sony Double Anti-Blur solution With Super SteadyShot optical image stabilization and high sensitivity (ISO 3200), the DSC-T100 compensates for shaky hands, minimizes blur, brightens images and allows flash-free shooting to preserve the mood -- and Sony Clear RAW Noise Reduction reduces the picture noise that can ruin low-light shots. \n\n 3.0-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus screen The huge, bright 3.0-inch screen of the DSC-T100 is styled to fit flush against the camera back for a clean-line look, with Clear Photo LCD Plus design to make photos look more natural even in sunlight. \n\n Simple setup controls A touch of the Home button opens your user-friendly GUI -- and you can select functions by simply moving a cursor vertically or horizontally to the appropriate icon. Function names and the on-screen Function Guide display make it easier to learn camera setup operations. \n\n HD output Thanks to Sony, your photo album can go high-def -- with direct HD output to your compatible HDTV screen, so you can share DSC-T100 still photos with family and friends in spectacular high definition clarity and detail. Your life never looked so exciting!\nNote: HD output requires an optional Sony HD connector cable; HDTV sold separately \n\n HD slide show with music. It\u2019s the high-definition viewing experience that makes photos come alive on compatible HDTV screens, accompanied by your choice of visual effects and any of four preset musical selections stored in memory or your favorite MP3 tunes downloaded from PC to your camera for use as background music. \n\n 9-point auto focus Because an off-center subject can make your shot more interesting, the DSC-T100 can measure auto-focus precision at 9 points on your screen -- giving you greater creative freedom to compose your image. \n\n D-Range Optimization Powered by the exclusive Sony Bionz high-speed processing engine, D-Range Optimization preserves image data in bright highlights and reveals more detail in shadows or backlit areas -- for great results even in difficult lighting conditions. \n\n In-camera retouching The DSC-T100 lets you add creative effects to photos after you shoot -- including soft edge filter to soften backgrounds, cross filter to place starry \"dazzles\" at highlight points, partial color filter to mute surrounding colors, even fish-eye filter to create interesting fish-eye lens effects. \n\n In-camera red-eye reduction Irritating \"glowing eyes\" can ruin even the most creative photos -- so the DSC-T100 provides in-camera correction at the touch of a button to reduce lingering red-eye effect that other systems might miss. \n\n 31 MB internal memory The DSC-T100 allows you to capture a large number of images without a flash memory card, so it\u2019s great for traveling or for quick candid snapshots. \n\n Memory Stick Duo media convenience A built-in slot accepts optional Memory Stick Duo media or Memory Stick Pro Duo media -- the compact, high-capacity storage media that make it easily to upload photos to your computer or make lab-quality prints at home on your Sony Picture Station digital printer (sold separately). \n\n 25x Smart Zoom feature The Sony Smart Zoom feature intelligently \"crops into\" the central portion of interest in your photo, avoiding the image degradation of other digital zooms. \n\n MPEG Movie VX Fine Mode Captures VGA (640 x 480) audio/video clips at high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second), with length limited only by the capacity of your media. \n\n Stamina battery power The DSC-T100 provides up to 340 shots with a fully-charged NP-BG1 Lithium-ion battery -- enough shooting capacity to cover a long weekend or a whole vacation. \n\n Picture Motion browser software Supplied software makes it easier to upload, organize and search photos on your PC -- and provides a convenient map view function to sort photos by location and display their origin on a world map by using an optional GPS unit.",
