Used it frequently; we travel a lot. After it gave out, I used a conventional cooler for a couple months, but realized how convenient and effective the thermoelectric cooler was. Looked at other units but determined that this was the best available in terms of effectiveness and cost, so I bought another one last month. Would rate it 5 stars if my original unit had lasted longer.",

When traveling, it was on the floor behind the driver's seat, and the noise of the fan running was audible, but barely. It runs very quietly, and keeps its contents consistently cold. Well worth the money, and my wife and I are very pleased with its performance.",

This cooler fit perfectly behind the seat and was easy to access while on the road. It was very quite while running and kept everything very cold. The only thing that was an inconvenience was that we couldn't place anything on top of the cooler as it would effect the fan, but that didn't change our opinion on how much we loved this cooler!",

It's unfortunate the temperature drop is so weak because it is great in every other respect.",
