I am going to email the company and ask them to do a men\u2019s line because why not? They\u2019re good and near,y indestructible.. I still have my originals and in years have not broken the black tabs off the sides. Remember when they broke easily..",

Other moms were complaining of blisters from their boots, but I didn't have that problem. They were also cute, probably too cute to wade through a creek, but they were fun and I got compliments on them. Would definitely recommend. I bought the flame colored ones.",

As for the Crocs rainboots, I wish they were more flexible, but I guess this is how flexible rainboots can get. All in all, it was a good purchase.",
