I would purchase again in a heartbeat and have recommended to family and friends they invest in one that fits them as well. Thank you Nikkor",

If you need one lens to carry with you all day--this is the one and I say that not just based off of the zoom coverage within this one lens, but because of the exceptional images that this lens produces. It produces incredibly sharp images at nearly every focal length and aperture. Nearly any lens correction that needs to be done can be done via Photoshop if you shoot in RAW/NEF when opened up on your computer. I've used this lens when I only wanted to carry one lens when covering 24 hour fitness endurance events and it has served me incredibly well.",

I had hopes that it would allow me to shoot at lower shutter speeds, in the dim lighting situations of Churches and receptions. I am amazed at how well this lens increases the overall number of good images. I recommend this product highly to anyone who wants to increase their zoom range and obtain better images in low light. If you use the Fuji S3 camera, as I do, be aware that there is an incompatibility with this lens that can be corrected by Fuji at no cost.",

The VR feature works extrememly well, and makes up for the slow aperture at the long end at least for static subjects.",

If you are going to use it indoors WITHOUT an external flash you will create a SHADOW on your pictures. In the 18mm - 24mm range, the camera's built-in flash is too low to \"look\" over the end of the lens. This will create a shadow on your flashed subject. However, you can zoom in to 24mm and the issue goes away. I love only carrying one lens and the amazing VR technology allows me to take low-level light photos without a tripod.",

      "title": "Best Nikon Lens I've Used",
      "text": "From film days, my favorite Nikon lens was the 24-120 zoom, but the 18-200 beats it. Excellent contrast, great clarity and the vibration-reduction is terrific - I get about 80% of the clarity of a tripod shot with hand-held VR. It's a lot of money, but I'm going to sell a bunch of other Nikon lenses that I don't need any more to pay the Visa bill.",

      "text": "I've been using this lens as my primary with my D50 for almost four months now, and it has rarely let me down. You can't beat Nikkor glass and the range has allowed be to use one lens instead of switching between two. Mostly use it for indoor family shots, with some outdoor / sporting events as well. My only complaint is the location of the focus ring, but that's pretty picky. Overall I highly recommend this lens!!",

I had a Sigma DC 18-200 which worked perfectly fine, but the VR makes all the difference in the world hand holding at slow speeds. Nikon advertises you can shoot up to 1/15 of a second. I was able to even shoot up to 1/13 without any blur. This is well worth the investment.",
