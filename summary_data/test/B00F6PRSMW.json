      "text": "The best sounding headphones I have. Man what a sound, the lows and highs are some what boosted, so not sure how B&W can say they reproduce the sound accurately but no complaints with the sound. I own Senheiser 595 headphones and these headphones blow them away. These are not open back headphone but rather sealed units. A little on the heavy side but very comfortable. It comes with a cable to be used with a cell phone and works fine with my Iphone 6 Plus and comes with a second cable to be used just as headphones. The Iphone 6 powers the headphones with no problems and is plenty loud.",

If you're choosing between these and Beats by Dre, choose these. As a hip-hop aficionado I will say they lack slightly in the bass they provide, but after I paired a headphone amplifier with them I then realized that these are the best things ever. They feel like little fairies are dancing around in your ear and tickling all the right spots.",

This combination is far beyond anything I've ever heard. The clarity, separation, and fidelity across the whole range is simply amazing. No amount of hyperbolic praise would even do it justice. Get a pair of these (and a Dragonfly if you don't have one) and you will be absolutely blown away.",

Clarity and balance are unparalleled. Comfort is near perfect, and likely will be once I get a second to figure that out. These are the most complete solution to listening you'll need.",

Bass is tight, vocals are precisely defined, and there's a wonderful sense of space, balance and clarity across the whole frequency range. At the same time, the over-ear design and snugly-fitting ear pads ensure you become completely immersed in your listening. Because when you're hearing sound this good, you don't want anything to interrupt your enjoyment.",

      "With P7, we have created a headphone driver that works more like the drive unit in a hi-fi speaker, with a diaphragm focused purely on the job it's supposed to do: generate sound. Which means a drive unit with a more precise, controlled movement. Connectivity Technology: Wired",
      "P7's ear pads feature a dual cavity cushion design that helps the pads mold to the contours of the wearer's head. This design maintains a consistent volume of air between the drive unit and the surface of the ear at both sides of the head.",
