I am not small and we have a full bed and this has been fine. It has really helped me sleep! I am 23 weeks pregnant and the past couple weeks have been more difficult for sleeping. This pillow has helped me to sleep comfortably on my left side and stay tilted when I'm on my back with my legs up. I love it! Only complaint would be that it is warm, but nothing other than that. It is soft and comfy, not too firm. Love it!",

Because you're able to tuck it them under your stomach, back, and legs to the degree of support you want where this pillow does not. Positive, it is firm but it also hinders good contouring to your body... Wish I could return it.",

Then it became useful for support all over. It was a little awkward to get out of for those mid-night pees, especially as I got bigger, but I eventually developed a sort of roll to get out of it. I didn't keep it post-partum so we had more space on the bed, but I remember this pillow fondly and recommend it to everyone.",

I wanted one again for myself without taking \"his\" so now have the light blue as well. The gray one does a better job at hiding fuzzies, but both are comfy!

This product is for more than just a good nights rest.",

      "text": "First time after 2 babies, that I bought this. I thought it was going to work with me bc I usually do sleep with multiple pillows at night. However it didnt. I feel like it was too big and bulky. Which I get it, its supposed to be a body pillow. But I ended up buying a smaller one that I could just place underneath my bump while I sleep on my side. This pillow was too big and bulky for me. I also didnt like how much space it took on my bed. Lol I ended up giving it away to my brother.",

I bought this pillow to help to keep me on my side and it worked great. I ended up using it throughout my whole pregnancy last year. It started to get a little lumpy (after over 2 years of use), so now I\u2019m on my second one. It\u2019s so much cheaper than competitors but just as good, if not better. Highly recommend.",
