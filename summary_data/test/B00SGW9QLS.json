My advice is to just buy a stand that has a front facing piece of plastic or pole to rest them on with a sturdy base.",

It held on too tightly so much so that whenever I wanted to use my headphones I'd lift the whole stand, My hair gets greasy and so does my headset and the grease from that transfers. If I were to choose, I'd buy the Headphone Hanger Instead. I'm rating it a 3/5 because Amazon Considers 3/5 as \"it's okay\" of a product which I feel it is.",

But, this thing will not stay on its two feet to save its life, it weighs as much as a sheet of paper which makes it fall down EVERY time I get my headphones off of it. I ended up Super gluing the thing right on top of my PS4, so its safe to say its not going any where. So if I where to sell my PS4 it would come with a FREE headphone stand, not only does it keep your headphones neat and clean, it raises the value of your PS4. 4/5",

Also it may look flimsy, but it holds each headset very well and does not move. The price is right to protect your headset investments and looks stylish and simple to boot.",

      "text": "Did some searching, and this is the best bang for your buck. There are reviews of people saying it isn't sturdy, but I always put my mic facing up (Astro A10), and it always stays straight and still. The plastic material is nice, and doesn't really scratch or wear too easily. The black is clean and smooth for your headset to stay put without wear-down. A good product, and I recommend it.",

Looks great on his desk and works as a nice stand, I got the clear/translucent kind which is short and wide making it sturdy yet still light weight. No more dropping headphones off the arm rest even though he still does that...lol I highly reccommend!",

The ability for me to keep the headphones in the open position while on standby prevents me from having to close the headphone repeatedly after each use (therefore decreasing wear and tear). A great buy and reasonable price.",
