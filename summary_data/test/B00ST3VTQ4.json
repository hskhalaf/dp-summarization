      "text": "I bought this ph meter for indoor hydroponics. Calibration was simple and straight forward. The meter was easy to use and seemed accurate and consistent. Much better than the cheap $10 meters. I ended up breaking the glass electrode 2 months after purchase... (the probe is nicely protected but i still managed to smack it against a hard surface) I emailed the manufacturer looking to purchase a replacement electrode. They answer quickly and said they can't supply a replacement part but would like to send me a brand new replacement meter, for free, no questions asked. (just needed the original order number) Now that is great customer service. I'll look into dr.meter for any future needs before i go elsewhere.",

It's impossible to line up the pins and mine bent and that was that. I am an idiot for not reading the directions thoroughly first, but WHY WHY WHY is that part even openable if you can't get it back together?! I didn't manhandle it at all and was very gently trying to get it back together but it was really impossible to do. Be careful.",

If you are going to use this regularly, then I would recommend popping for a good one or verifying you can get the replacement probes.",
