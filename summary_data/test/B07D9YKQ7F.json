They are very small but great training treats (and are heart shaped...so cute!). I keep them by the door for when she rings the bell, goes outside, then goes potty. I also bring them in a bag when we go on a walk to train her when we see other people/dogs, as she is a rescue and is scared of other people and animals. Very pleased with these. A brand I trust and nice size treats that my dog is motivated by!",

They have a good smell so I use them for nose work (training to find things by scent). I like them because they don't contain corn, wheat, or soy. They also have no chicken or poultry byproduct meals. There's no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors.",

      "text": "My furbabies (2dogs and 4cats) like these treats which makes me very happy but the peices are so small. I think these treats are only for training purposes. When I gave them the treat, they looked at me and said what's this, are we broke, did we run outta money, where's the rest of the treat. I agree with them where's the rest of the treat?? I mean this tiny little bag costs $9. I saw that it is Blue Buffalo Chicken Bits but I thought the Bits were bigger than what was in the bag. I love Blue products for my babies but I won't be buying these Bits again cause they are too expensive",

Wild canines do not have smoke houses, as best I know. Their domesticated cousins don't need \"flavor enhancement\" in their food that may be carcinogenic.",
