Then I found these and they are so easy to use, I was able to use two a day, morning and evening, for as long as it took (without sweating the cost) to determine my LH surge. It was clear the night I had my first positive result, woke my husband up and am now 5 weeks pregnant!! Gave them to my best friend who is also ttc cause they're now the \"Lucky Strips\"",

So, a faint line in the test area indicates there is LH in the urine, but likely not a surge consistent with pre-ovulatory levels. However, this leaves a little bit of interpretation up to the user. Thus, it is important to triangulate these results with other data (such as basal body temperature and cervical secretions) in order to achieve an accurate understanding of when you are ovulating.",

I like being able to view the result line in comparison to the control line, as opposed to just a smiley face or yes/no test. That way I can see when I get an almost positive result days before the definite positive. Would buy these again!",

      "text": "Tried other OPKs from Amazon and were possibly missing the mark because of them - or maybe it just wasn\u2019t our time. In any case, I bought Pregmate in April and we\u2019re now 5 weeks pregnant! It\u2019s July 7th as I\u2019m writing this. Very easy to use, obviously they were accurate, easy to read because it\u2019s wider than others, and the instructions inside were also helpful. Overall probably the best quality OPKs available on Amazon. Buy these! One last thing, we baby danced every other day in between my period (but waiting 3 days after period ended) and I think that really helped us to conceive. Most importantly, lots of prayer and faith in God!",
