The seat makes it easier to put shoes on without sitting on the floor which I used to. The racks wont fit tall shoes like my work boots so I just put it right next to it. The assembly was easy but tedious.",

It has to be assembled but it's pretty easy, it takes 15-20min and the instructions are pretty straight forward. The only thing you will need that's not included is a screwdriver, only for the final step. Once assembled it's light and sturdy, good quality materials.",

Putting it together is a pain because you have to align 8 bars to fit in 8 holes simultaneously. I found this was easiest done by fastening everything to one side, laying that side on the floor with the bars sticking up vertically, and then putting the other side on top. I used an electric driver so drilling holes into the top wasn't necessary. I can't justify taking off a star for 10 mins of annoyance considering how great this bench is for the price.",
