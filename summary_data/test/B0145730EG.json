I've rented trail bikes here in the Northwest and while this isn't a $1000 bike, it's as good as any of the $300 - $400 bikes for a lot less. We pretty much ride beach and mild trails, so the weight doesn't both us. Also, shipping was great, customer service has contacted me if I need any assistance. The only reason I'm taking it to local shop is because I need some misc gear and they know their stuff better than me.",

But I don't understand how a bigger chainring than should be on it (by far I might add) makes sense. Or 190mm hub spacing and 100mm rims on 3.8 tires. Final thing, the forks don't have lawyer tabs and the dropouts are backwards. Tabs aren't a big deal but reversed dropouts is puzzling. Made a couple changes to it for my son to lower the gearing and shed some weight. He likes it and much more usable now.",

The directions are for more than one model of bike so it takes some time to find the right set of directions. The tires are huge, if your not use to it your feet or leg will brush up to the tire when making sharp turns. Since the tires are so big you might want to get a shorter bike than you might normally get, to accommodate for the fat tires.",

The disc brakes don't exactly stop on a dime, but that might improve with some additional adjustment. Comes mostly assembled and while not terribly difficult to finish, you do have to ensure you get the wheels straight and true for the disc brakes to engage properly. I've only taken it around the block a couple of times, but shifter seemed to work well. Fat wheels do make more noise, but not enough to complain about.",
