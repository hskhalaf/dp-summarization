Also, the convenience of being able to attach the wheel directly on the cage would be wonderful, but it seems it will only fit if the cage is on the thinner side. Mine is coated and a little thick/sturdy so it would not fit.",

I love that it has a solid running surface so there is no chance of an accident like with the barred ones. And all of my hamsters have loved running on them. They are not silent (no wheel really is) and they do get louder over time when the axel starts to wear, but they're not that expensive, so I just buy another one when it gets too loud.",

Solid plastic so they won't hurt your rodent's feet, reasonably quiet, easy to clean, easy to fix with a little olive oil if they get squeaky, and they turn very easily. My rats, syrian hamsters and dwarf hamster have all loved them. The only trouble I've had with them is that a lot of rodents like to chew the center piece that keeps the wheel on, so at some point you do wake up to the wheel part sitting face-down on the floor of the cage, but... that's rodents for you. I've bought a bunch of these and I'll stick by them.",

But it was too big, so after some research I landed on this one. But heard bad remarks about it for center thing catching to hair. Needless to say that was not the problem in our case. Its high enough to not cause any back arching, or to even catch hair. And best thing so far is its SO quite. Only down fall is it does not attach to bars if you have a cage with bars.",
