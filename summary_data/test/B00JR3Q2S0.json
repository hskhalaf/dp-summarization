      "text": "Just what I needed for summer here in Tennessee. I am 6'1\" about 215 (athletic build) and bought the XL tall. Fits good, snug but not too snug. Armor sits in the right places. Wearing this jacket is like wearing just a T-shirt, air flow is great. Also like the fact that it comes with a rain liner. The zippers can be a little finicky, if I zip too fast they get caught in the mesh, but not enough for me to knock off a star. Looks good also. Joe Rocket is proud of their name. If I could change one thing, it would be removing the big \"Rocket\" across the bottom of the back.",

Zippers are cheap, no internal pocket for sunglasses, side pockets too small for riding gloves, CE elbow pads seem like toys and pocket too low leaving elbow partially protected, and the windbreaker/water resistant liner seemed like the quality of a promotional give away. Also, the zipper and velcro on cuffs didn't work well together, and the waist adjustment wasn't well designed either.",

The material is so shiny that it is glitzy which I hate. It fits poorly with or without the padding. Back pad is impossible for me to wear. In hot weather, it was OK, but when temps dropped below 70F degrees, it was far too cold for riding, even with the liner. In fact, the liner made me sweat, even though I was actually chilly. I prefer my old leather jacket, and even my denim jacket to this. Oh well, too late to return it. Live and learn.",

Also comes with a zip-out liner you can use in the fall to make it warmer. My buddy liked it so much he bought his own.",

My only issues with it are two-fold. One, without the insert, the fabric is a little rough inside, but a long sleeved shirt helps with that. Two, the main pockets are outside of the rain gear, so if you get soaked, what's in your pocket does too, i.e. insurance papers. On a positive note, the rain gear cuts down on wind and makes it very comfortable on cooler days where just removing the wind chill keeps you warmer.",

This jacket is very comfortable, while the extensive armor makes me feel safe.Normally, motorcycle jackets don't fit me well, as they seemed designed for skinny teenagers. This one is comfortable for a portly old man who likes to ride a sport bike. :-) In a pinch, it makes a great pillow to sleep on the floor with. The only downside is the room it requires, the jacket does not pack down well into a saddlebag.. All that armor makes it bulky.",

I live on the Gulf Coast where it is hot most of the year and this jacket is the coolest jacket I have as far as keeping my body temp down. I'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat.",

Once you zip the liner in, I imagine it will keep me dry. It is summer in Texas so I doubt I will see rain anytime soon to test it.",

I did return the first one they sent me because the left sleeve was slightly larger than the right even with the strap pulled down evenly on both sides. Not a huge deal but it drove me nuts. Had no issues returning it and ordered a second one. This one fits like it should. No complaints. It's even comfortable to wear when it's 105. Highly recommended!!",

      "text": "The jacket is VERY visible, which is why I bought it. It's kind of a pain installing the inner liner, then removing it, then installing it, each time the weather turns. The jacket (without liner) is comfortable into the upper 80s -- so long as you're moving! At a stop, you cook. With the liner installed, it's a good fall jacket. Could use a few more pockets. The armor is light weight, but it should prevent the worst road rash in critical areas -- after which you'll need a new jacket.",

If I had gotten a Medium, I'd be swimming in it. It's made very well. Update- It's well made. It survived two trips to the local car wash to clean off bugs and grease.
