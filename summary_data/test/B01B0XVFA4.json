That said, the sellers on Amazon are taking advantage. The reason for all the bent cans is they are cutting a full case of 24 in half, so the cans fall out, and then selling it for almost the full case price. Look elsewhere and you should easily find a full case for about the same price as these Amazon listings. Shame, shame on these sellers.",

This patte style kidney diet food has the perfect ratios of phosphorus and protein to help keep the kidneys from being over-stressed. With that said, I could only get one of my 4 cats to eat this food and she was not the one with renal failure. After 1 week, she refused to eat. I have read mixed reviews about the palatability of Hi-TOR. The general consensus is that your cat either likes it or hates it. Note: The food itself is rather dark and does not smell like traditional cat food.",
