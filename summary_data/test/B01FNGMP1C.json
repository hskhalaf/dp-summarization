I had LG Phones before and was Pleased, I love all the Features this Phone Offers for an Inexpensive Price.

That was the whole reason I bought the phone...to have data while traveling abroad so I could use Google maps. The text and call features worked but the data never did. Consequently, we got lost in London and Dublin and didn't get to do even half of what we had planned. THEN, it randomly ejected the sim card after one day so I couldn't call to get a cab. After that it wouldn't accept the sim card anymore. COMPLETE waste of money and so much time lost on the vacation that I've been planning for three years!",
