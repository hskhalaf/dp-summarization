The box is lovely and wonderfully designed. It comes with two mats, 5 pairs of chopsticks, and 2 rice paddles. I was feeling like a true sushi chef in no time! I definitely recommend wrapping your mats with Saran Wrap so that it protects the quality of the mat over time. I wanted to avoid having the difficulty in removing stubborn rice off the mat. It was so easy to use and really reassuring that I had all the right tools. Highly recommend getting this for home sushi enthusiasts!",

The chopsticks will last a while, love them, but the tools are pretty flimsy. I expect they'll last long enough since this isn't something I'll use too frequently but still. The mats are fine - you'll want to cover them in plastic wrap or something otherwise they'll be tough to clean. You can look up videos online to help! Overall a really fun kit but not something meant to last forever for those that expect to use regularly.",

Just make sure there is enough excess saran wrap that it doesn't get tucked into your roll!

Tip though, I'd wrap the bamboo in plastic wrap so that you dont get rice in the crevices and let rice cool down before rolling! The nori won't \"melt\" and you'll be able yo cut it easier. All in all, great product. The chop sticks are a nice bonus as well. C: I would also watch a few videos before rolling to see technique.",
