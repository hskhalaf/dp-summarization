Her 6 year old brother was also able to join in the fun as the tunnels were plenty big enough for both to be in the toy at the same time. It is also customizable to open or close different tunnels or have \"two\" tunnels side-by-side. My only concern is durability. It seems like thin material so I wonder how long it will hold up.....but it's great for now!",

The brightly colored tunnel was easy to assemble--just unbutton two buttons and it opens up. Also love that when he's not here, we can easily fold it up and put it in a storage sack which takes up very little space.",

It's also surprisingly easy to fold up entirely flat and put it back in it's carrying case. The middle section has open holes on the top and bottom and I just put a blanket over it.",

Comes with little fasteners on each of the 4 tunnels so it\u2019s easy to collapse one or two if you don\u2019t want all four open. There are a few holes that have shown up due to cat claws, but that\u2019s probably to be expected. They haven\u2019t spread or run, just little punctures.

The handy carrying case it comes with is great. I was debating getting a single tunnel but stumbled upon this one and thought it would be better for multiple kids, and it is! They have so much fun chasing each other through the multiple tunnels. My only concern is that the carrying case won\u2019t hold up very well since he gets zipped and unzipped so much. But we will see, so far so good. Great buy!",
