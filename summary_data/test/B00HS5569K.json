I got the ebook before I received the product and the ebook is amazing. It has really good advice including what you should do so hopefully you don't have to use this weapon. The ebook is fully illustrated. The inclusion of the ebook sets this product apart from any other weapon I have ever bought. I can tell that this product was designed by a self-defense expert. Even though I am a trained martial artist, I can say I would not want to mess with anyone carrying this (not that I would ever mess with anyone).",

Also, bing so flat and thin also makes it harder to hold and I'm almost a foot taller than my wife... I'm going to keep looking for a defense weapon for my wife but it does look inconspicuous.",
