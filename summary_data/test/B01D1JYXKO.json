The sanding sticks are coarse, medium and ultra-fine; you probably won't need anything but the medium. The knife body is plastic, not metal, but it gets the job done and comes plenty extra tiny modeling blades. I even used the decal-applicator to flatten decals, you'd be amazed how well they turn out!",

The sanding sticks are a bit large for Gunpla, but they'll work on the easy to access places. Overall a great starting point, this kit + a pack of Squadron Sanding Sticks got me through my first Master Grade without any hiccups. For people building High Grade kits or anything with equal or less parts than a HG, you can expect the nippers and sanding sticks to last for 2-3 builds, but don't expect the sticks to last you through an entire Master Grade, there's just too much sanding if you don't make really good use of the hobby knife.",

Keep in mind that you get what you pay for so don't expect top of the line products. At the same time these are not $1 junk items and are in fact significantly better quality. You could easily pay double if you just buy most of the items in this set individually so the price is definitely right. This set will get you started and if you continue the hobby you will be able to upgrade the pieces you feel are important to you. Happy modeling! :)",

I used some much larger side cutters at first (they were the only thing I had and were likely used to cut coax cable or something) and these are significantly easier to use to get the little nibs off the sides of each piece, and far more comfortable as well. I haven't found much use for the other stuff, but as I work through the model kit, I'm sure I'll have more use for it. I also really enjoy how everything comes in a plastic case.",

The Xacto knife comes with extras in their own bottle that way you can't lose track of them. I highly recommend this kit to anyone that builds Gunpla or any other models.",
