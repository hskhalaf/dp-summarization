After my cat evacuated, he began to drool excessively and foam came out of his mouth. I read the main ingredient in the enema is not toxic to cats but it can cause severe irritation. Bathe your pet extremely well after this and make sure he is not licking itself. This costed me a visit to the emergency room, X-rays, blood work, IV fluids and anti nauseous medication. Spent more money in the ER than what I was trying to save by going to the vet.",
