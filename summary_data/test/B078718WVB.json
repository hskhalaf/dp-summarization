I have purchased this type product, off the shelf, in two different locations here in San Diego, and the nose piece was stronger. When I bent it to shape around my nose, it would be more stable, and would not move as much. Overall, these are O.K. for me, for what I use them for. I use them to prevent myself from getting sinus nasal infections. For over 20 years now, I have had very severe allergic sinusitis. Just about any type odor (pleasant or not) can almost instantly start me on the road to an infection in my nasal area.",

When I bought the house it was under $40 for 100 masks, so for the price these are pretty good. The nose piece stays shaped, where as the other masks even after forcing the nose piece into position , unfolded. The ear loops are not snug, but the other masks were so loose that I had to tie knots in them to be able to wear them. Overall I am happier with these masks than I have been with any of the other ones I\u2019ve tried.",
