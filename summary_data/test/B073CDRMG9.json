      "text": "I bought this Glass Electric kettle because I really like the look of it on my new counter top (the previous one I had was plastic.) It does the job: heats up the water very fast, is easy to fill, easy to pour the hot water out. The lid doesn't come off completely like the previous one but that is not a problem. It has a larger capacity (about 7 cups), which is an advantage because I like to make large pots of tea every morning and i don't have to refill to boil more water. I've been using it several times a day and after 4 months of use I still can't think of any negatives.",

This one is a little more frustrating--it has two clamps on the top of the lid, and you have to squeeze them and pull up to get it open. If you've just boiled water, this is tricky because hot water may splatter around. Overall, it's difficult to win with these. Either the kettle is frustrating and has plastic or silicon glue in places that touch the water as it reaches temp, or you get one with a great kettle design but a rubbish lid. No in-between, sadly.",

Also - it has no temp control and when it boils, it boils for what seems like 2 minutes before shutting off. Who wants overboiled water and a burned hand - not me.",

You cannot tell from any distance if it's properly closed. You must first close the lid, then squeeze both red buttons together, then push the lid down all the way. Nope - you can't just squeeze the two red levers together and close it. Doing that produces an obstruction which prevents closure. It's a two step procedure.",
