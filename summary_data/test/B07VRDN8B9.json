It does come with a quick adapter, but I find the water that comes out very inefficient. The following are non-sponsored links: Diverter I used:  Adapter used:",

I highly recommend that you make sure it's level to ensure it runs smoothly and quietly. It drains fast and you can choose how many wash, rinse and spin cycles you want and for how long. Wash up to 15 minutes and rinse and spin cycle up to 5 each. Very great quality for the price!",

No need for a dryer, wash the clothes at night, hang them up and they are dry by morning most of the time. It only uses powdered detergent, which seems to work better than liquid.

      "text": "The machine worked great for a few weeks but suddenly it started to make very strange noises when it dry spins and I have to stop it because it is the sound of crackling or something which is probably breaking. It is still working fine in the wash cycle but when it goes to dry and spins fast it is completely broken. I don't know what to do or how to fix or return it in this pandemic situation.",
