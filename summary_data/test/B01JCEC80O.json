      "text": "Made a couple malts already with this Cuisinart machine from SpaceBound. It does a better job than my blender. Just be careful not to overfill the container. I disregard the fill line and just use about a cup of milk and two scoops of ice cream. Learned the hard way on the first malt. I clean by using hot water and run the machine on low a few seconds. It's that easy. I keep a folded paper towel under the machine just in case. FYI, I filled the container and it measured 32 oz. I run it on the low setting. On high it tends to spill over.",

It tends to come loose and drop while running which is very messy The old cups had a rim on the base. Since the new cups are deep-draw stampings, It is difficult to provide the rim. One thing... It sure looks good! They probably got as close to the original H-B jadeite color as possible without a law suite.",
