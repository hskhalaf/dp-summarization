The width is commodious (particularly in the toe area which is what is so important to me) ...I normally wear a b-width and these were wonderful. The day they arrived I put them on that morning and wore them all day as it was rainy and cold and I had to be out a good bit and on my feet. They offer great support and your feet do not get wet either from weather or sweat! Oh and I am in my 70s!",

I tried this waterproof version of the Ariat Terrain after two pairs of the other version lasting me over two decades. This pair- less than 1 year. Bought these boots Aug 2017 and by July 2018 they have huge holes in them. They have not had any crazy use, just barn chores. The fit at first is comfortable, but it is much stiffer than the non-waterproof style. I\u2019m bummed these didn\u2019t last at all. What happened, Ariat?",

Living in the Pacific northwest, was skeptical about them being waterproof, but they keep my feet dry and toasty whether I'm in town or walking dogs on wet, muddy trails. Worth their weight in gold!
