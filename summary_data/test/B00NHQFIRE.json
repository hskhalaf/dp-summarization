I am glad that I read reviews before purchasing because I was expecting something much smaller and was pleasantly surprised by the height :) I would definitely recommend this set!",

This set was truly well with the price and has provided endless hours of play consistently since we gave it to my son a month ago. Added bonus, it is shown multiple times on the Lego Avengers Video Game which makes it even more exciting for my son! Lego hit it out of the park with this set!",
