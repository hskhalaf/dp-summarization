I feel the small is the perfect size for someone who will progress quickly and is realistic with their abilities. Just after three sessions I have this bad boy drumming really solid. Being smaller, it also doesn't cause a ton of noise or vibration on my cheaper Everlast station. It works together perfect. It's a great bag, I'll likely be getting additional sizes. Also great to have it be soft enough to use it without hand protection.",

There is no need to be redundant in this review. The many positive reviews say it all and YES, the bag is really that good.",

Titles, ringsides and everlasts hold their air much longer. That said; I have no problem taking a few seconds to pump them up nice and firm.",

I have three up and the two others are the cheaper mex tex. None of my boxers use the Reyes and they prefer the mex tex speed bag. The Reyes was expensive but did not work right to my standard. I have since taken it down and I put it away. Won't buy Reyes speed bags again.",
