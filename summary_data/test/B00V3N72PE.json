It's possible I could have gone with 7 wide but didn't want to take a chance. The true test is longer run 10+ which I will try soon and post updates.",

I have had to come up with a clever way to tie them and will ultimately be adding some heel padding to provide a better grip. The overall construction is high quality, I just don't know where they went wrong with the heel?!",

UPDATE - the (admitedly very small) hole that ripped within the first few days hasn't grown, despite tons of use, which is surprising. It doesn't affect the shoe at all, so doesn't bother me. The shoe fits my orthotics with no problem, letting me still feel like I can move my toes freely. The sole is a bit slippery on a gym floor, but perfect for outside running, and hasn't worn down at all since I've had it. I plan to take these with me on a big hiking excursion to see how they do.",

      "text": "I am hoping I can get used to these shoes. I have worn the New Balance 610V2 and loved them, but the fit on this newer version is completely different. I have wider feet, but usually can fit into a B. This is what I ordered this time, but these shoes are very wide, so much so that they are almost sloppy on my feet. The cushioning is good. I am thinking that if I cannot wear them for running, maybe I can wear them for walking as long as I wear a thicker sock.",

I walk a lot of different trails with my dog and needless to say, my right foot can be a problem! This shoe is very comfortable, so far so good on the trail! Roomy and cushioned, nice purple gray color, love these shoes!",
