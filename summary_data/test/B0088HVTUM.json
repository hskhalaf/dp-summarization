The bucket is fairly well made, though I wouldn't call it rock-solid because it's a plastic bucket, not a bucket made of rocks. It holds liquid fine, the handle is pretty sturdy, and the price was reasonable. As a bucket, it's very successful at being a thing that you can put other things in. My only complaint is that it didn't come with a lid, which would have been nice. If you're looking for a bucket, or some thing to put things in, this works.",
