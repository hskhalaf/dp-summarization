They were among the least expensive acceptable end tables on Amazon, and the fact that they had the retro legs was a plus since it matches some other furniture that I have. The table tops feel nice and solid, even though they aren't real solid wood. Assembly was easy: four screws, screwed in with the included Allen wrench, for each leg. They also included two extra screws, just in case. I'm very happy with these tables for the price.",
