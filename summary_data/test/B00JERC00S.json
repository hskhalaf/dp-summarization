If they are misaligned by even 2 mm you'll get a signficant reduction in force to where the attraction can be easily broken by hand. But this is the nature of the technology, and not a defect of this product in particular. You just need to have some patience and perhaps a few washers or spacer plates as necessary for proper alignment.",

Any mis-alignment however in which the interface between the planes of the magnet face and armature greatly reduces the holding force. The magnetic consumes ~150 to 200 mA and gets warm after being activated for more than one hour. The temperature rise for prolong activation is an open question at this point but is of some concern when it is used close to combustible items such as dry hay.",

      "text": "Do not buy this item. The holding strength may be 5 lbs at best. It have it connected to a 30watt 2.5 amp power unit and it literally cant even hold the door closed under its own weight. 130 lbs is a joke, It can hardly hold the weight of the magnet up on itself. I'm bummed that this waited so much of my time. I made custom brackets for it and spent time getting wire and switches for a custom install that now is all pointless. Amazon should remove this item.",
