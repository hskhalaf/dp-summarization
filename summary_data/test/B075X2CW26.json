Mine came with a Radeon RX 460 as the gpu (which is insulting), had only 2 slots for ram with only 1 slot being used by an 8 GB stick, and did not have an upgraded heat sink for the cpu. I didn't even take off the default heat sink to see the cpu becuase i expect that it also was not what I paid for. In fact, based on other reviews, the only 2 things that I found that I was expecting were the case and the 1 TB WD Blue. It's pretty unbelievable.",

Computer super easy to set up, looks Gorgeous and Performs exactly as Promised! I did have one question and was relieved knowing I was calling a number in the United States. I was connected to a technician within 2 minutes and understood every word he spoke with ease, lol :) Highly recommend If you want Quality and brand name Parts and not generic!!!",

Also the battery in the lighting remote came dead on arrival. I am worried about the power supply going out on me and damaging the computer so I plan to replace that soon by myself. Other than the Dongle and remote note working, this is a great computer for the price, everything worked right out of the box that mattered. I could barely be more satisfied with the money I spent. <3 Thank you Ibuypower and Amazon.",

Good packaging, quality build overall. All components were as advertised and performance is good. Knocking off a star for terrible cable management job done during assembly. Was just a rats nest hidden in the back of the case. A few zip ties would go a long ways guys! Also one front usb port is not working, need to take a look at the connections.",

Not only is it quiet, but the lights are really cool, and there's room for more upgrades if I want to down the line. Furthermore, the mouse and keyboard are really good; the keys on the keyboard feel really nice when pressing, and the mouse feels quite smooth AND it has cool lights on it around the edges. To summarize, this PC is a monster, does everything you expect it to do and its 100% worth the money, would totally recommend!!",

This computer is where it is at in regards to price, power, and looks. You will easily play Far Cry 5 on Ultra Graphics in 1080p @ 75fps. Now that is amazing. Even trying to build this computer would cost you way more. I would say it is worth it if you are loooking to enter in to computer gaming. This rig will LAST.",
