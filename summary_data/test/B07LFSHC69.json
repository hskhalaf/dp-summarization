It\u2019s light and the design allows me to reach every corner on my back with one arm. Love it! It comes with three settings. Make sure you don\u2019t use the the strong mode on bony areas. It hurts a lot when it works on bones directly. The heating function is pretty useless. I cannot feel the heat at all, but heat is not what I looked for in this massager so I doesn\u2019t bother me.",

I don't use the attachments for anything because the red ball seems to work the best. I believe it's worth every penny. You will be lucky to find another at this quality for this price point!",
