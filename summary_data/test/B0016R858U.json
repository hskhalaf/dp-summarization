I left it burning all night and woke up blowing black soot out of my nose. There was also soot all over the room it was burning in - on the lamp shades, plants, pictures on the wall and on the kitchen counters. The cloud of smoke and black soot in my nose was quite alarming as I have never experienced this with any other candle. The white ceiling above the candle also had a light smoke stain.",

You cannot smell the Blacksmoke but I don\u2019t think It should put off so much. Took pictures of the candles so that you could see the black smoke that comes off the candle. The Blacksmoke can be seen from the flame as well but obviously not in the photo. it also burns quickly. On a positive, the fragrance is very pleasant and can be smelt throughout the room.",

I was disappointed with this one because it bearly lasted a month and the wicks were gone, I don't know if they have changed the formula or if it was just old but something has changed.
