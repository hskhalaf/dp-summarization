When I used the plunger to push the previously ground meat down, my casings were ballooning from air. My new sausage stuffer is easy-to-use and easy to fill. I made 15 pounds or so, and even though I had to fill it a few times, we ended up with a bunch of beautiful sausages.",

Wish the handle were a bit longer and thicker to accommodate my large hands, and a little less slippery. That said, from an sanitation perspective, all stainless steel beats a competitor's plastic handle verison. Good purchase.",

Filling the hopper is a messy job. This unit does not hold much so it needs to be refilled often. It might be good for test runs but it doesn't fill the bill when I need to make more money than a couple of pounds of sausage.",

There is a little clip that can be pushed off with a couple of flathead screwdrivers or a with tool specifically for that. But it's probably not necessary to do that, I just don't want slime or mold or bacteria growing inside that part of my tool.",

This is my fault since I did not read or examine carefully before selecting. The seam just above the pounding surface is prone to dents and is hard to clean and dry. I expect rust to be a potential problem in the future. Other than these issue I have no complaints. The item is heavy and solid and works well to do the job of pounding meat to a uniform thickness.",
