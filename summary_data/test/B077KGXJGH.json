I did have to shut it off for a little bit to let it cool down but that\u2019s not a big deal. If you\u2019re willing to work with it it will be just fine.",

Although I can't use it on the high setting, I think that means it really concentrates the heat. The size was good and I was able to pile all my locs underneath. Love it and recommend it.",

My hair is natural and I love my twist outs so I twisted my hair and attached my blow dryer (my blower dryer is huge so there was a slight struggle getting it to attach but once it was on I didn\u2019t have to worry about it coming off). I set my dryer on high/cool. Didn\u2019t use the chin strap but the draw string on the bonnet is a plus. My hair was dry in 45 minutes, even the back of my hair.",

Using my hand held dryer to power this hood, only gave me the two heat options of the dryer. The high setting was way too hot so I had to leave it on cool. Again, this is not the fault of the hood.",

It was also very hard to get the right height to fit ypur head under properly. This is so much simpler and convenient. Its very easy to adjust and comfortable. I no longer have to stack up books or slouch down in a chair to fit under the hard hooded dryer. I just put this on, sit down wherever I feel like it and relax. Its made of a strong material that feels durable. Will definitely be ordering another one for my mother.",
