I cannot pair the remote to either my Nexus 5 phone or the iPad mini at all so the remote is basically worthless to me! Update (1/13/2018): The vendor contacted me and promptly sent a replacement. The new remote paired up with my android phone immediately and worked just fine. Again, I wish the ring light itself would be a little smaller though since it covers most of the screen so it's hard to see when you're taking a picture. Vendor's customer service couldn't be better.
