We DID wonder WHY there was a hump in the middle that just didn't seem to go away, and today I decided to find out why, and lifted it to flip up, and discovered that it CAME WITH TWO PILLOWS WE NEVER KNEW WERE THERE!! They had partially expanded, and were causing the hump! Other than that, we love the firmness, and have witnesses NO CHANGE in the mattress after having owned it for two years. It keeps ius cool at night, and was the ONLY way I could get comfortable when I broke a few ribs riding a bike earlier this year. Love it and would absolutely purchase it again.",

The web site they refer you to is non-existent. Not sure if they still have product for sale anywhere but if so, don't waste your money. And finally was contacted by the mfg after Amazon got involved. And they went from bad to completely crappy. A bad mattress from a more than bad company.",

Im not in menopause but my body temp does rise when i sleep. As far as comfort and support: firm for 190# 5'6\" and 190# 6'3\". Had it for a few months in michigan winter season. More firm on side near the window (poss because its cooler). The thing came with the box beat up and falling off but plastic still sealed. Glad we kept it cuz its better with pressure relief than spring mattress...but not perfect. Good nuff",

It is absolutely beautiful material BUT the smell from whatever it is made of is overwhelming. I am concerned about what type of chemical it is and if it is harmful to our health. It smells like formaldehyde which I am praying it is not because it is carcinogenic. I want a comfortable bed but not cancer. Hoping to get a reply from the seller. I just want to make sure whatever they have on this is not going to harm my health.",

Quality: We've only had it for 3 weeks so I'm not sure how well it will hold up in the long term. However, everything so far has been perfect. It expanded to the right shape and size. It's flat, no lumps, smells fine. Firm: No more waking up with sore backs. I'd call it \"quite firm.\" Maybe a 7 of 10 on the firmness scale. Affordable: Costs a fraction of what you'd pay for a memory foam mattress in stores. If it weren't for this good price I would not have bought it.",
