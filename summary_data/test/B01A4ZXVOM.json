      "text": "So.. this is the second towel that I've purchased from RainLeaf. The first one was for my boyfriend, and he said it was weird, but good weird. It's strange because it is so soft (but not like plush), and it works SO well. I'm able to dry off very quickly when showering at work, and it dries in a locker without getting funky. We purchased the large size, and it works well for both of us (he's 6'-6'1\" and I'm 5'2\"). We have orange and green, and the colors are just like the photo! I'm tempted to purchase more just so we have them on hand for camping, keeping one in the car, etc.",

      "text": "I first bought a Rainleaf towel for a trip to the UK; I needed a just-in-case towel that was compact, light, and dried fast. Since then, I started using the towel when I exercise. The absorbency is fantastic. It is super-soft, and comfortable to wipe against my face, but not too soft. (I have another exercise towel by another brand that I never use because it gives me a touching-a-chalkboard icky feeling. No issues like that with Rainleaf's towel.) Plus, the cloth holds up if washed by hand or in the washing machine, and dries very fast, as promised. For this reason, I bought a 2nd towel in another color; I gotta say, I love the color selection, too.",

That environment sees less than optimal airflow and hanging conditions and it's a constant struggle to keep things as sanitary as possible. That being said the biggest benefit of these towels is that they dry very fast. Regular terrycloth towels start to develop a mildew/mold odor after 2-3 days use and laundry is something that requires strategy while underway. These microfiber towels can easily be used daily for 3 weeks and not develop mildew or mold issues. I bought a pair but only needed to use one for 7 months of daily use and never noted any fading or wear and tear. Outstanding product.",

I recommend them and would purchase these towels again.",

This is of course assuming that it's fair weather and you have the windows open. Anyother key feature is there is a loop to use to hang it on a bush or whatever if you're not driving. It is also very lightweight if you're flying or hiking. If you're headed to Europe and staying in discount hotels that don't provide towels, Formula 1, the largest of these chains, sells a similar one for half the money.",
