We were challenged with getting all three of these dogs co-existing in the same house. Three weeks later we are at a point where they don't even have to be separated, they are eating together and drinking out of the same water bowls. I believe this plug-in was a big help in the process. For a household that now has 3 dogs that originally didn't get along, we know have a calm, happy home.",

I didn't give it five stars only because I don't know how long it will last based on the recommended times.",

Nothing is 100% when rehabilitating cats, but they do calm down - at least they stop nonstop caterwauling. The oil and diffuser were also wrapped very nicely that when I opened it I kind of felt I was opening a gift. I do recommend.",

I was hoping that this diffuser will help them calm down but it is not doing anything. On top of that, the scent smells pretty nasty, like sour milk or cheese. I will not buy again.",

Just like people, I believe things affect cats differently; unfortunately for one of my furry children, this seemed to make him ill. However, after removing it, he was back to himself within a couple of hours. I didn't notice a smell at all BTW. I would caution buyers to avoid assuming an item is safe for your animal simply because it is natural and to watch your animal's behavior after this is plugged in.",
