      "text": "This item does what it promises, it keeps you warm in this cold weather . A plus as well if you live alone , keep these on and turn down the thermostat. If you're looking to lower your heating costs. I ordered a large size and the tights more so the top , feels like a compression garment , so you may want to go a size larger then you think you need. Might be one of my best buys this year !",

They do not keep me as warm as the old ones. I walk 6 miles a day starting at 4am in the morning and I need something to keep me warm during the winter months. I like the way they fit and feel just not as reliable as the old ones.",
