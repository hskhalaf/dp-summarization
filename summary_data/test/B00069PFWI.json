I purchased a used quick pack coleman lantern as well, and the top nut mounting bolt was so loose, I had to put an additional nut on it to get it tight enough to use. There's something to be said about the simplicity and functionality of this lantern. Just as bright as the Coleman too.",

I thought I just had to press it in there further, but looking at it from the bottom, the cylinder is going all the way in. and nope, its not the plastic cylinder base either.",
