I'm a freaking college-educated programmer with professional IT experience, and even I couldn't get these pieces of crap to work. I can't believe Netgear's quality control is so awful that two modems in a row ($430 modems, no less) were duds. Imagine charging half a grand for a product that you don't even engineer correctly! tl;dr trash. It's trash. No better than an expensive paperweight.",

The problem people don't realize is that when you change your *modem*, you have to call your ISP and tell them to activate it. Typically, you'd have a modem and router separate so you just change the router and its plug and play. Since this is a two-in-one solution, you have to call your ISP in order to authorize the modem and it will work. This router modem combo is the best so far.",
