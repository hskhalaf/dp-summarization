I bought it for my travel trailer, to keep our toothbrushes and toothpaste up off the counter and from falling all over the place as we tow it down the road and it's perfect for that. It holds all of our toothbrushes and toothpaste and the little cups are super handy; I really like that they keep the toothbrushes from getting dusty as we roll down the road!",
