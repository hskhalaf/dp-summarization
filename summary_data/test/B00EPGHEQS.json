Keep away from ASUS because they don't build a quality product for the price you pay and their customer service is a joke.",

I am so happy i went this route. The speed, the look, the functionality, everything is perfect. The ONLY flaw is the semi sharp front edge on the machine, but i only feel it when slumping back with it on my lap, and even then, it doesn't shred my, its just a little uncomfortable over time. I would for sure buy again.",

Both times with the help of Asus customer support I was able to restore the computer to an earlier date and restore touchscreen functionality. For $1700 I really didn't anticipate this sort of poor software integration and failure of hardware to boot.(forgive the pun). I am giving the U301 one more chance to see if the updates have been corrected that apparently create the software/hardware snafu and cause the touchscreen to become disabled. Not pleased!",
