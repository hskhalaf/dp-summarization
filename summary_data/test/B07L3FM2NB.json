Being tall and having big feet (and pretty big calves), knee high socks don\u2019t usually go up that high on me, but surprisingly these did. The only thing about these socks is that they\u2019re not as compressive as I thought they would be, but it does help a little with the swelling (I\u2019ve got major swelling due to pregnancy). My feet and legs definitely don\u2019t feel as fatigued and achy as they normally do when I don\u2019t wear compression socks, and it helps with the pain over my pregnancy induced varicose veins \ud83d\ude29. Overall I like them altogether.",

Stay up all day, all night . make the circulation in your legs feel so much better and a little less pain. I wear them with my pj shorts at night cause ok pants bunch up. And there these are like tights keeping my legs warm. A great buy.",
