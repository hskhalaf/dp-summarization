This worthy purchase of a boot is remarkably stable, durable, and lightweight. It is also a grippy platform that requires minimal break-in time. However, many wearers were disappointed with the Danner 453\u2019s frail outsole, bleeding ankle liner, and too-narrow fit. Its fragile shoelaces and abrasive lace hooks further compounded the negativity which surrounded the boot.",

        "This mid-cut backpacking boot requires minimal-to-no break-in time, and many wearers couldn\u2019t agree more",
        "Many experts and users were smitten by the Danner 453 with its enormous level of comfort",
        "An expert among them even likened it to a well-worn tennis shoe",

      "cons": [
        "A considerable number of owners couldn\u2019t help but feel disgusted with the boot\u2019s outsole for wearing thin too quickly",

        "These laces, according to them, were too scrawny to give them a secure ankle fit",
        "Some wearers found the boot too narrow",
        "Even the 2E - wide still felt too cramped and restrictive for them",
        "A handful of reviewers detested the hook eyelets for bruising their laces and rendering them unusable",

The boots got soaked and stayed that way the entire day; a week later, the Goretex inside and the leather are still damp. My advice: if you're wearing these out for more than a day hike, think very carefully before you walk through that stream or puddle because once they get wet inside, you're going to have a hard time getting them dried out at camp later.",

Now, they are new so I obviously dont know how they will take their punishment but I can say that these things look and feel solid. Oh and they are already comfortable without breaking them in. Always a good sign. I hope we can go on many adventures together for a long long time. :)",
