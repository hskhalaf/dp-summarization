I DO love the Bentgo kids lunch boxes, so not all of their products are this bad!",

I needed a Lunchbox with a couple of sections meant for Multiple Snacks/Fruits/Veggies/Eggs and ever since I bought this Lunch Box, packing Snacks and lunch is pretty much easy and managed. With two sections on the Top box and bottom one with No section makes it easy for me to Mix N Match Her favorite Food items. Do keep in mind that the boxes are not leak-proof, meaning anyone looking for a leak-proof lunch box, this product might not work for you. Albeit The boxes are Top Rack Dishwasher-Safe I prefer to wash them manually for washing them in The dishwasher may deteriorate the quality oftentimes.",

The other container without the divider doesn\u2019t firmly close either. Such a strange design! Oh and I bought the little sauce cups- they are so small, really too small, and they do NOT fit inside either of the bigger containers - the lid will not shut with the sauce cup in there.

A fun and practical container system makes my lunch something special to look forward to. They are nicely made, and thoughtfully designed.

      "text": "We've been using the Bentgo stackable lunch box kit for about 4 months. It's a good idea, but the big problem is the containers do not seal. This kit is for dry food and snacks only. Liquid leaks out if the containers are tipped. They are not air tight. Update: I talked with customer service and they indicated my experience is not typical. It's possible the issue was due to using a dish washer even though we used the top rack. They are shipping replacements. I'm very pleased with the responsiveness and service. Hopefully the new kit will work out. The insulated carrier and lunch box kit fit perfectly and leave space for additional items.",

While the container may not have been as good as I was hoping, the company was excellent to work with! I dislike this container. I wanted to love it. It's cute and looks easy to carry. However, the lids stopped connecting to the base after about 2 uses. Now I'm afraid to put anything that could potentially spill in the containers. It also becomes difficult to carry when the lids no longer connect. I will be looking for another bentgo box.",

After owning another set, I can honestly say I am very impressed with both the containers and the company.",

So my advice is.. even if you are somewhat unhappy or unsure, just return it as it only gets worse over time.",

It might take some time to learn how to pack a lunch this compact - most American style lunchboxes give you more space but are as a result bulkier and difficult to lug around with you.
