I decided to use it only on my right thigh so I could compare it to my left thigh and they still look the same. The smell didn't bother me and the cream didn't irritate my skin. The reason why I gave it two stars is that it did make my skin feel softer and moisturized. Unfortunately I can not recommend this item based only on the fact that my thigh feels softer.",

I tested on my left leg (which is usually bigger than right leg) for a week and started to see the difference. Left leg where I used started to look smoother and better than right leg. I also used for my stomach to make it smooth. The result is very subtle, but I it looks smoother.",

I could tolerate the smell if I felt it was working, but after weeks of application, all that I notice is skin irritation. It's application goes on easy enough, you twist the top to the ON position and the lotion flows out using roller balls. This might work for others, but it has not worked for me.",

To be honest, I'm not noticing a ton of improvement, although I am noticing some decrease in cellulite. For some, the modest improvements may justify the price, especially if they don't have much cellulite to banish. I do enjoy the process. The applicator feels nice and does a good job of massaging, and I enjoy the scent, which reminds me of being in a good spa. Thankfully the scent doesn't linger as a perfume.",

As such, I can't defend its high price- especially since I think it's predicated largely on the roller-ball application mechanism, which isn't really necessary for application (rubbing the lotion in manually works equally well). As I said, it DOES moisturize well, but equally effective moisturizer products can be purchased for much less. Your results may vary, but I didn't see any tightening or toning effects.",
