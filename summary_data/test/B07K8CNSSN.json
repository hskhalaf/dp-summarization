I am able to walk comfortably in these shoes. They\u2019re easy to put on once they\u2019re broken in a bit. I\u2019m obsessed. They\u2019re super cute with jeans and shorts. Great for walking the dogs, shopping, etc ! I wear them every day as my casual shoes. Well done Reebok!!!\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99",
