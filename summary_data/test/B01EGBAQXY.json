There is a place on the web that will tell you how long that ChromeBook is supported. I would never buy another ChromeBook. I can see where it is not supported after a time, but there is no way to update it. I have gone back to my laptop and installed ubuntu. At least when a version is no long supported, I can update to a new version.",

The Chromebook was only $200 with tax but I expected to get 4 to 5 years out of it, so I am somewhat disappointed. Last ditch effort is a powerwash to reset to original specs.

      "text": "I was on the fence about getting a Chromebook for the longest time, especially as my go-to personal laptop thingy was an Asus Eee 1005HA that's about five years old and still going strong with amazing build quality. This Chromebook seems to have the same famous build quality, along with a battery life that's at least twice as long, a processor twice as fast, slightly larger screen, only half the power consumption, etc. While watching netflix at full brightness, this Chromebook consumes 4.2W. My netbook does not have the power to run Netflix, but on absolute lowest power settings with the screen off, it still consumes 7.6W. I like it a lot.",

The speakers aren't the loudest, but given that it's a tiny Chromebook, I'm not going to judge it too harshly and if I want to have loud video/audio, there's always casting things via the Chromecast to my TV. The screen quality is great, and I really like the small form factor too - it's not too small to type on, but not too big to just toss into my purse or backpack and go!",

As others have said, the smaller keyboard does take getting used to but the keys feel good and once I get used to it I think it will be fine. One note, other reviews have mentioned that it is annoying that there is a search button where the capslock key usually is, but you can actually go into Settings and change this veeeery simply, in Keyboard Settings. I've yet to test the battery life, so I can't comment on that.",

It is very light, pretty much like iPad, sleek, looks really pretty in white and blue colors, works perfectly, very fast and easy to use. I recommend it for those who need Windows type system and Google Chrome. Some features in chromebooks are not available, like PDF reader, but one can download PDF converter.",
