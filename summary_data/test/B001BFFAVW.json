She was bitting her paws and scratching her ears so much she was making sores on them. I have had her on it for 5 days and I can't believe how fast it brought her relief. Very good product. Will make sure I have this during the spring thru fall to make sure she doesn't get this again. Keeps her digestive system good as she was eating grass and vomiting more than I thought she should (though she would eat anything and everything), I noticed she isn't doing that either. Would highly recommend.",
