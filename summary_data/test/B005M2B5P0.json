The sound of the water was extremely loud (like sitting next to the loudspeaker at a rock concert), and I'm concerned the tube may have gone too far into my ear canal and punctured something. 24 hours after using it I still have noticeable hearing loss. At this point I can only hope my ears will eventually return to normal. I will definitely not be using this product again.",

I had been basically 100% certain that I only had wax in there muffling my hearing on and off, but I went through another bottle or two with no luck. I'm glad I stopped trying at that point, because it turns out I actually have Otitis Media with Effusion: liquid behind the eardrum, in the Eustachian tube, muffling sound sometimes. It's less common than stuck ear wax, but it's not rare: very roughly 1 in 1,000 adults per year, and far more often in children.",

      "text": "Love this thing. I had a really bad case of impacted ear wax build-up and the bottle system cleared it in 20 mins max. Personally, I just used warm water to flush out the wax, but next time I'll try using hydrogen peroxide as suggested. For anyone out there who has problems with ear wax build-up, I highly recommend you to purchase this and cut down on your over-priced ENT doctor bills. Truly, I saved so much from just this simple product even with shipping. (PS. I live literally a whole ocean away from USA and still think it's worth the shipping)",

I had to go to an urgent care a couple of years ago when both my ears got plugged. For 35 bucks including shipping, this is about a million times better than a trip to the doctor.
