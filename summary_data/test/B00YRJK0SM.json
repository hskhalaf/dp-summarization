A minor gap between wall surfaces and the outside edge of the shelves can be surrounded with sheetrock tape before applying the white silicon caulk. Be sure to gently sweep the caulk into place with a fingertip and then remove the tape by pulling it up-and-away from the freshly applied caulk. A clean professional installation will be the end result!",

The included screws strip kind of easily when using a power drill, so try to have a couple extra screws on hand. I didn\u2019t use the anchors since I have plaster walls. These shelves are the perfect size for up to an 8\u201dx10\u201d framed photo and a couple small tchotchkes. Great for saving space in my small hallway!",

If we used the hardwear provided, the shelves would have been too unstable for what we needed them for which is why I am giving 4/5 stars.",

      "text": "These shelves are beautiful and easy to install, but there are some things the manufacturer should correct: The instructions state a 3/32 drill is enough to set the anchors, but that is far too small - even a 1/8 is too small. A 1/4th is where the tip of the anchor will properly insert, and then you can lightly twist it in with a screwdriver manually to secure it. The plastic anchors are also prone to breaking, so either be very careful or get a pack of metal anchors as backups. Otherwise, this is a great mid-cost shelf that perfectly matches the floor molding of our house.",

I had to dig around the house for other anchors and screws. My advice would be to KO the long screws and use shorter ones. And like another reviewer said, a corner of one of the shelves , the paint was scratched off.",
