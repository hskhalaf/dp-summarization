Take care with the thumb screws that attach the bar. I did not and dropped one in the lake....that ended that weeks lesson. I called Connelly and they quickly sent a replacement at no charge! We have 5 younger grandchildren so these trainers will be kept busy for years to come!",

We even removed the stabilizer bar after awhile and he was successful on those attempts as well. He likes to use the stabilizer bar as he feels extremely confident and puts on a show (touching the water with his hand, skiing one handed, bouncing, and more)!",

      "text": "If your child is a little too big for the 48\" beginner skis that are everywhere, these are a MAJOR step up, but not so big that a kid can't use them like a 60\" teen ski is. My son is 11 and weighs about 93 lbs. He couldn't get up on the 48\" and I decided it was because they were too small. The next weekend he got right up with these with the bar in place. We stayed at the lake that week on vacation. By the end of the week he had dropped a ski and slalomed all the way around the lake! OUTSTANDING!!!!!",

Narrow Width underfoot keeps them responsive and playful. This concept is downsized to make the super sport pair. Smaller, lighter skiers will gain confidence and enjoy the ride more on properly sized gear. Jr. Size heel-slide adjustable bindings fit most kid's feet giving them more control of the ski. Beginners can use the front stabilizer bar to keep the skis in line and the proper distance apart.",
