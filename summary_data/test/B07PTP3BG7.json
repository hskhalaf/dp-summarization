Visual aids can help a child with: \n\n - processing and communicating wants and needs\n- understanding a directed task\n- reinforcing positive behavior \n- understanding rules at home or in the classroom\n- improving vocabulary and language\n- communicating after a stroke or brain injury\n\n\n\n The phrases were carefully selected as the building blocks for communication at any age. \n\nHow to use  Cards are 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches and come with a zip-lock bag for easy on the go storage. You customize their use to suit your unique needs or choose our option that is ready to be connected with an included book ring. \n\n#1 Tip for getting started: introduce picture cards when your child is calm, fed, and rested so that their brain will be ready for learning. We recommended that your child has a good understanding of the meaning of a card before attempting to use it in a stressful situation.",
