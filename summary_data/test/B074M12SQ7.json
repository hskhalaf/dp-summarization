Spend the extra 100 - 300$$ to avoid this complete and utter disaster of a tablet. No wonder my company switched to Dell! Wow additional note trying to Google if the screen comes up the second you touch it to scroll it blacks out. Geez",

Even browsing the internet is taxing and webpages render very slowly. In general, every action on the tablet feels sluggish / laggy.",
