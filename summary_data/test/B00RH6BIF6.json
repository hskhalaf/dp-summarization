I upgraded to a 2tb HDD, and installed an internal SSD in the bare socket. This allowed me to have the 128gb SSD as my root/boot drive, Tat really made bootup super fast. Next I upgraded the OEM 4gb of memory to 16gb. Lastly a 4 port USB hub These upgrades were a piece of cake to do. Much easier then Apple and way more economical.",

I was hesitate for a second because it doesn't have a disc drive, but you can easily buy one for those rare times that you can't download what you're what you need. Great product. Never any issue and I've had it for years.",

      "text": "I bought this because my favorite Lenovo Q190 is no longer available. What I like about Q190 is is sleeker and comes with a mounting bracket. This Pavilion Mini can only by placed in one position on the table and cannot be mounted. The design is cute and decorative. As for performance, it does the job very well for media viewing and light office tasks. Runs Windows 10 and Office 360 without problem. One star is removed because there's no way you can mount it. If you don't need to mount this somewhere, this is a great and reliable mini PC to have. I have two of these and two of Q190.",

      "text": "Awesome little machine. It's no Nuc5i7, but it comes with wireless keyboard, mouse, and Windows, for a very low entry price. I added one 8G SODIMM and replaced the HDD with a spare notebook 240G SSD that I had laying around and it gets the job done in a very small footprint at the lowest price point. Stream internal storage is just too small, and with no SATA cable, just not an option. This is definitely cheaper once you realize that you have to purchase an M.2 card to make the Stream viable. The Pavilion Mini is the best very small system for the money right now.",

(The ones included are usb keyboard and mouse) but it has been great for taking up hardly any space in my son's room so he can do homework, although he has spent more time playing minecraft than homework since he got it! We are very happy with the performance of this tiny desktop!! We ended up hooking it up to his tv that is mounted on the wall, I only wish this computer had a bracket to mount it behind the tv, then it would be perfect with a wireless mouse/keyboard it is completely out of the was until you need it!!",
