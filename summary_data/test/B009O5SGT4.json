It does snag additional materials like the surrounding leaves and pine needles but to me, just adds to the intended use. I will be doing more business with Arcturus.",

As one reviewer already stated, it helps a lot if you run your fingers through the strings gently to let them down as they come pretty tangled from the manufacturer. I spent about 4 hours doing that, and the suit turned out mega nice! Then I laid the suit outside (for our area scent) and it looks like a large clump of sod. :-). Too cool!",

The long threads allow you to mix in local vegetation, which i did, added some pine needles and oak leaves, which seemed to shake out quite well when done.",

      "DENSE, FULL COVERAGE: You'll be hard pressed to find a ghillie suit with this much coverage and density. The Ghost Ghillie conceals you with nearly 6 pounds of synthetic, silent, water-resistant thread. That's more cover, more stalking, and more kills.",
      "BUILT TO LAST: We minimize the shedding that occurs on all ghillie suits by double-stitching all thread on the Ghost. While most other ghillies single-stitch, our double-stitch locks in the thread, dramatically reducing shedding while adding durability.",
      "ADVANCED 3D CAMO: Our Ghost Woodland Ghillie Suit for men is made with a 7-color blend - 4 shades of green, tan, black and brown - making it ideal for most wooded areas.",
      "THE REVIEWS SAY IT ALL: We use these suits ourselves so we're particular about each piece of the ghillie suit and the feedback shows our commitment to quality. These hunting suits are ideal for situations where you need deep camouflage that quickly break up your profile.",
      "4 SIZES: Kids (for kids 4'0\" to 5'0\"), Young Adult (5'1\"-5'6\"), Regular (5'6\"-6'0\") and Extra-Large (6'0\" and over). Each Ghost Ghillie comes in a mesh carry case & includes adjustable pants, button jacket with attached hood, & an elastic ghillie rifle wrap."
