All of my cards fit and several slots have 2-3 cards inside with plenty of room to slide them in or out. It is not bulky and it has no problem snapping closed with everything I have in it. It is a must have for smaller bags!",

And personally, I'm delighted that the details of my new wallet (colors and the gold zipper teeth detail) looks quite nice with my new \"Happy Birthday!\" Kate Spade bag.",

      "text": "This wallet is very pretty , I wish the slots were different though there\u2019s two of them that are so deep my cards sink to the bottom. I like it when you are able to at least see the top part / color of the card for easy grabbing, I feel like maybe this is a date night wallet or for people with not so many cards, theres a coin slot but hardly doubt you can fit maybe a dollar worth of change in there. I will update with durability in a few weeks .",

The size is just right and fits in back pocket with no issue, or into the side pockets of my gym leggings. It's well made and has PLENTY of room on the inside for cards and cash. The change pocket is a little small, but I don't carry much change on me anyways. Definitely recommend!",

I have a large MK wallet that\u2019s too big for my smaller purses and a small MK wallet that\u2019s too small to hold all my cards so I was looking for something in between. As soon as I received it I transferred everything to this wallet and I can\u2019t complain. Plus it somewhat matches the new Coach crossbody that I bought. The only minor complain that I have is that for the color description it said it was a light green but it\u2019s nowhere near that. It\u2019s more of an aqua blue. Other than that it\u2019s perfect!",

The wallet seems to be made of good quality and is sturdy. Looks like it will hold up over time. The only reason for the 4 star rating is that one of the reasons I bought this wallet was the color. It appeared to match a purse i was buying perfectly. However the wallet is not as bright as the picture so it does not match 100%. But I will keep it because it matches close enough and is still a good wallet.",
