This one feels more like it's made for a taller larger torso, but I'm a 5-foot girl, so it's not quite comfortable. It doesn't have one end significantly thicker then the other end, so it's a little bit less comfortable. Overall though, it serves the same purpose and it's not bad. The quality feels good. I just definitely think it's made for larger torsos, and it definitely won't collapse under the weight of a heavier body.",

The ProSource is a bit taller & stiffer [\"That's what she said...\" ;) ] than the Ab-Mat. The extra height ads a good stretch to your back and then you don't notice it after a while.
