The person on the other end can hear you loud and clear. They can actually hear you better than if using ear buds with a built in mic. Hat fits great and looks nice. The sound quality of the speakers is good. It's not BOSE quality obviously but it sounds good and other people close by can't really hear what you're listening to. This was a good purchase.",

He really likes this one, though! says the sound quality is really good. It's good with music on his phone as well as streaming sites. It is still a little big, so if he pulls it all the way down on his head, the speakers are at his ear lobes, rather than directly on his ears. He also says it is very warm. It's easy to charge. I'll leave an updated review once we try removing the electronics and washing it.",

This hat performed fantastic.. I did have a bit of trouble the first time I tried to Bluetooth sync it to my phone (I'm 48 and not the most tech savvy) but once I got it done it was easy.. charge lasts a long time, hat itself is very comfortable and warm. The best part and perhaps most surprising thing was the sound quality. It is as good if not better than my headphones.. really clear sound.. Very impressed and happy with this purchase.",

If you wear your beanie like that, of course. The comfort is great. Not too thick and not too thin. Its just little things. Like the box on the beanine in unnecessarily big.
