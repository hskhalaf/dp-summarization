Then, I parked my car and returned about one hour later. It did not work anymore after that. I connected it to the computer and it didn't even leave any light on (neither the red nor the green). I could not open the menu and update anything. I tried to reset as the website tells us to do so (pressing the whell + reset buttom) but it did not work as it didn't turn on. I don't know anything else to do. It is really not working at all.",

AFTER A MONTH I WAS ONLY ABLE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME, COULDN'T RECEIVE OR MAKE CALLS. I AM STILL GETTING ANOTHER ONE WITH THE CREDIT FROM AMAZON BUT WILL PROBABLY ON GET THE ONE FOR SINGLE PHONE.",

It would keep say it was downloading my contacts and I could not get it to stop. It was downloading nothing. The phone wasn't even connected and the contacts were already downloaded. Resetting the device was no help. Sent it back and looking for another bluetooth device for my car.",
