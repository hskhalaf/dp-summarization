It\u2019s a nice looking fan. The remote control doesn\u2019t always work on the first try. There have been a few times where I had to press the buttons repeatedly, but it does work most of the time. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with this fan. As far as installation, the directions were very clear and well illustrated. Installation was time consuming, but it wasn\u2019t hard.",

I must turn the light back on with the remote. If I try to use the main wall switch, it will not turn on. Additionally, the buttons are flush with the face of the remote, so finding the correct button in the dark was a challenge until I used a drop of glow in the dark paint on the light button.

He still could not get the remote to sync with the receiver but happened to have a remote from a Casablanca fan which did work.",

I wrote to FrugalFairDeals and they shipped me another fan the same week and did not have to send the bad fan back to them. The replacement fan worked great and I now have two wonderful Hunter Fans with all the things that I wanted. Good buy, great customer service. I would highly recommend this fan from FrugalFairDeals.",
