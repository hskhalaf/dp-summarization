Also used to defrost the freezer of an older model shorty refrigerator that was frozen up - set the fan at high speed, and put it in the center sitting position so it blew on the ice and less than an hour the job was done. Very light weight and can be tucked away easily - I'm sure it will get lots of work this winter when the snow and slush fall off the cars. Will use to move along the drying next time I clean the carpets also.",

Not as powerful as their industrial fans, but very close! They use less power and less like to blow a circuit. Handy to have around and yes they do plug together.",
