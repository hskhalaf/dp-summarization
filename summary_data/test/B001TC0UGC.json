      "title": "Not Worth Purchasing",
      "text": "Unfortunately, this kit was not \u201ceasy to do.\u201d The instructions used detailed pictures to explain the steps but asked the user to jump around in the manual to accomplish different stages in the process and left some details out that a novice would not have known on their own. Ultimately, I had to ask an expert to show me the steps. Another problem was found with the yarn vs crochet hook. The thread was very thin and light-weight and easily fell apart while working with the bulky crochet hook. There was really nothing of value in this kit aside from the instructions, which would likely be found in any crochet book. Not a good buy at any price.",

I ended up teaching her myself.",

Plastic hook/needle is unuseable. The plastic snags and separates yarn. I attempted to file the nubs off but it still catches. (as a beginner I may be wrong on the needle/hook being clunky but that is my uneducated opinion) I purchased this as a gift for my niece and I was very disappointed and a little embarrassed to send such a low quality gift. She had to buy new crochet hooks which worked MUCH better.",

Once she had a proper crochet hook she did much better. The instructions are ok but not for true beginners...my daughter said \u201cthe directions aren\u2019t very clear after a few steps in...i think it would make sense to people who have done it before but not to someone who never has....they should have had someone who never crocheted try it with no help\u201d.",

We ended up using a knife to fix the hooks but still. Second thing is the yarn is too thin for beginners. BUT the book and instructions are awesome great pictures and very clear directions. So over all she is happy. I have tons of yarn and hooks for her but I'm sure other may not.",
