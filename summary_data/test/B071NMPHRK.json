We installed the fence, plugged it all in...and IT WORKED! The online training videos were a great help and our dog ( Norwegian Elkhound) has adapted to it. He snuck through a couple time, but with some adjustments, he never even tries now. Very pleased, and have needed warranty support once, which was incredibly responsive and easy (thanks, Pam and Kelly)! Very happy customer and a great company!",

We zip tied it to the fence approx. 18 inches off the ground. At each gate we ran it down the posts and underground in pvc pipe to protect it from mowers. The manual was the only negative aspect , it was a little better than some that are obviously written in Chinese and then translated to English. All in all a good product.",
