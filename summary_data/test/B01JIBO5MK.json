      "text": "My previous electric starters used a narrow electric element that lit a very small field of charcoal. With a Weber kettle grill, I needed a starter with a bigger, wider footprint. And the NutriChef Premium BBQ Grill Starter fills this need perfectly. Owing to the design of the element, it will set a nice, big pile of charcoal to burning. And it burns hot enough to light even on cold, wet, blustery days. And isn't a longer BBQ season what we really all want? If your needs are similar to mine, this is your answer.",

This starter is amazing, the size is perfect as it heats a large portion of the coals giving me an even fire.

Advantages: 1) Elements are spread out wider and thus heat more charcoal. 2) It comes with a holder stand for cooling the starter. It heated the charcoal quickly - when I was finished spreading the charcoal the holder stand came in handy for cooling the starter down. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I didn't like this at first because it takes a little time to get going and light the charcoal. After using it for a while it's the only way I light my charcoal. It works great, you just have to be patient. Update: Worked for about 1 1/2 years then fell apart. I'm not sure what I'll go to next because I want something that will last. I might go back to my weed burner. The added benefit of which is that my BGE can be ready to cook in less than 2 minutes with that method, rather than the 15-20 it takes with the NutriChef.",

I cook on a Big Green Egg and this shape does not work well, I am bending it to fit but should not have to.",
