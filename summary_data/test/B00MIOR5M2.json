At first noticed I tightened the screws that held the hinges but did not help. Might have received a faulty one? Will message customer service and see and update more. **UPDATE 06/28/2018** Customer service rep was fast to solve my issue as this issue was common with this product. BECAREFUL YALL!",

Additionally one of the wheels is at a angle, I presume the base was welded just a little off... doesn't affect the movement too much, but at $80 I really didn't expect any issues.",

This one has held together well in that same amount of time. I roll it over carpet alot which is where I would expect it to have a hard time and to start becoming loose and wobbly, but it has not. My wife and I both love this replacement.",

However, the wheel locks don't work at all. Even with the brakes on it will move around whenever removing laundry bags or using the folding table. I think they would've functioned better had all wheels contained the brakes. Overall the product looks nice and does a good job.",

    "description": "Keep your lights, darks, delicates and linens separate with the Seville Classics Deluxe 3-Bag Laundry Hamper Sorter Cart with Folding Table. The lightweight table lifts up for convenient bag removal; it features cotton fabric cover with polyester-foam padding. Use the space to fold freshly laundered linens and clothes, or as a table for pressing wrinkled slacks, pants, shorts, and shirts. Bags are constructed from heavy-duty, machine-washable 100% polyester canvas and provide about 1. 5 cu. ft. of space each. Simply throw the bag into the wash when it's ready! Each bag features dual steel-wire handles dipped in soft-grip material. The base features three steel mesh panels that prevent the bags from sagging when overfull. Swivel wheels allow the cart to move easily; two lock for stability when you need it to stay put. Use it your way: organize colors and whites easily in your bedroom or laundry room; store it in a closet to keep dirty clothes out of sight; roll it from room-to-room when it's time to gather bed sheets and blankets; carry the bags to the laundry mat or the dry cleaners. 100% polyester bags in natural white Lift-up table features a heat-resistant cotton-canvas cover cushioned with polyester-foam padding Iron mesh folding table High-strength oval tube frame provides stability in motion and at rest; champagne epoxy finish Angled steel-wire bag handles coated in champagne soft-grip material Three mesh support panels prevent bags from sagging, stopping premature wear and tear Large, curved handles can be held easily with the folding table down or up Four 3-inch wheels glide easily; two lock when needed Easy assembly with necessary tools included Dimensions: 31. 2\" W x 18. 3\" D x 36. 7\" H Bag dimensions: 14\" W x 8. 5\" D x 23\" H Volume: 1. 3 bushels or 1. 6 cu. ft. per bag Weight capacity: 10 lbs. per bag Weight: 23 lbs.
