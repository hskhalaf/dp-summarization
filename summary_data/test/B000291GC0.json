      "text": "I love this cooker! We originally bought this to fry fish occasionally and it works great for that but I use it at least once a week to cook food that needs high heat like when using a (cheap) wok or searing steak in a large frying pan. The flame is great and puts out more heat that the 4 burners on our stove combined. The aluminum pot works well and is easy to clean even after frying (lots and lots of) whiting for close to 2 hours. Thermometer is good too. This was the best 50 bucks I spent this summer!",

It\u2019s been on a bunch of family vacations, tailgates, and back porch cooking days, and it\u2019s never let us down. It\u2019ll burn like the sun. I like the handy little thermometer too. I actually use it on my smoker sometimes, bc it\u2019s real easy to clip on anywhere, and it\u2019s pretty accurate. My wife is Cajun from Louisiana, she approves and so does my father in law. That\u2019s good enough for me.",

It's nothing big, but i feel it could be remedied with a clip that kind of hangs from the black circular rim at the right height. Might make my own with a scrap of metal. All in all, REALLY happy with this.",

The cooking set includes the single-burner gas stove itself, a 10-quart aluminum deep-fry pan, an aluminum perforated insert basket with handle, and a five-inch stainless-steel thermometer that helps maintain a safe cooking temperature for the oil. Some assembly is required for the stove, such as attaching the legs to the round frame. Designed for the utmost in safety, the stove features three legs that hold up to a 34-quart pot with no stress on the bolts. The cooking surface measures 12-3/4 inches in diameter, and a slight ridge keeps the pot from sliding off. From the ground to the top of the round frame, the cooker stands 19-1/2 inches tall. \n\n While a lid is not included with the 12-1/2-by-5-inch pot, the basket does come with a long steel handle (simple attaching required) that safely lowers and lifts the cooked food in or out of the hot oil. The thermometer features a pot clip and 1-3/4-inch dial that allows the cook to keep an eye on the temperature of the oil. A red zone is clearly marked for danger should the oil exceed 450 degrees F, at which point the heat source should be turned off immediately. Both Celsius and Fahrenheit are shown. Intended only for outdoor use, the cooker includes a UL-listed 10 PSI regulator, 29-inch hose, and a valve assembly. The pot also can be used indoors on a stovetop. Bayou Classic covers its cookers with a one-year warranty. --Ann Bieri What's in the Box\n1 single-burner stove with regulator, hose, and valve assembly; 10-quart aluminum stockpot; aluminum perforated basket with handle; 5-inch stainless-steel thermometer. 4 items total.",
