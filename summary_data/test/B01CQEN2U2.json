You can either keep it really simple or dive into more advanced settings (lots of YouTube videos). The WiFi feature wasn't originally a selling point but after using it I love it. If your phone has NFC it makes transferring pictures super easy. You can also use your phone as a remote with a live preview. I liked this camera so much I convinced my boss to buy one and we now use it for product pictures. I highly recommend it for personal or small business use.",

The flash is tiny in size yet extremely capable. The pop up eye piece takes a little getting accustomed to but is very functional and activates when you look through it like magic.

Sure, it's not as fast/clear/bright as a much larger DSLR, but I can't stick that type of camera in a pocket while hiking through rough terrain and carrying a binocular and backpack (and possibly hiking poles).",

That's inconvenient and I don't know WHY Sony has not continued the \"automatic flash pop-up\" option. Other than that, the zoom is fantastic and picture quality very fine!

      "text": "I bought this camera for a trip out west this past summer. I was looking for something that had good zoom capability for wildlife photos but could also get good scenery shots. I was not disappointed in the least. I am not a pro and I don't have any editing software, and I was getting photos that were worth printing without any touch up work. This camera will be traveling with me from now on.",

      "text": "Used it one weekend when I forgot the battery for my Nikon D7000. The view finder is reasonable. Not the image quality or ease of use of the D7000 but usable if you are not doing sports or moving wildlife. Color rendition is also better then most other point and shoot cameras I have used. The auto focus is reasonable, again, not a sports camera but otherwise good. I did not try using the \"face finding\" mode. I always use a fixed focus point so that I have control over it. At least this camera gives you the choice.",

I learned that without the proper downloads no one else could see the GPS readings (as per Sony) so that was a waste. I alos had difficulty ( as in never) getting the WiFi to connect with my computer. I did a bit more research and decided to try the HB80 and I am very please with it.",
