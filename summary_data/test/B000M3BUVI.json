The new one arrived with a useless pitcher with a cracked bottom. See the photo, zoom in, crack is from the center toward 3:00. Very disappointing but I still had my old pitcher. The new models don\u2019t have a spring controlled steeping basket which means you need to use a coffee filter to slow the process. This gives less control over the desired strength of the tea. I highly doubt this new unit will last 30 years.",

No, if you have a stove I wouldn't recommend this to replace the tea pan - unless you need more stuff to clean and something that takes up more instead of less of your time.",

I make at least one pitcher of tea per day with this machine. There are two excellent ways to get rid of the tea stains on the pitcher, lid and filter. The best way is to soak them in hot water with OxyClean in it. The tannin stains completely disappear. The second best way is to use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (or generic product of the same type). I highly recommend this Iced Tea Maker.",
