Excellent sound quality. The remote is absolutely terrible. I think it's an insult that they would send a crappy remote like this to their customers. With the number of complaints, in the reviews, about reliability SpeakerCraft knows this is a problem unit and yet they continue to sell it without fixing it. This shows total disregard for their customer base. Shame on you!!!",

Both units experienced the same type of failure: out of the blue, with no sign of distress, the output from all devices became a loud, high-pitched shrill combined with white noise. The manufacturer was of little help with the first unit, but fortunately the vendor, HI-DEF Lifestyle sent a replacement unit even when the warranty had lapsed. When the unit was working, the sound was very good, setup was easy and it looked great, unfortunately both units have broken and I can not see myself purchasing another SpeakerCraft product.",

The only thing that bugs me is the cheap remote which is the only way to control the audio. A Logitech / Harmony universal remote will solve this thou if you have one.
