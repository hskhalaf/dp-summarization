I knocked off one star because the drawer panel was unpainted (see photo) and I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending the whole thing back just for the drawer panel so I called Melissa and Doug's customer service to send a new panel and it was an easy and painless process. Other than that, my 3 yr old loves this table and finally enjoys playing in his playroom. We also got the waterfall bucket train set by Kidcraft. It's compatible with the Janod train set we already have so it worked out perfectly.",

The two deciding factors were the quality of Melissa and Doug, and the plain green top. I bought a Thomas the train playboard to put on top when the kids are playing trains, but they also like the option to take it off and play legos, puzzles or dollhouse on it. We will use this table for years! It was definitely worth it for us and I would recommend to anyone with small kids.",

One side of the table has sunken holes to allow the screws to lay flat and the other side doesn't. Chips and scratches everywhere. Huge ugly product sticker on the side of the table that's impossible to take off. Not worth the hassel of returning so we will keep it. My kids will just mess it up more anyways.",

He is 14 months old and he loves standing up playing with his toys now rather than sitting on the ground playing. There were a few edges that were a bit sharp but we just got a nail file and lightly sanded them down and then it was fine. Overall a good buy and we are very happy.",

Once built, it's solid and has a big surface area. I use it for the kid's legos and the size is really helpful to keep the spares as the drawer is small and used just to keep the manuals. The space underneath also allows to use it for storage for small bins.",
