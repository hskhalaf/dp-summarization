This latest is the highest output, and significantly, features a superior LED. Unlike the previous (2014?) model which had a conspicuous yellow halo around the light beam striking an object, the 2015 has a clean beam of all one color temperature--I'd guess somewhere between 4000 and 5000 Kelvin. Just make sure you purchase with superior batteries and a charger, both available on Amazon: Orbtronic 3200 mAhr 18650 protected lithium ion rechargeable (yes, they're worth the $$ in reduced fire hazard and increased life)  Nitecore D4 controlled charger",

It uses the same batteries as the Sure Fire. Love this flashlight!",

The tech must have evolved quite a bit since then though. This was a fantastic purchase, and if durability proves to be an issue, I'll come back to update this. It feels similar in quality though, so I don't expect that to be an issue.",
