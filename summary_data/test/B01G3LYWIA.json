Just trust your gut and get your actual size. They are true to fit. I think all the reviews saying go bigger just have weird shaped and sized feet.",

The sneaker size may need to be ordered a half size (the first pair ordered was my actual shoe size & they were returned) larger than your shoe size. My pair is the narrow & fits like a glove with tube socks. It\u2019s a comfortable fit light weight sneaker. I\u2019ll make an effort to post another review after wearing them for more than ten hours. I\u2019m hoping the sneaker will continue to perform exceptionally.",

I recommend them highly, I will never buy a different brand again.",
