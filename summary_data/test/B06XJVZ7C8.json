      "text": "Works as advertised. Nice and light. Folds easily and rolls nicely on the course. Only two drawbacks that I found - and these were because I did not look closely enough at the item description - my fault. 1. Does not fold down with the golf bag installed. This means you have to remove the bag first so now there are two separate items to store in the trunk. Every time you go golfing you have to add or remove the golf bag. Inconvenient. 2. The front wheel does not swivel which makes it a bit more difficult to steer along the course. All in all, a good cart for the money.",

My forearms were killing me trying to keep the thing straight until finally I just tipped it back onto two wheels. Second, there is too much give in the handle. The front wheel is fixed so it needs to be lifted off the turf to turn. When you press down on the handle, it tends to give rather than lift the front wheel. Kind of flimsy. I am disappointed",
