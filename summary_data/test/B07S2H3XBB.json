This breakage is completely unacceptable for any medical product that should last for multiple uses a day for many years. Omrom's support was also unacceptable; not only did they not stand behind their product, they imposed a completely absurd delay in remedying a product fault.",

Nevertheless, it worked fine for a few weeks and then all of a sudden I started getting error messages. I followed all the instructions perfectly but it wouldn't work. I'm returning it.",
