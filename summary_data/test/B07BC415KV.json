I order the black ones and love that the heel is kind of beige. They go with jeans and dress pants as well. It\u2019s a beautiful combination. I\u2019m traveling soon and will probably take them with me as my major shoes for walking.",

So I bought 3 pairs after my first suede pair got ruined in a rainstorm. These are leather so I feel like I am safer wearing them and they have the very grippy gumsole, so much better for bartending in general. These fit well, I feel like breaking them in will be really easy and the color is so pretty in person. The sole is almost a small platform just in case that would deter anyone. I highly recommend, especially at 24 dollars!",
