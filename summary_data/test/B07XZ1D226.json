I used the rear mirror camera view almost all the time. When turned off, the standard mirror has somewhat anti-glare coating which reduces bright lights. I uploaded a video on how easy to use the UI and some sample recordings for both front and rear camera.",

The main problem is that the rearview mirror produces a double image that makes it difficult to see clearly. I also reflects a glare from car headlights behind you. The company seems to be aware of the poor design but offers no solution. They did offer me a refund but then I am stuck with the installation costs. I do not recommend this product.

As for the backup camera, the night vision leaves something to be desired, I have ceramic tint on all my windows and it was blocking too much IR light. I then moved the camera to the outside of my car and mounted it and on a sunny day the camera would almost white out. At night headlights would cause it to flare. This is where that sticker covering the camera comes in. I thought it was a standard sticker that protects the lens during shipping but nope, it's a CPL filter. DO NOT REMOVE IT UNTIL YOU FIRST TEST IT OUT!!",

May not seem like a big deal, but it causes you to not be able to see the video image, but only a mixed of reflected mirror images from the mirror itself - extremely dangerous as my eyes try to figure out what to focus on as I'm backing up.

Almost lightens it up more to see better. Installation was easy, especially in Jeep. Only two things is that I end up shutting the camera off and using the mirror on sunny days with top down as the glare from sun makes it difficult to see. I also find it annoying how the split screen shows up by default when you start the car, which requires you to change to rearview only before you start driving. I'm hoping a firmware update in the near future will fix",

      "text": "This is a nice camera. I am overall happy with it. Minor issues I experienced are associated with the fact that the mounting is not solid enough and the mirror mounted piece trembles when the car is in motion. This gives me a bit of nausea. I was unable to stop that from happening. This, however may very well be only my case. With rearview camera definitely needs to be installed by a professional, it is not for an unexpected person to do. But once in, it is a fantastic tool.",

Also the mirror-mount dash cam will not block part of your driving views. It\u2019s very helpful for the night time driving because is tinted in nature and kills rear cars\u2019 approaching lights. This product is working really good. It records both front and rear events and save them in two separate folders in micro SD card. Just remember you will need a high speed micro- SD card; otherwise it won\u2019t record video.",

With a VW Golf you get a wide enough perspective from the rear camera mounted top center inside the back window to see both blind spots! My only really hit probably could be fixed with a firmware update, when you put the car in reverse, the parking assist is intermittent. The resolution of the camera changes every time, so the signal is consistent, but the parking indicators are sometimes there and sometimes not. Not a big deal because you can still see everything without hitting anything.",

There is a bit of distortion due to the wide angle lens, things are actually closer than they appear in the screen. I can live with that. It fits my needs.",

The only hard thing was to move the camera mount, it is quite stiff to position. 2 modes of video (standard and locked), multiple features to change the movement, loop recording.

CONs: -Night vision: some of the colors such as green or red traffic lights are a bit dulled out compared to what our eyes see, but it is not critical. -Length of cam barely covers the mirror, wish it was a bit longer.
