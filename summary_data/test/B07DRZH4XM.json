      "text": "I was looking for a sous vide with physical buttons, no connectivity like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and that was built to last by a reputable company. I have tried other cookers with touch screen buttons that failed rather quickly or that could not hold a temperature but this device does what it is supposed to consistently. I have used atleast twice each week for months with no issues. I do wish the clamp to mount it to a container was adjustable but that is a minor thing. Seems silly that I have to pay so much more to get a device with less bells and whistles but like many others I value quality much more.",

I am trying to descale it (1/2 water, 1/2 vinegar, set to 140 deg. for 30 min) because there really isn't any other troubleshooting information available. It also cannot heat the milk to 180 and hold it for 20 minutes, so I have to do that in another pot which isn't great either since All Clad says it should be able to heat to that temp and hold it. So now I spent A LOT of money on something that is now useless",

Pros: Solid construction, easy to use, fast heat-up speeds and great outcome Cons: SUPER loud (even if you put a towel under the container its in), square shape makes it extremely hard to find a container/lid combo for it, does not have an adjustable arm. For the money you pay they could have designed this much better and made a container/lid accessory. I would have been perfectly fine with a less expensive product. More $$, is not always better in this case.",

It also has a 3 pronged plug. The controls are easy to figure out, I like that the head turns for easy access. The instructions include cooking times and even a few recipes. It can be fairly loud and that will vary with the container used and even be relatively quiet sometimes, otherwise it works great and is easy to use.",
