It does not take up too much space in between my toaster and my blender and it worked just fine straight out of the box (after a good cleaning with warm water and soap of course). The only gripe I've had with this juicer is that the mouth is significantly smaller than other compact juicers I have seen. If you choose to buy this product I would advise the buyer to acknowledge that they will have to prepare their fruits and vegetables but chopping them up into smaller pieces before being able to feed them through this particular juicer.",
