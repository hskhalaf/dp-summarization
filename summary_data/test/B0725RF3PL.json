      "text": "I just purchased a new car to tow behind my motorhome. I had only a few days to get prepared before hitting the road on an extended trip. So, without time to wire into the vehicle's actual tail-light system, these external mount lights did the trick. They are easy to set in place, the magnets hold them tight (past 70mph with no problems) and they are easy to see from the front (amber) and the rear (red).",

They're double sided so you can either use the red lights or the orange lights. I used the red side when pulling my camper. They do left turn signal, right turn signal, brake lights, flashers, and \"running lights\" when plugged in. We reached speed of 65 mph on the interstate and they never moved. They were mounted to metal on the back so I think that was the biggest issue other reviewers were having. They don't know metal from other materials. Try them for yourself. They're great.",

The magnets are strong enough to keep the lights from moving at all, but do release easily enough when you pull on them. They come with plenty of cable length and include an extra strand and press connectors if you needed more. The lights where bright and visible. They are Amber one one side and red on the other. I can\u2019t speak to longevity as they have been on there for only a couple months but they still work fine as of now. Overall I would buy them again for the price.",
