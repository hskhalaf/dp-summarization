If your son wants to try the position, but isn't sure he will stick with it... this is perfect. However, if he loves to catch and plays with a competitive team, I'd spend the extra money and get higher end.",

His only complaint is the mask. The back lip is kinda sharp and scratches him if he tries to rip the helmet off. It's very comfortable while it's on. Due to this he hasnt used it in a game yet. I need to sand it down or find something to put over it, but all in all a great set.",

I definitely suggest also getting the little wedge pads to attach to the back of the calves to make squatting more comfortable.",

The set allows the kids to have much better mobility. Before, we had problems with kids not being able to get set properly. This chest guard actually fits smaller players, allowing them to crouch comfortably behind the plate. One small complaint the kids have is that the face mask is hard to take off quickly. They were used to the bigger mask that fit them big, and was easy to take off when runners were going, etc. Overall, the kids really love the set.",

Another player on the team is 11, weighs about 110, and brights his own (slightly larger) shin guards, but uses the mask and chest protector from this set. No complaints - the pieces are lightweight and durable. Nice that it is color neutral (black and silver), so that it matches this year's jersey (Royals) and last year's jersey (Cardinals). Suggestion - Manufacturers should start including the throat dangle with these sets, given its uniform requirement for all Little League play.",
