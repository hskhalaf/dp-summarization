I do tons of code, email, and enterprise J2ee apps, it is fantastic to have such a large canvas to do things... Youtube at 4k full screen looks good. I can't comment on gaming though.",

At 4K, the monitor works well enough for gaming, but I wouldn't recommend it for first person shooters, or any games that require pinpoint accuracy. At 30Hz Vsync locked, the panel works really well for games like skyrim, where aiming isn't really a twitch requirement. Buy this, enjoy having the equivalent of four 1080P screens on one screen.

Programmers will be fine with the low refresh at 4k but any real visual enthusiast will probably run the display at 1080p at 120hz ( which looks glorious! ) Such a good deal for a 39 in 4k screen. Yea it doesn't have 60hz 4k, but it's also not 27 inch and as a 1080p 120hz display at 39 inches, I think it already pays for itself and then includes 4k to boot if you wanted to watch 4k Youtube, Netflix etc.",
