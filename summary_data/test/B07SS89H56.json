      "text": "I have used my GTX-2000 8 shoes for two short (5K) runs now and found them very comfortable from the start, without any breaking in required. My previous pair were Brooks Adrenalin GTS 18, which I also rate highly and find the Asics seem just as good, with the added advantage of being completely waterproof. My last run was in the wet, and as expected my feet were still dry at the end. They seem to be still breathable, but time (and longer runs) will tell. They also look great, so I have no hesitation in giving them 5 stars.",

Another known issue is having bad breathability due to waterproofing material. it will be good for winter.",

    "description": "These stable shoes GT-2000 8 G-TX for overpronouncing runners were specially developed for long-distance runs. The largest adaptation of the GT-2000 8 can be found in the midsole. The upper of the GTX version is made of GORE-TEX material. This gives the upper material waterproof properties so that your feet stay comfortably dry even when wet. The Flytefoam cushioning material is lighter and gives back more energy than the Solyte foam. Forefoot and heel areas have also been given more GEL to ensure better cushioning. The forefoot is more flexible and enables easier rolling. Dynamic Duomax technology and the Trusstic System provide stability and support for overpronators by preventing the feet from kinking inward when landing.",
