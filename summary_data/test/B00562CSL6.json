Tied fan to a smart switch so I don't have to go upstairs. Ducts open and close as described. Duct does not keep heat out from attic. Duct does not open all the way but I believe it's the airflow to the duct. Can be diy via YouTube. Works for inland house where during the summer it reaches 117 but at night drops to 70s. Recommend getting attic fans with thermal switches along with this to keep your house cool.",

When I first started the fan it had a clunk sound. After a little troubleshooting I found the fan pulley was a little loose a quick tightening with an Allen wrench and all was good.

As a result, there is no appreciable vibration transmitted to the house structure. The noise of the air movement is still appreciable, especially on HIGH. This fan really moves the hot air out of the room quickly!",

      "text": "We have a 1700 sq. ft. house and installed this in the upstairs foyer. You have to be selective about which rooms you want to cool, only leaving windows open in one or two locations. But it really draws the cool air in after the sun sets and cools off the targeted rooms in 20 minutes or so. Has made a huge difference in the comfort of the house as the day turns to evening. So far, no problems. It is a bit noisy but this doesn't really cause much of a problem. We run it on the one hour timer and that seems to be plenty of time to work it's magic.",

A little loud, but it does the job. Switches are adequate and do the job. I would add a timer in place of the on off switch. Great installation video on U-Tube.",
