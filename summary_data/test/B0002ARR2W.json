Some mats that were small would make it past the blades, but if I were careful holding the hair/mat I could cut it off with the blades. Be careful using as there is not much protection from the blades especially when removing the hair. Definitely not recommended for children to use.

      "text": "My favorite grooming tool! I have other dematting rakes and this one is by far the best tool for my ShihTzu and Maltese. I can even rake out their mustaches. You can be gentle or aggressive, but I suggest being gentle. With a minute's patience you can work even the largest mat out. The cutting edge is long and tapered with a serated-ish edge. The tips are smooth and gently glide across the skin. I have used it on my own scalp to experience what my dogs would feel. No objections here.",

This is really good quality dematting tool. Be really careful because it is really sharp. Use it very sparingly or your fur baby will have choppy areas in their fur. Great purchase!! I would definitely buy it again!!",
