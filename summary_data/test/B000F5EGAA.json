      "text": "I replaced a Tourney derailler on my Fito Beach Cruiser with the Acera. It's a crank forward bike, and the Tourney really struggled on the upshifts. I noticed when I installed the Acera how much better tension it has than the Tourney, which is why I suspect it works so much better with longer chains that are required for crank forward bikes. The shifts are smooth and solid. This derailler shifts very well under load...do not be afraid to pedal hard with it. I highly recommend this to anyone that still has a Tourney derailler and is suffering from poor shifting.",

I really like that it connects directly to the frame, unlike my old Tourney that attached with an extension, so it seems to have fewer moving parts to wear out. It was easy to install and adjust and seems shift smoother. I'm not a serious MTB rider, but I do ride every day, so anything that makes for a more pleasant ride is good and I'm really happy with this derailleur.",

      "text": "The product looks nice but the item is advertised as being able to fit a 6 -8 speed hg cassette. Well with every adjustment in the world it would not even come close. I could only get 7 speeds. Also this is not due to lack of knowledge, I have been working on bikes since I was a kid and I'm 35 now. However for the price I paid and for what the product is I decided to keep it and use it for another bike in the future. Not worth returning.",

I ordered this one as a replacement and it has been much more durable and accurate than the one that he had previously. Although it isn't on par with some higher end components like the ones on my Trek Fuel it is more than adequate for his needs.",
