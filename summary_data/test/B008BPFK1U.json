You can buy various pads or brushes to fit the unit to get the level of scrubbing you need. You can even buy a lambswool bonnet to buff your floors to a pretty shine before you entertain guests. We also use it on our Trex deck outdoors. Love it and it has a fairly small footprint so it stores easily.",

Tried a couple different bushes and pads, the slightly softer brush worked best as it seemed to get down into our grout more than the stiffer brush. Machine is heavy but not hard to maneuver when on. Now only need to run this once in a while for maintenance.",
