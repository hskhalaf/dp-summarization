I can see how this might be an issue for some as these are easily compressed into a very small shape so they can be inserted in the ear canal. The first time I used them I did just that, inserting them too deeply and finding them to be uncomfortable. Easily corrected though, just reinserted them but not as deeply.

You can use them two (maybe three) times if they're clean enough. After that, they loose a bit of their elasticity and become quite terrible, almost like they suddenly funnel noise into your ear instead of keeping it out. Just toss 'em at that point.",

I can't fall asleep if there's any outside noise, so I often suppliment with a, but I've never once been woken up while using these earplugs alone.

When rolling them down smaller, only roil the tip ~3/8\" . I find this a great help in getting proper insertion. I think the un-rolled part serves to support better to push the other part in.",
