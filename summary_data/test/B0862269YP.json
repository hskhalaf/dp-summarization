You could probably upgrade the memory and ram, they just want you to give that business to their technicians. Don\u2019t fall for it! Investigating, DIY before donating your money. I decided to rate it 4 stars because the product description is garbage. But I really like the design of this model. Lightweight and sexy blue.",

It looks like the battery is draining fast, but it really does last about 4 hours. The screen is often too bright so I use the nightlight setting to keep from getting headaches. The charger has a HUGE block on the end, so it takes up a chunk of room in the power strip. Overall, it's been perfect for what I need. I wouldn't recommend it for heavier use like photoshop, but if you only plan to use the internet and Microsoft Office, then it's great.",

Excellent display with a 14-inch 1080p screen. Pros: -Excellent display -Fast CPU and enough RAM -Exceptional speakers -Decent collection of ports -Powerful battery -Power Conservation mode to extend battery lifespan (when enabled, battery will not charge over 80%, preventing the battery from ever being in a high-tension state, therefore maximizing lifespan of the battery) Cons: -No USB Type-C with charging support",
