      "text": "I love these cups for pre and post. My old ones finally bit the dust after a few years (the lids crack). I got this one, but the lid is super difficult to snap on and the cap is also difficult to close and open. Also, the gasket that divides the two compartments falls out a lot. My other gripe is that the caps used to be two different colors so you can quickly determine which side is which. When they are both black, and now there is print on both sides, it's easy to confuse the two.",

      "text": "I found my self skeptical about this cup and it's two chambered design. I chose to buy it mainly because it was made in the USA and I liked the color and message on it. After using it for a couple of weeks I have ordered a second. It has worked perfectly for me as I drink one chamber early and one late in the day. When I reach a level of fitness where I need to push more it can be used for a pre workout and post workout drink. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is using whey or smoothies in their diet. Also pretty easy to clean.",
