Otherwise you may have to do some small ironing work when you get to your hotel. Other than that, the bag performed very well.",

I like how they close and hold things in place. The one complaint was that, on the way out, when we got to the ship, the zipper on mine was open a bit and my shaving kit was gone. I don't know if the zipper popped open or someone did it on purpose. We had no issues with it on the way home. I would recommend this bag overall.",

The fabric on the outside is much nicer than what they use on the inside. When they say 3 suit & dress they are not kidding! So just keep in mind if there is more than one person using it you may need one each. Thankfully the shop we had gotten my husbands suits from had supplied him with a garment bag (free of charge) he commented it was funny that the one we got from them was about the same quality as this one that I bought and paid for.",
