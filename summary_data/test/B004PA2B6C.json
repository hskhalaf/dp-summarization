      "text": "I've been using this router for about 8 months, and it's been very reliable. The only complaint I had was the website administration screens were a little complex. Not unmanageable...just built by engineers for engineers. I updated the firmware yesterday, and the GUI is a huge step forward. It's slick. Apple slick. Well designed. The information you want to see (i.e. user name and passwords) is prominently displayed with setting details accessible in a single click away. Managing the guest account (internet access only) is incredibly easy. Turning bands on and off is simple. It's range is great covering my entire single story 3,900 sq ft home. This has been a great piece of equipment for me.",

This is at least my 4th Netgear wireless router never with a complaint. Linksys would probably be one of my choices however, I do not like their software interface in the least bit. Would consider D-Link also. Back to this router, I have a 3 story house (Basement, ground floor, top floor, around 4000 sq ft). The previous router had somewhat weak signal upstairs as the wireless router and ethernet switch are in the basement. This router has fixed that problem and increased speed of data transmission as well. Netgear did very well once again!",

It took about 20 minutes to get this online with my modem and set up both networks. Adding my printer was as simple as pushing the button on the router - no password entry required from the printer. This little button is great. My one peeve is that the LED clarity makes the lights incredibly bright. Even turned around against the wall its distracting in the dark.",

Don't buy this expecting enterprise WAP range, though. It carries a decent ways for it to work well in most homes, but I was losing the signal within 50'.

Netgear make a huge deal out of this router having one of the best ranges of their product and it does not even come close to the hype. In fact, the range is significantly less than my previous model. If you're using this as a wired router then you should be satisfied but if you want wireless range you should look elsewhere.",

The 5 gig high speed side of this dual band router in my opinion was a waste. Performance on the high speed prove to be much slower than the regular \"N\" router speed. Overall, it's not a bad router. If you find it at a good sale price go for it. Again, if you're counting on the 5 gig aspect of this router - don't.",

      "text": "I bought this router to replace an older Netgear model. What I like about Netgear is the similar feel their configuration screens all have. I installed this router and had it configured in less than 10 minutes which included a couple firmware updates (required two). Since installation, it's run very well and we do notice faster WIFI speeds with our wireless devices.",
