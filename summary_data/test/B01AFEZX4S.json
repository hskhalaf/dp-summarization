The 12 cup canister lid is warped and has to be forced on. The 5 cup canister lid went on easily, but has too good of a seal, to the point where I broke a nail trying to remove the lid. I\u2019m not sure if the lids warped in storage or if quality control just isn\u2019t important anymore, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend these.",
