But considering it only has one blend setting, which should be pure\u0301e since this is for babies, you would think it would do a better job of that. Often foods come out chunkier than they should be. No matter how long I let it blend and what type of food I use it\u2019s never truly pure\u0301ed. Also they should have made it smaller and more compact. Counters get really cluttered when you have a young baby, and I\u2019ve never filled it up more than a quarter when making food. I should have probably just gone with an actual blender.",

Otherwise it is not worth buying because it only worked for a few months before being stored away.",

Just a word of advice, for string beans, peas and other veggies with high fibrous material, I recommend straining with a strainer when pouting into the container. Great product!",

Cleaning can be frustrating with the tube on the blades just because its hard to really get in there but honestly if you clean/rinse/soak right after use it shouldnt be an issue.",

Aside from the lack of spare parts, it's the best invention out there for busy working moms and dads that want to feed their babies healthy home made food.",
