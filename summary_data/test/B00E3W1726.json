Installing any hard drive is very straightforward and arguably one of the more simple installation/upgrade operations that practically anyone can perform. The Samsung 840 EVO 250 is a quality product and that includes concise installation/operation instructions and functional software that operates as designed. My recommendation is, 'know your hardware' then read the manual before attempting the installation. If it's not clear to you, read it again. If it's still not clear to you, have someone else perform the installation.",

Would definitely recommend this SSD if you want to put your OS and some games on it. However, the space fills up quickly (especially with newer games being as large as 20-30 GB each) and you may get \"spoiled\" by the load times and want to put EVERYTHING on a SSD!

Apps launch quickly, startup and shutdown are vastly improved. After considerable research, this drive is among the best price:performance options right now. Pro Tip: You don't need a SATA III drive for many older computers. MacBook Pros before 2010 did not have SATA III support. All things being equal, you might save some money buying a SATA II SSD, but SSD technology has been improving quickly. SATA III is backward compatible with SATA II computers.",

Next morning I swapped my old drive with the SSD and the system booted up without any problems. I am using SATA II, nevertheless I saw significant improvement in boot time. Cloning and install went smoth. Glad I got the Samsung.",

Some of these cables come with an External Power Supply. I didn't need to power-up the cable as the USB 3.0 5V port on my laptop was good enough to powerup the SSD during the file transfer.",

      "text": "These little guys are about the fastest SSD's on the market. When you're talking SSD, that's really saying something. We all know how fast SSD technology is. They're also great for power saving. If you don't need a terabyte of storage in your notebook, you can't go wrong. I also use these in desktops for the OS, and include a 3 terabyte HDD for storage. That combination makes for a VERY fast PC. Combine this with an FX8350 or Core i7 CPU and 8 GB RAM and you've got a really good start on a screaming fast computer.",

      "text": "Works great in my MBP Mid-2010. I have it about half full at the moment and it's still running great even at the Sata 2 spec that the machine supports. The link speed connects at Sata 2 by the way. No issues there like some machines with the nVidia chipset have with this drive. Mine uses the Intel chipset. Pair this with maxed out RAM and you'll extend the usable life of your machine at least 1 to 2 years. I can't believe I waited this long to do it.",

      "text": "I don't like to count off to much for defective units, everyone gets them from time to time - the big question is that does the unit perform as expected when it is up an working. Yes, the drive works just great. AHCI If you are adding an SSD to an older system and you are not using AHCI mode you can run into issues. AHCI is better and you want to run SSDs under this mode - the problem is that all your old drives will have to be reformatted too. This makes replacing a system drive a bit more work, so be careful.",

      "text": "Love this solid state drive, for the price I could not beat it, althought the 840 PRO is faster for 4k read and PC boot speed at the same size the price on this was unbeatable. I have 2 840 EVOs and am using Raid 0 on Windows 8.1 so I have a total of 500GB, and the speed benchmark runs at 1008MBps or 1.008 GBps compared to a old standard Hard drive that normaly runs anywhere form 60MBps to 180MBps on a brand new toshiba Hard drive.. The performance is great and the price is amazing for what you get.",
