      "text": "The truck is decently cute once completed. But it is annoyingly painful to put together. The holes for the axels and handle were too small and required applying some force or drilling. Few other things fit poorly as well including doors which do not close properly due to the gaps between them and the rest of the truck body. Also, somebody should have put some thought into how to replace dead batteries as nobody wants to disassemble this whole thing just for that. Basic seat belt would have been very useful. 0 stars for the quality, the rest is all for the joy it gave to my little guy.",

(I understand most people probably wouldn't purchase this for their one year old- so I assume older children don't slide down into the floorboard part of the truck.. so a safety strap may not be needed by everyone) I also wish there was an option to purchase different tires instead of the plastic ones, but so far they have been holding up well!",
