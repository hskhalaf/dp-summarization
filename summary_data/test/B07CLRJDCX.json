It works great, setup was simple and it loads video and websites very fast. The best thing is that I don't have to deal with fixing a Windows 10 update and virus protection and \"cleaning\" is a simple \"Powerwash\" away. As a Google fan, this works with my Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Photos, and Pixel 3XL phone flawlessly. A perfect low maintenance home computer.",

It is working now, and hasn't crashed since, but I've read a good number of comments that this is a problem other Chromebox owners have faced.",

You can add the Microsoft app and get online access to Word, PowerPoint, or whatever you need. I highly recommend these to any parents looking for an alternative option than a bulky desktop.",
