My whole family has looked through this thing and nobody thinks it\u2019s usable during daylight. The display is also pretty lousy, it looks like a 1980\u2019s alarm clock that is dying. Maybe I just got a bad one....either way it\u2019s getting returned.",

Glass is not as nice as my Zeiss Victory PRF but it\u2019s also much less expensive, also the Zeiss doesn\u2019t have the ballistic angle calculations built in Ike the Vortex does which is very nice. But with that said the glass is by no means bad, it\u2019s actually very good. Took this to the local range and the range finding is very accurate. The VIP warranty also can\u2019t be beat, this is a main reason why I\u2019m converting my optics to Vortex. This rangefinder is awesome.",

I took one step back to try and get 1400 and received \"----\" which means it could not get a reading. On non reflective-ish targets I am still experimenting. Best I have is just shy of 1000. Having a rangefinder has made me realize that 900, 1000+ yards would be a very long shot. Red display is excellent in all light conditions. Overall, I am VERY, VERY, VERY pleased with the product and would buy again. Also, Vortex lifetime warranty = peace of mind.",

      "text": "I took this on an elk hunt this year and it worked flawlessly. I lost my old trusty range finder on an antelope hunt 2 years ago and shopped hard for a replacement. I \"settled\" on this one. It's compact and easy to carry. The elk hunting was a bit slow, so I got to play with this rangefinder a bit. It would routinely range out past 1000 yards. It was interesting to see the variances in the distance to the target when playing with the Horizontal Component Distance mode. You can't beat their warranty either. I would highly recommend this rangefinder.",

      "text": "Great little (tiny compared to others) rangefinder and very accurate. The only thing that could be improved is the ranging time (about 1-2 seconds), but with a warranty like Vortex's VIP warranty this is to good a deal to pass up. Couldn't ask for a better pair of rangefinders from a more reliable company!",
