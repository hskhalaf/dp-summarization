And I'm impressed with the quality of the polish. Sure, the bottles are smaller than standard nail polish but there's plenty of variety and I imagine we will be bored of the colors and ready to buy new ones once we finish the little bottles so it's honestly the perfect size. The best part of us all getting together and having a nail painting party, we can actually sit together, chat, enjoy snacks and drinks together. The experience is much more preferable over a professional manicure.",

The nail-bed is warmer than the part of your nail that sticks out so you get try color. But even if your nails are shorter the color change is fun and both daughters had success growing their nails out a bit because of less breakage. Will chip under heavy use...so we of course have to apply often.",

Anyone who has done nails knows that too many coats can increase the chance of peeling. The light is also more of a toy than a real light. I ended up buying a better light, polish, and top coat elsewhere. The rest of the kit is decent but it's basically just nail shaping tools.",

      "text": "The kit is nice but after trying the nail polish, it lasted 1 week and started to peel off around the edges but actually taking the polish off was very difficult. I had to scrape my nail after soaking in acetone for 20 minutes....... Not good. It also did not come with any alcohol wipes.",
