It takes some time to get used to clicking with your thumb -I'm on day 3 three and it is becoming more natural. Using a third party app like X-mouse to disable the third button on the side of the stick is must for me - beware there is no scrolling which is not an issue for me. Very comfortable grip. My biggest complaint is the cable in the wired version is way too stiff and interferes with movement sometimes - probably would go wireless next time.",

So I have to switch back and forth in game using this and reg mouse depending on what I am doing and how much speed and accuracy I need. Also not being able to scroll is a huge annoyance.

I still haven't found a mouse that is perfect (or provides minimal risk for repetitive motion injuries). I think the best way to control this is by limiting the amount of time you use a mouse!!",

Today I have minimal elbow discomfort and work full time, all of which is spent on my computer. I cannot tell you how important this product is for people with RSI.

Better yet, my tendonitis in my index finger went away. 5. kind of a conversation piece...which works",

I must say that I found the small/medium one a bit too small for my liking. However, the \"large\" one does feel a bit too large as well. I think if your palm is 3\", then you can probably go with either one and get used to it. I ended up going with the large one.",
