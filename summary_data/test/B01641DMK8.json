I would definitely recommend it. Oh and I ordered a medium size for my 3 1/2 Yr old girl in case it helps anyone. It's a perfect fit",

I wish it came down a little farther but overall it's AMAZING! The wide brim shades his face, the mesh keeps him cool and the back flap protects his neck. We were at the beach all day and I felt confident that he wasn't going to get burned. (I of course applied sunscreen as well) I was a little hesitant at first bc of the price but I'm telling you...WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!",

These hats provide excellent coverage for their face, shoulders and back.( I still use sunscreen because we are outside playing in the sun every day.) These hats hold their shape well even when wet. We have been using them at the splash pad. The brims do not flip down when wet. I'm so happy with them I am ordering an adult size for my husband.",

Of course you can relock it. 3. Protect necks.",

This is much better than the long strap w the toggle as the strap gets caught and then the safety buckle pops open. Sizing is very generous w lots of room to grow.
