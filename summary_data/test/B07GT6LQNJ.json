      "text": "I got a free sample of this eyeliner last summer. I loved it! It\u2019s easy to apply, the color is bold and doesn\u2019t smudge. I am almost out of it, and I was happy that it was available on Amazon. I paid 26.00 for full size and it isn\u2019t the same. The applicator brush is different and it doesn\u2019t go on as nicely because it\u2019s too big and chunky. Cannot draw a fine line with it. The color looks like a washed out magic marker brown and it smudges. \ud83d\ude41 I\u2019m not happy with it at all. See attached photo- small sample and product received.",
