When Im in the silent area such as my house when kids are in the school, I can hear mild white noise through the headphone when I don't play music with power on & bluetooth connected. But I have to say it's pretty mild sound so I can disregard it. Furthermore how many times would I wear headphone without playing music? So I like this gadget, I am using it everyday and I will use it for a long time because I like it.",

So far, I've had no problems with battery life and my phone (iPhone 6) tells me how much battery is left on my headphones. The noise cancelling works really well, but it doesn't totally block absolutely everything out (and I'm okay with that). Listening to music at a quiet volume is really important because I listen to music all day long and I don't want to blow my hearing. The on-ear is good for average sized ears but might be troublesome for larger ears. Haven't had any problems with bluetooth connecting to other people's devices or anything like that.",

The headphones are comfortable but do not stay secure if I bend over or use them while working out. The case and accessories are fine but I wish it came with a connection to charge from an electrical outlet. I had to purchase separately from another company.",

Second problem- after 3 months, when I use noise canceling feature (wire/wireless modes) , left headphones developed weir noise , very annoying low pitch noise. Tried to return it , seller disregarded , I will go through manufactured warranty about the noise canceling problem . Sound overall is very good, music is rich and has good bass.",

Very low level buzz when connected via BT; sound not present when wired and essentially inaudible when music is playing. Too late to return so I'll keep using. Microphone for phone calls works well in my office. Buttons are intuitive. Battery life acceptable for long days. Folding design and storage bag very useful and takes up minimal space in my bag.",

The product works really well but would be much better and comfortable with proper cups. The sound is very good but cancellation is not quite as good (but it is impressive) as my bose 35ii. The bang for buck is better for the AKG. I bought 2x QC35ii for my family members with noise issues and 3x AKG for the rest of us.",
