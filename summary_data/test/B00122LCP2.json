Unfortunately, I missed the cutoff for return and will probably end up spending whatever I saved to buy additional foam or filler at the fabric store to stuff it. Whatever material was used to fill the bolster was too light or not enough. It gave little to no support. More like a soft pillow rather than the sturdy bolsters onhand at my yoga studio. It would make a good body pillow, but if you are looking for a solid support to use for stretching keep looking. This is not a good buy.",
