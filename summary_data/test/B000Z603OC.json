It undid all of the hard work I spent curling my lashes every morning, an issue I've never had with the volume mascara from Kevyn Aucoin. I don't know how this could be marketed as a curling mascara. It is terrible and I will never buy this again. I'm going back to the volume mascara that holds my curl as is.",
