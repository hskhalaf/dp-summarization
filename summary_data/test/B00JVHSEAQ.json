I tried various things over the years -- Kitters is five -- and have even taken him to the vet. I had pretty much given up, and thought it was my lot in life to be stuck with a stinky cat. But I recently transitioned from Beyond White Meat Chicken & Oats, which he's been on for a couple of years, to Beyond Grain Free, and viola! no more smelly cat. So two paws up from Kitters, and two thumbs up from me, on Beyond's grain-free formula.",

However, I have found this brand priced much lower in my local store. Give it a try, and give it a few days. If your cat doesn't scarf it down, they might just be playing it stubborn. =-)",

I changed to Science Diet due to their coats and skin being dry so how much oil can there be? They stopped eating the Science Diet and I have them on a Purina dry and am supplimenting to take care of their coats. They seem fine now but I really liked this cat food. I still give it to them as a snack from the smaller bags. They seem to enjoy the shape as well as the taste.",

I'm not sure if there was a problem with the packaging, but this is not the quality product that I normally have purchased and will have to switch to another brand if it happens again.",
