Also, the red lid on the gumball machine does not fit when all the balls are in the machine. Why couldn't the company put a little shopkin inside each ball? They cost nothing to produce.",

When searching for a Shopkins toy that she didn't have already or that I wouldn't find all over my house, I found this. You can put the shopkins in those little \"gum balls\" and they come out. You can use other Shopkins you already have. She has fun surprising her friends on choosing a surprise Shopkins from the machine. My only critique is that then gumball machine is attached to shelves making for awkward storage. I wish it was just a Shopkins gumball machine.",
