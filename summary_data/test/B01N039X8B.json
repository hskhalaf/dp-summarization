We had a downpoor one night and had no issues, unlike another tent at the site. Easy for one person to set up and take down in just a couple minutes, including adjusting position, attaching rain fly, tying down guy wires, and adding pouches. The center hook proved useful for fan/light. Only \"issue\" is light blocking fabric also retains heat and blocks airflow. Like most tents I have no idea how they come up with the number of people it will hold",

The dark rest is the only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars the spray or how ever it\u2019s applied is even so there are a lot of dark and light spots, as well as these little rounds spot where there is no shading. It still stayed dark enough that we slept comfortably in the some what shade till about 8am.",
