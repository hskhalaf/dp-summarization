      "text": "I bought this mini fridge for my classroom, to use while I was pumping at work. It has a removable shelf and, when removed, can hold 2 assembled pumps. If using medela bottles, it could probably fit 6 if they were stacked horizontally. The directions say not to leave it on for an extended period of time, so I try to turn it off overnight or every couple of days. Great for pumping teachers, or mom's who want to keep their expressed milk in a cleaner, more private fridge.",

      "text": "It is a neat frig. Bought it for my 12yr old and he really likes it despite it not being overly practical. You really can only fit a few sodas but I knew that going into it. One concerning thing. The HOT setting gets really hot! One of my kids accidentally switched it from cold to hot. It boiled two cans of soda and blew them up, the force opened the frig door and made a big mess! Not really any fault of the frig but definitely something to consider if this is going in a kids room. I assumed it was more of a \"warming\" option, not boiling.",

You can fit a six pack comfortably in this fridge, but not much more than that. It has a shelf that will allow you to fit as many 4 soda cans at the bottom and perhaps a couple sandwiches on top. There's also a \"warm\" setting to keep things warm, but I haven't used that feature yet. There are many mini fridges out there, but I chose this one because it's Star Wars..",

Also we needed this unit to run continuously. The directions state that it is to be used for 3 days maximum and then turned off for a minimum of 8 hours. Sadly we are disappointed in this item. It was returned as not being advertised properly. Be careful when you buy this item.",
