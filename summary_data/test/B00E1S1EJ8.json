Wonder Woman toys are hard to find so I was excited to find this action figure that wasn't outrageously overpriced. This bendable action figure wasn't as bendable as I expected it to be and in fact is pretty limited. That is the reason that I didn't give this toy 5 stars. It's better than ok but it's not as great as I had hoped it would be.",
