      "text": "After 6 months of minimum use on my living room home theater system, the trackball has become unusable... erratic and extremely slow. It is used in a clean environment and the keyboard was never dropped or otherwise abused. After reading other reviews here and on other sites, I realize I wasted my money. Just as well as it's an ergonomically challenged keyboard anyway. It's clumsy and difficult to move around within living room seating area as there are no handles nor non-key space in order to grab it. And it requires two-hands to operate as there's no buttons on the right side, near the trackball.",

Also it seemed a little difficult to get the reciever to acknowledge the keyboard and it not that hard. but i will change this review soon like a said after a week or so.",

To remedy that, I bought a large trackball mouse. Then, after several months, various keys on the keyboard stopped working, culminating in the entire keyboard giving up the ghost.
