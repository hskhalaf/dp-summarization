He is a tiny 35lbs, smaller than most preschoolers but he is about 6-8\" too tall for this. My suggestion would be that it is fabulous for a 1-2 year old but any older and they will be much too tall.",

It\u2019s basically another blanket with different fabric (nylon) It\u2019s super easy to roll and pack. The colors are brilliant after 2 washes It\u2019s perfect if you are going to use it over carpet, pad or foamy surface. 10/10",

However, it ultimately fell to pieces during it's first wash so that changed my perception of the quality. I will say that I was very happy with how quickly I was able to exchange the defective product. The new piece was in my hands by the next day.

It got rolled up and now we just use it when she\u2019s playing on the front room floor in full view of an adult.

That said, it was on sale for a great price and got smiles simply because it was Minnie Mouse and functional as a nap mat. My advice? Feed Minnie! Get some padding on her and go a bit higher end on the fabric for the blanket to give it more weight or soft/minky feel.",

So when you roll it up, the straps and handle are off to one side of the mat vs. being in the middle. It\u2019s a really bad design and makes no sense. I think they expect you to fold the mat in half lengthwise and then roll it up. But then the rolled up mat ends up being super thick and the straps are not long enough to Velcro it shut.",

Again, what I was expecting based off other reviews but be sure that is what you\u2019re looking for.",
