They don't realize that this style is the only type of square that can be easily adjusted in 2 minutes, and dialed in exactly squate by filing one of two alignment guides inside the slide area. Just check YouTube. Super easy and exact as long as you have a thin file. All squares should be checked over time for weather changes and after being dropped. This style is good for a lifetime. The 6\" is SUCH a useful size for marking and woodworking. Great value for $8. Easily worth double or more.",

Making the ruler non-glare seems like a no-brainer for anyone who makes such a tool. As other reviewers have noted, the ruler wobbles when I fix it at either end no matter how tight I make it. So I'm not sure if it's really square. And at one end, that shiny finish is just turning black - guess I must be crazy to expect a $10 tool to last more than 2 years.",
