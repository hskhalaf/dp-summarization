( You had better take your time building it, and you should be mechanically inclined, not for the meek) It came with everything needed to utilize it, to include tie down cabling. I have 2 raised planter boxes in it. I did put down a yard of decomposed granite for a base. works awesome.",

One thing we learned the hard way is that you MUST secure the entire greenhouse to the ground. Otherwise a strong gust of wind will toss it around like Auntie Em\u2019s house. The spikes are extremely solid and I don\u2019t expect we\u2019ll be chasing it anywhere in quite a while.",

They are attached with zip ties and there are definite gaps no matter how hard you try to get everything fit correctly. I could heat the old version and grow my seeds out. There is no way this would hold heat well enough to do so. The quality is much lower... Guess they needed more profit. Really disappointed since me previous shelter logic lasted so long. Already looking to replace for next year.",

The greenhouse features integrated shelving on both sides for built-in staging of plants. The shelves feature a metal grid design, which allows for proper draining. It also has a double zipper door panel that rolls up, allowing easy walk-through access to plants and seeds. The front door and the back rear panel both have vents for maximum airflow and temperature control. The greenhouse can be assembled in about an hour and a half with 2 people.
