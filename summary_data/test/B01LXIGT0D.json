Wear them as intended and I think they will be fine. my wife also has had broken both ankles and these provide her pain free walking unlike other shoes.",

      "text": "My new favorite pair. These are great. I ordered a half size up (7.5 ordered 8) as I always do for pointy shoes and they fit great. Classic look, will never go out of style and can be worn with everything. Great purchase, nice price. The heel height is perfect for all day in the office. They add additional dressy look to any outfit. They can feel a little wobbly at first because of the skinny heel, if you are not used to that kind of heel. I am looking forward to wearing these a lot.",
