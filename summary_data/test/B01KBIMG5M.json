      "text": "This thing is amazing! Just finished using it today for the first time for a client. I didn't have the remote so stopping and starting was a bit of a hassle. Also, $11.99 for the full app? It was worth it though because I had complete peace of mind with my shoot. Hooked it up to my GH4, size 58m lens (12-35). You do have to punch in a little to get around the vingnette, but I was doing that anyway to create a little bokeh. Anyway, great product, worked well with my iPhone 6+...just adjust the font size to client's liking. For $100, you're getting every $ worth.",

I use a 24mm full frame lens and the edges of this box actually vignette. Nowhere is it advertised that it only works with certain lenses of specific focal lengths so it caught me by surprise. So the only option is to use a 35mm lens or longer, nothing wider than a 35mm will work, just be aware of that when you buy it. Unfortunately for me that didn't work so I sent it back.",

You absolutely can not tell that I am reading from a teleprompter, I think because the text is essentially right within frame. Bigger teleprompters have the text going to far left or right of the lens/frame and you can see eye movement. Granted this is not for a far away use, but I find it perfect for YouTube like videos",
