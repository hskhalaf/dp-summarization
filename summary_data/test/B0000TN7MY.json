Steam leaks out around the ill fitting face piece, which is a one size fits all thing. 2. Face piece actually has a good sized opening in it that lets steam OUT, which defeats the purposes of getting a lot of steam to breathe in! 3. Pieces that come off to add water are not the easiest to put back where they belong. Just not very \"user friendly\" in my opinion. I won't send it back, but am going shopping again for what I had before.",

I've been singing in bands for 20 years, and wish I had found this sooner. Even through allergy season, this was a huge help. It's super easy to use and to clean.

We bought this when we had a bad bout of respiratory flu. There was a point I couldn't smell or taste anything for several days the congestion was so bad. I used this machine several times a day during my illness and gave some temporary relief which I was grateful for. Great to have on hand.",
