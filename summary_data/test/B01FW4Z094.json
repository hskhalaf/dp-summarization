      "text": "I normally buy Jif, because that was the kind my Mom and Dad bought, but I like Hormel products (my nephew's wife works for them) so I purchased Skippy to try. I was a little bit worried since my son was coming home for Thanksgiving weekend and he eats a peanut butter sandwich almost every night as a snack. I'm happy to write that he has purchased Skippy before (always on sale) and the taste is very good. Spreads easily and didn't seem oily. Now I have another option we all like.",
