      "text": "Purchased this guitar as a Christmas present beginner instrument for my son to learn on. He plays tuba in his high school band and wants to expand his knowledge. After a very busy high school band season, he just put the strap on today to practice and the fabric strap failed. Guitar fell 3-4 feet on thick carpet and the fret/neck section shattered. The hole on the fabric strap split as the picture shows. I've been an Amazon PRIME customer from almost the very beginning, this is by far the worst service I've received and I'm starting to think I should look elsewhere. Unacceptable. Needs to be made right.",

If it came with some sort of beginner lesson tutorial it would be perfect. I still play this guitar a ton and have made a few videos using it (and reviewing it) on my YouTube channel. 10/10 would recommend this guitar to anyone looking for a great value!",
