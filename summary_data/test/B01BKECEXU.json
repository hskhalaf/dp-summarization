I reached out to Hill's today to ask if the \"recipe\" has changed and they provided the following information - for those that are interested: Perfect Weight Hearty Vegetable & Chicken Stew Dog Food Canned has not been reformulated, however early in 2018 we transitioned to a new rice starch supplier due to raw material availability. We too have noticed loose gravy since this change. While this has no impact on nutritional value, we are testing a new gravy recipe that would provide a thicker gravy consistency.",
