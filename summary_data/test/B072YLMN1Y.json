The pack came fairly quickly and I am more than satisfied with Amazon doing a fine job delivering it in perfect condition! If you want to save money on the polish, I reccomend buying packs like this one on Amazon to save you some money. Most MINI GELISH polishes are $13... FOR ONE.. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!",

The red is a perfect red for holidays or everyday. The muted mauve is a beautiful color that'll match anyone. The deep purple is a nice and the light purple is a nice summer/fall color. I'm still looking forward to trying out the other colors but the quality of the nail polishes are very good.",

These seem to need 2-3 coats, and the colors do seem to end up a little lighter than the bottle, but they are still nice. I think that's to be expected. I cure each coat, then a top coat, and then rub vigorously with alcohol soaked cotton ball to finish. Following those steps is important so they don't peel! :)",
