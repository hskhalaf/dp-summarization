Between this coming without all the parts and the swing set bracket (also Eastern Jungle Gym) I purchased not fitting the recommended lumber, I will definitely not be buying this brand again. Edit: after some additional emailing I was able to get the missing pieces. It is a nice tire swing (when in it's entirety).",
