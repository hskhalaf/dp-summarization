Other generic brands are 1) poorly designed which means a nasty odor always lingers from dirty diapers or 2) cheaply designs it so it runs out faster. This brand not only locks in the odor inside the bag of our Diaper Genie, which means no foul smells in the nursery, but also lasts a very long time before we even need to purchase extra refills. Definitely a great product and a great price point!",

However, the quality is slightly less than name brand (or even Walmart brand). The biggest problem we had is that the manufacturer doesn't always put the opened-end close to the 'top' and mark it with a white sticker. In one case my wife wound up pulling half the bag out of the holster to find the end, making that refill useless, giving us a 7 pack instead of 8. I will try a different brand next time.",

I didn't realize this until I had already opened the package and one of the refills, so couldn't return it. One out of four purchases have been this way, but I guess sometimes you only get what you pay for.

One tip I would suggest for anyone using the Diaper Genie: save yourself a lot of bag space by compressing the diapers downward before cutting the bag to tie. You can typically force the waste down to the bottom of the bag and save a lot of space. I saved around 2 feet length of bag by doing this.",

      "text": "This is a great alternative to the expensive Genie brand refills. I have a home child care business and change a lot of diapers. I haven't noticed any increase in odor in the changing area or needing to change to the refill more often. One refill did unravel very quickly leaving unused liner in the pail but I was able to gather the extra back up and re-use it. Someone suggested leaving the shrink wrap ring on, I'm going to try that if it happens again. However, it only occurred one time so that may not be necessary. I have tried other \"generic\" brands and this has been the only one I have been pleased with. It's worth a try!",

Don't cut the top of the bag off until you pull it out of the can and check for gaps, otherwise that space goes to waste.",
