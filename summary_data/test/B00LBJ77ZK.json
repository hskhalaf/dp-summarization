I have spent the last hour using tweezers to try and remove this darn thing from my computer's audio jack. I rarely ever remove this from my computer as this hooks my computer up to the speakers so maybe it's a quality issue and not an over usage issue. The sound quality is good but the build quality failed today. I have owned this since November 2015 5/16/17 Excellent customer service and warranty. Would recommend this product and company",

Overall quality of the cable and jacket are very nice, and the molded feel of the connectors is also well done. Very satisfied for our purposes.",
