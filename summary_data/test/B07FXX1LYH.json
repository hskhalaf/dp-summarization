      "title": "Love better than my foam roller!",
      "text": "I love this little vibrating, massage ball! I have used foam rollers for years and was recently introduced to this little gem. It works out sore muscles with its duo of vibration (with 4 different speeds) and raised treads. Its compact so perfect to take to the gym or even on a trip. It's about 4 inches across. What I like best about this ball is you can use it like you would a foam roller but you can also hold it where you need it most. Think inside of your legs. This comes with a charger so no batteries required. Bonus!",
