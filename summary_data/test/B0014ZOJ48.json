One thing that I found annoying was that I needed to contact support about a bolt that was missing and the information provided by amazon was incorrect. No one at that company knows a thing about this rake, nor do they support it. I was able to find the manufacturer and contact them directly. They were extremely helpful.

When you cast the rake out in front of you and pull it towards you, material on the ground is moved towards you. It's a satisfying product in this sense, almost magical. It also appears to be an effective tool for keeping zombies and zoned out meth heads at bay. I will update my review as I have more experience in this area. Nothing has fallen off this rake, and that includes the attractive paint. No gripes about hand grip. General hand feel and weight are good to good+.",

After weeding manually I wait a day and use this rake to sift through the sand to remove the dried plants and roots that got left behind during weeding. This rake works very well for that. The straight edge blade also works well for pushing sand. I use it for leveling after my kids are done digging holes for their sand castle building. The rake seems well constructed although I'm not a commercial user of it. The aluminum handle with rubber grip are comfortable to use. Very satisfied with this purchase.",
