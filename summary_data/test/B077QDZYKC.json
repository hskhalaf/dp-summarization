Now, after installing the new car stereo this antenna was intended for, I'm finding reception very poor. I don't think its the radio. I can't pick up stations that all other car radios can get. I'm going to try a different antenna. Unfortunately this one is a major pain to get back off. You get what you pay for.",

For a few dollars more I have purchased a Hernio marine radio, Which is working like a charm. And yes, I am using it on my car. I guess you get what you pay for, never again.",

The base iffy: moisture could seep in through it, (but you can fix that with form-a-gasket) and it's not at all intuitive how you change the antenna angle.",
