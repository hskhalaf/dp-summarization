      "text": "I bought this waffle iron because my teenage daughter makes waffles for breakfast every day so it was worth it to me to spend substantially more for this product; however, I was disappointed that this waffle iron didn't work as I thought it would. As noted by many other reviewers this waffle iron does not get my waffle's brown and crispy. I make Kodiak Power Cakes with milk and an extra egg and no matter how long I cooked the waffle they would not crisp up. Maybe it's just this brand of waffles. The 2 star rating is because this waffle iron is incredibly well built and will undoubtedly last forever. I think more wattage would make a big difference.",

Unfortunately it was also more expensive by a fair margin. However I was looking to purchase one that would last. So having said that It is well constructed and has a professional appearance. Iis easy to use and easy to clean. In fact at this point I hardly have to clean it. The waffles lift right out without leaving any residue. Time will tell on the longevity and I hope not to test the customer service. Very happy so far.",

We actually made vegan waffles from a recipe by The Vegan 8. There is no butter or oil in the recipe, and I didn't need spray oil or nonstick spray on the waffle maker either! I used a wooden skewer to pull the edge up after the waffle cooked, and then a spatula to lift it out the rest of the way. We made 3 batches of waffles, and nothing stuck! I love Breville products! The quality is always great!",

The moat is a plus, but still, measure 4 ozs or a half cup, per waffle, when attempting your first batch. After that, you\u2019ll be able to eyeball your fills without measuring. Basically, fill the bottom plates just above the squares and just below or up to the contain lines.",
