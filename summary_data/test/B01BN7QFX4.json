Obviously made for industrial purposes, they also work great as fridge magnets if you have serious weight to hold up. (You'd have to slide them off the side, tho.) The counter-sunk hole makes it very easy to mount these to a wall or pegboard, and the design of them means that the entire magnetic field is on one side of the magnet, doubling its strength. I do not doubt for a second that these could hold 75 lbs. Would definitely buy again.",
