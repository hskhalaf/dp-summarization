The program has been a total resource hog in the last two months and, to my great dismay last week, it actually missed catching a virus! The culprit was the \"auto update\" thing which hadn't worked for a long time! This is the worst piece of software I've come across. I downloaded a free version of Panda Anti-Virus last week and it was able to catch and clean the virus without a hitch. NAV sucks and I'll never buy another product from Symantec again.",

For several minutes after I log in it does not let me launch ANY applications until it finishes launching its zilions of services. When I try to launch anyting it comes up with the message \"Application is waiting for a virus scan\". I plan to take advantage of Symatec's money back guarantee and return this DOG to the. Ugh! Guess I will have to try MacAfee+ZoneAlarm this year.",

Symantec has no solution to this at this time (several weeks after they discovered it). I finally ended up getting a refund (after going through about 10 phone numbers).",

Don't run any other programs while installing and go get all the updates before you run the program, they fix all the problems and allow it to run well.",

The product activation did not come up with a valid number so I never got around to activating the program. Too many problems - will carefully check product reviews before buying Norton stuff in the future and probably just get an alternative. Norton should offer a full refund, or a free upgrade to an antivirus program that actually works, to anyone who bought this program.",

I don't know what Symantec is thinking about but keeping loyal customers isn't one of their priorities so it seems.",

The product activation has a bug on Windows XP Professional that makes it \"forget\" that it's been activated. And after you activate a few times, it locks out your product key leaving your computer completely unprotected. The Symantec knowledge base acknowledges the problem but cheerfully tells you they don't know how to fix it. Testing? What testing? I think it's time to get my money back and buy a product that actually works.",

Its \"real-time\" file protection feature thrashes the hard drive, and its e-mail protection feature has caused serious problems with MS Outlook. I have had to disable these \"features\", and the virus protection has been a pain to use and maintain. It's clear that NAV is catering to corporate environments at the expense of the home users' market. This year, I am going with Zone Alarm for virus protection. Their firewall product is excellent, so I am hoping that their virus protection will play nice with Windows 98. Wish me luck!",
