I'm super disappointed. I used to recommend this litter to everyone for great clumping and exceptional odor control. The clumps fall apart and odor control is non-existent.",

At one point, we ran out of litter early, and we had to buy the lavender kind since the store was out of the multiple cat formula. Our cats made it very clear that they prefer the multiple cat litter, so after tweaking our Subscribe and Save schedule, we don't run out anymore. Highly recommended!",

I really don\u2019t like it... but you only smell that when really close to the litter box so it is so-far tolerable until I find a better option. So far I have tested grass litter which has a softer texture that my cats liked but the odor control is way inferior to this. Thus I\u2019m sticking to worlds best for now.",
