Now, after three months of Flexadin, she still limps a little, but she can run again. Highly recommend. UPDATE: I ordered another pack of this product when I began to run low on the first...it arrived congealed together inside its pack! Maybe the heat in shipping? I don\u2019t know, but once it was in the air-conditioned house and cooled down, I still had to pry each dose apart from the semi-melted mass. The stuff works great, but the texture was that of softened tar when it arrived (August 2018).",
