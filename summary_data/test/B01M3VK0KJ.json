      "text": "After careful consideration I wound up deciding on these. I absolutely love them, and for the money I think they're unbeatable. They only took me about 5 minutes to get used to, and after that (like some other reviewers) I spent of my time at the top of the hill waiting for others in my group to strap up! Seriously cut the amount of time spent strapping in by a whole lot. My only gripe really is that the forward cant adjustment knob moves on its own, and especially so every time you un-strap that foot. so every few runs I had to readjust them. I'll get that taken care of using some loctite or something though.",

My only complaint is that the description says the plate provided fits 3 hole burton boards, but it did not fit MY 3 hole Burton Canyon board. Luckily I had my old plate and it fit perfect. Maybe burton has changed hole locations and mine is different.",

It takes ten seconds to lock yourself in and being able to lock and loosen the over the foot strap is very important. The only draw back with this binding is the back support had to be sanded down. This is my family's second pair of these bindings and both had to be sanded so the boot could be pulled out. If you don't, it can top the sole of of your boot",

Super easy to use, very convenient.",

    "title": "System MTN Men's 2020 Rear Entry Step in Style Snowboard Bindings",
    "description": "System MTN Men's Rear Entry Step-In Snowboard Bindings : System's all new MTN snowboard bindings are revolutionizing the market. Featuring their state of the art rear entry/step-in design, these bindings are easier to get in and out of than any you have used before! Say goodbye to sitting down to strap in, or messing with straps and buckles, System's MTN bindings let you set it and forget it! Just slip the hi-back down, slide your foot in and ride away! Unlike other rear entry bindings, the MTN ankle strap automatically opens to provide tons of room to fit your entire boot, and then cinches back down with one quick lever! The patented design of the rear cable locks the hi-back in place and actually tightens with pressure, making your bindings stronger and more responsive the harder you ride, all while keeping you firmly attached to your board! But the tech doesn't end with getting in and out of these, the MTN also features full EVA padding on the hi-back and high density dampening on the footbed for a plush, comfortable ride! The 3D molded ankle strap is covered in highly durable polyurethane that offers maximum comfort and instant response! Toolless forward-lean adjust, covered baseplate and sliding strap adjustments make tweaking the MTN to perfectly fit your boot and riding style a breeze! System has perfected an easy in, easy out step-in style binding that actually focuses on performance! Footbed: High Density Dampening The MTN utilizes high density dampening pads through both the heel and toe ramp of the binding. This reduces board chatter and shock from impacts while creating a smooth cushioned ride! Whether it's icy chop, big drops, or fast lines, the MTN will feel like you're riding on a cloud. Baseplate: Fully Compatible Multidisc The fully compatible multidisc base plate allows the MTN to easily mount on all boards including standard four hole, Burton three hole, and the Burton Channel EST boards!",
