The Batmobile headlights work when the button on the underside of the orange \"roll bar\" is pushed. There is a launcher on the back of the Batmobile that once flipped up will launch the included disks. Because this is going to be a gift, we only were able to try the headlights and not the launcher, but the whole set looks like fun!",

Batman and Robin can ride together in the car which he loves, but it also had the separate motorcycle just for Robin.
