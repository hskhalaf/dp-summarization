On the front it says up to 32 serving sizes... on the nutrition label, it shows 16 servings at 2 scoops each for a total of 90 calories and claims to be a total meal replacement for kids. How on Earth is a child supposed to survive on 90 calorie meals? And if you want it to last 32 servings, that cuts it to 45 calories per. It has a good boost of vitamins and the flavor is actually pretty nice but I needed something to help my little guy gain more weight, especially because he has lots of food allergies and eoe.

The downside to this is like others have said, it mixes terribly. I have to mix it with very hot water to dissolve it, then I add ice and regular milk. Even blending it with something cold right, it doesn\u2019t mix well. It has to be hot to make it mix.",

Sometimes I serve this just as chocolate milk and sometimes as a shake and sneak some spinach and other healthy things in.

You can incorporate Kidzshake in so many recipes, from muffins, bars, cookies and energy bites, to smoothies and smoothie bowls. One of my favorite ways to use the chocolate Kidzshake vegan is in yogurt! (Tastes like chocolate pudding!) Kidzshake is just a wonderful multivitamin that is also gluten, soy and nut-free.
