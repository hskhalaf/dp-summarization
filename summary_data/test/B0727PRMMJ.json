Because the top is flat, it doesn't drip to the outside of the bottle and the lid covers any drips. However, it does need to be wiped off occasionally.",

It leaks all over the top and runs down the bottle. I had glass bottles but they broke. They had very thin and narrow spouts that never dripped. This design is not practical. I have to constantly clean the outside of the bottle. It can be tricky especially since there is oil in it. The manufacturer needs to change the spout.",
