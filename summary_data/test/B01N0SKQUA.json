      "verdict": "Sometimes simple is better. The simple styling of the Lacoste Lerond Canvas sneakers belies a superb construction that had many users mentioning they will recommend the kicks to their friends. They\u2019re also quite comfy which is a significant point to consider when purchasing shoes.The uppers of these shoes seem to attract dirt quickly, however, being made of canvas, they\u2019re also quite easy to clean. There is not much arch support in these low-tops either, but inserts might do the trick. The shoes do come true to size and provide an adequate fit.",

      "text": "Great look on arrival. However rigid back cut both heels to pieces after 10 minutes of wearing. Soaked back of trainers in cold water which removed the blood. Wore thick socks and plasters second time of wearing to no avail. Also have only worn trainers twice playing tennis on astroturf and the trainers have discoloured beyond belief. Would not recommend unless you don't intend to wear and want to just keep them in a box for show.",
