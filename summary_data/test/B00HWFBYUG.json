I don't regret it though because the colors are f********** amazeballs! Highlighter, contour, bronzer, eyeshadow: simply everything is included in this palette! I did a flash photo and a normal one. Seems pretty cool but it's so much prettier in real life :) I want to have the butter bronzer too but I don't have the money lol",

My skin also suffers some hyperpigmentation from over exposure to the sun, and the shimmery effect of this product (along with the Physicians Formula RX Concealer), really minimizes any noticeable dark spots on my face. Please do not discontinue this product because it's fantastic.",

If you don't use a brush and really work it into your skin, it just looks like a strip of chalky powder on your face.",

I do have \"nicer\" highlights, but this is a good product, and I'd highly recommend it to someone who wants to his/her feet wet in the highlighting game without investing too much money.

The formula is buttery, pigmented, and blends really well. Personally, I've found that my skin really likes Physician's Formula products. This is one of those products everybody should have in their make-up bags.",
