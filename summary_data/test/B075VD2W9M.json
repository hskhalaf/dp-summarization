      "text": "I ordered this product thinking it would be a fun, and a little bit cheaper, alternative to playing the actual course. WRONG!!! At $100 for 13 clips i might as well make the money worth it and play 3 rounds of golf with how easily they break. The little clips that are suppose to hold the sensor on the club shaft are cheap and break easily. I could make stronger clips from paper. I played 9 of 18 holes my first time to try it out and 4 of the 14 clips broke and half my strokes were putts. I wont be able to finish 2 rounds at this rate and will definitely never recommend this product to anyone.",

Only complaint I have is that in order to use the simulater you better have a pretty powerful laptop or desktop in terms of graphics card and memory as my laptop was not powerful enough to run the game. So that extra money I could\u2019ve used to buy the skytrak went into a computer. Other than that it works great and is a lot of fun. The yardage is preset for clubs but that can be changed in the options for your clubs. Set lofts and lengths of clubs to improve the accuracy of yardage and strikes.",
