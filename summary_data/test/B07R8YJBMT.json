      "text": "My favorite part fo this diaper bag is how many compartments it has. At first I was not sure what we'd use them all for, but it's allowed my organization-obsessed self to be at ease with finding things quickly when we're out. We are one month in and the bag has, so far, proven to be sturdy and efficient at holding everything we need. My only complaint is about the strap- it is as comfortable as one can be. I haven't had to carry it for long periods of time, but I imagine if we did it might get uncomfortable.",

The bag, however, is quite light and small enough to fit under the seat of an airplane. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",

I'm happy I settled with this especially on prime day. There is AMPLE storage and pockets. The material is great quality and seems like it would be easy to wipe clean. But I do think its kinda heavy ( little more than 2 lbs). So it might be annoying to carry around. I also kinda regret not getting a bag where the bottle insulation storage area isn't covered and is just a slot on the side. Besides those two points, I love it.",

One thing to keep in mind, older kids have bigger clothes, so my 3 year old only needs an extra pair of pants and a couple of pull ups. Baby on the hand will have much more, so there will be plenty of room for everything for her as well. I'm excited to really start using this bag.",

      "text": "I had a list of things I wanted in a diaper bag and took a while to pick the right one. It had to have an insulated bottle pocket, had to have tote handles, needed to be big enough to fit anything I wanted, needed to have big front pockets to hold my water bottle, needed to have a lot of inner pockets and needed to come with a changing pad. This diaper bag has all of the above plus more. I am very very happy with my purchase and I can see it being useful for multiple kids and for air travel. Looking forward to using it for a long time!",
