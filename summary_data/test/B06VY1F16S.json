For the money the value is there. I have now owned it 3 weeks, it's been washed 10 times. I just purchased the blue one.",

It fits exactly like the fit on the model. Slightly loose in the midsection and sleeves. I have a bit of a beer belly too. If I weighed my normal 172 a small would probably be a better fit. The material/weave seems a little different than most cycling jerseys. It's not as smooth/silky feeling. Looser weave I think. Have to give 5 stars based on quality and price.",
