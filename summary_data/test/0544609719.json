The only exercise I performed during the 30 days were every day chores around the house (yard work, clean the pool, sweep and mop, etc...). I did feel a little disoriented at times during the first 7-10 days while my body was detoxing. The only other thing that was a bit concerning is the fact that I did not have a regular bowel movement.",

However, it offers next to nothing for vegetarians except to tell them they should eat meat. It explores the dangers of dairy and soy, but treats meat as if it is all good, but that is if you can afford free range meat. I don't think it did justice to the dangers of meat the way it did, for instance, to dairy. As a lifelong vegetarian, i decided the keto diet was not for me.",

I will say that reading the It Starts with Food book is a good idea just for the huge amount of background knowledge given. Educating yourself before taking on a life-change such as this is key.",
