We gave her one every day at lunch, she begs so much that now it\u2019s breakfast :). All of the flavors are loved equally. It does look like a quality product, chunks or real food and a nice thick gravy covering it. It was a great find on our part, Bella\u2019s too!",

      "text": "My cats LOVE gravy and lick it off almost every food I give them, leaving bits of dry food in the bowl. I use a package to share between their two bowls and mix these \"treats\" with the leftover bits. Sure enough, the bisque and the bits disappear. Works well and I feel like we're not wasting food. I will say that it's soften hard to get all the bisque out of the package, but at least it's not plastic.",

Each day, she feeds one tube to them, alternating back and forth, a little at a time. They love it! So much so that they gladly sit within inches of each other, politely waiting 5 or 10 seconds until it's their turn to have some squeezed out so they can lick it. I can definitely say that it has contributed greatly to lowering their stress level with each other, and that makes it worth the money.",

She doesn\u2019t always eat all the meat but loves the gravy. I try to break up the meat in the pouch before I open it, then she eats a bit more of it. I add a small amount of hot water & stir it in so she gets more gravy & it\u2019s a little wam. Spoiled!!!",
