      "verdict": "The Ryka Eva NRG was complimented for being a comfortable workout trainer. Its lightweight nature pleased shoppers in general. It was also praised for its traction on studio floors. However, there were complaints about the outsole\u2019s durability, the upper being too soft, and the footbed being too firm. As for the fit and sizing, people were on the fence because some claimed that it did not follow the brand\u2019s measurement scheme. But in the end, those who were able to purchase the right size and width were contented with their trainers.",
      "pros": [
        "The Ryka Eva NRG was immensely praised for the comfort it offered to many of its users",
        "The lightweight construction pleased numerous owners",
        "The fit and length were perfect, according to a lot of consumers",
        "Plenty of gym-goers stated that this model provided support on top of the feet and under the arches during workouts",
        "The durability of this footwear impressed multiple testers",
        "The traction of the outsole provided enough grip and allowed the foot to slide when needed during dance/studio exercises, said several fitness enthusiasts"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A significant number of reviewers were dissatisfied with the sizing and the width",
        "others thought it was short and narrow, while some stated that it was large and wide compared to previous Ryka models",
        "The back collar of this Ryka shoe was too high that it caused chafing and blisters for a minority of buyers",
        "The underfoot cushioning was too stiff and caused discomfort for several wearers",
        "The upper material was too soft that it failed to properly lock the foot down of some people",
        "A few folks complained about the quality and durability of the outsole because it peeled off and did not provide much traction"

As far as comfort, they are comfortable except for the narrowness. Hoping they stretch out over time but I would not order again.",

I wore again today for my work out with thinner socks and I specifically didn't tie the shoe strings and it was still a little tight, but this helped a ton. I recommend getting a half size larger, if you normally wear a wide width or switch out shoe strings for a longer pair.",
