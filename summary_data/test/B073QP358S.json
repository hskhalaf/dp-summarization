      "text": "People always said the DC snowboard boots run small so I bought the DC Mutiny 2016 model in US8 before, came out they are a bit large for me. While some other opinions said DC runs true to size, so I bought the Mutiny 2018 in US7 but have to return them. The quality is there, good heel hold and I like the colorway. It terms of length, they are true to size, yet in terms of width, they are way too narrow for my feet.",

      "text": "Overall the boot fit true to size. The boots were snug and my toes touched the end as they should. I liked the heel padding that locks your foot in place. Expect a couple of days of boarding to break these in. Tongue padding is thin. I had issues with my bindings pressing the metal lace rings into the top of my foot. The stitching is cheap, as with most items made in China. Stitching began to break after one day of use.",
