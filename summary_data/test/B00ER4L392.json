The chest protector is perfect. Honestly, it would be hard to find gear this great at double the price.",

    "description": "Perform at the top of your game every game. The new 2014 Louisville Slugger PGS514-STY Series 5 Youth 3-Piece Catcher's Set comes with a helmet, chest protector and shin guards. New lighter, Precision pad designed chest protector fits better than ever before and doesn't ride up when crouching. High-density foam padding deadens the ball on contact and a new over the shoulder harness enhances a form fit. More pad breaks allow the pads to better conform to the body. Perforated mesh lining with metallic mesh cover reduces weight and creates better airflow. Anatomically inspired, double-knee design allows for a better fitting shin guard and a less restricted range-of-motion. Intermediate Sizes: Chest protector; 12\". Shin guards; 13\". Helmet; one size (fits 6 3/8 - 7).",
