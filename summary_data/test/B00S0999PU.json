It was well-received as a general-purpose gym shoe but was not recommended for heavy-duty use mainly due to lack of stability and durability issues.Although the shoe was discontinued in 2017, it helped Reebok gain experience to create a more technologically-advanced Nano trainer.",
      "pros": [
        "A good number of testers describe Sprint 2.0 as a comfortable cross-trainer",
        "Most users agree that this CrossFit shoe from Reebok delivers support for moderate weightlifting and HIIT workouts",
        "Its rubber outsole offers reliable grip on gym floors, as stated by some reviews",
        "The trainer feels light on the foot, according to several reviews"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "More than a few buyers have reported that the sole came unglued after only a few weeks of moderate use",
        "Not everyone is a fan of the plasticky material which covers the upper",

You can loosen the laces and it'll not be so tight on you, but you'll have to play around with it to keep your heel in place. The shoes seem very durable and are a great platform to preform Olympic lifts with.",

I didn't find them appealing in looks when I first received them because how thin some parts are and how plasticky they looked. Take note that they are narrow but to me it was no biggie.

This brand really grabbed my attention and gave me what I wanted. I though it was going to be too tight but the width was just wide enough, without going overboard. They slip on comfortably and don't feel awkward when working out in them. The only issue was that the soles seemed a bit thin but it's nothing a simple replacement didn't fix. I will definitely buy from Reebok again if this is how they make running shoes.",
