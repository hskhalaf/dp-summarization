Note: following the Vitamix instructions for loading items into the blender and everything blends up just fine. The unexpected bonus was the two 20 ounce to-go cups...very nice. I didn't realize I would be able to blend drinks in the cup. The blender base screws onto the cups and you put it on the base then blend. Also, the insulation on the cups are great, I put my cold drinks in with a bit of ice and it stays nice and cold. Overall, a very good purchase and worth the money.",
