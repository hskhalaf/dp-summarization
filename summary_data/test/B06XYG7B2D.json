      "text": "I always charge my new devices before use. I charged it fully (until it turned green), then played sounds on it for about 4 hours and it started to notify me that it has low battery. I had the Bang & Olufen app open to check the battery meter, and it was at 50% then it died within couple minutes more of use. I plugged in the speaker to charge it since it has zero battery, but when I plugged it in, the app said it has 50% battery? What is going on? Do I have a faulty product?",

So now I have a cable for my iPhone, one for my charging battery, and separate one for speaker. Sounds okay but less than I expected from B&O. My cheapie Bluetooth speaker has many more features and sounds almost as good. Even though I bought The P2 on Sale for only $100, its going back. Not Impressed at all.",

The volume doesn\u2019t work right and it stays at a medium low level and cannot be changed manually because there are no volume buttons on the device itself. so, it\u2019s kind of useless because I can\u2019t hear it unless it\u2019s right up on me. WAY too much money for That problem. Never use it now.",

It's small footprint and decent battery life make it an easy and obvious choice for travel. It won't fill a symphony hall with sound, but it's more than a match for a hotel room or small picnic with a friend. Well worth its price. You can find a lot of cheaper speakers but you won't find a better value if sound matters to you.",
