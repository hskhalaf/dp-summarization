Because food particles can get trapped easily between the silicone and the metal, making cleaning a chore, or worse, causing health problems. This one is strong enough not to bend or dent and is minus the silicone. I use it to quickly steam potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, green beans, etc. in my Instant Pot. After removing the veggies, I quickly rinse the steamer and there is no food buildup. Okay, once I let it sit too long, but after a go in dishwasher, it came out shiny clean.",

This is my go-to accessory for steaming - especially odd sized and over sized vegetables. And, i easily holds 1 to 18 eggs for cooking.. When it is not being used in the Instant Pot, it also is an excellent cullender. Great kitchen accessory! I chose this over a perforated insert, for its lightness, durability and ease of cleaning. Good purchase for any kitchen!",

However, it takes up quite a bit of space in the pot and one cannot put in as many vegetables or things to steam; I understand there needs to be a gap for circulation, but this is a bit extreme, whereas without the basket and just using the trivet, my vegetables steam the same and I can add much more. It really just depends on how much you want to steam at one time.",
