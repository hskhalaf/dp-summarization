I must say before using it I did a thorough job cleaning and prepping my wheels to be sprayed. The results were awesome wheels looked almost brand new it did well covering scuffs and chips. It sprays evenly without much residue. It will dry in about 10 minutes but I would recommend 30-45 minutes for a better longer lasting finish. For 4 wheels I used almost 2 cans.",
