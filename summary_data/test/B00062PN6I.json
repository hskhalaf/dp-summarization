Also, I have a pretty small head and I was really worried that these would fall off of me. They're adjustable and fit me great with plenty of room to fit a bigger head. Comfy and secure!",

Sound quality and comfort are fine for what my wife and I use them for -- watching TV. Also pretty good for music. Being realistic, they are not as good (comfort or sound) as the $50 headphones I tried at a brick-and-mortar, but then they don't cost $50. For what I paid ($13 USD) a very good value.",

      "text": "I use these for my computer only. They sound great for videos, Skype and gaming. They have not broken at all like some claim and I use them daily. Decent length cord. The plug base is a bit big because you can screw on larger plug for bigger sockets like guitar amps. They fit over my ears fully and dampen outside noise quite a bit. I can't hear people talk who are right in front of me while I wear these, but I can hear the door bell ring so they are not completely sound proof. Amazing price for the quality. I can't imagine you would need better unless you work professionally in music or something.",

The second star is because my Mom likes them, which is a good thing since I got them for her. As for me personally, I don't care for them at all. The bass is strong but not particularly clear. The mids and highs are muddy and dull. It sounds like i'm listening to the music through a wall. These don't hold a candle to my old Sennheiser 201s. Won't be buying again.",

These are used to listen to T.V. without disturbing anyone else. They are excellent for this purpose. The only minor drawback may be that the cord is approx. 7 feet long. I use a headphone extension cable to reach the T.V.. This O.K. for me but some people may need it longer. Only had them about three weeks but, so far so good.",
