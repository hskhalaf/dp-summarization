In fact vertical openings may look less suspect to some birds, provided you don't move too much. It's much smaller than the Doghouse but I can sit on a portable armchair with a mid-sized tripod, less stable, stakes are needed most of the time, it's also much easier to place in the vegetation than the Doghouse with it's smaller footprint. Very happy with it !",

He loves it. It arrived in a secure package in excellent condition. It is high quality and has held up to frequent use in all types of weather. It has enough room to sit comfortably and hunt with a gun, it is a little small inside to be able to use for bow hunting. The blind is easy to set up and take back down and pack up to treck out of the woods with ease. Would recommend this to others!",

      "text": "I love these little blinds and have taken many deer while sitting in them. I do, however, find it quite difficult to re-pack it and have been smacked by the metal rods on several occasions. So, instead of using it as a mobile blind, I have strategically placed 4 of these in permanent locations on my lease. They will last about 2 or 3 seasons staying in the woods, but it allows the deer to get used to the blinds and it saves the headache of repacking it since I hunt the spots so much. And the cost to replace these when they finally weather away is relatively low especially if you catch them on sale.",
