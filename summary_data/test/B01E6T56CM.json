After clearing my computer, the FOCUSRITE WORKS LIKE A CHAMP WITH THE NET's DOWNLOAD of AUDACITY. I'm very happy and satisfied. (NOTE: THE FOCUSRITE MUST HAVE EARPHONES for listening. It does NOT use the computer speakers.) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by someone who never even walked in to a Recording Studio.",

While the iTrack worked as a piece of hardware and required little to no installation, the Scarlett Solo required a driver to be installed.

I checked and it was the only one that matched my criteria, but even then, who cares? Why did this need a driver when the iTrack didn't? Quit these garbage improvements and make hardware that works smoothly. Anyway, I'm giving it three stars because I assume it works for other people, just not for me.",

Instead they come in has a stereo signal with the XLR connector coming in on the Left Channel and the instrument input on the right Channel. You can select a mixed mono which is a nice feature but I would have preferred two separate mono inputs. The recordings are impressively clear and the output is among the better I have heard.",
