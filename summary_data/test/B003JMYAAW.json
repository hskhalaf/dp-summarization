This masque is gentle enough to use daily, but I use it about once a week. It does an excellent job of diminishing the appearance of pores and I swear my face looks so radiant after I take it off. It even reduces the red, inflamed look of pimples if yo break down and pick them. You can even use a small dot of it on pimples to completely dry and deflate them overnight! 100X worth the price.",

The product itself has always worked great, it's a refreshing smell that's not to overpowering and afterwards my skin feels tight. I generally do this 1-2 times a week to help shrink my pores. It can make your skin feel dry if you don't apply lotion after you use it. I think it is great for oily and broke out skin.",
