The only reason for not giving 5 stars was the corners are plastic and I cracked 1 inserting the pole. Not bad enough to weaken the frame but cracked still the same. Other than that, PERFECT. Update Changed my rating to 5 stars because topoLite read my review and promptly sent me 2 new corner connectors without me asking.... awesome customer service.... Thank you",

But, if you grow autos you would be able to put about (4) 3Gallon pots in here. However, the material is perfect, it\u2019s perfect for a closet grow I currently have this in my bathroom.",

Within 2 hours I received a response with a tracking number for delivery! I call that great customer service! As far as the product goes, the quality is excellent. The cover is made of heavy material that will last forever. The support frame goes together easily and is sturdy. No issues hanging a light from the frame. There are multiple vents for fans and cabling. The vents have drawstrings to ensure a good seal. Overall I'm really impressed with thus product. I would highly recommend this product !",
