    "description": "THE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE\nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation. \n\n OUT OF OFFICE SET\nA daily dose of nourishing vitamins for your complexion. \n\n - 8 ml D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops\nFormulated with ingredients like Vitamin D, Marula Oil, and Vitamin F, to replenish and support your skin\u2019s complexion, while also delivering a bronzy finish. \n\n - 3 ml Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil\nStraight from the \u201cpip\u201d of the marula fruit, Virgin Marula Oil is untouched by chemicals or fragrances. This luxurious oil reduces fine lines, wrinkles, redness, and blotchiness, while improving your skin's elasticity. \n\n - 3.8 g Lippe Balm\nA rare combination of peptides and sea fern algae hydrates the lips and helps to restore collagen, increasing lip moisture and adding volume to give better definition to the lip-line. \n\n NO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesn\u2019t have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent. \n\n COMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skin\u2019s health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. You\u2019ll never find the \u201cSuspicious 6\u201d (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrances/Dyes and SLS) in their products.",

      "THE PERFECT TRIO. D-Bronzi Sunshine Drops provides sunshine in a bottle, mimicking the benefits of Vitamin D, while the Virgin Marula oil delivers a dosage of omegas 6 & 9 for rejuvenated skin. Top it off with the Lippe Balm for noticeably plump lips with this Vitamin C infused lip balm.",
