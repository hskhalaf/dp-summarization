Contacted JBL/ Harmon, the company that owns JBL. they informed me this item I had ordered was COUNTERFEIT. They did replace it though with a newer version called The Clip. HUGE difference between the counterfeit and this Clip. Glad I went thru Harmon for this replacement, otherwise the seller DOSHISHA DREAM would have probably sent me another fake. the Clip from JBL/Harmon is well worth the money.",

When the speaker bounces around as I'm walking, it constantly hits the volume wheel up against the side of the bag and changes the volume every few minutes and so it's very annoying to have the change back the volume all the time.",

My husband also takes it to construction sites and uses it for some music while he is out working on houses. Bluetooth reaches pretty far too!",

      "text": "Really great product with great sound and I have had no Bluetooth connectivity issue. I have given it only 4 starts for these reasons: 1. The very short built in cord to allow the speaker to be daisy chained to another speaker is VERY flimsy and IMO will not last under regular usage. And because its built in you cannot replace it. JBL should have made this an 1/8\" port and you supply your own cord. 2. Daisy chaining the speakers together does NOT give you stereo nor any appreciable gain in the sound volume. Yes, the product's description implies otherwise. Repeat - you cannot get separate right and left channel stereo sound out of these speakers.",

JBL's customer support for this item states the battery cannot be replaced, so I'm not sure what the next step is - check the warranty I guess.

I will admit one minor quibble is the charging cable is quite short but anyone with a longer usb charging cable can take care of this (hence no stars deducted). Overall the sound is a great the max volume is great and the shape/compactness is quite nice. The red color is nice. It is more of a cherry red color.",

It is solid, hefty, ergonomic, easy to use and the sound is super! I use it at work when I'm doing small jobs/service calls where client is home or bring in a large job-site radio does not make sense. They say you can link [daisy-chain] multiples for more/better sound, not really a feature for me. I like to connect to my phone and listen to music files or Pandora while I work.

So I need a speaker that is clear for the human voice, and loud enough to hear while making kitchen type noises. This one works for me. I do recommend it highly.",

I also find extremely practical to be able to charge it with the same charger for my Kindle and my Android phone Didn't give it the 5 stars because I still think it is a bit overpriced, and I didn't entirely like the colors available.",

If anyone has a solution to fix this, I will restore the star, because the only reason I bought these two speakers was for the daisy chain capabilities.",

I ordered two of them and am very happy with their performance and the sound quality. Pairing them to the smart phones was a breeze and took less than 5 minutes to pair both of them. I would buy these again and highly recommend them to anyone.",

I would still recommend this to friends.",
