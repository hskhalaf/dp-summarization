Basically all the manufacturers of light therapy lamps pull this sort of bullshit. You can find more info on the problem by googling \"you need more lumens\".",

The frequency is fast enough where the strobing is not visible to the eye, but one could still possibly feel the effects and sense the fact that it's flashing very fast. For a health light, that one must have very close to their eyes, I expect constant current where it does not flicker at all.",

      "text": "Doctor recommended using light therapy to combat seasonal depression symptoms, opted to try this product for several reasons 1. Product development by an inventor from Minnesota (same region, limited sunlight working in an office 12 to 16 hours a day) 2. Looks like your basic desk lamp and doesn't look like a giant sun tanning unit drawing attention from coworkers. 3. Simple, adjustable design. 4. Multiple light settings and sits off to the side, just needs to be in your field of vision. Also it's on the stylish side. As for if it solved my problem, it certainly helped.",

I can't say 100% that it's making things better, but I seem to be getting to bed more easily in the evening and haven't had quite as much of the winter blues. It's a small monetary investment but seems worthwhile to try.",

I put this light in my bathroom and have it on while getting ready for work in the morning. I purchased the tall slim model which sits nicely on my toilet and shines directly on me while getting ready. I would highly recommend this product to everyone who suffers from SAD.",
