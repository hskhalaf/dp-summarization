And every time you adjust the arm piece that stabilizes it the plastic gets a little more sunken in. I personally wouldn't purchase this table again. I'd rather have one that's a bit more stable and doesn't fold down.",

Now it sits open in my living room, because it is far too hard to fold it up again, and I am afraid of breaking the braces. Otherwise, a decent piece of toddler furniture.",
