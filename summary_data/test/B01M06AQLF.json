I tried to purchase these to save space in my cooler however they did not last very long, at all. The weather was very warm and the packs just did not hold up. We had three other types of cold packs in there that stayed frozen almost the entire time but these slim ones probably lost their coldness after maybe 4 hours. So food for thought, I would combo these with other bigger ice packs if you want them for the cooler otherwise stick them in the lunch box.",

They also don't take much room in your freezer. Con - they get SWEATY!! Like REALLY sweaty.
