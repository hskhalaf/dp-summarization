I also like the option to wire it to a reverse light or more constant power such as running lights, which allows you to have the camera on to see blindspot while driving. I definitely recommend things product to ANYONE!",

Camera image is very sharp and adapts to full screen when phone is in landscape position. Mobile phone app install was very easy and the camera image comes up quickly, like a factory cam with no lag time. I connected to brake light for power as the brake is always depressed when reversing. Wiring is easier if car has reverse or brake lights on the trunk lid. Otherwise run wires along trunk hinge conduit to rear light assembly which may require extending the wires. Recommend splice and solder to vehicle wiring for reliable connection.",

I chose to go with it just because I don't want to waste my time waiting for a new one to be delivered and making another appointment to get it installed.
