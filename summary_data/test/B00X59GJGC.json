      "title": "Good networking solution, but dont expect anything like 1200 Mbps",
      "text": "These provide stable, fast data connectivity by sending encoded ethernet over your domestic mains wiring. The advertised speed is however a theoretical maximum that noone will ever see in real life. First, the signal degrades over distance. Any household appliance sharing the wiring creates interference which further degrades the signal. Strong RF can also do this. Finally a portion of the remaining bandwidth is used for the carrier protocol so is not available for actual data. In practice I get about 500Mbps speed, so probably around 450Mbps of data transfer. This is still faster than my broadband, so this is not an issue.",

The new unit connected within seconds. While it's rated at 1200Mbps, I'm getting network speeds of between 500-600Mbps which is enough for my requirements. I guess network speeds are simply a reflection of the home wiring and the appliances connected to them. I have a lot of inverter appliances which would probably affect power quality with harmonics etc.. resulting in lower bitrates. Overall, I'm satisfied.",

The originals were used to connect 2 routers in the house to provide good Wi-Fi access throughout. Whilst they worked, connecting to Wi-Fi via the slave router gave significantly slower internet speeds than when connected to the master router. These new ones have given a significant increase in speed - we now get the same results with broadband speed tests from both master and slave routers - and the \"pass-through\" socket has helped tidy up the installation of the slave router. Just waht I was looking for.",
