      "text": "This potato ricer is an improvement over one I bought many moons ago. Its multiple discs are self-storing so they are less likely to get lost and it has a \"lip\" that allows the user to hang it on the edge of the bowl or pan affording greater leverage. That being said, it can be a little unwieldy and slips around the edge of the bowl at times. I paid almost twice what I had paid for my other one but it appears sturdy enough to last for a long time, so probably worth the investment. All-in-all a good product for turning out lump-free potatoes and vegetable \"purees\".",

Plus, it is overly large & bulky (even accounting for what they claim is an over-sized bin). But lastly, the unit doesn't 100% rest of the bowl into which you're ricing - so one hand is always on the handle & it makes the process cumbersome. To it's credit, it does have a fold-out lip you can use to rest the front of the unit on the bowl; but - the handle has a strongly curved shape so you always end up holding that side of the unit.",

In a single stroke, the Kuhn Rikon swiss-designed ricer gently extrudes long, light strands through either of two stainless steel disks. Use the disk with larger holes for a mashed side dish or the one with smaller holes to make a fine puree. Make blenderless sauces. Try it for berry sauces for desserts or for tomato puree. Make healthy, homemade baby food, strain blanched greens like spinach or chard. Make potato pancakes, gnocchi and spaetzel.",
