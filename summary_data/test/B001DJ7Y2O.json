I want to purchase a new one, but the price becomes 8 times more. It seems stopped providing new product. I just wander why there is no other manufactory who products similar clip-and-go mouse. Is it due to patent limit? If so, at least Logitech should reproduce it. It is a huge commercial opportunity.",

Was able to configure left and right wheel tilt to Ubuntu 8.04 with btnx. Clip feature is cool because you can conserve power when you step away and works if you need to move your laptop to another room. Range on mouse is amazing. Wheel scroll is very useful. Middle mouse button need getting used to. I don't know of any smaller receiver, so set it and forget it. Great replacement for my MX510.",

I saw my coworker use this mouse, and how useful the docking feature was when going from one meeting room to another with all the items you have to carry. I just had to buy it.. and I really love it. You simply dock it to laptop.. one less item to carry. So cool! It works great too! The scroll wheel is fantastic.. you give it a whip when you have to scroll a lot of pages.. and you're there quicker.. its so convenient.",

It is perfect for a laptop, with the adhesive \"hanger\" that makes it easier to carry around and also turns off the mouse to save batteries. The mouse also has a power on/off button and you can store the USB transmitter on a slot between the batteries for even better portability. The construction is good, the size is not too small and with batteries installed it feels pretty substantial. Overall a good portable mouse.",

I carry my computer all over the house and up several flights of stairs, so not having to carry the mouse separately is excellent. Plus the power on the mouse shuts off when you dock it on the clip, so it saves the battery life. I have nothing bad to say about this mouse. I love it!",

It rolls clicking slowly and if you press the wheel down it can be flicked to scroll fast. 5 - the scroll wheel also scrolls side to side. 6 - the mouse feels solid and slides on the mouse pads very well",

It draws very little power, so the batteries last for several months of daily use.

    "description": "Color:Silver/GrayLogitech V550 cordless laser mouse for notebooks, with a Clip-and-Go dock that lets you attach your mouse to your laptop, gives you one less thing to carry. The nano receiver is so small, it can stay in your laptop all the time, and advanced power management gives you up to 18 months of battery life.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n \n\nNow You Have One Less Thing to Carry\nWhen you need to grab your laptop and take it to another room or into a meeting, just slide your V550 Nano onto its dock and go. The Clip-and-Go dock makes it easy to attach your mouse to your laptop, and because the wireless nano-receiver is so small, you can leave it plugged into your laptop all the time. With the V550 Nano, you can keep one hand free to grab that all-important cup of coffee.  Key Features \n\n \n\nClip-and-Go Dock That Lets You Snap Your Mouse Onto Your Laptop\nNow you have one less thing to carry around your home or office. The Clip-and-Go dock attaches easily to your laptop, so when you're ready to move, just clip your mouse onto the dock and go. And the mouse turns off automatically when attached, helping save battery life.  \n\nExtra-Long Battery Life (Up to 18 Months) and Low-Battery Indicator\nAdvanced battery management technologies mean that batteries will last up to 18 months. That's a year and a half before you need to change batteries. And the convenient LED battery level indicator notifies you when batteries are low.  \n\nPlug-and-Forget Nano-Receiver That's So Small, It Stays in Your Laptop \nThe wireless nano-receiver is small enough to stay in your laptop and even when you pack your laptop away--so it's easy to just plug the receiver in and forget about it.  \n\nHyper-Fast Scrolling for Flying through Documents and Web Pages\nThe hyper-fast scroll wheel lets you fly through documents and Web pages in just seconds. One spin and you'll never go back to an ordinary scroll wheel.  \n\nAdvanced 2.4 GHz Cordless Technology for More Robust, Reliable Performance\nLogitech's new 2.4 GHz cordless wireless technology gives you more robust, more reliable performance than previous-generation technologies and with virtually no delays or drop-outs.  \n\nSuperior Laser Precision for Smoother Tracking on Virtually Any Surface\nLogitech's advanced laser technology works smoothly and effortlessly on virtually any surface, giving you a level of control many times more precise than an optical mouse.  What's in the Box \n\n Package Contents \n\n *  Logitech V550 Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks \n * 2.4 GHz Plug-and-Forget Nano-Receive \n * Two Clip-and-Go docks (silver and black) \n * Two AA alkaline batteries \n * Desktop USB extension stand \n * Clip-and-Go dock storage box \n * Two cleaning wipes \n * Clip-and-Go dock removal tool \n * Quick-Start Guide \n * Three-year limited hardware warranty \n * Full product support \n\n System Requirements\n\n\n * PC with Windows XP, Windows Vista or Macintosh computer with Mac OS X (10.3.9 or above) \n * 1 available USB port",
