If you push the material in between the poles on all 4 sides it will slide right in. I thoroughly field tested this hub on Michigan\u2019s Saginaw Bay this winter and it exceeded my expectations.

Kept me warm enough without a heater, great at blocking wind, can even darkhouse adequately for sight fishing. However, for solo fishing so just carrying without a snowmobile, it is a bit too big and too heavy to carry comfortably or set up. Will return the 3 person tent and get the 2 person instead.",

I bought the non-insulated shelter and it kept us very warm with the propane heater inside. The non insulated unit will develop frost on it, so it needs to dry out in the garage or basement prior to putting it back in the carrying case to prevent mold or odor. The ice anchors work great and are relatively easy to put into the ice. There were only two of us fishing in the unit, but it was large enough for us to keep all our gear inside the shelter as well.",
