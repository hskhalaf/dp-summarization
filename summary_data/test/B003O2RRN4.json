      "text": "My biggest concern wasn't actually the scent (which is the point of this candle), but rather how well it burns. Too often, I purchase candles that burn unevenly or lack a strong outer wall that protects the candle's longevity. However, this burns straight down the center, keeping it clean. Also, this \"Pumpkin Spice\" scent is great! Especially if you're a fan of pumpkin pie.",

Arrived quickly, in pretty good shape. Two candles were slightly dented, but usable. Possibly needs packing within box, as there is none. Thought the color was a little off, but is close enough. Over all, am pleased. I would buy again, as well as refer others.",
