These aren't fire gloves, but they do protect my hands. So far I haven't had any issues with them. The high visibility color helps my teammates see my hands if were in smoke. Something beneficial if were pulling a driver out as we need to see our partner's hands. While I don't use these for patient care, if I happen to get blood on them the color lets me see it so I can toss them. I would buy these again.",
