I bought this mostly for the rack so that I can cook multiple things at once. However the rack is not tall enough for you to really cook anything in the bottom area. Also since it\u2019s significantly smaller than the full width and length of the 5.8qt, I ended up cooking less food than if I were to lay them without the rack. I wish they would just design the right accessories for 5.8qt instead of forcing people to downgrade their 5.8qt capacity to 5.3qt.",

None of these accessories will work. They are so small, too much space in between, and the frys fall out, and the legs are too short, so can\u2019t be used as a 2nd level. Simply a failure. Please design a full size shelf, fitting the 5.8 size air fryer, then I will be happy. I do consider returning them.",

You have to figure a way to get it in there with food in the bottom, but it will work. I saw other reviews that said these accessories are too small but they are not. If they were bigger they wouldn\u2019t fit in the basket! And they can\u2019t be made to go to the edges of the basket because the air needs to flow inside the basket hence the name \u201cAir Fryer\u201d. Highly recommend!",
