      "text": "I am looking for good reference studio headphones for my music room. I have some Shure 840's that I am completely happy with, but I need a more of an open soundstage and open back headphones will be perfect for mixing and mastering. The SRH1440 has a good solid feel and design, but the highs are way to harsh. The high end hurt my ears. With proper equalization I'm sure many would be happy with these cans, but for mixing, no.",

Beyerdynamic teslas, are nice on the first listen but then there are certain frequency ranges which sound metallic and glittery and not in a god way. Audio Technica's go to model was very nice but there was limited separation and they are not comfortable.. Then, I tried the Shure SHR1440......now I am headphone happy. My choice for best headphones between 150 and 300 bucks.",
