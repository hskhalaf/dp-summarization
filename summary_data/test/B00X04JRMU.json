The wash didn't do a good job, but with very little effort, my car looked perfect. I just sprayed and wiped with one rag, then buffed with another. In 15 minutes and with very little chemical and effort my car looked excellent. It also works very well on windows, door jams, wheels, and the interior of your car! I highly recommend this product!",

But for the price it's an excellent product. To make it easier to buff clean, make sure you use a very damp microfiber to apply and dry immediately with a clean dry microfiber. I've found going over the vehicle once without buffing with a dry microfiber, then going over it again with a diluted 1:1 mixture of wax/distilled water makes it very easy to get a glossy finish.",

The WW wax was a much faster job, but the Meguiars had a more slippery feel and cost one third as much as WW Car wash Wax kit. Both gave a similar good shine. My conclusion is if you are time constrained and want a quick shine, use the WW wash/Wax. If you are interested in a more durable and slippery wax job, use a paste wax and spend more time. I will stay with the paste wax.",

I paid so much for a product called F11...I paid $79 plus taxes for F11, which included a 16 oz bottle, a 1 oz travel size bottle and two Microsoft clothes...I paid half of that for the Wet or Waterless Carwash and got so much more, for a product that is just as good... Included was one gallon, a 16 oz bottle of product and 4 high quality Microsoft clothes...I am not knocking F11, but Wet or Waterless Carwash is just as good of a product and you get so much more for your money...I highly recommend this product... Very easy to apply and take off and the results are amazing!!!",
