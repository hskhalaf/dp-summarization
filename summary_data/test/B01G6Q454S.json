Contacted the less-than-friendly and less-than-concerned customer service lady and explained the situation. About 3 weeks later a new base arrived with NO word from CS - we were totally blind-sided by the arrival of a completely new and better-designed base. We were happy! Now, after about 6 months of owning the new base, the lifting mechanism for the head (of the base) will rise and will promptly and slowly sink back down. Clearly, the lifting mechanism is defective. We are now trying to contact the company that sold the base. Stay tuned.",

I let the dogs up until I go to sleep, nice to have room for them. I do have to have a way for the one to jump down, she has arthritis. So I switched from the med height to the low height, also easier for me to get in with the height of the mattress.",
