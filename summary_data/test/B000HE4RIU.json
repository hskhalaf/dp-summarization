I do have dial up but even my friend who has high speed has experienced a lot of slow down too with this same software. Registery change popups are annoying.

It was the most slow and annoying thing I have ever encountered, filling my screen with ludicrus messages, pop-up and advertisements. It caused the broadband to act like dial up. It was so annoying that I removed the program and switched back to Norton (which isn't all that great but I'm used to it). Spyware and adware and viruses cause the computer to slow down, fill up with pop-ups and install unwanted garbage all over your computer. I can honestly say that McAfee was worse than having malware.",
