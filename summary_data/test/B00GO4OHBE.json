      "text": "I bought these along with the cast iron oyster grill pan after reading some of the answered questions. One person said that these would probably fit into the cast iron pan. They don't. I was hoping to use these instead of buying the oysters in the shells since we don't own an oyster knife and glove. I decided to keep them and use them for serving the oysters roasted in the grill pan. Even though I am somewhat disappointed that I won't be able to use these as a shell replacement, I think they will come in handy.",

If you happen to forget the shells on the grill like a friend of mind did and totally burn everything and get get them perfectly clean by normal cleaning, just simply get a small metal wire brush that fits on a drill and restore the shells to like new. Had to do it once and looked like new! Love them!",

We have eaten Oysters over the Holiday every way you can think of, but the way I like best is to just spoon a couple big ones on each shell, dress with your favorite condiments and slurp away, no shell fragments, no sand, no algae. These are a great product...",

I still think the stainless steel shells are nice and I definitely will use them when I don't need 12 matching pieces.",

    "description": "\"NEW ORLEANS CAJUN COOKWARE\" The \u201cchar-grilled oysters\u201d served in New Orleans became a national success. Serving char-grilled oysters on their natural shell was a bit of a problem. The labor of finding and opening natural oysters, sanitizing the shells, consistency of the shells and disposal of the used shells forced us to seek a better and more efficient way of grilling. As a result we began making our own stainless steel shells for use in our restaurant as well as for home use. The result is a large, flat bottom, stainless steel shell that is sanitary, deep enough for your \u201cspecial\u201d sauce, allows char-grilling of a variety of foods and is easily cleaned and reused. Now anything from pre-opened oysters, to chicken to veggies, etc. can be char-grilled or oven-cooked at home with your own \u201cspecial sauce\u201d. You are limited only by your imagination! (12 shells per pack)",
