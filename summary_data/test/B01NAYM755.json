Smart TV with wired connection makes streaming things online really easy - no lags. Bought a simple mini bluetooth keyboard and synched like a charm so I can easily type in searches. Synched well with my sound bar, setbox and blueray with easy to follow instructions.",

We saw this Samsung QLED TV on display at a Big Box store and we really like the picture quality and color richness. The Amazon Delivery contractor was very easy to work with and did a super job getting into the house and unboxing it so we could plug it in a make sure it worked OK.

Try getting a bit more volume, fat chance, you have to go to settings to even do that! The speaker control does nothing at all, nothing. Closed captioning the same, just a poorly designed tv overall, sending it back, not sure what I'll replace it with, but Anything will be better.
