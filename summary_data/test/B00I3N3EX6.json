Very happy with this detergent and will continue to purchase whenever I can. Would recommend this scent to anyone that uses Gain, or who would like to try it for the first time.",

The smaller the bulk, the cheaper the unit cost, on amazon. I noticed this a lot with paper towels, detergent/ softener & toilet paper.",
