I initially thought I have been sent the first gen headphones as there are no obvious changes in appearance, but after doing a bit of research, you get a first gen charging case with the new 2nd gen headphones.. they are the latest model as advertised. so I am happy man now.",

We took them to an Apple store and were told that the headphones are faulty but are outside the warranty period. They were only purchased mid November and in use for about 5 weeks! This means I was sold an old second hand set or otherwise can\u2019t explain why they are outside the Warranty period??? There is nowhere to contact the seller to request a replacement set because the return window has closed!!",

I did contemplate a cheaper alternative but after hearing a few reviews from friends I'm glad I went for the apple version. battery status of the case and pods show up on the screen of your phone and even give them a name, which you can change via phone settings. If you like apple don't buy a cheap alternative save up and get these.",

Apart from receiving about 30 minutes additional battery life I have yet to see further enhancing features to offset the weakness of previous versions. The Apple logo and build is still immense quality and blurtooth paying on every device is convenient. Another downside is Apple should have the Airpod application on the android store to make it accessible to all users and at this value the charging case ideally be as part of the end price.",
