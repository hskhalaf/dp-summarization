My devices don't recognize it unless I reset my router and the printer every time I want to print. The apps on the printer yield constant errors and will not work. I've tried all sorts of updates to both the printer and router, manual configuration of IP addresses, and nothing solves the problem. If you do a google search, you'll notice many people experiencing the same problems. I paid close to $200 and really I just want to throw the thing in the dumpster. It's so frustrating and inconvenient.",
