It's extremely fast and works great while I am editing photos with Lightroom and Photoshop. The screen resolution is just amazing. I even tested out a couple of games on it and they worked well (Skyrim and Sims 4). I don't think I have any complaints and it was well worth the purchase!",

      "text": "Awesome device. I needed a Windows tablet and plenty of power as I run VM's, Netbeans, Visual Studio, etc and run some additional programming softwares/IDE's and occasionally do some video editing. This SP4 w/ i7 blazes through pretty much everything. Not too worried about throttling as I didn't purchase this device for gaming, that's what my desktop rig is for. UPDATE: By doing various power setting hacks (included in links i posted), I am able to get 9+ hours battery life. No issues at all.",
