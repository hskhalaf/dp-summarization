This review is for people like me who want to use this item as an *olive* pitter. It requires a little bit of strong grip when the olive is firm, but it still works well. The picture is the outcome and you can see some pits came out with fleshes. I think it would be much easier with soft black olives. For scale, the olive pick (upper part of the picture) is similar to common toothpicks. I hope this review will be helpful to olive lovers.",

So what happens is you see the hole in the cherry you just punched, and you think you got the pit out, but you didn't. You will find yourself initially biting into a cherry feeling confident because you think it's out. Then Ouch. Dental work needed. There's got to be a better method or tool.",

Beware of this and just double check your cherries or olives.",

My wife and I pitted a large box of sour cherries last summer to make jam, pie filling, boozy cherries, and sugar pack frozen cherries. It would have been an impossible task without this. Good grips, easy to use, easy to clean. Made a tedious task much more bearable.",
