They have punchy bass that's slightly more aggressive than my DT-770 80ohms, but it's never muddy. The highs aren't as refined as most $200-300 cans, but they're at least as good as anything under $200 that I've tried. They're comfortable, I can swap the cables easily, and they're inconspicuous. I bought them as a cheap pair to throw in my bag and use in the office, and now I'm listening to them at least as much as my DT-770s.",

I originally bought a pair of Audio-Technica m40x headphones and loved the sound, but they were terribly uncomfortable. It was unfortunate, as they were great sounding headphones, though more expensive than the CB-1's. The CB-1's do the job just fine, and sound pretty good. The bass is a bit larger than with the AT m40x, but the mids/highs aren't quite as good. But overall, I'm quite pleased with the sound and build quality of a pair of headphones I paid only $55 for.

I'll keep this headphone for playing the keyboard, but when the sound quality is critical, I'll use the Neumann instead.",

The sound is crystal clear and has not been tweaked in any way-also are not too harsh in the treble (highs) range and the bass is warm and rich without being going over the top or wearing out the ears too quickly.

After using the Status headphones for a few minutes, he insisted I try them on. The comfort was really unbelievable. You do not know how uncomfortable your current headset is. You just have no idea. When you put on the Status headset it's just heaven. Super plush and quiet. And the sound is top rate, according to my son. I'm not as into that part of the equation. I would say just based on the comfort they are a giant leap ahead of literally any headset I've ever tried. Just different, just better!",

There is a very weak point of this headphone, the swivel...if one picks it up by ear muff, there is a good chance the swivel part of the ear muff will break so the ear muff just kinda hanging on. I had to tape it up to to prevent the ear muff from breaking off completely. This headphone's design somewhat lacking the quality to wear it on for more than 2 hrs...too warm. Its sound quality is pretty decent as well as the noise cancellation feature.",

The build is mostly plastic which gives them a slightly cheap feel and a fragile build for someone with a larger head. The sound leaks at high volumes and there is not much sound cancellation but I'd recommend at this price range",

These are monitors, therefore they do not 'add' artificial sound levels to what you hear. You hear the music the way the Artist intended it to sound. The pads are super soft around the ears and the clamping force is light, even with the headphones completely compacted. Recording quality varies widely, so if they seem too quiet, look for a different source for your music. At 32 ohms these can be driven loudly with a cell phone or tablet. Awesome sound, all-day comfort, all at a great price!!",

Sound signature will provide plenty of fun with modern music. I heard the shp9500 as well and that thing was so much brighter sounding that it sounded tinny. Don't get why everyone seems to like it.

      "DESIGNED FOR COMFORT: The CB-1\u2019s padded headband and overstuffed earpads were designed to be comfortable during multi-hour recording sessions. Its over-the-ear design fully encloses ear, offering passive noise cancelling without putting extra pressure on your head. The CB-1\u2019s adjustable headband ensures a snug fit on your head, and clicking ridges allow for full customizability. .",
      "TWO CABLES INCLUDED + \u00bc ADAPTOR: The CB-1 comes with two 9-foot audio cables - one coiled, one straight. Both have a custom locking mechanism that keeps them attached to the headphones, eliminating the risk of dislodging the cable. The CB-1 is compatible with any 3.5mm audio cable, but it will lack this locking feature. We also provide a \u00bc adaptor plug for use with professional audio equipment.",
      "UNDERSTATED STYLE: The CB-1\u2019s minimalist, unbranded aesthetic will never lose its luster or fall out of fashion. A slim frame doesn\u2019t awkwardly protrude sideways, and the CB-1 can be folded to become compact for travel."
