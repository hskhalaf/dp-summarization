I guess I should get rubber sheets if I expect it to be water proof. They are easy to wash, so I'm sure that they would work if your just protecting your mattress from sweat",

The material is soft to the touch and it is substantial--not flimsy at all. For the price you simply cannot do any better-in my humble estimation. Most highly recommended item--and the seller was also noteworthy and deserves special commendation.",
