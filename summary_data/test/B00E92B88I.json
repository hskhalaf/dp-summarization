But, mine came branded with AT&T logo and had AT&T apps installed. I have requested a return. Let me see what happens. I bought from company named 'MyParana'. I did not want to spend money to sign up with T-Mobile to find out this phone will work or not (None of the people I know have nano-SIM from non-AT&T carrier). So, chose the safe method to return it immediately. I do not like how they advertise as 'not-carrier associated' and send you branded stuff.",

Though carrier unlocked, this model is notoriously locked down and comes pre-loaded with AT&T bloatware. What I received instead was a 32GB XT1053, which is the \"Developer\" model with unlocked bootloader. While this won't make a difference to most people, it allowed me to easily install a much newer ROM than Android 4.4 version it arrived with. The only warning is that mine arrived with the language preset to Spanish. I run a factory reset right away to provide an easy way to switch it to English, but this could present a problem to someone who is unfamiliar with Android devices.",

The screen was surprisingly nice, and although the camera isn't the best on the market it is certainly quite good. At 4.7 inches it fits perfectly into pockets, while keeping a well-balanced feel.",

I am looking forward to the release of the Moto X+1 and will keep my 16gb X as a backup. Near vanilla version of Android Kit Kat makes this an ideal phone.

I'm not sure if the seller is reselling carrier cellphones on a legal way or this is a kind of illegal business, but I have a bad feeling about it. So be aware about that.",

      "text": "I ordered what was supposed to be the \"Factory Unlocked\" version but I got an AT&T branded phone, which had AT&T apps installed. The box was opened before and sealed again. the sim remover was missing. To my shock I found out that the mic is not working, if I called someone, I could hear them, but they could not hear me. Going to return this crap.",
