I couldn't believe it. I soaked them in warm water hoping they would regain their shape but nope, they didn't. Attached are photos comparing the two pair and also the soles showing they are the same size sandal. Just so weird.",

I bought them to not slip at the gym in the shower and on the tile floor. Loads of traction on these when the floor is wet and while showering. Non-slip. They work great! Highly recommend.

They are light, so it makes it really easy to just throw them in your gym bag without adding weight, but comfortable enough that you can wear them while you shower and then wear them home if you don't want to put your feet back into shoes. Better than flip flops as you don't have to make sure your toes are in the right place-just slide them on. Just dry them off and they are ready for your next trip to the gym.",

It's my experience with items made in China and other similar countries that they don't have a real 10.

      "text": "Perfect slide for showers at the pool or campground. Lightweight, cushioned & waterproof. I usually wear an 8.5 but based on other reviews I ordered down a half size. I have a wider foot with shorter toes, so the size 8 works well for me. They are a little snug in the toe box but they do stretch with wear. If you have longer toes, you might want to stick with your originally size.",

So I was pleased with that because I am sensitive to strong odors. I am wearing these in the shower and they work great for this purpose.",
