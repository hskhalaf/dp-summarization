I was thrilled because our regular oven doesn't heat up when it's really hot outside. Anyway, the only sort-of issue that I have with my new Emerson is that it only heats the convection oven up to 425 degrees. My Kenmores heated to 450 degrees. Oh well. Problem solved -- just leave the food in a little longer. I even bought some Emerson stock because I was so pleased. I hope my unit lasts!!!!",
