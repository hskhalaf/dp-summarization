These are not a perfect replacement. They help \"some\" but I'm getting complaints that bath towels are scratchy etc. I'm sure these are fine quality for type, but I don't find them to be nearly as effective as regular dryer sheets or liquid softener. However, I won't go back after doing the research on commercial softeners. I will do more research perhaps in the use of baking soda or vinegar or other such ideas. These balls seem right now to be only a part of my solution.",

One thing to note that isn't a big deal to use is that the balls will sometimes end up in your pant legs or sweater arm, etc.",
