Also the plastic joints that hold the two parts of the play beach house together are cheap the even after day one would not be tight enough to stay upright and would fall over. Save your money and buy something else. Purchased for a long flight but was a total bust.",

The only thing I would change is the dolls, i always feel like their feet are gonna come off. But it's not happened yet, not with any of her playsets so I can't deduct stars for it.

The problem is there is a definitive issue with the assembly. It can be played with in two pieces but clicking them together so it stays up right (like a clam shell like all Polly pockets are suppose to be played like) is impossible. It does not snap together and it is so heavy (the top) it does not stay up. So save yourself the frustration of this Polly pocket.",
