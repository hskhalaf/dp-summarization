      "text": "VERY bad for blood sugar, and therefore NOT keto. All sugar alcohols are NOT the same, and the more deceptive manufacturers will always use the cheapest one, known as maltitol. How bad is maltitol? So bad, that even artificial sweeteners like sucralose have LESS impact on blood sugar. I am outraged. NEVER buy a bar that uses ANY sugar alcohol other than erythritol. Erythritol is the ONLY sugar alcohol that has nearly ZERO effect on blood sugar, meaning it is true keto. The Atkins snack bars use erythritol. Buy Atkins, do not buy Grenade unless they switch over to erythritol. Grenade bars sent my blood sugar ratings through the roof, and I am NOT diabetic. VERY misleading product",

I kept raving about how it doesn't have that awful protein taste that lingers on the back of the side tongue, and they all agreed.. also i loved how it was not too sweet like how some protein bars try to cover the \"protein taste\" by adding so much sugar or even nasty artificial sweeteners. I cant wait to get more flavors and i will be sharing that too!! thanks #GrenadeUSALLC #GrenadeUSA",

I got the white chocolate cookie flavor and it's pretty good. I love that there are 22g of protein, one bar is perfect to replace breakfast or lunch when I don't have time for a proper meal, and I'm left feeling full with energy to make it to the next meal.",

I prefer the chocolate chip cookie dough but also loved the banana chocolate one (they do not sell the banana flavor in US). Anyways, if you are looking for something else to try and are sick and tired of the quest bars I think you will be pleasantly surprised with this brand!",
