Without spoiling the ending, it was enough to ask questions about afterwards. However, once the story mission was over, I had very little interest in completing the rest of the side missions. Gameplay control is good, some minor glitches here and there, but not unusual for an open-world game. Can recommend for a cheaper used game. Wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Farcry Blood Dragon again...",

For instance, there isn't a great introduction to the world of FarCry 4, there is barely a tutorial, and the controls are confusing in their default setting-- not to mention the inability to switch to a third person view when piloting, driving, etc. any sort of machinery, which makes it difficult to gauge exactly what you're doing.",

No faults other than forcing you to use specific weapons on some missions. That was corrected in FC5, but it was a minor irritant. One of the reasons is because there are nice weapons in this game and you don't want to switch to something else when you get into the groove with your current favorite. Excellent game!",

You level up just like in FC3 and earn skill points. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking... Best FPS I have played since its predecessor.",

At first, I enjoyed the game, but after awhile I became overwhelmed (lazy with the side missions) that side track from the main storyline. Not to take anything away from the game, its an awesome game. I know for sure if I had the time and patience like I did when I was younger, I would love this game.

As someone who wasn't a fan of first person games and preferred the 3rd person perspective, Far Cry 4 changed my mind and I'll check out more first person games in the future. Pros: Action, RPG elements and a fun experience. Cons: Some missions feel cheap/repetitive. Leveling up just to level up instead of leveling up your character with good reasons to. A very fun and addictive game. I would give it 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed it.",

The usual suspects...help the protagonists further their cause, but you have to choose to help one of two parties instead. I really enjoyed the voice acting of Troy Baker as Pagan Min. His little tirades throughout the game were exceptionally funny. The \"secret\" ending was a nice touch. The \"secret secret\" ending was worth a second play through. Lots of stuff to see and do.

The times I did play it I was literally blown away by how realistic parts of the forest are. There are even little trails you can go on that literally just take your breath away. The game allows you to swim, drive, fly, and even ride elephants (which are the ONLY animals that don't attack you or run away). The game also allows you to actually become a traitor by killing (or in my case accidentally running over) civilians. So, from the perspective of someone not really into those kinds of games, I'd say it's pretty freaking cool.",

      "text": "This game is simply the best first person shooter open-world game to ever come out. I was speechless at how realistic the environment is on the PS4, and as for the animals; well lets just say that killing enemy NPCs with an RPG while charging at them on top of a elephant is one gaming experience I'll remember for a long time. Far Cry 3 was a masterpiece, Far Cry 4 continues that legacy. 5/5",
