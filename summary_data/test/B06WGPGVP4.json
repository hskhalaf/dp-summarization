      "text": "Game changer. Along with Remo Silent Stroke heads on our kit, the L80s make it possible to jam at conversation level. They sound beautiful. If you want to play your kit at 11pm without disturbing the neighbors - heck, without them even having any remote awareness that you are doing so - do yourself a big favor that you will never regret, and buy a set of L80s, along with a set of Silent Strokes. My band rehearses without a PA now. No need to rent a rehearsal space. Utterly tolerable volume levels. I tell anyone who will listen: the greatest thing to happen in music since The Beatles. Seriously. Conversation level. This has changed everything.",

So these cymbals work really well for that, they have a nice bright sound and they're lighter weight so they're ring doesn't sound awful but rather fades out nicely. However if you like jazz, blues or something requiring more of a deep and darker tone these cymbals are not meant for that. Overall awesome cymbals at a reasonable price, and the bag work great and is durable.",
