Indeed, from its plush comfort and reliable waterproofing, to its barely-there weight and outstanding traction, this lightweight day hiking footgear leaves nothing to be desired. That said, the boot came under fire for its substandard outsole. All in all, outside its letdown of an outsole, the Berghaus Explorer Trek Plus GTX still makes for a worthy day hiking boot.",

They are lightweight and immediately comfortable for my broad size 4 feet, yes with herediatery bunions (always worn sensible shoes)! I fully expect my new pair to be as waterproof as the first pair always were. They were delivered two days ahead of expected date, only two days after placing the order, and \u00a332 cheaper than Millets on the high street. I have checked about the lifetime guarantee being void if bought through Amazon and have been assured that is not the case.",
