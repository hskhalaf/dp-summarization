Sure it cleaned it right up, but I didn't realize vinegar was a no no for the surface of granite. So I bought the Black Diamond Granite Countertop Cleaner.and it does a fantastic job. PS: I also used Black Diamond Granite Sealer b/c I hadn't sealed my granite even though it was 3 years old. It's BETTER THAN NEW. I highly recommend Black Diamond Granite products.",

The cleaner works best on soap scum, general grime and drips from cooking that might get on the surface. For thick spots, I recommend using a non-scratch scrub pad first with hot water and a little bit of soap as this product will not clean heavy-duty hardened food/liquid off of surfaces by itself. It does provide some shine after cleaning but not as much as I'd expect from this product although it is very good. I'd say this product is perfect for general granite deep cleaning. Recommended.",
