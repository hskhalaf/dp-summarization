I think the temperature changes caused it to fail. I purchased the ten lap watch to see how it would hold up under the conditions that I put my watches through.

I use these watches for running/working out and wear them 24/7 then toss them when they stop working. The price is great and they last at least a year or two.

Since the gym is quite brightly lit, the lighting function is of no used. Bottom line: good quality watch, but the contrast of the numbers to background is too low to be usable for me.

It keeps time, it fits comfortably, it looks great, the display is easy to read (for those of us over 40); and he has been wearing it everyday. That says a lot since my husband has a large collection of watches. I'm so happy I made the decision to go with Timex. Thank you",

This band is not as comfortable though. I sweat underneath it since it no longer has an open structure. I liked the previous model of this watch better even though the band broke after a year.

My gym has a serious lack of clocks (for some odd reason), and this watch is comfortable enough to wear during tough workouts. Plus, it's water resistant, so I don't worry about sweating while wearing it! It's comfortable, functional, and the Indiglo is the perfect brightness for dark conditions. Easy to set and use.",

They are just simply reliable, accurate, worry free, waterproof (we have a pool and like the ocean) so no need to fuss about removing them. Eventually they need a new battery or a band will break after years of use and abuse but they are so cost effective, I always just buy a new one instead of trying to replace a part or battery. All in all a great group of watches.",
