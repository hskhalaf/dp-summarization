Also, it would\u2019ve been helpful if the towelettes were pop up as, more often than not, more than one got pulled out at a time-especially as I got halfway into the pkg. One more thing, thought they were a bit thin-would not order again. But like other Clinique products.",

Remove gently because skin will feel irritated if rub to harshly. I like the longer length of wipes, the scent which is frresh, and the resealing feature that helps maintain moisture of wipes. My favorite thing about the wipes is they can be used for the entire face yes the EYES too!!! In the future I would purchase the liquid form in bottle amd use cotton balls to remove makeup better.",
