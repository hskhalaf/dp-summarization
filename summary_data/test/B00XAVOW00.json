If you have a behringer stereo amp and or midi keyboard then buy this. I've seen all kinds of reviews about plugging adaptors in 90% to get them to work in both channels, right doesnt work, or you get unreliable signal or whatever, but they are probably mixing mono equipment and stereo plugs. I've done it too. Look carefully, and troubleshoot before calling them defective pos. These work perfectly with my stereo stuff.",

A little over a year later all three have fallen apart. I have even put them back together and they fall back apart. I plugged/unplugged infrequently and never jerked or bumped on them. They have good reviews overall so maybe I got a bad batch. I will be searching for a different brand.",

I have to pull out the earphone connector a tad before everything clears up. But that was with only one pair and I didn't have any others to test with. Might have been just that pair.

It's a bit hard to get the plug into them because the contacts are tight, but that's a good thing. The only problem I have is with some headphone plugs the two channels are mixed, shorted between left and right so no stereo. I think it's related to slight differences in the tip and ring position on the plug. It's mostly noticeable on a headphone with a mic so there is an extra ring on the plug. I have used many of these that fall apart or have loose connections and these are much better!",

It could be some kind of short in the adaptor or a manufacturing defect that puts the conductors slightly too shallow or too deep. I am returning these adaptors.

      "text": "Since I didn't want to spend $100 on a bluetooth adapter on ebay, I got one on amazon which only had the regular headphone male end, this allowed me to pipe sound to bluetooth speakers. No more cables, no mess, no static. Works well, will update if something changes. Someday when I own a home I'll update to in the wall wiring, in the meantime, this works perfectly well for the roku/bt speaker setup. Not for audiophiles, for sure, but works well for what I need.",

And who knows how long it\u2019ll last, but I can tell you that it won\u2019t break the same day you buy like that Guitar Center trash. I\u2019m very pleased.
