This one came in outstanding packaging, with a FANTASTIC manual and appears to be better made than the other. I'm not sure exactly why my other unit (which is \"Baofeng\" only - NOT \"Pofung Baofeng\" as this unit is...) is so different - but this one is much nicer. I have *several* versions of the Baofeng HTs - this is the first one I could describe as a truly professional product. Extremely pleased!",

However, I would still recommend using an alternate antenna for even better range. The Nagoya NA-771 is very popular for use with these radios and offers a nice bump in performance while not being overly long. If you really want to maximize handheld range, the fold-able HYS 31.5\" antenna can really push your performance. Both antennas can be found here on Amazon for very reasonable prices.",

The build looks better than my older version. My only wish/desire for these radios would be that Baofeng/Pofung or perhaps CHIRP would include a software option to lock the keypad to prevent unintended changes to the settings. That explains the 4 star rating for ease of use... Still, I'd buy these again. KN4PRE",

With the high capacity battery I can easily go all day on high power. Like most, I did replace the rubber duck antenna with a Nagoya. I have found build quality to be acceptable, perhaps not on par with Japanese radios, but you don't get the impression the HT's doing to all apart in your hands.",

I've used this radio almost daily for 6 months now & I've been very pleased. It transmits not only in the Ham bands but also will cover FRS/GMRS or any MURS, MARS Freqs as well without any modifications.",

Most of the time I have it connected to a dual band mag mount antenna in my vehicle and it hears and reaches distant repeaters quite well.

Maybe you're like me and want something small, portable, and affordable enough that you can use for backup/hiking/shtf/whatever your reason. This unit is exactly that. If you're looking for serious car-mounted or base station use, extreme quality, or something you can pass down to your grandkids, go get a Kenwood or Yaesu. This is a great backup unit though.
