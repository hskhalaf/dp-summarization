      "title": "Maxtor Mini - Almost fantastic!",
      "text": "Great product. I didn't realize how SMALL it was until I opened it. The GREAT thing about it is that it's powered by the usb cable and is only twice the size of a pack of cigarettes so you can backup, unplug and bring to another computer or bring to your vehicle so you have \"offsite\" backup. The ONLY thing I'd improve is the software. It nicely syncs but isn't very configurable, and you can't leave it unattended, you have to \"yes or no\" some overwrites. BUT I just use my OLD maxtor one touch software or my \"vice versa\" and it works great. Highly recommended.",

It comes formatted as a SAT drive, which I was going to change to NTFS but decided against it because as a SAT it can be used with multiple operating systems. No separate power required, which makes this an ideal USB plugin device. The one annoying thing is a huge white eye that could be used as a flashlight. A tiny green or blue light would have done just as well, but less obtrusively.",

I have been a customer of amazon from the day they opened in 1996, but it is mostly books and cd's. I will be definately buying more electronics through them.",

I bought this hard drive 2 months ago at BestBuy and compared to others (one WD Passport, three home-made with 2.5\" internal drive and $10 enclosures), this one is EXTREMELY SLOW. Worst even, when you're using it every other program would be much slower; the CPU usage meter would not show why 'cause it's still at 2-3% usage. My computer is a reasonably fast system (Core 2 Duo E6300 with 2G memory for my desktop, T2300 with 1G memory for my laptop) but still suffers.
