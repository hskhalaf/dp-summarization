For me, the tow box was too wide and I found my feet sliding around\u2014even though the size was right. Going back to ECCO made me realize why I fell in love with them in the first place. If you walk the course, ECCO is your shoe. Tip: always use ECCO\u2019s size suggestions. I\u2019m a 9.5 and wear a 42 in ECCO. That translates to an 8 / 8.5 for their sizing. Whatever. That\u2019s the only weird thing about the brand.",
