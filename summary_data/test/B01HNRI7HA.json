This is an Exfoliating and does a good job removing dead skin (living in Vegas my skin gets very dry and exfoliating is essential). I use the bar every 2-3 days and it does a great job. It is not as grainy as the Kiehl's Exfoliating bar but the pleasant smell of citrus from the Anthony bar makes it my top choice when I need an Exfoliating bar of soap.",

Large sized bar at first may challenge some with smaller hands, but this product works well and wears well.Will buy again.",
