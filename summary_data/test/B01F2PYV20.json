Simply froth it when it's cold or room temp and not only does it fix the separation issue with this type of creamer, but it creates a wonderful cappuccino style coffee too :)",

This provides a very similar texture and creaminess as half and half, though it isn't as thick (to be expected). I appreciate that there's no added sweetness or flavors. The flavored ones are very faint, nothing overpowering or too intense. My one wish is that this came in a larger container/quantity for less. It's hard to swallow spending $14 on coffee creamer for 40 ounces...not sure it's a long term sustainable option for me at these prices. The price is the reason I took off a star.",

It is nice to have a non fat no sugar creamer that holds up to coffee as far as thick and not watery. I usually like a sugar substitute but Nutpods has flavor enough without having to add that sweetness. I will be definitely buying and using Nutpods. It is a welcomed switch in our home. Update: Because single serving size not available I have a small silicone container I put in my purse. See photo below.... used a teaspoon in comparison",

No added sugar and just enough flavor, creamy texture to lighten a pretty hefty cup of coffee; I confess, I was raised to brew coffee that's more like battery acid than regular coffee! And the price is more than reasonable for what most non-dairy plant based products cost. Definitely worth a shot if you find yourself in a similar predicament.",

I've found that 2.5 tablespoons is perfect for a large cup (~10 ounces) of coffee. All the flavors are good, but French Vanilla is my fave. The variety pack is nice just to see what you like.",

Most dairy free creamers have some sort of sugar added to them to try to make them work/taste better. You have to use much more of it than half and half. Also it is definitely not as creamy as half and half, but it does come closer to it than other dairy free creamers I've tried. Since you have to use so much in a cup to make it at all creamy, I probably won't buy this much just due to cost. It's not a bad option for every now and then though.",

How can that be with a non-dairy product. It was like bad cream. I dumped them all! They had no flavor either. When I did pour it into my coffee, along with all the lumps, I had to pour about 1/4 of a container for the coffee to get lighter. Not a product I would purchase again, it's just not for me.",

      "text": "I've tried what seems like every non-dairy creamer with clean ingredients that I can find. This one has the closest richness to dairy that I've found. It's unsweetened, which is perfect. There's basically no flavor, so like the other reviewers mentioned, they all taste the same, but that's not really a problem for me since I'm mostly wanting the creamy texture with no weird aftertaste. This fits the bill! Smooth and rich and doesn't taste like coconut or almonds. However, the price is crazy (currently 13.95). Unfortunately I think that's going to have to come way down before we'll be repurchasing. Otherwise this stuff is exactly what I've been searching for.",
