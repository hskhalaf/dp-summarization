This box solved all those issues and with it designed to fit in the corner, saves a little space in my laundry room where I have all their litter stuff set up along with the Litter Genie pail. The sides are high enough that even with their habit of scratching like there's no tomorrow, they don't fling litter over the sides. Worth the extra money of a \"normal\" cat box.",

Besides high sides for my neurotic spraying old man kitty, there\u2019s high sides for my manical litter shooting young man kitty. Fits neatly in a corner, is easy to clean with barely slanting sides, and because it's triangular the corners are wider and easier to scrape out. Love it!!",

The end result is that it functions as a collector for both her lazy peeing, and our other cat's frantic litter scratching. The high walls also contain the other cat's propensity to stand while urinating. We'd gone through five or six different boxes before we got this thing, and it's the only one that's worked for us consistently. Simply put, this is a well-designed litter box for cats who are a bit scattershot with their pee habits.",
