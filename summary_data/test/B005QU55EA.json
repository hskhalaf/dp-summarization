I didn\u2019t want to drill holes in my cabinets and the stick locks were easily pulled off by my toddler. These cords totally work and my toddler can\u2019t get the cabinets open! They may not be the prettiest but they work and that\u2019s what matters. We have two knobs on the cabinets and we are able to pull the cords tight enough that the my don\u2019t open enough for my son to get into trouble. Highly recommend!",

For some bizarre reason, the knobs are pre drilled into the door panel itself, not the edge of the doors, so they're about 6 inches apart, these fit perfectly with just a bit of room to spare. I'm being careful not to tighten them too much though because the hinges on these cabinets are SUPER cheap and I don't want them being pulled at by the tension of the ties. Luckily my daughter doesn't bother trying to get them off.",

And he's logical enough now to reason with about what's inside cabinets. Even though he can open them, though, he rarely feels the needs to do so as they still require some work for him (and he has strong hands). It's so nice to have found a solution that is easy and doesn't leave a bunch of broken, hanging pieces of plastic around. It's been awhile since I bought them, but I recall that they were designed by a parent and manufactured by handicapped adults. Win/win!!!",

When done properly it works very well with no slippage and is a great addition to our baby proofed house. Fair price. Great buy !",

Over time, the fibers stick out making it impossible for the rope to slide through the device. I can tell it is made of cheap material. After using it for the first time, we can already see the rope exterior come apart. The slide got stuck. I think overall the quality really is poor. We ended up returning it the next day.",

These don't look that great but I like not having to drill holes or worrying about damaging the surfaces. I tied two locks together on the French doors as one alone was a very tight squeeze. So far my toddler hasn't figured out how to break these so I am one happy mama!",
