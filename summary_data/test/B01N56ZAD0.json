However, it did not affect the performance of the collars - they still clip on tightly.

Looking for some barbell collars? These work and get the job done. If they break because you're slamming your weights, stop slamming your weights; different case if you're doing Olympic lifts, in that case, do it on a platform. Don't be a moron, these clamps will last.",
