This thing does the job and on the lowest setting it is not overpoweringly loud but you know it is there. It is a lightweight piece and assembles easily. It was what I wanted and the price was nice. Now I did put a speed control on it that I had laying around and that did dial it back a bit, winter fan usage is not the best thing but it does circulate the warmer air. The lowest setting is more like a medium on some other fans so take this into account.",

It blows far and is pretty quiet. I am sensitive to noise and I can tune it out pretty well. It's not heavy so I take it room to room with me on hot days. The only issue I have is tightening the stand height. Sometimes when I push the button to oscillate, the whole thing goes down because it's difficult for me to tighten the leg. That's nothing to the comfort it brings to the air in the house though. Glad we purchased it.",

The motor, the stand, and the base are all in good condition, but its useless without the protecting plastic. Little kids and pets can get caught in there without it, and that can be very dangerous. I had an old Lasko fan that had wire protection instead of plastic, so I replaced the plastic for the wire. I'm not to happy with that, though because the old fan still works..... I would return it, but last time I tried to return something during the pandemic, I didn't get a refund. I'm very displeased with Amazon at the moment. It's all very frustrating.",

The only reason it gets a 4 instead of a 4 is that the fan guard was a bit hard to snap together. Not physically, but the adjustment on where it snaps took a while. I would prefer that they just have some screws. Additionally, it has three speeds. The first setting is the highest than the second-highest then low speed. I think that's backward. I think it should be low med and then the highest speed. Minor things for the price. It works great.",

And, one side was did not even have the 'lock' design.. it is missing. The fan is plastic, which might also play a part in the fan not being able to hold itself together. The breeze it gives off is actually good, but I'm tired of having to put back on the front of the fan only for it to fall off again later. I plan on purchasing something better in the near future.",

I have since moved it to the shop and purchased a table fan for my bedroom. Five stars, because I should have checked measurements before buying. My husband loves it in the shop and it does a great job keeping him cool while working on projects in the summer.",
