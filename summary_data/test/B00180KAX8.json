I assume mine is just broken but I won't be replacing it because: The screen is ionized and so the pictures are only worth looking at from straight on. The controls are not responsive. The screen can't be re-oriented from displaying pictures horizontally, so if you have any vertically-oriented pictures (like the posters I bought it to display) you have to rotate them in a picture editor or else they'll take up only a fraction of the screen.",

Onto the product itself, the pictures taken vertically on phones dont scale on screen and are shown small, however, horizontal pictures work excellent. Picture quality is good and its easy to use (once the above mentioned issues are resolved)",

      "text": "I am beyond frustrated with this product. I ordered one and after setting it up, per the instructions, the photos would display in order. However, after the last picture on the USB flash drive displayed, the frame would freeze. The only way to get it to start the slide show over was to unplug it and plug it back in. I tried to call customer service, but was just on hold. Fortunately, I was able to return it to Amazon and order a replacement frame. I set the second frame up and had the same issue. I will be sending this one back and going with a different brand of frame.",

The pictures look perfect on the display but the sizing needs to be correct or you'll get black borders on your picture. One picture where the photographer took a vertical picture of my friends and I, it showed a 2 inch black border from left to right and vice versa! If you adjust a picture like that then say hello Jenny Craig, cause you're going to look morphed and unflattering. Anyways we just kept all horizontal pictures, adjusted the size, and abra-kadabra! We have a perfect gift for family and friends!!!!",

I think they're underrated because we all have pictures of our phones to look at, but for people who don't have smart phones or tablets, this would be a perfect gift for them.",

    "description": "Aluratek's 7 inch Digital Photo Frame is a wonderful way to bring your treasured memories to life with incredible image clarity in rich and vibrant colors on the true color LCD panel at 1024 x 600 resolution at an ideal 16 9 aspect ratio The functional and compact frame makes a great addition to any room of your house or office Aluratek digital photo frames make a great gift for grandparents moms and just about anyone who would like to share in your families most memorable moments Display photos from your most recent vacation graduations anniversaries and birthdays and relive them over and over again\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nFeaturing an easy-to-use interface and the simplicity of automatic playback. \nRecognizing a wide variety of digital photo formats automatically. \nWhat separates Aluratek digital photo frames from other brands is picture quality, ease of use, and affordability. You cannot get a better quality image or video than what Aluratek frames deliver, thanks to the best quality \"true digital\" LCD panels that are available on the market for production. Combined with an easy-to-use interface, wide format support, and the simplicity of automatic playback, Aluratek digital photo frames are the best choice for storage and playback of your important memories.\n\nView hi-resolution pictures, listen to music and watch videos easily on the TFT true color LCD panels at amazing resolutions. Most Aluratek frames come with built-in flash memory ranging from 256MB to 2GB. Transfer files quickly and easily to the on board memory with USB 2.0, or easily insert a compatible memory card directly to the memory card slot on the frame. With Aluratek's digital photo frames, you can share all your digital pictures, videos, and music files with family, friends, and coworkers.\n\nTRUE DIGITAL LCD PANELS FOR CLEARER PICTURES\nWhat does it mean to use a true digital LCD panel in an Aluratek digital frame? It means that all of your pictures or videos will be noticeably clearer and much crisper than others that have decided to use analog panels as cost-cutting measures. The advantage of utilizing digital panels over analog panels is very similar to the difference in watching HDTV (High Definition Television) instead of standard definition TV. It makes a big difference to watch in crisp clear HD as all the vibrant colors and intricate details will be noticeably better.\n\nENJOY AUTOMATIC SLIDESHOWS\nThe best choice for storage and playback of your important memories. \nAluratek frames will automatically start in slideshow once they are powered on. If you have any music files loaded onto the frame or loaded onto your SD card, they will also begin to play during your slideshow viewing.\n\nAluratek photo frames recognize a wide number of photo, audio, and video formats automatically, and you can add photos via USB, memory card, or thumb drive. Playback is as simple as turning the frame on.\n\nULTIMATE USER FRIENDLINESS\nIn addition to high build quality, Aluratek has also answered the call when it comes to affordability and ease of use.
