I though the JBL will be just as good since it has a similar silicon wing, but I was wrong! The JBL Reflect Flow is the worst earphone I have tried, despite having a similar silicon wing to the Bose counterparts! Yes the sound quality is good, but the earphone just doesn't fit my ear comfortably, unlike the Bose counterparts! I just returned it after spending only 20 minutes with it, its that bad at least to my ear! I think I will go back with Bose again..",

Now, they are starting to have problems with connecting to the case charger. I will often take them out and one will be charged and the other flat. Even if I deliberately place them in firmly. As proof I've attached a vid I started filming when I was listening to music on my phone and one of them connected and started playing music while still 'charging' in the case.",

Thought about returning them but since they *kinda* work I just keep them around as a spare set in case I need them.

There is a simple plain rubber adapter, and that one is just perfect for me.... I highly recommend buying those earbuds. You won't be disappointed with the sound or the quality.

When you put them in the case how do you know when they are charged. Is there indicator or something. 3.is there Indicator on them from which I can understand how much baterry they have left?",
