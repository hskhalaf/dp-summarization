There are some paint flaws on it, but overall it\u2019s a cute little cupcake. My biggest complaint on all the newly released Polly pockets is the clasp for opening. It\u2019s cheap and hard to open. One of them has already popped off. Really wish they would have kept the vintage concept. Those clasps are amazing and durable. The new cheap clasps will break easy...",

I love it\u2014 especially when compared to the shopkins mini sets that are a lot like these.",
