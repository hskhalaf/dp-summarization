Many boots we've had with this type of lining experience the same thing to a degree, but this was excessive. To add insult to injury, two of the buttons fell off within the first few days and the others are literally hanging by a single thread. If you buy these boots, I strongly suggest reinforcing the buttons before the boots are worn.",
