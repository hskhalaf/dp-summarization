It was one of very few convenient options for raw feeders; now it's not an option at all. I would like to find any non-HPP bags that are left, but they don't even label that they made the change. Also concerning, if they thinks it's a good thing like they are saying (it's not), why hide the ball?? I did get a bag recently and my discerning pup who used to love the stuff, won't touch it. :(",

She can eat them (slowly), but I will cut them all in half so I caneasily use them as treats. They have some soft white stuff inside that looks like bean mush (I have no idea what it is). I hope this is okay, but I am going to use this as half of my puppies food and give her half her regular food.",

      "LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO CHEW - freeze dried dog food is lightweight - no 40# bag for you or your delivery person to lug around. Since the moisture has been removed your dog will enjoy an easy, crunchy, tasty dog food vs. a hard, cooked texture of traditional kibble.",
      "DENTAL HEALTH - why do dogs have bad teeth? Starch, found in traditional dog food, causes tartar buildup, dental disease and mouth infections.

      "HOW TO TRANSITION TO VITAL ESSENTIALS: Switch to a purely raw diet slowly as some dogs may take to raw immediately, while others a bit longer because they are hooked on the added flavorings in traditional dog food. Typically, 10 days to 2 weeks is sufficient to transition your dog\u2019s food. This gives their digestive system time to adjust to the new food.",
