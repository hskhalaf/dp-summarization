Very well made and just right for what I need. The only thing that could be better, is if the strap did not start to show wear in the form of \"pilling\". It is what I believe is partly a cotton weave and maybe something else, but is durable and fashionable. I LOVE the red color and it is true to the picture. I will be looking for other colors in this same bag.",

I prefer nylon zippers to metal ones as the metal ones are rough and tend to scratch me and/or chip my nails. If this bag had a nylon zipper, I would have given it 5 starts instead of 4.",

      "text": "I have been looking around for an over the shoulder bag and found the perfect one w/The SAK Iris Cross-Body. Absolutely love it. Very room, zippered side pocket on one side and an open pocket on other side, with strong zipper for main compartment. Love the security that a zipper offers over the magnetic buttons that other bags have. Also, love just having the shoulder strap, over the combo handbag/shoulder straps varieties that other bags sport. All in all, an excellent value for the money! Highly recommend!",

I sent it back. Maybe I just got a bad one but these Sak bags are usually way more expensive so maybe these are seconds. Maybe you'll have better luck.",
