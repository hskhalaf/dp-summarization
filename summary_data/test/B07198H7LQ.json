If you are making something that you want to look nice or have a nice consistency to your raw tomatoes, this is not the knife for you. It would probably be ok if you are going to cook the tomatoes instead of leaving them raw. In the year and a half since I bought it, I dislike it even more.",

The sharpness, precision and weight is unparalleled by any other manufacturer, and the price is amazing for the high quality knives you receive. There were even a couple knives in the block set which I had not owned in the past that I never knew I needed so much - haha!! (Especially the kiritsuke) Since then I have purchased additional knives to add to the set both in the Gladiator as well as the Shogun Series. I have recommended these to many of my friends and family...thank you Dalstrong!!",
