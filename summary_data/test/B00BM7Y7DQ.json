In the old model it's not clear you would get the 1 tb for 3 years as google only gives the offer to original buyer and has to be redeeemed within 6 months of first registering machine. 3. but to really save money and get the same cpu and most of the display advantages get a \"asus chromebook 15\" with the i-5 option, acrually benchmarks faster then new pixel!!!!",
