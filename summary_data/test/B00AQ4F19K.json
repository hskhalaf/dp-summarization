I have not even had it for a year. So disappointed. I have seen these BOSU's at the gym being abused and all. I take good care of my things. I don't understand :(",

The little screw looking areas pop out and aren't flush with the bottom. If I had to do it again, I'd purchase the pro version for $15 more dollars and avoided this one.",

At first I figured that it was like a bicycle tire, and as such I would have to live with frequent re-inflations. But over time it got worse. Today I tried to return my 3 month old BOSU and learned that the return window was only one month. I called BOSU, and the rep almost immediately offered to send me a new one. He said that the leaks are normally on the edge where the sides meet the bottom; and that patches don't stick very well in that area.",

Each workout is broken down into different segments, so you can choose to complete the entire workout or limit to a segment or two. This has been great for getting back into working out. I highly recommend the BOSU!",

I hope the actual product is not as low quality as the pump and process of inflating it seems. The cheap plastic hoses pop off numerous times, very poor plug design, no valves. I give this pump, at most, two or three inflations before it fails completely. Where did they even find such a low quality pump? Must of had them special made. VERY disappointed considering high price. May even send it back. Very bad first impression.",
