      "text": "Bottom Line: This is really good scrub. I started buying it for my wife on special occassions but after I was treated to an application, by her, I realized that this is like nothing else on the market. Now we keep it in the shower as often as we can afford it. Beware the Merlot version is NOT similar -- a much different product aromatically and sensually. Cabernet can be hard to find and hard to afford but you will not be dissappointed if you or your loved one enjoy a true spa-scrub-experience. Not oily, no residue, intoxicating fragrance.",

It's subtle and not at all strong and the smell holds strong for several hours but I like something a little fruitier. I bought it because I was trying several different exfoliating scrubs to help with skin drying and this one does do that very well. Would I buy it again...yes but frequently like others...no.",
