If you tend to use for heavy load or surf on browser with lots of tabs, of course you should switch to your laptop or PC.

What a treat to customers!!! So I guess the message Amazon's sent to me is that \"do not buy our new products when they're just appeared. Wait for a week or two, the price will drop!\"",

It is BLOATED with amazon stuff and it is just too dang slow. The screen resolution is ok but the brightness is lacking. The speakers are extremely bad and you definitely need to have it connected to an external bluetooth to watch anything with decent sound. I only recommend this for the use of kids, and not even young teens, but literally <8, because from what I've heard the ability to restrict kids to a certain time limit on these things is possible.",
