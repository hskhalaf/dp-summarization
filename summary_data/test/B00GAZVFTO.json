They fit just right, and no more cold hands. Ladies, if you are debating about getting these gloves, my reply to that.....spend the money, you'll be glad you did! Well worth every single penny!!!!!",

I returned the gloves and purchased these mittens, which I use with liners and hand warmers, and though temps haven\u2019t been as low since I\u2019ve gotten the mittens, they feel a whole lot warmer.

Second, when you drying them it helps dry faster to remove that layer. i believe they are water proof but you collect moisture on the inside from your hand sweat.",

I ordered a Sedona colored Burton Gortex gloves and what I got (see photos) where a random black pair of gloves with no labeling and NOT Burton. Looked as if someone took the tags off another pair of Burton gloves and put them on this random pair. I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend's birthday so she could use them this weekend skiing, guess I will have to find something else!",

The lighter/fleece gloves give you great mobility when putting your snowboard on which is nice. I do like that there is a little zip pocket on the outside of the glove to fit cash or a hand warmer in them. These gloves are worth the money.",

DRYRIDE 2L fabric, and a GUARANTEED TO KEEP YOU DRY GORE-TEX membrane protect this Thermacore insulated glove from the worst weather conditions.
