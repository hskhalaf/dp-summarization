I have more \"complicated\" products on hand for specific skin concerns, but sometimes I just want a simple face wash that gets my face clean without overdrying: this bar is perfect for that. I tried the liquid version of this Neutrogena soap, but I prefer the way the bar foams and feels. NOTE: like most bar soap, this will get gross if it doesn't dry properly between uses. Make sure you keep it in the type of soap dish that completely raises it up so air can circulate underneath.",
