      "title": "A bomber wire binder",
      "text": "There are lots of cheap options out there, but this is worth the money if you bind often or in a hurry. The handles are long so there's lots of leverage. The punching is clean and easy for lots of sheets. The only improvement would be using a toothed binding holder for sliding the sheets onto the wire. The spring clamp down doesn't hold the binding in precision so you need to carefully get the first sheets started. Other high end binders by Akiles have a toothed binder holder that keeps them in perfect alignment.",
