I had purchased their Ultra Dura+ table top 1.25L wet grinder and around 6 months it stopped working. I tried contacting them many number of times. They responded only once that too asking for more details. Very disappointed on post purchase experience. At the lease they should be decent to let me know that they cannot service my request...but absolute silence from their part. After spending $200+ it sucks to see it all go the drain. If you still decide to buy, please purchase additional warranty provided by Amazon for some extra bucks.",

Didn't expect the belt to wear out in 4months when my colleagues have been using ultra bought from India for ages now. It's basically I wasted $217 for the faulty product and warranty doesn't support all items of the product.",
