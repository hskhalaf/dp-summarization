I have my drill and charger, bits, hammer, screw driver, pliers, and a few other miscellaneous things thrown in there. There is still plenty of room to spare for more stuff. My utility knife fit well in one of the outside pockets-not so far in there that I would struggle to get it out but not hanging out to the point that I think it would fall out. I don't have that many tools-just enough for things I can handle around the house myself so this is great.",

Part of the zipper handle broke, but it's no biggie, the bag itself is what matters. I recommend this to anybody, man or woman....either keep it in your car/truck/suv, or use it for taking tools to wherever you're working on whatever project....the marina, or the garage.

Even though they are less desirable to me, they do require more material and labor to construct. That's the only thing keeping it from being a 5 star item. They are constructed very well with huge strong zippers, etc. Will last a very long time.",
