I did end up giving them to my teenage son, though, since he liked them and wanted them. They fit him perfectly. I'd recommend them.",

It's a big relief, it's not hot to wear and it's especially not hot around my neck --surprisingly--. The bandana is soft and silky. I am very HAPPY. Thanks!",

They are a little snug, but that alone would be OK except that the elastic in the bands on both ends, while new, is not strong, so the masks keep sliding down CONSTANTLY. Just on my way to work (I ride the bus), this mask slid down SIX times. These might be OK for a walk around the neighborhood or a quick trip to the corner store but not for anything else.",

My only complaints are they are a little tight around the neck if you have a large neck. I was able to stretch mine out enough to feel like it wasn\u2019t choking me. They are easy to breath through and hold up after washing. It is nice to be able to pull it down when needed instead of unhooking a mask from your ears. I will be purchasing more for my son to wear to school next month.",
