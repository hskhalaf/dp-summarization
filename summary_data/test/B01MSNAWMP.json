Well, I got new shoes but in sickness forgot to have them stretched and kept them in my closet for a year. My daughter suggested I try to stretch them on my own. So, upon searching I bought this product, and followed it's directions. It was so easy to use! Keep in mind I am disabled, and I still found it easy to use. I did everything it said, and it worked perfectly to stretch out my shoes! So now I get to wear my new shoes comfortably. I'm so happy with this product.",

      "text": "The price on these are great, but you really do sacrifice quality. These don\u2019t expand all the way open, instead, when they\u2019re put under pressure, they start to make concerning noises and begin to reverse. This, obviously, defeats the purpose, as you\u2019re using them to stretch a shoe, which means they should be able to endure the weight and pressure of stretching leather. Nevertheless, they did work to a degree, specifically on the toe portion. The inserts for the toes are super effective for isolated stretching, which was really what we needed. Overall, we were pretty satisfied with the end result, it just took more attempts than it would have with a higher quality stretcher.",

I think the shoes are now a half size bigger. I contacted the seller bc my package did not contain the 4 bunion/corn plugs, and they were very quick to respond. I would buy products through this seller again.",
