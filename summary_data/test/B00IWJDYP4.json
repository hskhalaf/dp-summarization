It was so easy to stick with everyday because the grooves in this tool fit perfectly into the contours of your face and it makes the process feel like Heaven. I really love it. However, I had to give it 3 stars because it broke a few months in. I went to contour my jaw and one of the edges broke in half. Not sure what that means about it's quality :(",
