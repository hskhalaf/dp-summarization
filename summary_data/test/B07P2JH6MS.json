I also own the model before this as well - m15 with the 1070gtx and this one with the 2070 is a lot lighter (and longer obviously) Alienware is a great brand. If the graphics cards get outdated then you can buy the graphics amplifier and plug it into the back of these and it will run whatever new card you put into it using your laptops cpu/etc. I got this on sale around new years so I had to get it.",

Most of my games do not take a lot of processing power and this laptop is likely much more than I'll ever need, I wanted excess power in reserve and this appears to be a strong resource. The video card is the same one that my grandson has in his high priced VR set up that he custom built so I feel good about that.",
