It is difficult to see what's happening inside while it is working. I am used to being able to watch for my oatmeal to boil over but it is nearly dark inside my Danby. This won't change my 5-star rating though because it is about the favorite microwave of any I've ever had.",

      "text": "The appearance to me doesnt scream fancy or high end.. but its very straight up and to the point.. Its a microwave, so it has all the standard features. Altho for me I dont think the defroster works nearly as well as the Panasonic micros I have had! It just doesnt seem to be nearly as efficient.. I do agree its much much quieter than other micros and especially my Panasonic unit i had. The inside is super large, so I also agree with others. Theres some weird self clean internal thing but i have no idea why it is.. Danby doesnt explain it! Ive never heard of the brand before, at all... but i would buy em again.",

      "text": "At first we hesitated with this microwave as we had never heard of \"Danby\" before and usually go with brand names we know and have experience with when getting appliances. I was more eager to try it than my husband was but I can say now that we both are very pleased with this microwave. The inside is SO easy to clean and that's a huge factor for me. He loves the shape and design. I love that the bell is loud enough to hear but doesn't wake the dead at 2:00 in the morning! It has enough power to heat quickly and it doesn't get any better than that. Don't hesitate with this one. It's just awesome!",

I love the dials and the clock. I love the sleek look and that it does not collect finger prints. I love the 24 hour clock too. UPDATE:. Still going strong after this many months... Still looks sleek even when filthy.. easy to clean.. it is a keeper...",

When we make popcoren almost every kernal pops and none have burned. Things are nice and hot after only a minute or so. When we make frozen meals they are heated all the way through and you don't need to put them back in. The microwave is easy to use. Very straight forward and no guessing.",
