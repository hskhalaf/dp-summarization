Great for the visiting young grandchildren. The cotton terry top, on this Made in USA product, along with a fully all cotton batting mattress pad gives a cool night sleep for adults, as well as a great liquid and stain proof protection for today's expensive mattresses. I am purchasing this one for my daughter and son in law with a newborn baby and all the spills that can occur on a bed with a nursing newborn.",

I had to go around the whole bed to \"tuck\" it down. I am hoping that it is not so lose that it pulls up and makes the sheets slip. I will update if that happens, it willhave to go back if it does because I am disabled and the specific bed I have is very hard for me to make. So hopfully it stays put lol. Stay tuned......",

The soft terrycloth top helps keep it from being hot (waterproof things usually create heat on top of them due to the waterproof barrier). It washes well and comes out ready to put back on the mattress. If I could change one thing, it would be this: Due to the large corner capacity (20\"), use sheet straps to anchor it, especially if your top sheet has a smaller corner capacity (such as 14\" or 16\"). I recommend this to anyone who wants to protect their mattress from unexpected wetness.",

I got the matching pillow protectors and am very satisfied with those as well! Hopefully this waterproof protector will keep my husband's sweat from staining the mattress!

We just upgraded to a new, natural organic euro king mattress which needs breathable protection and so I just bought another Luna mattress protector in the euro king size. All of their mattress covers have really deep pockets, and I realized I can still fit the cal king size on the new mattress as well, so that's nice to be able to keep the old one as a backup.

This makes our protectors especially helpful for anyone looking to protect their mattress while also offering real health benefits. While we sleep, we shed thousands of dead skin cells, which can quickly accumulate providing an ideal environment for dust mites. Luna mattress protectors trap dust mites, allergens and skin cells on the surface of the protector where they can be easily washed away during suggested quarterly launderings. This helps keep your mattress clean while improving air quality where you sleep.\n\nNatural Soft Cotton Terry Surface - Breathable, Cool and Noiseless\nTo keep our protectors cool and noiseless, the surface material is made with soft cotton terry back coated with a breathable, hypoallergenic and 100% waterproof membrane layer. Cotton terry naturally absorbs moisture and is completely noiseless.\n\nFitted Sheet Style\nTo ensure a great fit, an elastic band is used on the side skirt to automatically pull excess material under the mattress.\n\n\n\nCan be Machine Laundered\nSimply machine-wash with your sheets using normal household detergents that do not contain bleach. Tumble dry on low heat. Do not iron.\n\nUndetectable\nLuna mattress protectors won't change the feel of your mattress once applied. This is great for those with any type of mattress including innerspring, memory foam or latex.\n\nAll Luna premium protectors are backed by a full replacement 15-year product warranty, contain no phthalates, vinyl or PVCs and are Made in the USA.
