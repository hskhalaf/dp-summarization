The chain is super long and we ended up not needing any of the length due to the ceiling heigh of our room, but there is definitely a lot of length if you need it! I think the brightness is prefect and we are going to put it on a dimmer.",

That being said it looks cute and I managed to install with no experience. I definitely think the medallion suggestion is one to take, it makes it much grander.",

We have the chandelier on a dimmer switch, which I wish I had dimmed for the photo. Plenty of light for this guest room but we will put a bedside lamp for guests to use, but it's not needed for additional light. Very happy with this purchase!",

Only issue -- fishing the power wire through the center tube to get up into the box, what a pain. You have to hold up the whole assembly while fishing it in since you should have cut the wire short enough that you're not going to shove feet worth of wire into the electric box. Even with that part of the install being tough, still the overall product earns five stars for looking good and working as designed. My kiddo loves it (yes it's in a bedroom, LOL)",
