      "verdict": "Adventurers generally liked the MQM Ace for its lightness, comfiness and excellent arch support. Its breathable mesh upper and surface traction were also appreciated by buyers. On the other hand, there were those who found the fit too narrow. All in all, the Merrell MQM Ace is a superb low-top hiker that offers a set of trail-centric features specific for summer excursions.",
