Now it seems the AirPods will be the extra set. These sound much much bette! Deeper punchy bass, very vivid vocals, and a surround sound stage. Very nicely balanced. I would say these are the best sounding earbuds I\u2019ve tried. They stay inside your ear no matter what as they come with anti drop accessories that work very well and it\u2019s not possible to shake them off. Battery is outstanding as well. Do yourself a favor and buy these instead of spending 200$ for Apple.",

As have many, I have struggled through a myriad of truly wireless ear buds and have always been disappointed - mostly for the common reason of not staying in place. Many would sound OK, but would required constant readjustment to sound reasonable. These TREBLAB X2 are in a completely different class and are absolutely AMAZING...so far. They are bit more expensive than many of the other models, but well worth it. They stay perfectly put in your ears and sound fabulous - even during a hard gym workout! You will not regret buying.",

      "text": "I really like the sturdiness of the earbuds. I think the different size silicone buds are great and they allow for the best fit of any earphones, buds, etc., I've ever tried. The battery life is good and I'm hoping as I use the product more battery life will remain consistent. I'm trying to follow the instructions, which were also very good, to be consistent in the way I use the charger. Not used on any incoming calls, so I cannot comment, but expect no problems.",
