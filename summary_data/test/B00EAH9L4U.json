I'd say we only used it for a maximum of 5 times which includes doctor appointments and quick errands. It's pretty much from the house, to the car, to the stroller. Material must be of poor quality for the handle to break off within the timeframe we used it. It's the price you pay for trying to save money. Better to spend more for better quality carseat. Will try to contact the company and see if I can get a replacement.",
