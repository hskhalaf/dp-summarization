We only use it around the apartment for getting cat toys out from behind furniture (for the most part). If you want to use a grabber for something more robust like picking up loads of trash outside (highway cleanup etc.), I might advise you to look for something sturdier than this.",

The rubber cups have tiny air holes that prevent the cups from locking shut, and the stick is designed to give much better grasping power than sticks with \"claws.\" I've been able to pick up pencils, single sheets of paper, heavy plates in the bottom rack of a dishwasher, jars and cans on upper shelves, computer recharging cords, small pieces of cooking debris, and more. I haven't tried to pick up a dime from a wooden floor, but I wouldn't bet against this stick.",

I have several throughout the house and use every one. Great for organizing shoes in the closet. You can up up slightly larger items too. I think 4 lbs would be the limit.",

They will assist to remove a light bulb but do not rely on them to pick up anything too heavy. use the main grabbing area to grab heavier items. It is safer that way.",
