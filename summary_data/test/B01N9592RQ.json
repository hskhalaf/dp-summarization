I couldn't afford a GPS unit & the units that work on cell signals weren't an option as cell service is very poor where we live, so this was a great option for me. The transmitter is not heavy for the dog to wear & it attaches around the dog's existing collar with velcro. I did end up ordering an extra transmitter holder from the company, because our dog got into a skunk & I decided it would be smart to have an extra on hand.",

      "text": "We purchased this for a cat who tends to roam the area. The tracker was a bit large for the collar, so for a smaller cat it is annoying her. Tracking her in a suburban area was possible but not great. We could find her general position but it was not accurate enough to actually recover her. She finally lost her collar with the tracker on, and we were not able to get hold of it as it is somewhere in a bunch of brushes and the tracker is not accurate enough to find it.",

    "title": "Eureka Technology MARCOPOLO Advanced Pet Monitoring, Tracking and Locating System (for Dogs and Cats 5 lb and Larger)",
    "description": "The Marco Polo Advanced Pet Tracking system Waterproof and Extremely Rugged is the ideal solution to keep your pets safe while they enjoy all the activities they love. Suitable for pets ranging from the largest dogs down to the smallest dogs and cats having a collar length of 7 inches or more. No internet or cellular access is needed so you can take your pets with you to the most remote locations, knowing that you will be alerted quickly if they wander and easily track them if they become lost. Marco Polo is the perfect solution for protecting your pets while traveling or at home. Extremely rugged, the Advanced Tracking Tag is made to withstand rough terrain and prolonged swimming. The streamlined design keeps the tag out of harm\u2019s way so it is not caught on branches or damaged while playing. Up to two additional tracking tags (sold separately) can be added to the system at any time to allow monitoring and tracking of up to three pets. The tracking tag has an internal, rechargeable battery that lasts up to 6 weeks on a single charge. Since Marco Polo requires no monthly fees it will save you hundreds of dollars over the life of the system when compared to subscription-based systems. When searching for your pet, Marco Polo acts like a personal radar system, scanning every inch of the surrounding area, including the interiors of homes and backyards. The system range is up to 2 miles in open conditions but, as with any 2-way radio system, varies with terrain and obstructions. If your pet is outside the system\u2019s range you can continuously scan hundreds of acres of surrounding area as you drive or walk around. Once within range of your pet the Marco Polo locator will guide you directly to their exact location, within inches if necessary, even if they are injured or hiding \u2013 a perfect solution for finding cats that are reluctant to come in at night. Select one of four safety zone ranges for your pet and receive warnings in less than 80 seconds when your pet wanders.",
