Still tweaking how we would hang them, place them, but after reading the reviews and choosing these lanterns we were not disappointed.",

There are 4 brightness settings, and using the 3rd highest setting, \"Medium\", did give a lot longer life, well over 8 hours before becoming noticeably dimmer. This does not seem to be a lantern that will take a beating or too much rough use, but with prudent handling should last a long time.
