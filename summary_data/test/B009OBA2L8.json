It takes about two minutes and the table is large, roomy and very sturdy.",

The TV console I ordered was stolen by neighbors immediately [because an inept mail carrier thought it was a good idea to leave it unattended UNDER the the mailbox in a building with no cameras or monitoring staff] and I had to place my 32\" TV on this. No sweat. It took it with style. I'll be ordering 2 more of these soon. I need to complete my living room and this will be a necessary part of that. It's beautifully modern. Just my style.",
