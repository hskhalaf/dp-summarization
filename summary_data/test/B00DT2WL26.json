It measures 10\" diameter at the bottom (same as inside cardboard scratcher circle of turbo scratcher) and 5-1/4\" tall. It is lightweight but has 4 small rubber feet to keep it from sliding. It didn't tip or move with 4 adult cats playing with it. Not much more for me to say but I'll let the kitties show you themselves.",

My granddaughter managed to pry the upper solid yellow ball off and lose it, but the cat still plays with the other ball. I even hear him in the middle of the night, batting the thing around. We have it on the living room carpet, and it travels about a foot every time he plays with it. Not a big deal for us.",

However, the most impressive thing is that my cat, Severus, starting playing with it almost the moment I pulled it from the box. I've been working from home and being meowed at to play with him for hours, while trying to get work done. He won't play with his toy mice, except one that dangles and I have to hold the rod and move it for him. He likes the laser pointer, but the one that I have hold and aim. It was wonderful to have him contentedly playing on his own while I got work done.",

I swear they played with it for 3 hours straight when we first got it. I honestly thought they'd get bored of it pretty quick, but they've been playing with it every day since. It doesn't make a lot of noise or take up much space either and the best part is, they can both play together, which makes them play longer. It's nice to see how something so simple makes them so happy. ^_^",

Other mfgrs have not addressed this issue, so be mindful. Kudos Petstages. Prices vary widely from day to day ($9-$20) but if you can grab it when they are cheap, go for it. I also have found that you can pop out the balls and replace them with either a Bergen Twinkle Ball or a Catit Fire Ball (has replaceable batteries). Cat LOVES the lighted balls (did top and bottom row only-all 3 was too much). Lighted balls also help add weigh to it.",

Something needs to hold this down to the floor. Even if it's pieces of velcro which I will have to add to ours. It's a fun toy for the cats (we have 7 cats) but it's worthless if it turns over.",

      "text": "The kids love it, however they managed to lose the ball in 3 days. There are no replacement balls sold without a large price tag. I used the size if the ball to search for a new one and discovered that ping pong balls are very close. I'm awaiting their arrival to test it out. The rubber feet probably work well on a smooth floor, but on carpet they pushed that thing all over the place. Also if note is the odd star questions, thickness and suction power?",

The rest of the two hours were spent playing. I understand that he spent most of the night playing with the toy as well. This was a great purchase.",

We even pop in a few at a time so they can knock them together and change the path the ball takes. We had a heavy ball that came out of an old computer tracker (mouse) and that rolls great inside of the track. We popped in a ball that opens to hold catnip and while it makes a mess, they love it (we just clean it up later) we bought a ball that lights up and they play in the dark with it too soooo what I'm saying is that it's versatile and entertaining and you can't beat the price!",
