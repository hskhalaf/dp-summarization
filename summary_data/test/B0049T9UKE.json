      "text": "I enjoy fishing and this is my first float tube. It worked very well and was sturdy for a recent lake fishing event. It lacks a few bells and whistles but is entirely adequate. I enjoyed the multiple pockets and it was comfortable and light weight enough to carry from my truck to the shoreline. It has a flag holding pocket which was required where I was fishing. I was with my friend who has a more expensive model with backpack straps on his and sits a little higher out of the water, but we both caught the same number of fish. The D rings are great where I attached a retractable net and a stringer. Overall great purchase.",

      "text": "The fish ruler/bar at the front of the tube is not durable, it came apart and I lost it in the river only after about 20 minutes, leaving me on a 6 hour float with no support in the front. It may work for still, deep water floating or fishing, but not for rivers with varying levels of water (only place to put your feet in shallow water is on the front bar - which is not meant for support). In rivers with debris, it is not safe to have your feet dangling below. I was excited for this to arrive and to use, and very disappointed in the results.",

      "text": "This was a pretty good tube for the price. It was very good starter tube because it had a lot of pocket space and was easy to inflate. I used this tube in mission bay while spotted bay bass fishing and it worked fine. i would have liked the tube to move a little faster through the water and instead of cheap velcro to hold up the apren they should have used a bunji strap like most float tubes. Overall I got a float tube that was like the price paid.",
