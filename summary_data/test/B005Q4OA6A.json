You have to take that on faith as there is no indicator that shows trickle charge mode. There are two settings 2amp and 8 Amp for rapid charge. Presumably the unit switches to trickle charge once fully charge on either setting, but the lamp still stays lit on 8 Amp or 2 Amp. Also there is no indicator to tell you the state of your battery (i.e. its 25% charged, 50% charge etc.) as some other units do.",
