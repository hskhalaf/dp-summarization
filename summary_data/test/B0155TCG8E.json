I've owned other carbon fiber paddles, aluminum ones, etc. The 3 segments makes it easier to transport and store and the paddles are extremely light, more so than other carbon fiber paddles that I had owned in the past. I liked this paddle so much that I bought two of them, in case my friends want to go paddling with me. Highly recommend. One caveat is that the middle button does corrode with extended use in salt water, so be sure to wash it out really well or buy them separately from a hardware vendor if it does end up breaking.",

Do carry a phillips head screw driver or a multi-tool in your kit, in case the screws that hold the clamp on the top eventually loosen. There is blue threadlock visibly applied to those bolts by the manufacturer to prevent loosening, but I can see how that may eventually become an issue, as some reviewers pointed out. If that happens, it will be an easy fix (just don't over-tighten any carbon fiber tubes so they don't crack).",

The paddle is super light, easy to put together, easy to transport in its perfectly sized case. You know how when you have a really nice piece of equipment it somehow makes you perform better even if it does the same thing? This paddle definitely has that. I'm not sure if I'm padding any better but damn does it feel nice to use it in the water. The only gotcha I would say is the angle is very aggressive. Definitely go on YouTube and look at proper paddleboarding technique so that you can use this effectively",

At this price point i expect a keyed section to fit tighter. The lower section has enough slop to bend back and forth slightly with each stroke. Again, at his price point and with a description of Elite i expect zero slop and movement. I fixed this lower movement with a small amount of thin tape under the middle section.",

I am ok with this as I feel it is a sign of precision manufacturing and very little play between the two pieces when they are connected. When the paddle drys fully, they easily come apart.",

The nylon blade does feel a bit heavy making the paddle feel a little disproportionate weight wise but otherwise seems like a good overall paddle especially for the price.",

I figured I'd get this one based on the reputation and I have to say this paddle definitely lives up to the 5 star ratings. I tried it out for the first time yesterday and it performs just as well as some of the 250.00 paddles at a fraction of the cost. Very happy with this product.",

The top hand grip is very comfortable and the adjustable size marking on the pole are very convenient so you can quickly adjust the paddle to your favorite length. While I wish this paddle was as light as the more expensive carbon fiber paddles, this is an excellent paddle for the money. Overall, I highly recommend this paddle.",
