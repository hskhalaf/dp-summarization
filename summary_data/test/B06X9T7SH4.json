I would not recommend this to anyone as it pretty much stopped working at about 6 months Even basic tasks such as navigating file explorer are agonizingly slow. Do not buy",

This morning on trying to switch it on the laptop is dead and nothing comes on. Feedback from supplier, is only 30 days warranty and they just dont care. So my recommendations is do not buy. Took it in to service centre and the motherboard has packed up. So ive had it on for 3 days. So I definately received a faulty laptop and supplier not willing to do anything about. Also not original DELL power supply",
