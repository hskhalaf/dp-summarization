But on really stubborn, thick, hard, cracked, calloused heels like mine, it has worked wonders. Start slow and see how it goes before you get too aggressive with it. If it doesn't work for you, you can always give it to your wife to use in the kitchen.",

Think of it as a handy little kitchen tool with one whole side covered in tiny razor blades. Store appropriately. Oh, and cleans up easily under hot running water, or in the dishwasher. Probably should not be recommended for use by children or novices in the kitchen.",
