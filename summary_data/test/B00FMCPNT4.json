The construction is excellent and should last forever - AND you could probably park a truck on it. I wanted a \"Portable\" table not this monster. If I wanted a bulky solid piece of furniture I would have purchased a regular table. It's labeled \"Granite White\" but what they really mean is, \"it weighs more than a slab of solid Granite\".",

We actually bought this for the grandchildren to play board games and use with their computers for Minecraft. No complaints from them. Prime free delivery to my front door was an added bonus.

Even though it folds in half which does help, it is still so heavy with the metal frame. If the frame had been made of aluminum I think this table would be excellent! I\u2019m sure the price would not have been as reasonable. It\u2019s a big table and I love it!",

When ready for storage the legs click into receiver clips. The bracing bar also clicks into the underside of the table. The table top folds in half forming a crescent for storage. It has a tuck away fabric/plastic grip for easy luggage-like transport. This is a quality product. Well worth the price!",

The only downside is that it does not close easily. It does not open/close like the older style...one leg at a time. This opens/closes 2 legs at a time. She uses a rubber mallet to hit the locking mechanisms to fold the legs up again. It's not that she's 94....I had trouble getting them to close.",

Just right - easy to unfold/fold, not too heavy, solid surface and just right height. There was a problem with shipping - slight damage from shipping - box did not do the job. Short story: we order two. One was damaged. With Amazon, you cannot return one when two ordered (have to return entire order). Anyway, got two replacements - again one damaged. Returned two. Worked perfectly.",

      "text": "I needed a table for extra guest. This table would be great for kids or adults. It is very sturdy. When unfolding the legs I have to lightly stand on the edge of the other legs and push since they are so tight. When closing I need to tap the underlying arm brace mechanism with a rubber mallet to get it move back into place. The tightness of folding and unfolding the legs keep it sturdy. There are 2 holes that should line up on the leg arm mechanism. I guess this is in case you want to place permanent screws in the brace. A plus is this table fits nicely under a twin bed in my guest room.",
