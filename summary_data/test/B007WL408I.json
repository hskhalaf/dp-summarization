However things have taken a turn for the worse recently. At some point the printer stopped waking up from standby. So now to print we have to unplug and replug the usb cable to wake the printer up. Very nasty, and Dell doesn't seem to be responsive to customer feedback on their forums. EDIT: bumping up to 4 stars, Dell finally posted a firmware update that addresses the sleep issue. So if you get one of these make sure to install that update.",

I have not tried to deal with Dell on the problems. Even if the fixable problems got fixed I still would not like the printer and am not going to spend any more time and money on it. Am just going to junk it and get a better printer (not a Dell).",

The printer seems to switch off the USB port, so it wont wake up when it see's data. You have to switch it off and on, and in my case I then have to switch the print server off and on as well. It's a pretty major flaw. I tried the latest bios but no luck yet. Come on Dell fix this bug in your printer.",
