I think she's a little young for it yet, although her 63 year old grandmother was not impressed either :) Many of the shape molds are just too small and placed too close together to make good creations out of it. It's a cute concept but the actual placement seems better for older kids who wants to build real looking food creations. Even though my toddler has a very long attention span it was just too complicated.",

Pull the lever and the inside of the oven will start to turn red as if it\u2019s heating up and then makes a DING sound when it\u2019s done. Very cute and our sons just love it. It also comes with a variety of molds and different color play-doh, as well as a fork, knife, rolling pin, and a plate. If your kids love play-doh, they\u2019ll love this set.",

Also my other complaint is I though they made press pies so you could take the play doh back out and it look like a cake or pie but no it pushes the playdoh into the mold and just comes out the sides of the mold you don\u2019t make a pie itself it\u2019s just imprints.
