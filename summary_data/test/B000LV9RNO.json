I had bought some cheapies at Costco when it came time to replace them and they left instant streaks in the rain so I decided to bite the bullet and pay the $20 a piece for a set and I couldn't be more glad. First wipe with them left no streaks or water at all. Clipped on perfectly easy and that's basically all there is to it. They work. Sometimes, you really do get what you pay for, even today.",

      "text": "I liked the wiper very much at first. As far as blade types go this one did a good job with covering all that it should. Very good. However I just tried them out during a winter storm and not so good. Ice still stuck to them real bad. If winter is not a problem for you then I would recommend them over other blade types UPDATE: Fell apart within one month of use. Junk!",

The passenger side blade (18 inch) is slightly offset so that it does not ride up on the window trim like the OEM blades installed by my dealer. Installation was quick and straight forward following the enclosed directions. Blades appear to be high quality and are designed to maintain good contact with the windshield.

I have had these wipers on my truck and I am retired and DO NOT drive my truck very often. I would say I never used the wipers more than 5 to 7 times and not for very long periods of time. I am more mad at the cheapness of this little product ! I would not recommend this product to a friend !",

Tried Goodyears from Costco, better but still unacceptable.",

Now after about 3 weeks of use the wiper is leaving an approximate 4\" wide wipe path un-wiped....not completely un-wiped, but un-wiped enough that it's bothersome and unseeable through. It's right in the middle and right in my line of sight. At slower speeds it's okay, but it's bad at 70 mph. I have a feeling that I'll be replacing the wipers a lot sooner than I have had to with other brands.",

Amazon offers only thirty day returns and by the time I install the wiper, the thirty days will be up. I think Valeo, a well known wiper blade manufacturer, should handle the warranty coverage on their products beyond the thirty days offered by Amazon. I think Amazon agrees.",

We do not yet have long term service with these blades but we have had a set in use for a year, they still preform like new. (We keep the cars in the garage when not in use, which probably helps.)

Pros: Fits well, does a good job wiping fully windshield, no skipping/jumping noticed. Cons: Lasted 1.5yr, the area where the wiper arm attaches sticks up a little higher than a normal wiper blade. Maybe 1/2\" or so. Seemed a little odd but you'll get use to it. It is worth a try over most conventional wiper blades, just don't expect them to last more than 2 years.",
