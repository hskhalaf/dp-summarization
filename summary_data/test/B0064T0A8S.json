I have had the blotches reoccur in small areas several times since my initial use and two days of application on these spots have eliminated it. All this and I havent even been through one tube! Great deal! I highly recommend it for Tinia Versicolor.",

I could not stop scratching that's how bad it gotten. I literally had to run to Right Aid to get their product and get some relief. And sure enough the moment I applied Right Aid product the itchiness was gone and I didn't scratch it anymore.

The product spreads easily and goes a long way. The amount that arrived is quite enough to do the job, with a healthy reserve left over if the fungus ever returns. I recommend this product to anyone who has the stubborn fungus like I did. Be patient and give it the days it needs to work. It really knocks it out.",
