I shoot using a Canon 100D (SL1) camera, Canon 550EX flash and the wireless Metz Mecablitz 15 MS-1 Macro Ringlight which is controlled by the Canon 550EX flash. The camera is set in manual mode, shutter speed I keep at 1/200 and I use F16 at ISO 100 and so far the images I'm getting are pretty good and sharp. All without a tripod since the shutter speed is higher than the focal length of the lens, effectively 160mm on an APS-C sensor. This lens deserves the Red Ring.",

The sharpness is unbeatable 10/10, The weight is just right for use without a monopod, and the size is perfect, I don't like standing out if I go to a event and want some pics. I would suggest you get a hood for this. Another strong point of this lens is the bokeh which looks great in my portraits. The next lenses I like are $1500 and above so you can't beat this price for the quality. Attached is one of my portraits. Zabu | zabu@modelsensation.com",

We use this lens with a Canon 6D and, as is normal for macro work, mount it on a tripod so the lack of image stabilization is not an issue. We have taken around 500 shots with this lens and can vouch for low distortion and chromatic aberration (although the camera has built in compensation). Pictures are very sharp and the MTF seems to be a close match for the camera sensor. Thoroughly recommended as a budget buy for a high quality 100mm reasonable fast Macro lens.",

I have been testing mine and it seems to be as sharp as my best lenses none of which are \"L\" series. Since I wrote this review, I have discovered that due to shoddy packing the lens is actually damaged. The rear element got jarred loose and now dust has gotten in and is showing up on the images. I don't know what to do about it. I have stopped using the lens because of this problem.",
