      "text": "This picnic table and benches is built like a tank. Soooooo sturdy and really comfortable benches. The best feature is that all 3 benches swing out to make getting in so much easier. Kind of like a chair. Great surface...smooth and a snap to clean. Even rain does not leave water spots. I really do not see where this could be hurt because of the materials used and the quality construction. Best picnic table I have ever seen. Everyone wants to know who makes it and where did I find it.... AMAZON OF COURSE.......AND LIFETIME IS THE BEST !!!!",

      "text": "This picnic table is very nice, but it comes with approx. 200 metal screws, washers, etc. per table. This is crazy! It took 4 to 5 hours for the first (of 3 that I bought) by a skilled handyman, and two hours for each of the other two. I am also concerned about keeping it clean, as it is under a fruit tree (for shade) and so far has not cleaned up easily. It is normally covered, but when we use it, the cover comes off, thus the fruit problem. Nice looking and comfortable, but prepare to spend endless hours on assembly. Re the color, it appears to be white to me, not almond.",

It's poolside so someone can sit on it sopping wet and quickly towel dry for a non-swimmer. A seat can be angled to accommodate a large belly or snug up a child. AND, being round, everyone is facing everyone, so it's great for conversation. Outdoor restaurants should look into these for their seating! Just hose em clean.",

It's sturdy and fits adults as well. I rated it a 4 instead of 5 because although my husband could assemble it himself, it took a lot longer than expected. But it was packaged well, had good directions, and all the parts were correct. It's a very good product. The kids and their friends really like it and it is just what we were looking for.",
