The five gallon size (what I was originally sent) would do great with single plants about the size of peppers, tomatoes, or even bush beans varieties, or with smaller root veggies like radishes and beets. The seven gallon size looks perfect for squash plants (my plan for them) and even sturdy enough to grow vining veggies out of (I'll experiment with cucamelons and tomato cages with the seven-gallon pots). Will definitely be ordering more, and from this seller.",
