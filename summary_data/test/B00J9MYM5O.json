I was hoping that it will help with the urine smell. It did help temporarily but by the next day when the sun hit the grass it smelled like urine again. I tried it a couple times. Unfortunately I was not impressed. However if you\u2019re interested I tried vinegar with some essential oil\u2018s to make it smell better and the effects lasted much longer. And it\u2019s much cheaper.",

He has a series of carpet runners that lead to the doors in our house and sometimes has small accidents as he makes his way outside. I also have a geriatric chihuahua and a black lab puppy. It's a lot to manage, but I love these animals. This product facilitates the clean-up process when one of the pooches has an accident. It is the best product I have found so far for eliminating urine odor. Yes, it's pricey, but it's worth every penny. I highly recommend it.",
