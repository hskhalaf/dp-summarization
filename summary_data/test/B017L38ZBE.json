When a friend told me about this lotion I was skeptical but hopeful. I hate the after-tan smell. This lotion made a huge difference. I have only purchased one bottle so far, but I will be buying this again. I have never been a brand-specific snob about any lotion, tanning or otherwise. I am now! Fantastic product.",

This does smelly very pleasant and nothing like most tanning lotions, which is a great thing if you're looking for something with a softer smell. Personally, I don't mind, and even like the traditional tanning lotion smell. Also, I feel like the bottle was almost empty after two rounds, but that could have just been me piling it on the first couple times I went in, too. There's nothing wrong, but couldn't give it 5 stars because I'm just not in love with it.",
