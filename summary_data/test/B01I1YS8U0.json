I put these in the freezer and moved to refrig to thaw a little before using. I padded/Dr instructions with gaze. I alternated between the two and had minimal swelling and DR was very pleased, he couldn't believe the results at my 2 week follow up. I am having another eye surgery after COVID19 and plan on using them again. I recommend them for any eye swelling.",
