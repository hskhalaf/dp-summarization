So far it has worked like a dream! It isn't bulky and I don't have to have a purse accessory as I walk around Costco. I also liked the RF protection capability in this small form factor. Though I didn't test it I'm assuming they meet the requirements. Great gift for sure and I think it is growing on her for the size and functionality.",

Bills must be folded, but it works fine, and they slide out easily. The dimensions are given with the description 4.1 inch length. It all works well and I love for the price. Nice leather, compact, and smooth. I chose Crazy Horse Coffee--beautiful.",
