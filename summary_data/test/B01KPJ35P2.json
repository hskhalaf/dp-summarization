Well this is my second season putting the canvas on and the corner completely ripped where the frame holds it in place and the cover is useless. I could live with the fact that the chocolate brown cover is now desert tan due to extreme fading but now that doesn't matter. You would think that something designed to be used in the elements would be a little more resistant to them. Buyer beware cover did not last more than 1.25 summers (9 months). Why are these stress points not reinforced? Frame is sturdy and rust free as advertised.",

The canopy top was the most difficult part as it had to be stretched into place just right. He used the holes already made in the legs to screw it into the deck for added security. It functions well, keeping him in the shade while grilling and it looks so Good! The added side shelves are good for holding condiments etc and could serve as a bar by adding stools.",
