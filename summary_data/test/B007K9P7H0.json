These are of a little different design than the others, not being able to be folded up for storage. Also, the headbands of these are a little more thin than the others and are just a little flimsy. The upside to these glasses are that they are considerably lighter than the others and can fit over glasses if need be. I have no real complaints here as they do what they are designed to do and do it well.",

Glasses are lightweight, comfortable and immediately paired with the Epson projector as soon as I powered them on. Comparing them to the Epson glasses, I quite honestly couldn't tell a difference in brightness or picture quality. My wife actually preferred these to the more bulky Epson glasses (built in rechargable battery). The temples do NOT fold in, if that is concern. For the money, you can buy a ton of batteries before coming close to reaching the purchase amount for a more mainstream pair of 3d glasses with built in battery. Very pleased with these.",

I know the actual panasonic ones help reduce outside lighting and distractions but cost 2 or 3 times as much. these are just fine in a controlled environment.

Lastly, this is not a knock against the glasses, but I have found that I do get headaches with the active glasses on, vs passive which don't seem to cause the headaches.

Normally, you cant looks very long at a non-3D screen because of the shuttering. Didn't give 5 stars only because I have not tried other active glasses. However for 2-4x as much $, I dont think I ever will. :)",

The glasses shipped quickly and were packaged nucely as is normal for Amazon. I would recommend to someone who is curious but not serious about 3D.",
