I wanted 4 chairs to fit at the eat -in kitchen counter and these fit the bill/ No assembly, super solid, high quality, look very nice, and match my light oak kitchen. They are smaller than regular dining chairs, but everyone, from the 3 year old to the 52 year old, can sit in them comfortably. I'm attaching a picture to demonstrate the size difference. I'm very glad I bought them and would highly recommend to anyone looking to purchase chairs on the small side.",

I had bought these chairs almost 4 years ago along with a set of 4 similar chairs for my kitchen table. The set of four fell apart but these chairs held up through many drunken parties and several large friends. I've just purchased 4 new ones of these chairs to replace the crappy other ones and they've arrived in perfect condition and are obviously the same as the old pair. I saw reviews about these being small, but I disagree. They're the right size for a Windsor chair. Love them and I hope to but some little cushions for them soon.",

Looked good also. The angles chosen for the pre-drilled screw holes make it difficult to drive the screws in completely. I did think the ad stated that NO assembly would be required.",

The price for chairs that last only 2 years not great. Once the connectors break underneath, the chairs become immediately unstable. Might be the right look but the fact they did not last very long isn\u2019t good. The wood is weak. Well within the weight restriction advertised. I think these chairs should be rated for maybe 100 pounds and be used as kid chairs based on the fractures I saw. Will have to keep eye out for similar chairs from different company. Buyer beware as they won\u2019t last very long.",

They are adequate for what we wanted. If you are looking for extremely high end quality these are not that. They have held up well so far. If you simply want a reasonable replacement for little money these are that.",

The smooth finish is perfect, I was a little leary based on prior reviews of them being to small but they are normal size. We are awaiting delivery of our new kitchen table so we will have true use later this week. With Free Shipper Saver, Fast Delivery and the exact color we were searching for, these chairs can not be beat! Thank You for making them avaliable.",

The color is as shown in the picture and they match my old butcher block table perfectly. I read the comments about the chairs being \"small\" but that's certainly relative. The height is the same as my old chairs, but the seat is a bit narrower. I actually like the look of these better since when compared to what I had, the old ones actually look too wide. These fit around the table better too. I'm 6'-1\" and 190 lbs. No issues with them being uncomfortable or small.",

Don't expect luxury, but for the price they are good little chairs. My only complaint is after they arrived and I decided I liked them enough to buy another 2, the price had gone up by $30.",

I was concerned about shipping furniture, but found that the completely assembled product arrived without any incident directly to my door. Now we have a complete set to our table and you would never know we didn't purchase all 6 together or from different stores in different years.",

If I ever buy a grand table I will be sure to buy 2 or 4 more of these chairs..",
