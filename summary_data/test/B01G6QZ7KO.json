The material being bamboo, it can be cleaned very easily and even the water droplets can be wiped off just wih a cloth when compared to a metal stand which gets rusty easily. Cons: I feel that the price is a little expensive for the product. It would have been better if the shelves are more spacious or bigger with enough room for the plants to grow. Apart from the top row (3) shelves, I could not place my medium sized plants elsewhere in the stand, all the other compartments can be used only for smaller plants.",

There are two sizes of pre-drilled holes on the shelves and supports. The most important thing is to follow the pictures, and use the LARGE holes to attach the shelves. I learned this the hard way.",

If you had to use the hex wrench that came with it, you would be spending upwards of an hour or more to screw in the pieces. Save yourself some time and use a drill-driver. Overall, very nice unit.",
