While I've only put probably about 2 hours total in cleaning cartridge casings, pocket knives and other odd pieces, including several fossils & arrowheads. While I cannot truthfully say that the unit restores a bright finish to old brass, the amount of 'gunk' residue and the coloration of the wash water is very impressive. This unit should become a very handy household tool, but be aware that it is not large enough for your hand tools and kitchen implements!

However the design that requires you to pick up the entire unit (which is way larger than I anticipated) and tip it over to empty it, while strategically keeping the lid from swinging closed, is really a terrible one. It's very unwieldy and the water always drips down the exterior (as would be expected) so I'm worried that it will eventually get in to the control panel and cause a short.

This appears to be a great way to clean and maintain special jewelry without spending excessive time rubbing and polishing by hand.",

However, after 11 months of use it appears that the intensity of the ultrasonic energy has diminished or for some reason not being as efficiently transferred to the item being cleaned. Items previously had the dirt \"jump\" off of them and into the cleaning solution, but now this no longer occurs. Overall not a bad product but the apparent loss of cleaning \"power\" restricts my rating to a 3.",
