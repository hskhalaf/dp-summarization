At first, I thought the issue was with our cable service; however, after closer inspection, the issue stems from the product manufacturer, Toshiba. I purchased the system during my first ever Prime Day purchase, direct from Amazon. The screen just glitches out and then goes solidly black. Unplugging the television only reproduces the same glitches. Now, someone from Geek Squad is headed to my home to look at shoddy, defective, equipment. While I am hopeful that this Amazon-branded product will be replaced, I will not hold my breath.",

But, depending on the input (built-in streaming, antenna TV, or HDMI), it is either perfectly sync'd or it has a delay, so I have to manually change the audio delay repeatedly. Lag is so bad I can't use the TV to play my Xbox One. I assume this wouldn't be a problem over HDMI, but I haven't actually tried.",

But the TV does seem to have better speakers than the VIZIO, so have not missed the soundbar really. The Surround Sound (like all TVs) volume is too loud and drowns out people speaking, so you have to keep turning it on or off depending on what show you are watching. Overall, its a fine TV for the price. I'd buy it again knowing what I know now.",

So if you are having remote trouble (cursor goes to end, won't respond) it's because of too many different devices on the same WiFi channel.",
