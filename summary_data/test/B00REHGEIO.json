I have broke 4 bits and it wasn't even a challenge. The tips simply break off! I've used DeWalt and numerous other brands that are way better than these. I wish Craftsman was like my dad's old Craftsman, but those days are apparently long gone. Save your money and put it towards a better set. These are not good.",

The drill bits seem to be of decent quality though (high speed steel from the looks). And at this price everything seems to be average to above average.",
