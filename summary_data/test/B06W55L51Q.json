Thanks again, Hisense Ltd. The micro plug on the camera itself was very flimsy, and now, less than two months after owning it, it's completely broken. Two weeks ago, it started being loose, and now it won't turn on at all. Waste of money.",

After reading reviews we took the chance and we are so glad we did. The battery life is really good and while the night vision isn't the most crisp you can still see your little one without any issues. The picture is great and again like the night vision its not perfect but you can see just fine. For the price you really can't beat it truly.",

Not to mention the camera being zoomed in when it shouldn't of been and that it wouldnt stay on camera 2 for more than half a 2nd or share audio when my baby cried.",

We thought we\u2019d get a more modestly-priced unit, but months later, we\u2019re going to have to buy another monitor.",

Overall a good good monitor. If you have any questions please feel free to ask me. Highly recommend this one! you will be pleased. Hope this review helps!",

      "text": "Good monitor for the price. Have had it for a couple weeks and no problems from it. The camera comes with a screw to mount it to the wall but it was light enough to attach with a sticky tab. Picture is not perfect HD but it is clear enough to see everything...the zoom mode helps to see baby breathing. The music sounds a bit creepy like out of a horror movie but I never intended to use the music. Overall for the price it is a good deal, no need to spend hundreds on another video monitor when this works for 80.",

      "text": "Super easy to setup as it comes already paired and ready to go! Plugged in the camera, turned on the handheld monitor screen - that had some juice in the battery already - and was back out in the living room with friends in under 5 minutes. It's very lightweight and unobtrusive. There's also the opportunity to turn off the screen and just use the sound option so we can keep monitoring at night without a light on in the room. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I purchased this baby monitor initially with my first child, as a lightweight video monitor to take on trips with us. It has been perfect for us! The picture is really clear. Night vision is also great. It\u2019s small to throw in a suitcase. We also now use it for our 2nd child at home and set it up in different rooms. It\u2019s very portable and light weight. Highly recommend. One of our power cords stopped charging after a year and a half or so. I reached out to the company and they sent me a replacement cord, no problem. Great customer service.",
