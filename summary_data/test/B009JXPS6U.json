Much better than coated type cookware, EXCEPT when it comes to making eggs. I don't know if it is ME, or the pan, but I have runied too many over easy eggs with this cookware due to sticking((regardless if I use oil or spray)). So I ONLY use non-stick pan for eggs. Everything else we use this cookware. I HIGHLY recommend this product and I also think the cost is worth it too.((not too expensive or cheap for what you get)).",

Even the sauce pans I have a problem with there being a constant ring around the inside or food cooking to the bottom. The reason I bought these was because there were so many glowing reviews. Wish one of those reviews was me. Sorry- but I would have to say - not worth the money.",

While i knew not to expect it to be significantly better than the other stuff i have tried over time, i did expect it to be at least dishwasher safe in the short run. I just pulled out the pot after first wash in the dishwasher and it is all discolored and scratched from inside. Definitely not dishwasher safe as it claims to be. I regret this purchase and should have just gone with the cheaper stuff knowing that i wont really be able to use them in the dishwasher. I want to return this, but i didn't even keep the box around.",

Neither the pots or the pans give off this smell. Maybe we just need to scrub the lids thoroughly before we use them. [UPDATE]: We finally tried to use the 10 inch skillet, and noticed it was warped.
