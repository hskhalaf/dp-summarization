      "text": "Just started working out on a daily basis. My personal trainer recommended several recipes that included \"egg whites\". I initially tried separating egg white from the egg yolk with a small funnel. It was very cumbersome and left me with perfectly good egg yolks but not ready to make anything with them. It seemed too wasteful a process. Finding this powder was a true God-send. I mixed about 1-2 tsp of powder with water to match a recipe calling for 3 egg whites. It whipped up and cooked just like regular egg whites. This product is exactly what it says it is...egg whites. Nothing more. Just add water.",

      "text": "I like this protein powder because it taste like what you mix into it, not the egg powder itself. This is nice because it allows for a lot of variety of mixes. Creates a fruit smoothie when you throw in some ice or frozen berries. If you want vanilla, get some vanilla extract and Swerve brand Erythritol to sweeten it up and throw in a banana and a little cinnamon sprinkled on top and boom! Chocolate, ok, throw in some Swerve again with cocoa powder, done. Nice thing is you can add as much of this egg protein to the mix to make it as heavy or light as you want. Really good choice if you like customizing your shakes!",
