The variable speeds are great so you can adjust the speed of the blade and find the sweet spot you're looking for. The only problem I've had with it is the blade guard comes undone every once in a while but it's very easy to pop back into place. Simply put, you can't go wrong with this jigsaw, It's the best out there.",
