I found this item in a pet store (in the bird section) and decided to give it a try, since they were all out of my chinchilla's usual treats. Funnily enough, my parakeets won't eat anything besides pellets, seeds, and millet, so they were completely uninterested. My chinchilla though, absolutely LOVES THEM. He's actually spit out raisins at me before because he wants his papaya instead. Now, I order online to save me the trouble, and my chinchilla does backflips inside his cage whenever he sees me reach for them.",
