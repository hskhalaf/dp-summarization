Make sure you buy a mini SD card as you'll soon run out of space on the internal storage. Recommend buying the add on case and batteries. You get a good 25 minutes plus flying time but that soon goes.",

My fault, yes, however for a 1.2 grand drone you'd expect the input not to be so poorly made. I then sent the controller away to be fixed where they have now tried to charge me an extra \u00a3110!!!! to fix it. Despite it being well less than a year old and technically within warranty. Do not buy DJI. A chinese product living up to chinese quality standards. Avoid.",

    "title": "DJI Mavic 2 Zoom (UK) - Drone with Sensore of 1 / 2,3 Inch and 12 mp, Lens with 2 x Optical Zoom (24-48 mm), Full HD Video, Ultimate Flexibility, Distance of 8 km - Black",
    "description": "Style Name:Mavic 2 ZoomMavic 2 Zoom:\nPowered by a 1/2.3-inch 12-megapixel sensor with up to 4x zoom, including a 2x optical zoom (24\u201348 mm), the Mavic 2 Zoom is all about dynamic perspectives. Capture everything from wide angle to mid-range shots for even more creative options.\n\nMore Expressive Mid-Range Shots:\nCompared to a 24mm wide angle lens, the 48mm telephoto lens compresses your perspective, enhancing the parallax effect for a classic cinematic look. Now a whole new world of aerial photography is open to explore with even more epic, cinematic shots.\n\nA Worry-Free Way to Find a View:\nWhen shooting Full HD video, 4x lossless zoom (including 2x optical zoom) gives you a closer view of faraway subjects, making unique scenes more accessible to capture at a distance. This option also helps you maintain a safer distance from buildings, vehicles, animals, and people.\n\nQuick and Accurate Focus:\nHybrid autofocus on the Mavic 2 Zoom combines phase and contrast detection for higher focus accuracy with an increased focus speed of up to 40% more than before. The autofocus tracking system makes subjects appear clear and sharp when zooming in and out.\n\nZoom During Flight:\nDolly Zoom is a new QuickShot for the Mavic 2 Zoom, offering an otherworldly perspective in a fully-integrated drone. Dolly Zoom automatically adjusts focus when flying, adding an intense, warping visual effect to your video. When flying manually, you can also set proper focus speed values for even more creative shot options.\n\nSuper Resolution Photos:\nThe Mavic 2 Zoom also has a brand-new Super Resolution feature \u2013 an asset when capturing the vivid details your landscape photography deserves. When taking a picture with a 24 mm equivalent field-of-view, the camera will capture and patch nine photos with its telephoto lens, resulting in a 48-megapixel super resolution photo. Compared to ordinary panoramas, the super resolution photos retain the original look of the shooting targets with a more accurate composition.\n\nHyperlapse:\nSay goodbye to complicated post-processing. With Hyperlapse, the aircraft shoots stable aerial shots and processes them automatically, enabling you to create professional-looking timelapses with a simple tap of a button, which you can share to social media immediately. Save a flight path in Task Library to fly the Mavic 2 through the path whenever you feel like it. JPEG and RAW photos can be simultaneously saved on a microSD card, leaving more room for post editing.\n\nEnhanced HDR Photos:\nThe Mavic 2 also supports enhanced HDR photos, an improved technique that blends a sequence of photos for ghost-free high dynamic range, offering increased image clarity while avoiding unwanted artificial effects.\n\nHyperLight:\nBrighten up your world with HyperLight, a low-light setting designed to enhance your images while reducing noise significantly.\n\nH.265 Codec for Higher Image Quality:\nIt records 4K video at higher bitrates with advanced H.265 compression. Videos in H.265/HEVC codec maintain 50% more information than videos in H.264/AVC, creating high-quality videos with better-preserved details.\n\nSignature Technologies:\nOcuSync 2.0 video transmission performance is greatly enhanced with improvements made to communication distance, video quality and anti-interference, offering you unprecedented control.",
