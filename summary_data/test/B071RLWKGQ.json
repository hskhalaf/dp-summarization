One review mentioned the straps being a little too narrow which I also agree with. Overall, this is a great bag and was helpful to keep my hands free when they needed to be.",

The opening at the bottom allows for me to access my yarn, and it has plenty of room to stack even the biggest of projects on top when I put it away. The backpack feature with additional handles on top make it easy to carry whether I have it zipped or not. The material it is made with seems very high quality and durable, although I haven\u2019t done anything strenuous to test it. It\u2019s very attractive and I get compliments anytime I go somewhere and have it with me.",

I also thought, based on the images, that there would be much more expandable room inside the bag, but unfortunately the whole pack seems too slender and too small for more than one of each of the essential items. No doubt this bag is stylish and sleek, but I'm not sure it will be very functional for my baby, especially as he grows out of the newborn stage.",

We used Tommy tippee bottles with our first and planned to do the same this round. They don't even come close to fitting. It also looks like the outer part of the bottle part doesn't expand so it doesn't look like it'll even zip closed if a narrow bottle is put in.",

Pocket on the back let's you get to the bottom of the main bin if something gets buried, or if you want to keep your pump in there. we keep a couple swaddle blankets, and extra outfit, multiple diapers, wipes, etc with room to spare. Multiple pockets inside to keep diapers, pacifiers, diaper creams, etc. Front pocket with room for 3 bottles in insulated holders. Side pockets for wipes, diapers, etc. Only negative is the straps seems to slide and extend when wearing. Sometimes the cord will pull all the way through and need rethreaded. Hasn't caused any problems.",

I love the bottle section in the front and the wipe section on the sides. I love organizing so this is the perfect backpack for me.",

The best part in my opinion is the opening so you can access the bottom of the bag. That\u2019s the issue i always have with diaper bags.
