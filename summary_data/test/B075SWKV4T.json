Has little pegs to stand on so it doesn't sit directly on the ground which is a bonus for me. The only reason I give it 4 stars not 5 is that the materials is not as high-quality looking as I had hoped, it's more of a screen print stripe instead of alternating fabric, if that makes sense. But I still love it.",

The best thing about using a diaper bag for tech bag diaper bags come with a changing pad which can be folded double to add more protection to your device.

The best feature in this one is that it becomes a messenger, a backpack and has straps to hang it on a stroller separately! And it is wide, so not one of those deep long backpacks where things get lost! The size is big yet not so big that it can\u2019t be carried as a backpack. So a decent size! The material is good and easy to clean, enough pockets and I just love the retro stripes! So happy with this buy!",
