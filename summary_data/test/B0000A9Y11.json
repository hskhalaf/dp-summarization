      "text": "Works well but not an ags 101 model. I researched before buying and pearl blue was supposed to be specific to that model and for those who don't know the ags 101 model has the better backlit screen vs the front light screen of the ags 001 model. I'm disappointed that this was not the better model since it should've been due to the color of the Gameboy but overall I'm still happy to purchased so I could relive a small part of my happy childhood memories",

Though there's probably an extension which allows this, I'm surprised there was not one on the system to begin with.",

This is the one trait that won me over from purchasing a DS, which was my original choice, and I must say he was right. The images, regardless of the game's age, comes in crystal clear even in a used model! It's fairly straightforward gameplay that allows me, a beginner, to really enjoy the experience. I would recommend for those who enjoy playing even if they aren't especially skilled.",
