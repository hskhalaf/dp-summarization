My last CPU was an Intel, but ever since AMD came out with the Ryzen line of CPUs, I wanted one. Now that I own one, I can honestly say, these CPUs are BEASTS! Good job AMD!

      "text": "After researching the new Ryzen processors I chose the 1600x as a good mid-range option. I upgraded my system from an i-5 that was still functioning well, but it was approaching the five year mark. This is my first experience with overclocking a processor, and it was tricky in the beginning until I read a great deal on what was necessary. I was able to get the system to run at 4.1 GHZ, but settling in at 4.0 GHZ. I am overjoyed at the performance of this chip, unfortunately there are still some issues with RAM that I hope will soon be corrected through updates. I paired this processor with an ASUS Prime x370-a motherboard.",

      "text": "This is a great CPU. I have it overclocked to 3.9GHz pretty effortlessly and at 1.33V so temperatures are very manageable. Single core performance is not great but not bad either, but it has 6 cores/12 threads which is not available with any of intel's offerings in this price range. I'm not going to criticize this for not coming with a CPU cooler as most people getting this type of product are probably using aftermarket coolers anyway and if you're not overclocking it's not a huge investment.",

If you intend to OC sure you may get lucky on a 1600, but the 1600X is binned to a higher standard and thus has less wiggle room. My first 1600 topped out at 3.56, but the base on a 1600X is 3.6 and every one I've picked up was able to hit at least 3.95.",
