Years of using whitening toothpaste, kits, strips, floss and what have you later, my teeth became naturally 'white'. I got complimented on them all the time. But, I was still waiting for them to be that blinding bright white. I have no idea what is in this toothpaste, but it makes your teeth REALLY white. And I know it's this specific toothpaste because I have been using Sensodyne true white for a long and didn't notice a difference. I have been recommending this left right and center. Get this and you will absolutely be swimming in compliments.",
