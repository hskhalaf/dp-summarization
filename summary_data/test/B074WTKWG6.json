My kids laughed when I wore them saying they look ridiculous compared to apple pods. Overall I expected more from B&O but since I purchased I will use but again shop around and possibly do for the Cambridge buds (which wasn\u2019t an option for me as they don\u2019t deliver to Ireland)",

Bluetooth connection has also been excellent. I've used this product now for a couple of months and have no complaints at this stage. I sincerely hope that B&O will continue to build on this level of product for upgrades and updates, and that they do not start cutting corners for profit over quality as happens with so many other other companies.",

My concern is mainly about the functionality of these buds, I think they should work a lot on the app which is poor on options and graphic. Also I figured out after 1 or 2 hours of listening, it hurts a bit my ears, maybe this is my defect but I think I will go for the Bose or the PowerBeats and see how it goes. However, I recommend this item for anyone who likes design and quality.",
