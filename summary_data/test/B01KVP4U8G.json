I think someone else complained about this when I bought them but I thought perhaps they had been rough with them or something. I bought these back in May and have had them in the same location pretty much the whole time. Beyond the plastic cracking I would take a star off for the fact that the bass is pretty low out of the box. I use an EQ app to improve it and with that it sounds pretty well balanced.",

I had read so many negative reviews because of that exact problem that I emailed the seller, New and Renew Electronics asking about it and if Klipsch had fixed the problem but the reply that I received didn't say anything about the headphone being improved only \"if there's a problem, send them back\". Well the return has been started without ever listening to the headphones BOA (broken on arrival). Shame on you New and Renew Electronics and Amazon for selling such a bad product.",

This is clearly a faulty product and should not be in consideration for your purchase. Such a shame and failure for a company with other great products, as these headphones are trash when it comes to quality. If you purchase these knowing theyll crack like ours, then you only have yourself to blame on that silly decision.",

I am very careful with them and when they are not on my head they are on a hook or back in their case. Each pair has lasted around 5-8 months for me before they have started to crack or the pads rip and fall off. I would highly recommend looking at a different set of headphones, its obviously a issue with manufacturing.",

They did give me a new set via the warranty, but it looks the same and will likely break again. The warranty is only one year. I'm really disappointed because this is the most expensive purchase i've made in the last 5 years at least.
