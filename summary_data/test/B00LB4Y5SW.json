      "text": "Surprisingly sturdy, fits my 8 year old grandson perfectly. Easy to put together. Nice black finish. Seat is perfect for a child, but I think it would be too short for an adult; the seat hits me in the middle of the underside of my thigh, so not a good fit for me; I am 5'8, with normal length legs. Under my grandson's legs is a homemade foot rest which he likes to fiddle with while we do school work. Without the foot rest, the seat is adjusted too high, however, it is now adjusted perfectly for work on his laptop for school.",

I would definitely recommend them for a student of all ages.",

I took off a star because he struggled with assembling the base. When putting the seat holders into the base, you have to slide them into these plastic pieces. I assisted after he struggle for awhile. I had to stretch the plastic pieces in order for the seat holders to slide in. Screwing these pieces together also took time. Hopefully we won\u2019t have to adjust the heigh because I won\u2019t look forward to that. Overall he\u2019s satisfied with the chair and says it\u2019s very comfortable he just wishes it had arm rests.",

It comes with an allen wrench for the 8 bigger screws. The chair seemed a little scuffed and beat up so I am guessing it was a return, but doesn't seem to have any other issues at all.",

Heavy and sturdy I'm not concerned with this chair toppling over or breaking apart. Pricey but if you want to invest in a solid kids chair you can have for the next few years this is it and I would buy this chair again.",
