It has problems with furniture, it push chairs (it does not see them) and it jams in other furniture no high or low enough. 17 July- I was disappointed, now I hate it. 28 July- After 5 times used it looks worn out, with dents caused by crashes with furniture. I can not return it because I am in Colombia and it would cost me 150 to 170 US$ to send it back. 5 August- Less than a month of use and battery charge lasts for roughly 20 minutes.",

I'm in love with bobi. Granted I have only had it three days, but it is such a time saver. My floors look great. It doesn't bump into my furniture and it cleans underneath places I have never cleaned unless I move furniture around. The mop feature is bogus though. Does not really mop. It just carries a dust cloth around underneath its carriage. So if you are picking this because you think you won't have to mop, think again.",

They tried troubleshooting her but after many failed attempts they decided she wasn't fixable. They sent me a new bobi and it works just like my old bobi did before she got sick. This company stands behind their product and has incredible customer support. Hard to find companies and products as good as this anymore. But I am very happy with my decision to purchase bobi.",

My bObi hat a little issue with the left wheel after a week and customer service was amazing. They helped me to find a temporary solution and offered me a new one in exchange. Which wasn't even needed since it is working since then again. bObi is doing an amazing cleaning job in \"easy\" rooms. Our kitchen is a bit of a challenge though since the bump sensors do not recognize the kitchen cabinets. It is fun to watch it though. It is a bit like having a little child :-)",

These are areas which are very difficult to clean by hand but bObsweep gets under these items easily and gets the job done. Customer service has been excellent thus far also. They responded quickly to my request for additional screws which hold the side brush in place (one came out while bObi was working and somehow got lost). I look forward to using bObi for a very long time.",

I could go on and on, but to call this a mop is ridiculous, to say the least. The Bobi didn't pick up as expected. I have hardwood everywhere and well, this just didn't do it for me.

I have dark hardwood and light carpeted floors and it handles both surfaces equally well. It gets stuck on my thick bathroom rug, but otherwise has no problems navigating different rooms and returning to its docking station. It's very easy to program for regularly scheduled cleanings. My favorite feature is the waffle mode where the bObi will thoroughly clean in one small area. This mode was very useful for cleaning up tiny pieces of a broken wine glass. Overall it's a great a little robotic cleaner!",

Don't have any problems w/ this product & its very easy to use. Even my mom made me teach her how to use it so she doesn't have to clean the hardwood floor that we have. Our floor gets so dusty everyday & bObi cleans it right off. She especially Loves the mop that bObi has... no more stains!!",

The programming feature is also fantastic, you can practically use bObi as an alarm clock, though she is much quieter than a manual vacuum.",
