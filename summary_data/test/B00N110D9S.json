However, just 2 years after spending $120 on this item, it is suddenly buzzing during play, making it unusable. I contacted the seller and received this response: \"We are sorry for the inconvenience however upon checking it has already passed the 30-days guarantee period. Please have the item fixed at your local shop.\" At least I got 2 years out of it. I would be super pissed if this happened on Day 31!",
