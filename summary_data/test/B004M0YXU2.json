I am able to lay on it and roll through the night without creaks or groans and there is no fear of something giving way and me smashing to the ground. It actually fits easily into the carry case and that has straps long enough so that you can wear it as a backpack when you are hauling gear. I would buy it again and again but won't need to.

The cot height works for me & provides ample room underneath to store duffel bags & camping gear. The cot has no center bar, and is firm and supportive. I did purchase two light speed camping mats to make the cot experience more enjoyable. I also purchased the kamp rite quick set table, silver which is well designed and sturdy as well. I highly recommend these Kamp Rite products.",

These sounded like they could fulfill my need. I added a double layer of cheap eggcrate mattress foam from Walmart & put a stretch-knit twin sheet over it all. It is wider & longer than any other cot - and higher (okay for tall people). So the pillow does NOT fall off the end! They were very happy with them, saying much better than the floor-level queen bed they formerly used. They are easier to set up too!",

      "text": "This is a great cot! I bought my kids and my wife cots too but this bad boy is for me! It's very comfy and gives me space to toss and turn without having to bother with a deflated air mattress. It's surprisingly light for how large it is. The bag that it comes with is well built and easy to use. Wrapping up and setting up the cot is trivial and requires no special skills or strength.",

      "text": "This item is built defective and two of the end swivel pieces were assembled backward causing product failure. The u shaped offset brackets are ok on one side, and on the other side where the u shapped brackets were assembled backwards they collide with the nylock insert lock nuts. If the u shaped swivel brackets were assembled correctly this would will allow proper clearance of u shaped bracket to pass the nylock hex nuts. this is a defective product that should have been put through proper quality control, and should have never been sold to consumers. deeply disappointed as i do not use this product everyday and did not notice it right away",
