The company tells you to replace the bulbs with an LED bulb they carry, which is much whiter and brighter than the original bulbs (check the multiple comments on Amazon).

They produce a good amount of light without being too bright, and they are dimmable, which makes them perfect for ambient lighting. My only complaint is that the space between the last light on the string and the plug to connect another string is too long. I had to overlap the cord so that the distance between the lights was consistent. Not a huge deal though. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase.",

I wanted to hook these up to my dimmer switch, but these aren't harsh at all so I don't think it's necessary. Most retail stores sell 24 foot lights for $40-50 so these are a great purchase.",

I run them on a wire, which I recommend for all these lights but I saw a set hanging up without a wire this weekend which was ok but just not quite as attractive. The way they are set up makes putting them on a wire very easy. This is a good product at a good price and will really sharpen your outdoor areas.",

I have them on a timer and love the glow when they come on. Incandescent lights are so much nicer than the blue-white LED lights. I leave them up year-round (even through MN winters!).
