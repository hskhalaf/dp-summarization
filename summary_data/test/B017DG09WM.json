Very thin bezel is very pleasing to the eye. 27 inches is perfect. The price is much better than the competition. If you're thinking about this or the Asus one, choose this one, because the colour reproduction is much much better, Asus always have the contrast too high and their screens are too bright.",

I don't really understand how this is even an IPS panel, it feels suspiciously similar to TN where instead of colors shifting at different angles, the horrid glow just washes out colors. I think i'll try one more and give up. Side by side with my Dell UltraSharp it looks utterly defective. And ontop of all this, the edge bleeding spots are bright enough to always be visible the moment the area goes slightly dark... at 24% brightness. For me, the 165hz refresh does not even come close to offsetting the frankly embarrassing image quality compared to the 60hz ultrasharp.",

Definitely invest the time to change the colour settings using an .icc profile as the default colour setting has an ugly yellow cast to it.

Size, resolution and aesthetic is all a big plus for me.
