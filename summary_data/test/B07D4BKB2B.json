I have to say that although it's ok, it could be a lot better. There are a lot of seemingly random objects...like a lego drone and a very small train. But it just doesn't seem very festive. By contrast, the playmobile one is being played with every morning. It is creating a real setting with pieces that make sense and go together to make a whole playset. The lego one just seems kind of boring. It's still ok...but I expected better.",

He loved this and couldn't wait to open a new door every day to see what new surprise awaited him. He would build the new Lego item while eating breakfast. I spotted this 2018 version and bought it to put away for Christmas 2020. A few items are the same, but there are many new surprises for him to build. It adds to his collection of regular Legos and he loves designing new creations from his imagination.",

With a few exceptions I found the builds to be so random and boring that I lost interest in even putting them together. I mean, how many different ice cream themed builds should you get in a freakin' advent calendar? There seemed be be no rhyme or reason to the builds, and a few of them were so bonkers that I had to google what it was that I was supposed to be building. A HARD pass on this, don't waste your money ... it's no fun.",
