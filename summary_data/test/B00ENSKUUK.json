It\u2019s better than nothing, for sure, but a larger diffuser surface obviously allows for wider spread of light.",

Need to step up your flash a bit of course to compensate for the lost light. 3. Storing is in a camera bag will probably require removal. I wish it was collapsible and would tuck away while mounted",

      "text": "I use this mini soft box for taking macro shots for my graphics and it works lovely with my flash. It fits on over the flash bulb and doesn't fall off no matter how much I point down with it. Super secure fastening. We had a chance to compare a larger soft box under the exact same circumstances. The modification of the lighting is quite great, the softness is remarkable. This is an excellent compromise for diffusion that's more practical in size and function. Folds up into a tiny envelope that's easy to carry and pack.",

I do business head shots at the clients' location and with this add on, I don't need to bring a whole studio with me. I can either put it on my camera or a speedflash on a stand, and it works great! Saves me from carrying so weight from gear that I would otherwise have to setup since it's so compact and eliminates the need of having a large soft box stand in the way. I will be buying more soon for my other flashes so I can use them all at once with covers. .",

The way that it is attached to the flash is pretty interesting, and for those of you who need additional information: you strap the small strap around the flash first, and then velcro the soft box back onto the strap. I would recommend this product for someone who needs a soft flash but doesn't want to do a full setup.",

I can have my flash angles up or down and it doesn't slide. Keeps a tight seal and the silver lining inside reflects it out brighter yet comes through the cover with such soft lighting, that's so much more flattering.",

I like that it folds flat and fits into a slip pocket on my bag. I made pictures with and without it, and it really makes a difference by softening the light. I would recommend this for the larger flash options, but for something like the SB-400, a diffuser will work just fine.",

Stays in place with the non slip rubber grip inside the cover but I really admire that they sewed velcro straps onto it for even more holding it on there with even more security. Stays on where it's supposed and does an amazing job at diffusing.",

Works well with my flash during the day time as well especially on dreary overcast days, the effect comes out really nicely with the weather. Collapsible and really easy to slip on my flash.",

Much more flattering light than the harsh flash. Will like to try it when using fill flash outdoors.",
