When they do get to a possible solution you just have to wait until the part arrives then hope that fixes it. If that doesn't, then you have to start over again and then wait on the next part. I've been through this process several times in 6 months of ownership. Too much hassle for the money. UPDATE: The Buggy has now spent more time in my garage broken than it has in working order.",

If you are interested in a power wheel style Kart look no further. If you want to get a fast go-kart style gas powered Kart, then this may not be fast enough.

There are some people online who have modified it to go faster which would probably be a lot of fun for the kids.

Batteries seem to last as long as any other Razor product--giving plenty of time for fun. This buggy has a bit higher ground clearance than the other Razor go-carts--although it's clearly for hard-surface riding, like pavement and concrete. It doesn't have enough power or grip for grass or sand.",

      "text": "Great electric Go-kart for an 8-12 year old. Was quite surprised at how well it handled grass with the relatively small wheels and also impressed with the ride time, where my 10 year old got sore hands and butt after 30 mins, before the battery ran out. Would highly recommend. Also great that it pretty much comes fully assembled, with only some safety checks and a flag to install.",

I couldn't buy just one and have them fight over it so I had to purchase two and never regretted it yet.",

Fairly good price compared to other go carts I looked at. It has enough power to be fun but not too much where it severly ruts the yard.",

However, you might not want to let your five year old try to drive it full speed under your parked mini van in the driveway. Broke the throttle right off after only having it a few weeks. Ah well, had to call Razor for a replacement part. So that's why it's for eight year olds. I even get on it from time to time and zoom around. I would definitely reccomend this product!!",

Obviously the ride is smoother on asphalt, but our rocky ranch roads do not stop this thing. The super low profile makes this thing very safe. EVERY child that uses it.. LOVES IT and our neighbors bought one too!. I highly recommend this thing. Charge lasts a good amount of time. Enough for 10 kids to ride around all evening.",

The tires are smooth and don't have any tread on them. This is probably done to decrease road friction making them roll easier but I don't think they are going to last very long. It is also chain driven which is a little noisy but much easier and cheaper to repair than a direct drive unit. All in all my grandson loves it and has a blast driving it around the neiborhood.
