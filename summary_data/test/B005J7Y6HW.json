The only reason I saw the crappy printing was because I ordered extra cartridges, which are also going back. Ugh. What a waste of time -- but thankfully Amazon is refunding the purchase. I'm going back to Dymo.",

There's a minor learning curve, but for the most part operation is intuitive. I knocked off a star for a few reasons: 1. This thing takes 6 AAA batteries. That's a lot, and AAAs aren't cheap. 2. Several of the fonts attempt to be a little more stylized than the standard sans-serif. They don't work well at all. They're far too pixilated to convey the curves of a more natural script. If you're looking for function, these labels are fine. If you're looking for form, keep looking.",

The only down side is that when you place a border your text, I feel like it wastes some of the tape by leaving too much empty space at the beginning and end of the label, so I might actually stop using the frames because of it. :( But it's still a really cool machine!",

The backings of the tapes are split down the center which tends to leave a mark when the label is put in place. Over all, I think I will like this label maker the more I use it.

Tons of functions, very quiet printing and as others have said, it doesn't leave tons of wasted margin on each side of the text. The label tape that came with the unit though doesn't stick to certain materials as well as the Brother tape did. But on the flip side, the labels come off clean, unlike the Brother labels that could leave backing when you took them off. Could just be this specific tape, I'll update when I try a new roll if there is any improvement.",

Just the other day, I was staring confusedly at a short person in the kitchen, when I noticed he was labeled as 'son' '7 yr old' and 'Nick'. What a relief. Even as we speak, I am wearing tags identifying my person as 'wife' 'mom' and a name I can only assume is mine. Whew!",

The only complaint i have is that i wish the tape would come in a 1/4 inch width instead of a 1/2 inch width. It got to my house pretty quick and was packaged nice and secure no damage occurred while shipping.. All n all i am very pleased with my purchase.",
