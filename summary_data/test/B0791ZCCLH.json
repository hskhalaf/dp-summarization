It would be safe to say that there was NO MORE than 1 tablespoon of actual food in each cup and the rest was a thin broth. Then, I found out it was made in China! No wonder! Tonight he threw it all up after eating his dinner. Will never buy Rachel Ray brands again, ever!! I found another brand, made in USA, in the same size container, but is listed as \"pottage style\", meaning a thick stew. Going to try it for our little guy.",

She was given an IV and bloodwork, which came out all good. Even after that hefty bill, I tried feeding it to them again, just to confirm it was the food. This is when the other dog began demonstrating the same symptoms.. My poor babies! We all paid dearly for it. :-(",
