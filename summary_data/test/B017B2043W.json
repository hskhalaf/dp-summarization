For an expensive (albeit consumer focused) security camera I expected much more, and this is obviously not what you want to go through for this product category. I am hopeful Netgear releases a firmware update that addresses these issues. Their Arlo Pro 2 is considerably more reliable.

This little camera is fantastic for apartment dwellers as well as home owners, and could even be used in a hotel room for added sense of security. We got it so we could see what our dog was doing when we weren't at home and so we could talk to her - it works great for that! Position these cameras where the action will come from the side rather than head on for best detection of movement/sound and quick recording. The revolving 7 day storage in the cloud is quite adequate. Get the recommended memory card so you won't ever lose what videos your camera catches.",

One question that pops up is if it works well in the window. It does to a point. The part that doesn\u2019t work well is the night vision as the IR reflects onto the glass pane in front of it. Turning it off solves this but again you lose the night vision. The low light is somewhat decent.",

I have been looking for a way to keep this other location under control, and this new camera has brilliantly solved the problem, I just installed a small hotspot with a basic data service and I was good to go. I like that it doesn't need a \"base\" and that it also has a mike and speakers, in case I need (...hope not, but you never know). And, it registered immediately under my account, so I can check all the cameras (my house and the separate location) from the normal app. Pretty neat!",

The arlo q is great to be able to talk to him and my animals when we are both gone. So far they have stood up to the outside elements snow rain 100+ degree heat and -20 winters.
