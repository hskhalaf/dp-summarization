For my purposes--reheating leftovers, cooking frozen dinners, heating up a cup of water--this one is quite adequate.

The 1.0 cubic ft. capacity can accommodate a 13-1/2'' platter, prepackaged foods, single servings or a half-size pan in either direction. When the door is opened during cooking, the remaining time is cancelled; saving energy and increasing the magnetron's life. Stainless steel exterior wrap and interior for easy cleaning and a commercial look. A handy \"on-the-spot\" reference for timesaving convenience is located above the timer with recommended times for heating a variety of popular foods.",
