The sound quality was okay but I was hoping it would be good enough that voices were easier to understand. They were not. Just generally disappointed. Amazon, however, was great as usual for taking the item back. I'm replacing it with a Bose.",

The set up was a breeze (pretty much plugged it in and it identified itself) and it comes with everything you need to mount the bar (obviously not the subwoofer). I\u2019m by no means an expert on sound quality, but I have another mounted flat screen in another room and the difference is huge and, for my neophyte ears, the quality is amazing.",

Got it set up in a few minutes, the subwoofer automatically connected to the soundbar and I was good to go. It sounds amazing too. I didn't know what subwoofers really added before because I never had one but I'm a believer now. It's incredible. Highly recommend!",
