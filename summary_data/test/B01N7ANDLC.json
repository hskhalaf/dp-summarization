The only minor downside is the relatively short cords, which are in fact 5 feet as labeled in the description. i would recommend a USB extensions cord. Thank you iNNEXT!",

When I first got them, I was a little concerned that one of the buttons seemed a bit loose, but it hasn't been a problem. They were truly plug & play in Windows 10. And zero configuration needed with the MESEN emulator. I have zero concerns recommending these to other people! In fact, I already have on numerous occasions!",

These controllers are actually quite nice, I haven't and probably won't use them a lot, but they fell solid like an original controller and the buttons seem to have the same great feel from the 90s I remember.

The description states the length though so it's not deceiving, just keep in mind that you will be a lot more comfortable if you use extenders. Lastly these hooked up and worked flawlessly with my Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (Retro Pie).",

I\u2019ve got controllers from various eras, all the way back to the original Gravis USB gamepad pro. None are nearly as sensitive to this as the innext controller.

Then one day a gamepad did not connect to the Pi. A few days later the second gamepad stopped connecting as well. Other gamepads connect fine and I tried to connect these to other devices with no luck. Prior to that, I was using it moderately with no button mashing, it just stopped working out of the blue. Based on the reviews here, the newer controllers may have better construction, but I'm a bit wary of that.",

I didn't return because I can't, the shipping cost would be more expensive that keeping the controllers. I hope the other buttons last longer.",

The buttons and d-pad do not rattle when you shake the unit. I have a couple hours of Mario, punch out, and various other games played on it and it's held up nicely. This new model rivals the quality of the Ibuffalo. If you are considering a budget Retropie build this is the controller to buy.",

Can I use it to play online games?\nA: No, this controller not supports online games.\nQ: 5. Why my controller inputting both joystick and keyboard buttons?\nA: What emulator are you using? Difficulty on mapping the buttons depends on the emulator. We recommend using SNES9X on PC, OpenEmu on Apple Mac, Retropie on Respberry Pi.\nQ: 6. After running a configuration through retroarch,when i connect the controller to my retropie/raspberry pi 2,the pi doesn't detect it.what's wrong?\nA: You can try powering down and booting back up with the controllers connected. or rebuild retropie.\nQ: 7. How long is the USB Cable?\nA: Cord is approx. 5 ft. Long.\nQ: 8. Can you configure the buttons to specific keys? I want to program buttons for shortcut commands like CTRL+Z, for example.\nA: This can be accomplished with 3rd party software that maps joystick buttons to keyboard controls such as Xpadder, AutoHotKey, or EventGhost. \nTips:\n1. Plug in the controller first before open the emulator or power on the raspberry pi, so your device could detect the controller easily.\n2. SNES9X is perfect emulator for Windows PC.\n3. If you couldn't configure input correctly, please contact us and tell us your device and emulator, we could help to solve it.\nPackage :\n2 x USB SNES Controllers",
