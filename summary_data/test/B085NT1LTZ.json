At anything, we have tried everything known to man to curb it, the SUPERNIGHT COLLAR has been sent from the Dog God!!! Alittle tricky to set up, but once activated and placed in the right position around his neck, this collar has transformed him, he barks once , the collar vibrates and flashes, he looks bemused looking around for the noise and the flashing, he's even tried barking quietly to see if he can stop it activating... No can do, a quieter house, a quieter dog. Wish I known about it 8 yrs ago when we rescued him from the dogs home, bless Highly recomend",

Also, inside the packaging comes with a warning not to use on your dog for long periods as it can cause damage to your pets skin, which made me feel uncomfortable and had to return. Also, you definitely need to purchase the air can to fill it. Instructions are pretty clear and easy, might be a bit bulky for smaller dogs, although I did get it for my lab. Was not able to try it out so could not review on efficiency and effectiveness.",

Other than that it is a brilliant product that gives you the option to change the vibration and sensitivity to suit your dog! The battery life is okay but could be improved.",
