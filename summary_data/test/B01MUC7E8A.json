Going to be replacing the twine portion with zipties, and weighting the pots with a rock/bric. Also be sure to rearrange the rubber bands, and when you go out, bring a bunch more with you. Good for the claws and will help you keep those doors only working one way. Would reccomend over promar, not sure about danielson.",

      "text": "Pots are quality and require some bending of hooks in order to put together. Use a large pair of pliers with a pad. The twine on the pots is required so that the crabs can escape if the pots get lost. The twine will disintegrate over time. Be sure to remove the rubber bands on the gates. Those are only for shipping. The rope this comes with is thin and cheap. I would buy the other pack that comes with leaded core rope or buy it separately. I would also weigh the pots down with a brick and put some washers or small weights on the gates so they don\u2019t stay open.",
