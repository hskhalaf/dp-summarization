After washing, I noticed a slight white fuzz all over the sheets and pillow cases. The sheets were washed by themselves, so it couldn't have come from something else. All in all, I don't think this was a good deal. I have bought Williamsburg 400TC Sheet Set which are $90, but they are the real deal and seem to last forever.",

I wonder if they are just cotton sheets? Hard to tell until they are washed and the fact that they are a sateen really makes me wonder. Good long staple cotton, after a washing or two, should have the softness of flannel but the the lightness and breath ability of linen. If my daughter reports back I\u2019ll update.",

It wasn't EXACTLY what I was looking for, I wanted sheets that are very cool to the touch. These are not that. They aren't bad, they don't super heat up uncomfortably, but they weren't what I was looking for. I've only lucked out with very cool to the touch sheets twice in my life - and unfortunately I wore holes through both sets after years and years of use.",
