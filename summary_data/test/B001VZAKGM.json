It won't cook for you either. Now onto the review, it's sturdy, firm, not flexible, it fits my hands well, it's flame resistant, it's not heavy (your burgers are just too weak if you're using a flexible one). Like most wood, it's handwash only. Not a problem as it cleaned up with ease.",

This is the second piece of cookware to have me excited (First being Lodge Cast Iron Skillet). As corny as this sounds, this spatula can be handed down to your grandkids one day, and I plan on doing just that.",

Not only does it do great flipping them over and getting under and around but when I'm finished and I put it on the kids plate the sides cut it into perfect squares for the little guy! Love it! Additionally, this feels very high quality in your hand. It's well balanced and solid. Not flimsy in the slightest. Get it, you'll love it :)",

I have to be very careful when using it or it will scrape some of the non stick coating right off the pan in and right into my food.

I feel that not throwing it in the dishwasher will help it last longer. It cleans so easily that there's no need to have it in all that water for that long of a time frame. I've seen these go for as much as $25. Be aware that you're paying for the name and the advertising. This is an awesome product and a great gift!",
