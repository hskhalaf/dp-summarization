Although manufactured in the traditional Puma design, the brand made a few tweaks to the material resulting in a breathable and lightweight cleat that doesn't sacrifice comfort. This cleat will allow wearers to execute cuts and keep a clean and close feel on the ball.",
      "pros": [
        "The Puma Invicto Fresh received much praise from many reviewers for being a great looking cleat",

        "Aside from being a good indoor cleat, many users found it to be suitable for casual wear, as well",
        "Some Puma enthusiasts loved the barefoot feel of the cleat owing to its incredibly thin shell",
        "Players were pleased with the lightweight construction of this indoor cleat",
        "Comments from a few testers favored the color combination of the cleat",
        "A few individuals who tried the cleat were impressed with the good cushioning it offered",

        "A common observation from some wearers was the narrow fit of the cleat",
        "One commenter was discouraged that the sole easily separated from the cleat"

Once that get wet forget about it, will start to peel off. You can't wash this because you will completely lose the colors on top. If you will never be in a rain and use it for indoor only, go for it. If you go out and it gets wet or dirty forget about your good looking sneakers, FOREVER.",
