As a normal blender think its great, but if you use the smoothie button a lot expect it to fail on you. The smoothie function uses the ability to spin the blade in both directions to suck down all the fruit. This works great but ends up killing the jar. The warranty covers the motor but not the jar and you can no longer buy the jar anywhere. If you want this for making smoothie\u2019s pick something else.",

After reading reviews on The Wirecutter, I thought surely this is the world's best blender, but that's a basic, and irredeemable, design flaw. A single wash-and-dry cycle later, and there's ugly rust all over the place! And I don't mean a little discoloration, I mean RUST, bright orange rust that wipes off easily and stains things (and yes it's RUST, as in iron oxide, I'm not mistaking it for something else.) Seriously, for a kitchen implement that cost nearly $200, how on earth can they not make it out of stainless steel? I'm aghast.",

I asked for replacement jar from Oster but due to the pandemic, any parts from China or Germany are taking much longer than usual and this particular jar is out of stock. Replacements will arrive supposedly in 4 months or so. I can't wait that long. Will likely upgrade to what Wirecutter recommends.",

I'm writing this review because today this blender is no longer usable: it smokes and it smells terrible. I used my mothers' vitamix extensively before I chose to go the budget route; I would rather have paid double the price to avoid the frustration with this machine over the past two years, not to mention the inhalation of potentially toxic smoke when it malfunctioned.",

Plenty of power to blend anything the blender makes nut butters great, I will say though best to purchase a second pitcher for nut butters makes the plastic hazy no functional issue just looks ugly so I keep that one under counter and pretty one on the unit. As compared to a vitamax and such power wise it's got it I would say though that the vitamax motor is probably of a higher commercial quality but for a home blender save 400 dollars and buy this for 230 you won't be disappointed",

The only bummer is that it's not dishwasher safe, so I have to wash it by hand. I usually do this immediately once my smoothie is done, so it's become a pretty quick process.

This was the case either with the smoothie preset or when turning the machine to high. Unless you only prepare smoothies with unfrozen ingredients, or smallish frozen items, save your money for a Vitamix, or buy a Breville with Amazon's product protection or via a credit card that extends a warranty.",
