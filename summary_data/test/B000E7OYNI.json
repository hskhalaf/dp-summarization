The basil itself tasted soo good, and the leaves were so large that one or two leaves were more than enough for a dish made for two. I am using up the rest of the seeds this year.",

The seeds are packaged in individual baggies with the seed name and growing instructions on the back. There are a generous amount of seeds in each baggie. The package also includes a booklet of instructions and a flier for the seller's website. The individual herb pictures are very cute and the inserts are colorful and fun. I planted dill, cilantro, savory, thyme and marjoram a few days ago in individual planters and already seeing sprouts come up. I'm a novice planter, so it is really excited to see results! I would buy from this seller again.",
