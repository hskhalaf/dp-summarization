      "text": "My 2011 Cadillac CTS connects to my phone via Bluetooth for phone calls only. So streaming music is only available through aux. jack. I tried a couple of different wired solutions but they were cumbersome. I tried this with marginal expectations but after a nice long ride to the beach and back today I can report it worked perfectly. And somehow my iPhone 7 was able to switch between the car and the Bluetooth adapter automatically when calls came in. I thought for sure I was going to have to find a way to toggle between the two sources for phone calls. I hope it lasts a while!!",

Battery life seems great. Can use while it is charging. Very clear sound. Easy to connect. Connects automatically now to my phone when I turn it on. Shuts off automatically when not being used.

There is no noise unless you plug it in to the charge while listening to it. I was disappointed when first plugging it in that the battery died shortly after\u2639\ufe0f But charging it for a night will fix that. Overall the product is good and worth the money.",
