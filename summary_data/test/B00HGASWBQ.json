Definitely lets you stay organized and get more done with specific places you don't need to look down to grab things. If your wearing them every day their well worth the money, if not you'd likely be happier going cheaper for occasional carpentry.",

I personally just don't enjoy wearing suspenders. Overall its a set a nail bags that is finely crafted and the tool placement layout is superb.",

I have been using one of their all leather tool belts for well over a decade and still use it on a regular basis, but I needed a better tool belt for a worker. I had bought a cheap belt from Harbor Freight, which started to fall apart the first time he used it, so that reminded me why buying cheap is not really a good value. Shoulder straps will be a wise investment as well for this tool belt.",
