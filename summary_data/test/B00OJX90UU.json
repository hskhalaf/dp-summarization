The instructions were clear nothing confusing. The reason why it's not a 5/5 is because the bench lettering was messed up a little, and some of the bars were bent a little, nothing super bad to were it needs to be replaced. The tools that came with it sucked so I bought my own and it made it 10x easier. They are included In the photos.",

The leg extension is the only thing I cant get a decent position on. If you need a bench to hold olympic weights this will work ok. The adapter for the leg extension slides off easy and is not fixed to the smaller diameter weight holders. The holders in the sides of the bench are about 1\" in diameter (smaller than the bore of an olympic plate) but are holding 35/25/10 just fine. I am happy with this bench.",

Furthermore, the stands for the bar aren\u2019t as wide as I thought, but they aren\u2019t terrible. Being 6\u20195\u201d, I have quite a long arm span, and this bench doesn\u2019t allow me to do a wide grip. That being said, I guess it forces me to get that form locked down! Lol.",

I say this as a person who is not handy and does not like any complex assembly. The instructions are well crafted. The bench is solid and sturdy. I had it done in under 2 hours. But that was using a standard socket wrench set. Throw away the assembly tool they give you. It's useless and virtually impossible to use on its own.",

A couple of flaws, but nothing serious; The preacher cushion has a poorly designed fastening which leaves it a bit unsturdy, but not so much that it is an actual problem, and the cushion fabric is indeed on the cheap side, imitation leather that eventually starts peeling/flaking off. It takes a good bit of time to assemble, but its pretty straight forward and comes with all tools required, would still recommend a legitimate screwdriver and wrenches but they are not required. Honestly a very good bench for the price and pretty straight forward assembly.",
