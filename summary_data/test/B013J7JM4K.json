As far as wearing them, I wear glasses and have had no problem wearing these headphones all day while wearing my glasses.

      "text": "For my untrained ears, it certainly sounds very good; for both music and calls [both when using bluetooth and the 3.5 jack]. I've used them on the commute to/from work, as well as 13 hour flights to Asia. The headphones itself is a little bit small though, so my ears sort of ends up hurting after using a while. Other than that, it's also surprisingly very durable as well. My 8 years old son has been using it whenever I'm not, and he tends to be rough with it. So all in all, I'd say it's a pretty good purchase.",

The sound quality is great no matter what type of music you are listening to and they definitely help cut out the ambient noise in the environment.

Sound is good and Bass is not that less as mentioned in many reviews. I heard \"god is a woman\", \"Hotline Bling\" and felt great.

I just travel with these a lot and as a result they take up more room than they need to. The other issue is that they are quite wide. They seem wider than any other headphone I've had.

      "text": "I wanted a pair of headphones that I could have the option of plugging in and not running bluetooth and powering up all the time. These have an aux cable that when plugged in the only way to control volume is through the actual device you're listening through. Headphone controls don't work nor the mic/control button; it is for stop and play only. For the price I'm debating if this is a deal breaker or not.",

Otherwise these are a good value for the sound and features if the fit is right for you, or you\u2019re slightly smaller but I\u2019d almost consider it a youth size for the cups if you want them to completely surround the ear like I was shopping for.

I've purchased a couple of sets of blue tooth headphones (earbuds) on here and when on the Zero Turn mower they would break up, and the music stream was not constant. With these headphones, I did not have that problem, the connection was solid. My issue with these headphones is that they are comfortable for a little while, perhaps 45 minutes to an hour, but not for extended lengths of time. Using them on a 4 hour plane trip left me with a headache from wearing them. Also, the noise cancellation is average, but not particularly good.",

The Bluetooth has worked flawlessly and the headphones block out outside noise well. I work 9 hour days and have not have to stop listening to recharge.
