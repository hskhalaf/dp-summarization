Poking with a toothpick is not a pleasant experience, and the burning afterwards can last for several hours. I can't really comment yet on the healing and whether any residual spots remain, but I'd rather have those than the ugly spots I've been removing. I would definitely recommend it!",

For the first one I followed instructions as described and it was gone in 6 days. For the second tag, I was a bit casual and kept the tag removed cream for around 6 mins instead of 2 mins as recommended, and my skin started burning like hell. I cleared it out and tag was gone within 3 days, but I think it will have a permanent scar :| Overall, I would recommend the product.",
