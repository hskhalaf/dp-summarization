      "title": "One excellent dove tail jig!",
      "text": "No dovetail jig is EASY to use, but this tool is close. This is one fine jig and the components are all very well machined and look great. I have used it a few times and once you get the hang of the adjustments, I was making repeatable full dovetails. I never cut a dovetail in my life until I bought this jig - now I am like Norm Abrams from This Old House; a dovetail king. But honestly this jig is fantastic and worth every penny.",

      "text": "I bought this jig several months ago, assembled it, watched the DVD for it, and now it is sitting in my shop collecting dust! :( however I am about to be build a full set of cabinets for our home we are about to build so I'm sure I will get plenty of use out of it. As far as a review on the product, this is the first dovetail jig I have ever owned so I have nothing to compare to but from what I can tell it is a solid jig and looks simple enough to use. I really like the simplicity of cutting the pins and tails without making any adjustments.",

    "title": "Leigh Super 12 in Dovetail Jig",
    "description": "Super jigs offer extraordinary joint making capability at exceptional price points. No other jigs equal the versatility and precision of Leigh super jigs. Variably spaced through and half-blind dovetails are standard on all super jigs. Infinitely adjustable one-piece fingers are easily positioned for any joint pattern, guaranteeing a half pin at each edge of the joint, regardless of board width. The cross-cut fence fits on the dovetail finger assembly to become a sliding dovetail template. Rout half-blind pin boards and tail boards at the same time using the included two-function spacer to offset the tail board and rout complete joints in one pass with the super jigs, you're not limited to one bit and one depth of cut. Just select any of the five half-blind bits available and rout half-blind joints in the depth that best suits your project. The finger assembly can also produce two sizes of box joints, 5/16\" and 5/8\". The amazing joint making capability of super jigs is due in part to the revolutionary new Leigh E-bush. Very precise adjustments for fit are made easily with the E-bush. Settings are changed using the included pin wrench and the uniquely shaped locking nut makes tightening the E-bush a snap. Markings clearly indicate the adjustment direction necessary for the desired change. A simple twist of the E-bush changes its active diameter which in turn changes the fit of finger joints and half-blind dovetails. Easy to use cam action clamps and aluminum clamp bars hold the work piece securely against non-slip material applied to each clamping surface. Includes: 1/2\"-8 degree dovetail bit, 1/2\"-14 degree dovetail bit, 5/16\" straight bit, 1/2\" to 8mm collet reducer, sliding dovetail fence, half-blind bridge piece material, E-bush, fully illustrated user guide and instructional DVD.",
