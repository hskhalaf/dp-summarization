I bought it for my daughter's birthday, because she wanted a science kit that was on a commercial, that was way more expensive and with way less experiments. I got this as a cheaper alternative that would allow her to do more. I'm very happy I got this kit instead of the one she asked for! I would definitely purchase again and recommend it!",

My daughter is nine, and she was able to do most of the experiments independently, although I highly recommend grownup supervision anyway to really slow down the experiments to make room for a little learning, too. The materials are of good quality, and I thought this was well worth the price I paid for it.",

The underwater volcano is the biggest hit thus far. The crystal related experiments were the least impressive/exciting. Would not bother to buy components to redo those. Like that there is a bit of discussion/guidance for parents to talk about the science behind what's going on, but it is a little over a 5yo's head.

Only basic supplies are required but not included, such as water, towels, a plate or tray to catch spills, and a stirring spoon. Although none of the experiments included in this kit are especially messy, each one should be done on a flat surface that can be easily wiped clean in case of spills. Adults who are supervising experiments do not need to be science gurus. In addition to step-by-step instructions for each experiment, the detailed science guide included with this kit provides adults with \"mind blowing science secrets\" that help to answer questions about what's happening in each experiment. All of the materials and experiments involve basic scientific concepts associated with acidic and basic liquids and are arranged to present these concepts in sequential order. The descriptions included in the science guide give background information related to each reaction and offer questions that adults can ask to help encourage fun learning during experimentation. \n\n Dynamic, Fun Science at Home\nAdults and kids will learn amazing new things about basic and acidic solutions with the Mind Blowing Science Kit. Whether erupting a color-changing volcano, creating a sunset in a test tube, or growing colorful, jiggly crystals, this science kit mixes learning with experimentation in a fun and colorful way for a wide range of ages. Each of the hands-on activities in the science guide is intended to be performed by a young scientist under adult supervision, although these activities can be adjusted to accommodate a range of ages and capabilities while still maintaining the educational excitement of the original experiments. In addition to providing detailed instructions, the science guide makes it possible for those adults who might not have a background in science, or even any exposure to scientific experimentation, to knowledgably perform experiments successfully. The dynamic, colorful nature of the experiments included in this kit make it great for pleasing a crowd at family gatherings, parties, or science fairs.\n\n What's in the Box\nRed cabbage juice powder, citric acid, baking soda, color tablets, cross-linked polyacrylamide crystals, vegetable oil, corn starch, paper, cotton swabs, test tubes and caps, plastic cups, pipette, stir sticks, small and medium plastic scoops, science guide.",
