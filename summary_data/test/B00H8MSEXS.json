The extra padding for extra security when the child is small is great also. I have recommended it to many parents any chance I get. This is by far the best highchair to have.

I have not used it as anything except a high chair so far. 5 point harness allowed me to set her in it as early as 4 mo old. Does NOT come with storage basket attachment as advertised. This was the only disappointment. Haven\u2019t been able to figure out where to buy only the attachment but it would be very useful. The only other thing id change about the seat is having somewhere I could attach toys so my daughter couldn\u2019t drop or throw them.",

      "text": "Good chair and has a lot of functionality! Very comfortable for babies as mine enjoyed sitting on it. However, my two concerns are- 1. The breaks are on the back wheels which makes it hard to control. One HAS to put their leg within the wheel frame before seating and removing a baby. Frankly a safety hazard in my book. 2. The belt material tends to collect food deposits. I guess that\u2019s a downside of requiring friction on the belt. That\u2019s the only reason I would give it 4 stars. The good part is that there are three trays, decent material and good higher and leg features.",

Even when you lock the wheels the chair can still slide so be careful with your baby. I still have to put my foot in the base of the chair to hold it to prevent it from sliding when getting the baby in and out of it. Pretty easy to put together and straight forward to use. Would be great if the seat height was adjustable with better locking wheels.",

It came quick, is easy to clean, and has all the features 3 x more expensive high chair the our kids had bought. Only complaint is we can't find a way to lock it so the older boy can't push it around. I'd still highly recommend it.",

Table tray cleaning is easy too as it comes with an extra top-on tray. 5. Leather seat, makes the cleaning over the entire seat easy too. Cons: Can not be folded.",

My toddler likes to sit in the kitchen while I cook. She colors, watches me, plays with her toys and isnt under foot! The inner tray is removable, to uncover a larger, flat tray. The wheels make it easy to maneuver her around while she remains in the chair. The fabric itself is extremely easy to wipe down, and dries quickly! Highly recommend",
