      "title": "Great sound, unfortunate design.",
      "text": "Whilst the sound and build quality are superb, this model has two major flaws. It becomes uncomfortable to wear after about 40 minutes, so it is not so good for watching films. Whilst fairly small in size, the case it comes with is quite bulky and it is not easy to stow the headphones back in the case after use. In fact the larger and more comfortable P5 model folds up into a more compact soft case, which is easier to put into a small briefcase. The P5 is nearly double the price but far more practical.",

      "title": "Not the most natural sound.",
      "text": "These headphones look and feel luxurious. I'm not that impressed with the sound though. There is clearly a boost to the upper bass / lower midrange that initially appears to make them pack a real punch and sound impressive. However; what happens is that this 'boost' tends to drown out more intricate elements of the music such as the higher notes of subtle electric guitar and complex percussion. I think they are purley aimed at the younger generation who listen to popular music on mobile devices.",

      "text": "Well first the sound. Yes they are quite bass oriented however I quite like to feel Im in the music and its not distracting or muddy as the mids and highs are well shaped giving the sound stage nice depth and feel. They are beautifully made and feel strong, however the head band pinch is noticeable after wearing for a while, but that being said it also contributes to good earpiece contact which again fully immerses the listener. The price is great and well placed. The only negative is the case doesn't feel that strong but it'll do for now.",
