      "text": "I have added a video so please watch to see it in action! I purchased the king size mattress topper. It has plenty of support and the foam is plent soft. The pad was designed well. I bought this to soften an extra firm mattress. Im always hesitant when I see 1 star reviews but if you have amazon prime, just get it and try it out. If you don't like it you can alway return it. I stopped by home on my lunch break and opened everything up to air out. It came tightly rolled and wrapped. It probably took a good 5 hours to completely fluff up. GET ONE!",

In fact the foam is so thick that I suspect you could put this on a very cheap mattress and it would still feel great. Very easy to put on the bed too, it fit perfectly and the pillow top has deep pockets so it will fit over the foam, your mattress, and whatever else you have on the bed easily. Very pleased!",

A definite upgrade for aging body. My pooch also loves the softer lay! There was no \"gassing\" odor that other subscribers complained about with other foam toppers. The additional pillow top cover also adds layer of softness if desired. The pillow top cover does not have absorbent protection and foam will absorb liquids, so I suggest using protective cover with or without pillow top. My deep pocket sheets were able to handle the additional thickness, so no need to purchase new sheets if you already have them.",

The cover is one of the nicest parts because it is separate from the memory foam (which allows you to wash it) and has super deep pockets that allow you to cover the memory foam and your mattress. The cover is not waterproof though. To protect the memory foam, I added a waterproof layer between the foam and the cover.",

Also, the \"memory foam\" pad is 2 inches, then they give you a topper that is 2 inches, which is essentially a low grade pillow. I wish I kept the box cause returning this is gonna suck.",

This product is truly supporting me when I lay on my side which our last foam topper (Costco) didn\u2019t do at all. This one seems to be cushionybyet supportive due to the gel infusion into the foam. It\u2019s much denser than a regular foam cushion but not in a firm way. The denser portion helps it not collapse when you lay on it but just lets it truly support your body where it needs it. So glad I spent the extra money!!",

      "text": "We received this 5 months ago. We have loved it for the comfort it added to our mattress. We put the cotton topper on it when we first placed it on the bed. Today I removed the topper to wash it along with our featherbed and discovered huge tears along one side that go almost all the way through. I can't imagine how that could have happened. My husband and I are not big people ( we both weigh less than 150) so it certainly isn't a weight issue. We will turn it over to see if we can make it last. Up until today I thought it was 5 stars.",

This one uses a low density foam. Some people in the industry don't understand that low density foam creates a cheap low quality softness that makes you sink in too much. It feels very thin when laid on .The key to high quality here is increasing the density without loosing softness. This is why tempurpedic stuff is still the best on the market, because they can do that. That is what gives you the feeling of resting on clouds.",

This product was easy to unpack. I let the memory foam lay out and expand for about 30 minutes and wow did it expand. It fit perfectly on my king size bed. No shortages on the sides or length. The topper was a great added bonus that stretches over the memory foam and my mattress. My deep sheets fit perfectly over it. I\u2019m very happy with this product and finally love sliding into my bed again. Great product and company!",
