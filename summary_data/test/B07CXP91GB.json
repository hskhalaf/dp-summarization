      "title": "REALLY Horrible Camera",
      "text": "Even after adjusting this camera's settings every possible way, the picture quality is really awful. The colors are all washed out and faded, pictures are either really dark or ridiculously bright, and never true to color. The \"no shake\" is useless, as most photos are blurry. Wish I hadn't waited to try this out, so I could return it. Truly is garbage. Now we have to buy another camera. If there were negative stars, I would have rated it as such. Waste of money.",

Also since I am using this for work not nearly as much cost of I lose this or drop it getting the picture of a nameplate on the backside of a machine. I am happy with the purchase.",
