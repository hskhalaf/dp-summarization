Is perfect for occasional seating or to accessorize and complement spaces. Your son at collage will love it but your grumpy senior dad will hate it. If you are looking for a grandma soft sofa look someplace else. This is more about aesthetics than practicality.",

Just add a couple fof throw pillows and you're good to go. Not a bad deal for the price. Easy to put together (legs are underneath in zippered pouch).",
