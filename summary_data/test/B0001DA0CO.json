We were changing batteries every 30 pictures or so. With the Kodak we could take 250 - 300 pictures on a single set of batteries. I eventually retired the camera to one of our cars where it is useful for pictures while out on the road or in case of an accident. I replaced it with a Cannon that has 6mp and 12X optical zoom.",

This camera fit the bill....it's easy to use and takes great pictures. The only issues I've encountered are: (1) battery life is short (but increases if you turn off the LCD screen and use the viewfinder) (2) camera often \"freezes up\" and won't open in cold weather.",

Yes, it does have a tendency to overexpose, but it's no big deal for me to tweak the exposure. For the price, under 200, it's a real deal. The software is good too, and you don't need Kodak's overpriced dock..just the USB and their Easy Share CD.",

It lived a healthy, trouble free life of whopping seven years and captured thousands upon thousands of beautiful pictures. Overall, it was a very good, sturdy camera. The picture quality was on par with more recent cameras. The performance was rather amazing for outdoors but just okay under low light conditions. The battery life could have been better. The LCD screen was tiny but hey we are talking 2004 here. RIP CX7430!",

It has gotten wet several times also. I finally broke it for good when I dropped it from about 15 feet high onto a rock, and it exploded! I went out and got the same model and I will when it finally breaks again. It's my favorite camera ever. The close up mode is really handy too!!",
