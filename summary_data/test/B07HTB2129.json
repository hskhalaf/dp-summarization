Day 1 it was 60 and sunny and then we woke up day 2 with 5 inches of snow the next morning but were totally comfortable in this tent. Its a bit small for 3 people bit fit my girlfriend, dog, and I really comfortably with warmth and no issues at all. Will update as needed but overall very imoressed with this tent.",

I used it on a backpacking trip in Colorado above treeline (12,000ft) and it not only survived, but kept me perfectly dry during a 3 hour hail storm. I knocked a star off because the zipper on my fly bent a little bit causing it to either be really hard to zip or to unzip behind itself if you weren't careful. However I contacted the seller and they are sending me a new fly for free. Great customer service",

The included ground mat was a nice feature. The rain fly has a ton of tie-down locations (15 total stakes if you please). It kept the frost off of us through 2 nights in the low-20\u2019sF. Not a perfect score because the zipper seems cheap, the tent without the fly is basically worthless (almost all screen mesh) and it isn\u2019t the easiest to put up. It\u2019s great for the price though, and packs up lite and tight with everything in one bag.",

The outer canopy zipper is hard to reach from the inner tent because it sits so low. It would have been nice to have that zip up to close instead of zipping down. The construction seems sturdy.",

For the price, I'm pretty happy with it, the zippers were smooth, the air vents did a good job with very little condensation. Too early to tell if it's durable, if anything changes I'll be updating the review, hope to camp for about a week in Salt Lake in December.",
