I am a 31-year-old mom of 4 kids so I wanted something modest enough, but not too mature-looking. I love the high waist, which covers well, and the ruffle top is really nice. I will need to get another style of this suit, as it is a new favorite! I am 5'5 and 125lbs and bought the Medium which fits pretty true to size, a tad bit large, if anything.",

The top layer hung longer on one side. making is look funny any the bottoms fit wierd with that crocked pleat. overall the material was cheap as well. I will be returning it.",

It tucks away that lower post pregnancy belly that no amount of crunches can eliminage, and the ruffled top adds some volume on top. The best part is the bathing suit fit is really comfortable- no pinching squeezing edges that make you feel like a sausage. I normally wear a size 6 and this suit in Medium fit perfectly. I've only worn this a few times and have already received tons of compliments!!",

But I will say in most photos and even when you look at yourself in the mirror, the colors that you see in the ad picture is pretty much what you'll see. The only thing is that when you're looking down at the bathing suit, it will look differently to you. Idk how to really articulate it, I'll try posting a picture later. It's flattering, you can't really beat the price. I bought a large on top, my only complaint is that there's a lot of fabric up there and I found it more flattering when I tuck the sides in.",
