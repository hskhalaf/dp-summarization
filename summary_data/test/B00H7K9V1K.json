      "title": "Really Solid Draws",
      "text": "I decided to go with the Petzl draws over BD or any other brands because the biners seemed to be more fluid. The BD biners had a stickiness or heaviness to them that made it frustrating to clip the rope into (especially when you're a desperate climber like me...). These were also cheaper than the higher end BD draws, so overall just a solid option that you won't be bummed about adding to your rack.",

The gate action is very smooth and haven't had any issues feeding rope or webbing through. Very light and a great product in my opinion. Haven't had to take any falls on them yet, but they have held 500+ lbs statically for about 2 hours with no visible warping of the metal (obviously it would be hard to reach a critical weight on these regardless of what you are doing.).",
