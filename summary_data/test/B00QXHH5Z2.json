It is constantly just stopping mid-spin even when applying very little pressure, and then when it is spinning (even with a freshly switched out, new stone) it is not doing as good of a job as it had when first purchased. It was great while it lasted, but it did not last long. Original review: Perfect for pedicure night for the whole family of 3. Battery lasts for hours. User friendly and really makes your feet smooth as if you were at a professional spa. Reasonably priced.",
