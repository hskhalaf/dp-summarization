      "text": "These are very handy to have if you fabricate a lot. I use the in aluminum, and plastic. I'd use them in steel, but haven't found the need. These drill a hole, then thread it to the appropriate size immediately following the drill bit part. So it's a 2-fer, it definitely saves a lot of time from switching bits. They're sharp, and easy to use. Go slow, once the tap is doing it's thing, you can strip the threads by bottoming it out. Go slow, but if you looking at this, you know what yer doing. I'd recommend them for a bunch of reasons, not a grape bunch, more like a banana bunch.",
