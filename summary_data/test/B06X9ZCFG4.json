I tend to use higher end skincare like Sheseido, Exuvience, Clarins, etc. I am very impressed! I\u2019ve been using it for about 3 weeks now as my morning moisturizer. I have very dry skin and it has has never felt quite so moisturized. It feels smoother and very supple. It doesn\u2019t really have a smell which is nice. I will definitely repurchase this. I don\u2019t think you can find another $20 moisturizer with the generous amount of product that performs this well.",
