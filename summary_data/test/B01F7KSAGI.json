The hooks would be great to tie down a load in a pickup truck, but a plain strap would have been better for my purpose. The ratcheting instructions are appalling - it's not a language transation problem, because they're mostly diagrams, which are either misleading or plain wrong. Others may not have my problems, but I've never threaded a strap through a rachet before. I've only used ones that were already put together.

If you thread the strap properly and take a little care when ratcheting, there are no issues with tightening them and the straps don't seem to stretch significantly after tightening. I read a few of the people who had abrasion issues and those could be caused by not tightening the straps enough and having them rub on sharp corners. The straps themselves are not thick, but are as strong as advertised and will do the job if used properly and your load isn't allowed to shift around.",

There are TWO buttons to depress to unlatch it, and it takes a few times before you get this done smoothly. One of them, on the rotating barrel, is easier to deploy if you tighten the strap a quarter turn, then pull the tabs that release the \"paul\" that hold the barrel from rotating. This isn't a problem unless you've set the strap very tight and it's in a cramped spot that's hard to reach - easy lesson to learn and avoid the next time.",

If this had just been cheap, flimsy backing I would not have cared but as it is, I think it's wasteful.",

For the ratchet part of the strap if this would have been a bit longer it would have given us more flexibility as it\u2019s only about 5inches long. The tied down strap is super long and saved the day with its eye hole security configuration. All in all the straps held great once we found places to secure them too.",

      "text": "Purchasing transaction was smooth and trouble free. Product I received was what I ordered and I am grateful for the soft loop option as opposed to the bungees. Inspected all four straps and build quality looks to be good. I'll be securing a step latter in the bed of my truck so I can climb up with a tree-trimming chain saw and clear branches hanging into out lane, so I'll let you know if any of them break! I know ... stupid man trick that leads to fatal accident ... but it seems so simple! I'll return and lower the stars if I discover any manufacturing defects. Otherwise, I'm feeling pretty good about this purchase.",

I had to simply run the strap around and \"double the strap\" to hold the furniture. If there had been hooks in the Uhaul, this would not have been an issue. Would buy again.",
