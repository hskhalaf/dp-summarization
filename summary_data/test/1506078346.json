The book contains all of 300 Hours' \"analytics, conclusions and learnings\" from a large sample of exam results, focusing on areas such as the make up of each of the CFA exams and which topics to focus on, to how much practice each student should be prepared to do in hopes of being successful. I am sure that this update only brings more helpful insights. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about successfully completing the CFA program.",
