The one nice feature is the suction cup on the bottom that holds it fairly secure in place. With all of the positive reviews on this one, I was really hoping for more.",

It is made of flimzy plastic, difficult to turn the handle. I worked way too hard for what I was left with. Plus, with all veggies, you are left with half of it, in a long cylinder shape. No way to chop/slice to match the curly ones. Very dissappointed. Now, I am having difficulty attempting to return it.",

Once that happens, the device is nearly impossible to use. I would gladly pay more for this device, only with a high-quality silicon rubber suction cup which remains pliable and functional.

I hauled it out, rinsed it off, popped a zucchini into it with a 5mm blade, spun the handle a few times, and I had perfect spirals for they dehydrator. Unlike my mixer, which also has a spiralizer, it is light weight, and using the suction cup on the right surface, it doesn't budge. I can see myself using this gadget quite a bit this summer!",

You're starting with the best. (Only reason it's not a 5-star is because it tends to stain easily.

I just saute\u0301ed them in olive oil with some Italian herbs for 2-3 minutes, and topped them with some grated cheese. Wonderful product for anyone who grows their own zucchini!",

Also I like easy to clean appliances and this fit the bill. I highly recommend",

It remains secure and doesn't feel like it is unstable or unbalanced. We have used it so far for carrots, zucchini,onions, and jicama. Being able to spiralize veggies gives you texture alternatives from the usual chopped salad components. I am completely satisfied with this product so far. I would recommend this product to my friends and family without feeling like I embellished the capabilities of this handy kitchen tool.",

I like to saute mine just a bit (to keep some crunch) and then put them in a clean dish towel and squeeze squeeze squeeze! Otherwise, they tend to water down yours sauce. They are actually just as good raw. I'll be testing that theory again tonight with zoodles and meatballs.",
