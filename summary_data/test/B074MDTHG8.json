Most light braces provide support on bottom of the wrist but not the top...this one stabilized really well with supports on both sides. The only (and fairly major) issue I have is the design of the thumb area. The border around the hole you put your thumb through is neither padded or flat, so it digs into the connective tissue between the thumb and index finger. I've started wearing a band-aid on that part of my hand to help when I'm wearing the brace but that's obviously not ideal. I ordered the L/XL, which I believe to be the correct size for my hand.
