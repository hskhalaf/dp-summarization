I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that this does not seem like a 3/4th size guitar, seems maybe smaller, but, I like the size. The action is great out of the box. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that this guitar projects and resonates lower tones a lot better than you would think it would due to its size. A fun, portable, easy to play guitar with some nice tones that has now taken up permanent residence next to my tv room chair. Great job by Yamaha (as usual)!",

Going from a kids department store acoustic guitar to the Yamaha is like going from a toy guitar to an instrument you could use in at music lessons, recital, campfire ect.

The play is easy. You don't have to press down real hard to finger chords. The sound is nice. It keeps tune if you tighten it up a bit. The craftmanship is acceptable. I had to adjust it because the low E was rattling. But, if you are just learning, a little rattle isn't a bad thing. You'll eventually learn some good chords and upgrade to a better guitar.",

I have no complaints about quality. I especially like how the size is reduced enough for a kid, but still very playable for an adult. I've enjoyed getting back into it as much as he is learning fresh. If you're new to guitars you won't be disappointed. If you're an experienced musician, you probably aren't reading this review...",
