I do like the steel blade, but haven't tried it on ice, but it did work just fine on car tire compacted snow. After the third use, some snow did start sticking to the shovel. I sprayed it with PAM and I'm sure that won't be a problem again.",

We have camphor trees surrounding our house and have a huge amount of leaves to scoop up. This shovel works great! I use it to push and scoop up the leaves that are in the road as well as to scoop up the leaves after I rake or blow the yard. Makes the job so much easier. This seems to be a pretty sturdy shovel. I wasn't sure I would like a plastic one as I've always had aluminum so we'll see how many years it holds up.",
