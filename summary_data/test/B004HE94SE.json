      "text": "Bought on recommendation of massage therapist who works in coordination with bio-mechanic physician in the same office. My consistent shoe size, per Nordstroms and Red Wing Shoes, is Men's 10B. I've worn & loved Ecco's for years, but was just diagnosed w/bunions! I'm very athletic, but apparently, my posture and mechanics have been improper. First use of Yoga Toes resulted in immediate short-term pain in one bunion, but that dissipated completely after 5-10 minutes. My feet definitely feel better and I can feel the realignment slowly taking place in my toes.",

YogaToes are soft and shaped well - easy to walk around the house. They feel good while wearing them, but more importantly, they help me remember to stretch my toes throughout the day. All of this leads to the best part: my heels don't hurt all the time; sure in the morning or if I've been sitting for an extended time. But, I'm so grateful for some relief! These are worth every penny!",

I wear them few times a week for 15 mins during the day and once a week I put them during the night all night. They relief the pain and keep my toes straight. Best product ever. I suggest it and for the people with no bunion issue as it can be used as prevention, especially for women who are used to wear high heels.",

I've tried cheaper alternatives, including similar silicone toe separators, toe separator socks, but none of them work quite as well to give your toes that real stretch. YogaToes have a wider separation between each toe, so for someone like me with long toes, this does a much better job at stretching and relieving the ache from having your toes scrunched up in shoes all day. It's worth to spend a little extra for these!",
