This fits perfectly under the edge of the kitchen base cabinets and won't scuff or scratch my new cabinetry. I've had many vacuums but this little shark is amongst the best I've ever had. Big expensive vacuums wouldn't lift sock lint from my weaved pattern carpet, no problem with my new Shark. The dirt canister isn't very large so emptying every other time may be needed. It also doesn't have a retractable cord but no problem for me. The cord is nice and long too.",

I clean houses and my customers that have Sharks love them. I also volunteer at a cat adoption center with carpet. The Shark we use there has been used twice a day everyday vacuuming up cat hair and litter for over a year now and it is still going strong. I choose this model because it is lightweight as I am used to using an 8lb. Oreck and wanted something close to that weight. I would highly recommend this vacuum.",

I realize I didn\u2019t pay very much for it, but I paid $40 for an Eureka Vacuum Cleaner for my sons apartment and 5 yrs later, it\u2019s still going strong. Terrible purchase.",

This is super light, easy to navigate with, and picks up the mess well. Not needing bags is a major plus, and it's not so hard to clean out the bin. I have to admit, the instructions were too much for me; I usually do read the manual before using something, but on this I was too impatient. As a result...I am still a little lost on how to do things, and how to use all its features. When I have a chance, I definitely will spend some time on youtube or reading the actual manual.",

We have 2 dogs (one of them has an unearthly amount of hair that he sheds) and this product does a great job at picking up all the dog hair on both hardwood and carpet. It\u2019s lightweight, the container is easy to empty, and it\u2019s not as loud as my last vacuum. All around win. Only complaint it the hose is a little short and doesn\u2019t extend very long.",

Has alot of suction and feels like its on ball bearings with brushroll on for carpet. Does a fine job on bare floor also, brushroll on or off. This doesnt feel flimsy and empties much easier then a dyson. It does not lift off so vacuuming under beds is not possible. There is no light or swivel head, but that doesnt bother me much. We just wanted an everyday lightweight vac we can throw around, it has met every goal! For the 89 bucks it cost me, i feel its much better then the 300plus canister vacs we've had!",
