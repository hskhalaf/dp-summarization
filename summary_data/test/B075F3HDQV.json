Its not a lot but enough to piss you off.",

It is so small, yet makes 12 cups of coffee and has the timer feature, which we use every day! PERFECT!!! We did remove the \"permanent\"filter and use #4 cone filters instead. (The hassle of dumping the grounds out and rinsing the filter got old fast.) Would definitely recommend it!!",
