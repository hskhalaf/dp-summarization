      "title": "ALMOST PERFECT",
      "text": "The battery life on the LG gram was a little over 11 hours when the computer was new, four months ago. It is now down to less than 7 hours of actual running time on a full charge. This is a great disappointment since the computer was advertised as having up to 21 hours on a single charge. Update as of August 14, 2020, about 9 months after purchase. The computer was sent back to LG for service, and after six weeks of waiting, it's now even more disappointing. The 7 hours of runtime has not changed., and may have even dropped further. Either they did nothing, or the computer inherently has this level performance.",

For the price of this laptop, you'd think there would be exceptional sound quality but not so much. Sad to say, but my iPad sound is much better than this. Sorry LG, but I will be returning for a refund and trying some of your less expensive competitor models.",
