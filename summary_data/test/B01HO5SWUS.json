There is a flow to the glitters and the shimmer radiates off the walls ever so slightly. It's beautiful. I would definitely recommend.",

I mean you can get them for a dollar for 2 but I clicked the turn roller thing to turn it on one too many times and it blew the bulb, another time it fell over and it blew. Other lava lamp never a problem so beware of frequent bulb replacements but super inexpensive to buy!",

This is my first time owning a lava lamp and I love it. A couple of notes, however. This particular lamp gets pretty hot so I would suggest plugging directly into the wall outlet unless you have a heavy duty strip handy. And I would not recommend leaving unattended either because of its heat generation. Other than that, I love the quality and weight of this item but only time will tell how deep the quality will go.

      "text": "i settled on a glitter lamp because all the lava lamps on here seem to have problems according to reviewers. but i'm pleasantly surprised by this. it gives off less light than i was anticipating, but as a decorative piece it's awesome. I didn't think i would like the rainbow-colored sparkles, but they actually add so much more visual interest. you can see all the colors really well. it's nice and it glitters and leaves cool projections on the wall....pretty sick",
