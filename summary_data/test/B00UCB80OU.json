I've had it a couple years and it developed holes in the netting. I sent an e-mail to the company asking what was needed to obtain a replacement under warranty. They replied that they needed the invoice and pictures of the damage. I sent those. But now, I cannot get a response and its been 3 weeks. I guess they don't think people will actually use the warranty. I will change my review if I ever hear from FibroPool.",

      "text": "Bought this in May 2016. Worked really well on bottom leaves, debris with the lip configuration. If you slide it along the bottom, step, etc. then stop just at the pile, the lip generates a good current that lifts the debris and it goes right into the net as you continue. The lip also hugs the bottom so most goes right in. Had an issue after over 2.5 years with some tears in the net. Contacted seller, received an immediate response asking for the order number, provided it, and received an immediate response that my new net is on the way. Very pleased with the product and the service. So few stand behind their products in this day.",

Normal wear and tear and the NET portion of the leaf rake are specifically Excluded from coverage. So, while it's not as good a value as I was initially led to believe, it is a sturdy looking net and hopefully will last a while.",

We have been able to literally clean out all of the leaves within 10 mins!!! I mean ALL the leaves that have been falling over these few months.
