My guests kept complaining to me that it was difficult to press the dispenser with the cup and if they used their fingers, they would burn themselves! I had to have a glass mug to dispense the coffee and then serve from mug to styrofoam cups. The coffeemaker did brew great coffee and it did maintain its temperature but the one-hand feature is not practical if you can't use styrofoam cups.",

It works for coffee, of course, but I already had a coffee maker that is better looking than this one. So now I have a duplicate appliance.

    "title": "Hamilton Beach 40540 Brew Station 40-Cup Coffee Urn, Silver,Medium",
    "description": "The Hamilton Beach BrewStation 40 Cup urn offers one-hand dispensing, so there is no need to put down a buffet or party plate to fill up a cup of coffee. In a busy buffet line, that means cups can be filled faster, saving time and reducing crowding. Disposable cups are never a problem, either - the dispensing button was designed to work with foam as well as classic ceramic cups. For added convenience, the dispensing area has a higher cup clearance than most urns and the drip tray removes for easy cleaning. The last drops of a 40-cup coffee urn have rarely tasted as good until now. In the BrewStation urn, a powerful center heater brews the entire tank quickly (45 seconds per cup versus the normal 60 seconds). Once brewed, the center heater shuts down and a gentle, keep-warm heater maintains a perfect temperature without scorching the coffee. Coffee tastes great longer, from the first cup to the last.",
