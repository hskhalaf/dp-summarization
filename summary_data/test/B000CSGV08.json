It makes no sense to use cheaply made filters of low to zero quality on expensive equipment that makes you money. Take all the other filters apart alongside the same in WIX for any application and you will see what I'm talking about. WIX is simply the best and highest quality filter that you can buy at any price. I also use WIX on our cars.",
