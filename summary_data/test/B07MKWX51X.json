Some balloons were broken and others covered in a brown dust which I highly doubt is latex. Thank goodness I purchased them ahead of time because I\u2019m returning them right away.",

The only balloons that popped were those that my young son filled too much air with (so not the product fault)! The colors are bright (see pictures). At the end of the party all the kids stayed to play with them, held really really well.",

Never thought quality control would be an issue on something as simple as a latex balloon, but I guess that's why there are certain things you shouldn't buy online.

This ain't rocket science! Only a little less inflation, and you'll have much thicker/more durable balloons. I'm very happy with them.
