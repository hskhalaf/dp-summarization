      "text": "We initially bought a queen for a guest bedroom, and every guest we've had had loved the bed. We also have slept on it for several nights because our main king-sized bed started sinking on one side (I am 130lbs, and my husband is 170lbs). Mind you, we spent $1,500 on that bed. Only lasted a couple years before it began losing firmness. Very disappointing when one spends that kind of money on something for it to start failing within the first couple years of use. Super happy with our purchase--it was actually cheaper than the queen for the king when we purchased it via LinenSpa and not Amazon (more than likely because of shipping costs).",

The gel definitely spreads out the heat...we live in FL...so overheating \"in\" a memory foam mattress is a real issue. Seems to be holding up pretty well...some of these tend to make \"canoes\" where you sleep since you can't flip these mattresses...only spin them. The cover is comfortable and quiet...our last foam mattress the cover had to be replaced...noisy when turning over in bed. Did not notice any objectionable odor on opening the compressed packaging. Did wait a couple of days before using it the first time so it would have plenty/extra time to expand and stabilize. Would buy another one of these for sure.",

While they are a little heavy, this mattress was perfect for our needs. It was a medium thickness and I think over time, it is a good idea to rotate the mattress to keep the foam from sagging in the area where you sleep often. While you can't flip it because it's one-sided, rotating it has helped the thickness maintain shape. Worth the price. I think if we replace it, we'll get a firmer one. But it's still comfortable",

The only downside is that after awhile it does begin to sag where you sleep and has become a bit hard to get out of without having to roll yourself out. It also gets very hard when its cold, however I assume most mattresses made from the same materials are like this. After a few minutes in bed it usually warms up and softens with your body heat.",

Arrived in a medium sized box - perhaps about the same size as a decent sized Christmas tree box. My husband remarked that he liked this mattress better than his parents' $10,000 memory foam mattress. I have to agree. Overall we are very pleased. Hope that this company stands true to their warranty should we ever need to access that option. (Hope we never do!)",

We have an adjustable bed, which raised our platform bed higher than I would like. I also wanted a firm mattress. This is indeed firm (not as firm as the \"Americana\" from Amerisleep, but with $750 price difference, I am willing to give up a tiny bit of firmness). If you are looking for a soft to medium-firm, don't get this mattress! But if you are looking for medium-firm to firm, absolutely. It's fabulous ... I can't believe what a great price this one is. It seems to keep reasonably cool and we are very, very happy with it! High recommend.",
