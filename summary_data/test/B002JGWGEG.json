Assembly is trivial. Box was pretty beaten up, but no damage to the stand itself. Will very likely buy another soon to use as an infeed support for my planer.",

They would tip over, turn at an angle and make life cutting 3/4\"x4'x8' sheets of plywood a very dangerous activity. This stand does not move unexpectedly and makes me happy and safer. I highly recommend.",

If there is a downside, it is that adjustments require the use of a hex wrench (included). This is not a negative for me, since I will only be using the stand with one saw. Bottom line is that I would buy it again and am considering getting a second stand.",

Many others complain about the allen wrench and losing it. I think thats a pretty petty thing to whine about. Easy enough to get a holding strap or even Velcro and attach it to the stand. I doubt anyone is going to be changing the height 15 times a day. Good price on a really good product. Thanks Vestil! Nice to be able to give a 5 star rating on a product these days.",
