Revised: The customer service people contacted me to verify what was happening, they were very concerned about any quality issues. I mentioned what happened and they offered immediately a replacement and speak with their factories to make sure this won't happen again. I really appreciate the companies that take customer's opinion seriously. Thanks a lot to Coolife for this beautiful bag :)",

We travel a TON for work, internationally and domestically, these have held up beautifully through Europe, the UK, and cross-country so far. Looking forward to many trips with these pieces. Love how they fit inside one another, which is especially convenient for packing items that were shipped to a venue that need to be brought back. Wheels have been resilient against cobblestone driveways and other, more conventional terrain. Some slight scuffs have surfaced but nothing out of the ordinary. We pack these to the max and are definitely satisfied with their performance so far.",

The manufacturer says that you can under pack it to meet requirements, but I have the bag about 3/4 full and it does not meet requirements. I even tried a luggage strap to squeeze it tighter but the frame structure of the bag still exceeds the limits. I am very disappointed as I wanted a carry on for my trip to italy. I leave tomorrow so there is no time to find another bag.",
