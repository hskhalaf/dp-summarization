We are now on the polishing phase and cannot wait to see the end result. We highly recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing a rock tumbler. It has actually been fun for the whole family.",

I do have to use a spare drive belt around one end of the jar so it doesn't drag but that's minor and they're cheap to replace.

This model has a better lid and is much quieter. I also prefer the way the tumbler just sits on top of the rollers as opposed to the old one where you had to position two pegs on the end of the tumbler into slots. One peg finally wore down and the barrel was then too short and I had to throw it away. This model also has a timer so you can set it for your desired tumble time.",

Only downside I have so far, is the machine doesn\u2019t allow you to dial in more than 7 days, so at the end of those 7 days, you have to add 7 more days. This is for the primary cycle.
