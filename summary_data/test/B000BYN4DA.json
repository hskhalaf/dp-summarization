They are not sharp at all so you can hold by the blade and throw. The weight helps them stick good and balance is just right.",

Also the quality of the leather seems pretty cheap to me. So if it isn't functional or aesthetically pleasing, what good is it? I'm very new to throwing, but these require a lot more finesse than the other knives I have.",

They have a fair amount of weight to them so throwing them can be a workout for your arm especially since the blade is thicker so in order to get it to penetrate a target you need to put more power into your throws but since it is heavier and well balanced it is still easy to control the spin when you are throwing.",

Also, the rotation is different from my other throwing knives. I have to stand in a different spot and almost chuck them at the board and still, they fall out a lot.",
