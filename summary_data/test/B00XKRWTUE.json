The battery can last much longer if you disable GPS and Bluetooth. With those services activated, it last 1 week. Without those, almost 3. If you measure the ditances in meters, be carefull in set meters as you default unit. And in the watch you have to modify the mile unit because after you set to meters, it keeps recording in miles. On minor thing: the screen is not that bright as it shows the picture, but you can read it perfectly in daylight and during the night.",

I own two of these and heart rate is totally different results between them even when worn at the same time. Not at all worth the price. Even though it is water proof, as stated earlier, if it gets wet on the back, heart rate reading is worthless.",

In the big picture I gave it 4 stars because the garmin app and software, in my opinion, is not easy to use. I don't like it. And I don't think Garmin has a very consumer-friendly approach to their software.....more interested in making $$$ than making sure their customers can use their products with various apps/across the board.",

One thing that surprised me was that I'd thought that I would miss the touch screen. I DO NOT!!! In fact, I love that it is not a touch screen watch!!! It is far easier to operate and does not inadvertently activate or change screens. I cannot recommend this watch highly enough. If I lost it today, I would replace it immediately.",

Heart rate is pretty accurate and I haven't gotten a rash on my wrist like I did with the Fitbit Surge. Also resists moister much better than the Fitbit or Apple iWatch. The reason for the 4 stars is because it lacks a cycling feature (I wouldn't care if it was a basic one) and if you're not careful, you can accidentally pause your workouts with the red button. A screen lock feature would be great, hopefully Garmin pushes one in their next firmware update.",
