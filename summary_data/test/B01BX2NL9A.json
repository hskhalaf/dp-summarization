The metal sides are a nice touch but it still works best if you put it on a baking pan because it isn't actually sturdy. You also need to be careful not to use a sharp knife to cut your finished baked item if you leave it in the pan because it would probably cut through the silicone. I have used it twice now and had good results. I really wish they would include some sort of directions with it but there were none that I saw.",
