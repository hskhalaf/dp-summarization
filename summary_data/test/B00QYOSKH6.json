Giving the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt I purchased a second one. Again, I was pleased but, it also stopped working in very short order. The mechanism that engages with the battery when you twist the shaft broke for a second time. So... a nice functional device. Not a problem if you don't mind replacing it every very few weeks. Don't buy. Phillips quality control is M.I.A.",

I bought this at the end of January the 28th to be exact, again after using it once a week with light service I only got about 48 days which translates to actually 12 times of use. What a piece of JUNK. Don't buy find something else. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY",

You have to spend at least 2-3 minutes on each nostril to get all the hair down to the skin. I have to stick it pretty far up. It tickles a lot so gets the mucus running for me. Make sure you clean the trimmer very well after use, or the hair and mucus drying up inside the trimmer head will make it not function. Read the directions, people! It's pretty small, has no cord, and is lightweight - everything I wanted in a trimmer. Love it and love breathing much easier!",

It has worked surprisingly well! I know it won't last forever, but it is cheap enough that I won't mind having to update it periodically. Highly recommended!",
