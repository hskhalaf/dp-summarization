All of a sudden all those photos I printed on the 760 looked dead and lifeless. You practically need a magnifing glass to see the pixcelation with the R320. Ink seems steep, but it is worth it. I actually bought another USB cable and hooked my 760 up for non photo printing.",

      "text": "I did NOT like the quality of photos that were printed on this machine. I returned this item and bought an HP 7760 photosmart (which was cheaper). I printed the exact same picture on the HP that I had printed on the Epson R320. There was a HUGH difference!! The Epson picture was grainy with a reddish tint to the photo. The HP photo was perfect. I would suggest foregoing the \"novelty\" of printing a label on a disk in exchange for better quality photos....which is what a printer is for.",

At Office Depot I recently paid $110 just for the ink. Once the ink runs out this time its going in the trash.",
