As some of the previous reviewers stated, the antenna design on this amped wireless router is not the best. They are very delicate and poorly made. Good thing that I follow instructions as it is a bit tricky putting together. Range is nowhere near what is advertised, in fact the netgear FVG 318 actually had a very similar range if not a bit better. On the good side, customer service was very responsive and did send me out a new set of antennas to try to improve the signal range. All in all however, it was not a good purchase.",

I had to turn down the signal power in the Dashboard (very easy to do btw). You can set up 8 guest networks as well. Well worth the price!",
