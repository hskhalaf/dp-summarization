Basil is my absolute favorite scent; so much so that I have even used the hand lotion as a body lotion. Ha! The Honeysuckle, Geranium, and Lavender are also great. Gosh, I have ZERO bad things to say about this brand! The laundry soap in specific cleans so well! I've never had any issues with it. It also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and keeps the scent well (but it does help if you have the \"matching\" scent of the dryer sheets). --For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram--",
