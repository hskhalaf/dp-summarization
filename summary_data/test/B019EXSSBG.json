Thankfully modern CPUs aren\u2019t as sensitive to these sort of things and there hasn\u2019t been any damage, but once again I find myself without a functioning PC.

It even has high quality thermal paste pre-applied. The biggest note I would make to the amateur builder, is to be sure that you either plug the USB Micro cable in BEFORE installing, or position it over your CPU so that you can reach it. Otherwise you'll need to reinstall it.",

I have not experienced any leaks or malfunctions of any kind, and the pump and fans are really quiet. Overall this is very good cooler and I would definitely recommend.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.",

      "text": "This cooler does a very good job at cooling my Intel Core i7 8700k with temps averaging low 50's and on some games the low 60's. The reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 is because of the iCue software, I've been stuck running this thing on quite mode so I cant even get the lowest temps because everytime I back out of the iCue software it automatically resets the setting to quiet mode instead of extreme where I set it, even the a custom profile wont stay saved so I gave up since temps stay comfortable until my cpu hits 100 percent usage but that never happens in games anyways.",
