I am surprised how brittle and weak the plastic is and how it snapped. I would not recommend this to any run and gun shooters. I think the design is way too fragile. Sound quality was not bad at all, but durability is lacking. Looked on their site for a replacement part, but it doesn't look like they sell new arms. Maybe I can superglue it.",

I like the Shure is smaller made of metal vs plastic even the Fuzzy windscreen fits better. This is made in China vs the other Australia. Pricing a a little less but with the attached Fuzz / dead-cat this is has a more expensive total. I thing worth it.",
