At first I was annoyed when the blue rubber seal stuck to the container rather than the lid (which can make for a mess if you have something saucey). But I actually appreciate when it comes to cleaning and sterilizing. Because the seal comes out, you can make sure all the sauce, juice, or salad dressing is cleaned out and will not taint the next thing you put in there. Overall, great value for the price. It was professionally wrapped in a branded box that arrived in an Amazon box. I was not paid or compensated for this review - products were bought by myself.",

Very convenient, as I didn't want to have to pack up and return the entire set just to address one little chip. My old set did get a over the years, but it is fairly easy to sand the edges to make re-usable. I just didn't want to start anew with a chipped set!",

I would like to get a couple of even larger sizes if I can find them! This glass won't crack as my plastic containers did (unless I happen to drop!). An interlocking system between the bottom of a container and the lid of another, so they would stack more securely, would be REALLY NICE.",

Regardless, tiny pieces of glass on the floor or on the countertop or inside the container aren't a risk I am willing to take. I am giving these one star only because of the brittleness of the glass.

Perhaps a small dot or the letters UR so that we wouldn't have to be trying different ways to make the lids fit better. Once you find the right way to cover the dish, it's great.",
