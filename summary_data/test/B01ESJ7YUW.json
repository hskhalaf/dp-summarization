We probably have enough room underneath for a 3rd person to also be covered. I plan on buying a second one just like it to keep in my car, when I have the money.

Your bag or backside will remain completely dry. Has a nice little strap to carry over your body/shoulder and it's easy to fold up and unfold and has two velcro strands to make it nice and compact.

This one keeps me dry and another person can fit under it comfortably. When closed it's very long but I knew that going in. If it didn't arrive broken I'd be 5 star easy.",

I bought the 54\" option and am happy with the size. It should serve its purpose on the golf course but at the same time not be obnoxiously big if I want to use it around town or in the city. The trade-off for buying a sturdy umbrella is that it's a bit heavier than typical umbrellas, but I don't find the slight additional weight to be a deal breaker.",

I have had this for just over a month (3 days past the return date) and one of the tops of the umbrella has just detached today. Overall I like the umbrella so I'm hoping it's simply a defective one. I'm also hoping the company will still replace. Update (3/13/17): The company sent me out a (new) replacement umbrella (about a month ago), due to the first one being defective. They were very nice and provided great customer service. So far the replacement hasn't had any issues.",

I live in Chicago, however, and if you want to stay dry in this rain, you need the widest cover you can get. The only issue when it's this large is that the stem is extremely long, so it ends up being most practical to hold it several inches above the handle, which isn't ideal. Hardly a big issue though. Would definitely recommend.",

Unfortunately, I wouldn't call this umbrella \"windproof.\" It can be easily assembled after becoming tangled from a moderate storm, but if it's really coming down with heavy winds the snap the innards of the umbrella like a twig. If you are from a windy area, this is great for a light drizzle. But don't expect it to hold up under reasonable winds. Note: I trashed the broken umbrellas and just bought new ones when the wind damage made repairs impossible. I can't speak to the money back guarantee claim.",

It would be helpful to have a curved or more ergonomic handle. Otherwise, really happy with this purchase.",
