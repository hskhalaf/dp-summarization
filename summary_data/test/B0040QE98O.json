I've was also very disappointed when I received the last 3 Revues I ordered. They were used, and supposed to be in \"very good condition\" but when I received them they were literally taped together with double side foam tape, and I could clearly see that they had not been stored properly.

The interface for live TV is much more intuitive and easy than the typical cable guide. But it still can't serve as a full replacement for cable or satellite because of content limitations. Once Google is successful in negotiating content licenses from the major studios, it will be well worth 5 stars. In the meantime, with the upcoming upgrade to the OS and the expansion of apps available on the platform, it will still be a game-changing device, bringing television and computer even closer together.",

      "text": "Huge fan of the Logitech Revue. Initial sales were bleak, so I was able to buy it at a prime price of <100. Unfortunately, Google is doing some strange things these days to trim their once expansive ecosystem. Recent update to GTV native Chrome browser has removed Flash support from the device. Consequently, I can no longer watch HBOGo on my unit which is a HUGE disappointment. Otherwise, still a viable device - albeit limited app potential. Google Market/Play Store still has highly limited apps available...but some of the native integration apps for streaming media from a PC through GTV are quite nice. Could be a lot better though - implementation over time seems to be short-sighted.",

Recently they released a new software update and we had a little trouble with it then but it has since cleared up. I love being able to browse the Internet from the TV along with all the other great features such as Pandora. The mouse/keyboard is also designed very nicely and is easy to use.",

I understand Logitech just jettisoned the product, which is too bad. The original $300 price tag was probably optimistic for a BETA level product. I am not really concerned about lack of support, as it is a solid state box, and the future will lie more with Google than the box maker. There is a TON of content beyond what I get with my FIOS (which is now much easier to sort through than with the default Verizon guide.) For $99, this was a bargain.

Recently we've been having hdmi signal problems while watching satellite TV. The hi-def channels would have sound problems until we left the current channel and then returned.

I have not encountered anything that is bothersome about the interface yet, and there is an update being pushed out sometime soon, so I won't comment on that. The picture quality is very good. My only thing is that I want to see Hulu content on there. Then I'd give it 5 stars. The continuing addition of content will keep this product improving.",

      "text": "Overall the concept of this product is good, but the wifi receiver is terrible. I have a very fast internet connection and a decent router, but this device keeps dropping the connection when I watch Netflix. I have to constantly reboot the device. I called Logitech customer service twice and their advice did not solve the problem--frustrating!!! This is annoying because this is the main reason for the purchase.",

Cons: Having very limited internal memory, no power off option/switch on the device, temporarily internet connection drop (when not in use), having android 3.1 but market place is very limited in terms of number of apps available for this product, not supported the Skype which is more common free video call standard now, to install applications consecutively need to power off system as many times as many application we want to install. Verdict: at 99 USD, this product worth to buy, easy in use and overall serve it's intended purpose well",
