With so many digital games, it\u2019s nice to actually create something tangible. Hope they make more of these Labo kits.",

I\u2019ll update again once we\u2019ve done the rest. Definitely a team effort with a six year old to avoid damaging the cardboard during assembly. I hope they release the blueprints so more durable versions could be made if desired, although no issues yet! Tip: Watch the fishing lesson in \"Discovery\" to learn how to catch bigger fish.",

Some of the sets he put together a couple of months ago are coming apart now though. Even not being used that much, the little tape with sensors is just coming off of the cardboard. There are a lot of small pieces to keep together too, until all sets are assembled. My nine year old really enjoys the Nintendo Labo concept.",

He had to use both motor skills and his mind to get the task completed. Thanks Nintendo!",

In a time when all kids want to do is play video games, this is an excellent hybrid - it involves using the Nintendo Switch (video games) BUT it also combines building a hands-on project which helps kids work on developing their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, spatial reasoning and creative thinking to name a few.

That has more to do with his tendency to not clean up after himself then it does the product because I don't see a way around that. Part of punching out the pieces is the fun.

It is appropriate for all ages but not recommended for young kids because it is easy to break and not waterproof. I would recommend it because labo has lots of different varieties of kits. For example, some things you get in this kit are a fishing rod and a piano.",
