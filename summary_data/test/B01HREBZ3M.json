The pockets are great for parts as well and the 1x1 grid is nice for taking pictures or quick size estimates.",

I can pair this with a simple saw horse and support a large 4x8 sheet of plywood by using the 2x4 holders when it is partially closed! True ingenuity!",

It comes with 2 clamps that slide into the built in tracks. And it is strong. I am a heavy guy and can stand on it, no problem. so you can definitely put heavy stuff on it. Just a great compact work surface to whip out and use to assemble or fix stuff.",

These work tables are heavy duty. They work for all applications. Top surface has pockets for screws, etc. that one can use or not.",

After trying this for a couple of days I purchased a 2nd unit.",

The table seems very solid, and once you hold everything up, it locks into place and has absolutely no give. Have not had an opportunity to really put it through its paces yet, but just using it as a table, it seems just fine.",

    "description": "Style:Table&Sawhorse w/Clamps&Holding PegsTake on your favorite projects in whole new way with the innovative WORX Pegasus. The Pegasus is a versatile work station that converts from a table to a sawhorse in seconds. It can be joined with other Pegasus tables to create a larger work surface and includes a dual clamping system to hold any object securely in place. As a worktable, the Pegasus offers a 31\u201d x 25\u201d surface capable of supporting up to 300 lbs.; the unique link-lock system ensures your Pegasus table will hold heavier materials without buckling or folding. Two quick-adjusting bar clamps slide along the built-in tabletop channels and act like a second set of hands to hold straight-edged materials in place for cutting, gluing, painting, varnishing and any other DIY tasks. Four holding pegs (we call \u2018em clamp dogs) can be rearranged across the tabletop to secure rounded or irregularly shaped objects. You can also remove the clamps and simply fold down the sides of the Pegasus for a sturdy sawhorse that can support up to 1,000 lbs. In sawhorse mode, the Pegasus has indentation wells designed to help hold a standard 2x4 steady so you can work more safely and easily. The Pegasus compact and lightweight design means you can take it anywhere. A built-in lower shelf holds tools and a power strip to keep everything easily accessible, organized and out of the way. When you\u2019re done for the day, the Pegasus folds flat for easy storage\u2014perfect for those with a smaller workspace or garage. Whether you\u2019re a DIY lover, a crafter, or a woodworker, the WORX Pegasus is the perfect companion for every project on your list. Collapsible workbench design",
