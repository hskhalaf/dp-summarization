You will need the bridge for these switches to work but you can connect almost unlimited switches and plugs to the bridge. Very easy to setup and also can connect to the Amazon Echo. Going to get a few more for some of the other lights. It has a setable timer to come on and go off at a preset time or at dusk and dawn. Also has a random setting for vacation to make it look like someone is home.",

We love the theater dimming when you turn the light off and the green light on the side of the dimmer switches to let you know a light is on- this is helpful for porch lights, outdoor lights, etc. Overall, it's worth the price for the security of random timed light control.",

You can even use the Pico remote to control the lights from your car as you arrive home.
