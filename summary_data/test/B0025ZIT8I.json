Big enough to wear cotton gloves under. Soft enough so you can move fingers well. Will be doing a update on these gloves in a few weeks. Don't think these gloves will disappoint. Update.....I've had these gloves for few months and use them almost everyday for magnet fishing. Great gloves. Super strong. No holes yet. Still 100 percent waterproof.",

Very impressed with thickness and flexibility of them, they are very comfortable to wear for an entire shift without getting too hot. The fact that they are an American made product at such a reasonable price made this choice a no-brainer for me. Will definitely be ordering more in the near future. Added more of these to our inventory of supplies for new crew members. Price went up $2, but still a great bargain for an American product of this quality.",
