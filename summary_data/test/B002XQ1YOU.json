I buy 2 bottles at a time and will be very sad when I can no longer find it. :( It's been discontinued, so it's like my personal sexy fragrance that most don't have access to or even know of. I always get smiles and you smell good remarks from people I stand in line with. My fiance' will nuzzle his nose all around my neck to smell it and always comments on how delicious I smell. I have a girlfriend who always wants to use it when she's at my house. I just recently gave her a bottle and she thanked me profusely. It is a beautiful, light fragrance.",

YES, it smells of alcohol when you first spray it, however, the scent isn\u2019t compromised too bad and does seem to last a few hours. I still get followed and stalked to know what scent I\u2019m wearing. So if you\u2019re a snob like me, you\u2019ll pay the price but if you\u2019re looking to smell REAL good on a budget, this is it baby! It\u2019s a solid 3 out of 5.

    "description": "Size:3.4 OunceVersace Versense Perfume by Versace, Versace Versense is a unique and exciting perfume for women, released in 2009 . The blend is comprised of natural components that are meant to evoke the Mediterranean with each spray. The fragrance opens with notes of tangy green mandarin, lemony bergamot and the aromatic warmth of fig zest. The perfume\u2019s middle notes include sea lily, floral jasmine petals and peppery cardamom. Rounding out the scent are the woody and earthy notes of cedar wood, olive wood, sandalwood and musk. Long-standing and beloved haute couture and lifestyle brand Versace is the maker of this scent along with 56 others in its fragrance line, the first of which was launched in 1981. The fragrance itself is pale green, perhaps to bring to mind the verdant essences of nature that have combined to create this special scent. The bottle is clear glass emblazoned with the brand\u2019s legendary seal, and features a silver top.",
