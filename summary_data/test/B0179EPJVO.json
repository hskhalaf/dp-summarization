I hope they don't ever break. It seems like a great duffel though. It doesn't have a structured bottom, so be aware of that. It looks slouchy when you're carrying it. I got the small maroon one and it's really pretty :) I do CrossFit and it'll definitely be more than enough room for all my junk. Shoes, towel, shower stuff, change of clothes, socks, wraps, water, shaker, etc.",

It's not overly big like some gym bags; this will hold your clothes, shoes, towel, some extra gear like gloves, or a workout journal, toiletries and such without being a huge bag that doesn't fit in lockers.

I wish there was a mini pocket in the main compartment of the bag and an extra mesh pocket on the outside of one of the pockets on either or both sides. That would drastically improve this bag, but for about $30 this is a great bag.",

Only minor issue with that is the base of that portion isn't attached to base of the bag itself, so the shoes can overlap your items in the main portion of the bag.
