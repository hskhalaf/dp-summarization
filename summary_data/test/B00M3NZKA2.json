Very visually appealing Cons- travel sack is cheap 1.Clamp pressure is not tight enough 2.Headphones will fall off if you tilt your head the wrong way 3.comfort is not good for people with bigger ears. Ears will touch the driver and cause irritation.Ear cups are also small. 4.short cable is only long enough for tablet and smartphone use 5. Earcup height adjustments do not stay in desired position 6. Headband doesn't distribute pressure well TL;DR: Good looking and Good sound; BUT not comfortable.",

I fell in love with the balance of these headphones. It's not the medioce sound from a pair of Bose, or the heavy beat sound of Beats. It feel so well tuned for everything across the spectrum. I have heard parts of songs that I have never heard before. Breathing from instrumentalists. Depth I didn't know existed in tracks I have been listening to for years. Once you realize what you are missing, it's hard to go back.",

I suggest trying these on in person before buying online. UPDATE. On my second pair after the headband snapped on the first set. Luckily the exchange was super easy.",

I've tried the ones that are 600-800 dollars, but the 300 dollar pair give just as great sound as the 800 dollar ones. These here are very good for the price range. They don't have the sound boost that the more expensive ones give you. But the mids and bass are perfect. By sound boost, I mean the level of the volume. I wish they were louder. But they're good for this price. Very comfortable to wear. More so than I was expecting. You can wear these for hours without a problem.",

      "text": "These are fantastic headphones. They have great sound and pretty comfortable for prolong usage. They crush my Bose SoundTrue, which I lost a couple of days ago. This is my first Sennheiser headset and was pretty nervous. They impressed big time! I wanted headphones with a mic because of how often I use my headphones but I didn't want crappy ear buds. This a great choice for people that want powerful headphones with style. One big con is their horrible cable, which lasted only about a month. The mic has background noise and the buttons act up. P.S. this is now my third cable and yes, it broke again. The quality of the cable is horrendous.",

      "text": "Overall not too bad. Not what I expected. Was really hoping for something better than studios2.0 closer to V Moda M100 maybe a Momentum with more bass, was disappointed the best description in my experience with these is that they sound as if I have cotton in my ears. I got these for $100 on Amazon and thought I'd give them a try, for $100 pretty good Would not pay full price. My option save the money and get something else.",

      "text": "Swing and a miss for Sennheiser. Very disappointing. I've always owned Sennheiser products, from ear buds, on ear, and professional grade over-ear headphones. They always provided superior sound quality, until now. These sounded like something you'd pick up at a truck stop in an emergency. No distinct frequencies or range, regardless of equalizer mode or volume. Absolutely awful for orchestral music. The Sennheiser earbuds I use daily are far better than these cans. Also, the earcups dont really surround your ears completely. They compress the perimeter of your ears so they become uncomfortable quickly. Find something larger or stick with on-ear headphones or buds. Sennheiser makes some fantastic products. These are not among them.",
