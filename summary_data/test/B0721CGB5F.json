The glass door actually shattered in the middle of baking food- not sure if this was a malfunctioning product or if this particular oven can\u2019t handle it\u2019s proper duties. I would recommend spending a little more on a toaster oven, if possible. If not, then beware of shattering glass and very burnt food.",

As seniors we find our ability to grip the dials difficult, slippery plus just hard to turn and turn accurately. The ability to set the degree of toasting is really a problem because of this difficulty causing us to stand over the oven and stop it when it reaches our preferred level of toasting.
