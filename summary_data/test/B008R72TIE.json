      "text": "Bought these at a value price as camping gifts for my grandchildren. All 6 worked perfectly. Nice product at that price for that purpose - flashlight, green wand for retaining night vision yet seeing things more clearly, a safety whistle, and a lanyard. Kids loved them. Of course a downside is that the button cells that power this can be pricey (try buying them at the Dollar Store), and it takes some care and a tiny Philips driver to replace them. Finally, be careful when storing this away, the power on button can be pushed by other stuff pressing on it. All in all, another great camping gift for kids.",

Also I ordered two sets of six and there was one in each order that did not work. I didn't try replacing batteries, but I shouldn't have to. Didn't have time to return them and just didn't do as many hats. I went back to the product description and no where that I could find did it say anything about the auto shut off. Very frustrating",
