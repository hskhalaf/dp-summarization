I bought it for my elderly father so he has a large area for cutting up veg and such. But I can't use it for that; I'm afraid of it falling and breaking his foot. (This isn't an exaggeration.) I had to buy a large, light weight polymer board for him to use. Still figuring out what to do with this one, since it is a very nice cutting board. If you have a counter where you will leave it, perfect. But it isn't something you want to get out and put away for every use.",

I will probably end up taking a fine sander to it. It does sit level and is heavy enough that it shouldn't slip on the counter top. I have washed it and oiled it. I think some paste would be a good idea as well. Overall, despite the somewhat rough finish, it seems like a nice product. I will see how it holds up. PS: Just for product accuracy sake, note that the \"neet\" label now appears on the side edge rather than on the top surface as shown in the picture.",

Its not so distracting that someone other than me would notice but it did leave a small jagged edge that I had to slightly sand to keep it from splintering and cutting my hand. Overall, even with the small ding, I highly recommend this block. The quality is really great and the size is perfect.",
