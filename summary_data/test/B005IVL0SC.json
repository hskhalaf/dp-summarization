After about 3 years with this printer, it became impossible to get the ink heads to act properly. I also made the mistake of trying to save money on ink cartridges. The printer warned me about a voided warranty if I used these non-Epson inks. Sure enough, it won't print anything now. I bought Epson inks (cha-ching) and they don't even work now. I switched back to HP. Got a HP OfficeJet 4650 and so far I'm loving it.",

There is no manual feed tray to be able to use legal size paper. Because of the paper path, the printer can only handle a lighter weight card stock.

What a time-saver! Set-up was extremely easy for me (I'm not technologically-advanced). I've not tried the fax option yet. The printer is somewhat loud. I've gotten used to it, but it still interrupts my cat's sleeping pattern :) My research paid off on this printer purchase.

      "text": "I love this printer! My old HP Deskjet lasted many years, but started to go on the fritz and just didn't offer all the features I want now, so I did my homework and bought this printer. It scans incredibly well, does double-sided printing, and has been easy on using ink as far as I can tell. I was able to hook it up to my home network quickly and now the whole household can print to it. It's fast, but a little loud (but that doesn't bother me). Has worked flawlessly for me over the last few months and I cannot recommend it enough for a home office.",

Faxes received can also be saved directly to the SD card for later retrieval. Google CloudPrint enabled. Extremely intuitive user interface and very easy setup.",

It's hardwired to the printer, so I didn't need to download software to run the diagnostic. I did - it cleaned the head - and it worked fine afterwards. I was really glad it fixed itself.
