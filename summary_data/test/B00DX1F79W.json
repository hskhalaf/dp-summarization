The top folder cover for scanning feels like it's going to break off every time I open it to scan something. I'm also not a fan of the scanning options. You can't easily save the file local to your computer. I have to save it to my OneDrive account, then download it to my computer. The scanning quality isn't great, either. If I had to buy a printer again, I would probably go with something else.",

Finding the print setup software is another challenge to find. This is the most convoluted software ever. Second: this printer is seldom found by my Mac. Sometimes i can get it to scan or print but never both after turning my internet off/on as well as the pc and printer. Printing or scanning a single page is at least a half hour project. If you're looking for a cuss word generator this is it....if you want a reliable printer shop another brand.",

Color printing to plain paper--to go in my snail mail letters is not the best but perhaps I have not adequately played with the settings. I suspect it will do better on photo paper--but IMHO if you want good prints use a photo print shop. I think probably good for recommended purpose of moderate home office use.",

      "text": "To preface, I use my printer to scan documents more than anything else. After using this product for just 1 week I started having problems w/ the scanner feature. With pages in the tray it would not communicate w/ my laptop. The solution was to power off the printer before each scan, but then it wouldn't even shut it self down resulting me having to unplug the printer before each scan. Neither efficient nor convenient. I plan to by an HP, but stuck with this in the mean time.",

The ink if your cartridge is low you can't even print anything until you change it. I got a paper jam a few days ago and I cleared the jam and can't make the jam front/rear notification disappear, I have tried everything that it said to do and the paper jam error will not go away. So this printer is basically useless now.",
