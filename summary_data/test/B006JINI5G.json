Fortunately, I have a few other readers and they work well. Two of which I have had for 4 and 8 years, respectively. The Transcend RDF5K is MUCH more reliable than this one (RDF8K).",

My only complaint is that their products come with a preconceived notion that the end user will be content with a connecting cable of limited length. An 18\" cable is fine for connecting devices that are in close proximity to one another but for the desktop users, we are forgotten. It becomes necessary to purchase additional length cables to complete installation. I realize shorter cables mean smaller packaging and cost savings for the manufacturer but more cost for some of us who need a more customized installation.",

The computer (Windows 8 machine) recognized it immediately and every time I insert the card it immediately is read. You know the reader is powered as there is a blue light on it that lets you know. Downloading a couple hundred photos takes no time at all and is significantly faster that plugging the USB cord directly into the camera. I haven't watched the actual speed rates however, so I cannot comment onto actual download speeds. Will try and update when i fill several cards worth of photos and download them all at once.",

Not sure if that is true, but the quality of the photos and videos transferred from my T3i are great. Great speed, great performance, what else could a customer ask for?",
