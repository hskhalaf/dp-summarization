The other three were just thrown in a BAG with a shirt, seriously. Glass packaged in a bag. Ofcourse they were broken and I had to throw them away. Also they were packaged with a t-shirt I ordered for a present which was covered in glass and little shards of citronella candle stuck to the shirt. I order alot of stuff off of amazon this is by far the worst thing that I have received. Not happy at all. The 1 surviving candle works good and looks cool.",

The wick is short and runs out before the citronella does so you wind up throwing away about a third of the citronella. And these containers are very brittle glass which should never be used around a pool or spa. We are going back to the metal buckets and use immersible color changing LEDs along side them. Search on em!",
