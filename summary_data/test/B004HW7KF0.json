Clear images Many SCN options Very simple to use Light weight Small - can fit comfy in pocket Cons: Pic quality inside not as good Small zoom Small flash But then again, it's worth it for the price and the type of camera Good buy over all if you are looking for a basic camera that's inexpensive and will give you quality products for cheap I gave it 4 Stars only because I wanted some better indoor quality, but it will serve the purpose I'm using it for",

I got Lumix for it's compact size, and based on the Amazon reviews it was the best bang for the buck with the features I needed. I plan to use it outdoors so I purchased the drops and spills coverage, $22 for three years can't be beat. Also purchased the recomended case and 8gb card. Very happy with the pictures and ease of transfering the pictures by usb or card. I forget I have have it on my belt it so light. For the average person it's agreat buy, alrerady recommened it to a friend and she purchased one as well.",

The reason for 4 stars: manual is lousy and Panasonic customer help is chaotic. Movie-making is too confusing, I can't get it to replay on screen, but I'm new to digitals and probably should blame myself. I haven't dealt with the added Loilo software, so can't say if it's useful. If you figure out the movie-making, I would highly recommend buying this camera for the picture quality.",

We have already used it for my son's college graduation pictures. It is very easy to download the pics to the computer and eventually automatically sending the pics to the local pharmacy store for printouts. The only disadvantage: The macro capabilities (taking close-up pictures of plants or collectibles) may not be perfect, but it could be that I haven't figured that aspect yet. Four and a half stars out of five is what I would rate this great camera for the price (about 79 bucks).",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-S3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n S3 \n\nThe 14.1-megapixel LUMIX S3 features a new design, with a distinct rounded shape that fits comfortably in the palm of the hand, to differentiate the models from the rest of the LUMIX line. With a 28mm* wide-angle 4x optical zoom lens, these LUMIX digital cameras are extremely versatile, helping consumers get superb shots both far and wide.\n\nVenus Engine VI\nThe image-processing engine, Venus Engine VI, uses advanced signal processing to give you beautiful images. Multi-task signal processing is employed for all images to enable high-speed, high-performance shooting. Venus Engine VI also effectively raises the precision of various functions, such as MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) and Intelligent ISO Control. Along with its extremely high performance, Venus Engine VI reduces power consumption thanks to a number of energy efficiency improvements. \n\n\niA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\nWhen you don't know which mode will give you the best shooting results, or when a sudden photo opportunity pops up and you don't have time to change any settings, simply choose the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode and let the camera do it all for you. Just choose the iA Mode, aim at your subject, and shoot. Four detection and correction functions are simultaneously activated to optimize the settings, so you get stunning photos every time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) Shake Detection\nThe MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)* in the DMC-S3 compensates for the blurring caused by hand-shake. Using built-in gyrosensors to detect even slight camera movement caused by handshake, the camera compensates for the shake so you get clear, sharp photos. The MEGA O.I.S. lets you shoot in dimly lit rooms or evening illumination to preserve the mood, and works for macro shots and zoom shots, which are especially susceptible to hand-shake. In short, it lets anybody take beautiful, blur-free shots with ease. \n\n* MEGA O.I.S. is automatically turned on in iA Mode and can be turned on or off in Normal Picture Mode or some Scene Modes.\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent Scene Selector Scene Detection\nWhen the camera is in iA Mode, the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode to Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait*1, Night Scenery or Sunset. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance*2. You are free from adjusting settings every time the scene changes when taking images with these frequently used Scene Modes to get beautiful results.\n\n*1 In iA Mode, Night Portrait is not identified when the flash is turned off.\n*2 With some subject and shooting conditions, it is just not possible to judge the best shooting details. When this happens, it is recommended that you shoot with the Scene Mode that best suits your purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent ISO Control Motion Detection\nThe Intelligent ISO Control function* in the DMC-S3 made possible by the Venus Engine VI detects subject movement and automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed to best suit the movement and light conditions. When it detects subject motion, it automatically raises the ISO setting and increases the shutter speed to prevent motion blur. On the other hand, when the subject is still and no movement is detected, it takes beautiful natural photos with a low ISO setting. The Intelligent ISO Control gives you stunning images with ease because there is no need for complicated settings. \n\n* The Intelligent ISO Control function is automatically turned on in iA Mode, and can be turned on or off in Normal Picture Mode. \n\n\n\n\n\nFace Detection AF/AE\nThe Face Detection AF/AE function*1 detects faces and automatically optimizes the focus and exposure settings. It prevents the blurry faces that happen when the camera focuses on something in front of or behind the subject, and keeps faces from appearing dark when shooting indoors or against the light source. It detects up to 15 faces at a time, making it extremely convenient for group photos. Once the camera detects a face, Face Tracking follows it even when the subject moves around. Plus, the system keeps detection on if a face turns sideways to the camera.\n\n*1 Face Detection function is automatically turned on in iA Mode and can be turned on or off in Normal Picture Mode or some Scene Modes. \n\n\n\n\n\nLUMIX Image Uploader\nThe DMC-S3 gives you a new form of communication by letting you share your photos and movies. All you have to do is checkmark the photos and movies you want to share and connect the camera or SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card to a computer. Uploading automatically starts by simply following the guidance. Facebook can be used for photos and YouTube for movies. You can join these social networking services without having to install any special software. It's easy to share photos and movies on the spot, which means that your friends don't have to wait for you to come back home to see them.\n\nEasy Computer Connection\nSelect photos and movies on the camera menu.\n\nUpload Photos and Movies\nThe software is launched after connecting the camera or SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card to a computer.\n\nShare with Your Friends\nYou can share the URL by e-mail right after the upload!\n\n\nLarge, 2.7-inch, 230,000-dot LCD\nThe DMC-S3 large 2.7-inch LCD features high 230,000-dot resolution LCD. The big screen reflects fine details, making it easy to check the focus before shooting. It also serves as a small photo and video viewer, allowing the user and friends to enjoy viewing the still and motion images together. \n\n\nBuilt-in Memory 70MB\nThe DMC-S3's built-in memory holds up to approx. 70MB of image data.",
