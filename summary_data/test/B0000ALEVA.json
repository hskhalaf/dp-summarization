A medium basket and a larger basket. The small basket even has a holder you can clip to your dishwasher so the water doesn't make it fly around. Brilliant! And so handy!",

The only thing I don't really use in this order is the tube cleaner. The water tends to always get stuck in the tubes so I throw it away and not risk having it mold. I often use the other baskets in this order and would recommend them to our other baby parents friends.",

I also wish the slits in the baskets were a little smaller. Some of my medicine syringes fall through the baskets, which is the opposite of their purpose! The latches sometimes don't stay closed, so I have to be vigilant so they don't come open during my dishwasher's wash cycle. Overall, they are cheaper baskets, so I didnt expect them to be perfect. They function well enough and I think they are worth the money.",

I put a 3 piece small beverage shaker inside one of the baskets laying them side by side inside the basket and put it on the top rack of the dishwasher and when the cycle was finished, none of shaker pieces moved or got thrown around. The baskets are sturdy enough but a little flexible and the set is worth the money and it's probably a giftable item for those people who use dishwashers on a regular basis.

We actually have 13 bottles, and the bottom only holds 8, so I just squeeze the rest on top next to the blue things. I use the larger basket to toss the base, the ring, and a few caps into.
