I don't know how strong they are but I trust JBL in making a good product. Also, they do leak sound so they aren't ideal for public use, but they are still great for around the house. And the bass isnt as great as JBL says it is. I really like my bass to be thumping and deep. Still, or the price, they are good. So I will give it 4 stars. I guess I was just hoping for a little more.",

Bold styling details, including brushed stainless steel ear-cup and headband accents, make J55 headphones an aesthetic, as well as acoustic, triumph.\n\nJ55 AT A GLANCE: \n * Bold JBL design and premium finishing\n * Premium, high-performance JBL drivers\n * Rotating, 180-degree DJ pivot mechanism\n * Soft leather ear cushions\n * Closed-back design\n * Single-side, detachable cable\n * Cable-locking mechanism\n * Rugged strain relief\n * Gold-plated jack with extension ring\n * Padded carry pouch\n\n\nVIEW LARGERJ55 ear-cups rotate up to 180 degrees while you\u2019re wearing them so you can keep one ear on your audio and one ear on external sounds or conversations KEY FEATURES\nBOLD JBL DESIGN AND PREMIUM FINISHING\nFrom the brushed stainless steel headband and ear-cup accents to the matte black or white housings, from the embossed, metallic JBL logos to the cable that matches the ear pads, these headphones are designed to be as pleasing to the eyes as they are to the ears.\n\nPREMIUM, HIGH-PERFORMANCE JBL DRIVERS\nJBL drivers deliver precise, powerful sound for an exceptional listening experience. Bass is pure, deep and accurately produced \u2013 the calling card of legendary JBL sound. As a result, J55s outperform competitive products costing much more. \n\nROTATING, 180-DEGREE DJ PIVOT MECHANISM\nSometimes you need to be aware of more than just your music. J55 ear-cups rotate up to 180 degrees while you\u2019re wearing them so you can keep one ear on your audio and one ear on external sounds or conversations. The ear-cups rotate under the headband for easy storage and transport.\n\nVIEW LARGERThe tangle-resistant, flat elastomer cable connects to just one ear-cup, which further minimizes tangling \n\nSOFT LEATHER EAR CUSHIONS\nOur ear cushions feature a soft leather that provides longwearing comfort. It also helps maintain an acoustic seal on the ear, which improves the headphones\u2019 passive noise reduction. And that means a purer listening experience.\n\nCLOSED-BACK DESIGN\nJ55 headphones feature a closed-back design that blocks ambient noise and minimizes leaking. So the outside noise stays outside, and your listening experience stays yours and yours alone. \n\nSINGLE-SIDE, DETACHABLE CABLE\nTangled cables are a constant source of frustration. But not with the J55s. The tangle-resistant, flat elastomer cable connects to just one ear-cup, which further minimizes tangling. The cable also detaches from the ear-cup for added flexibility.\n\nCABLE-LOCKING MECHANISM\nA unique, twist-lock mechanism keeps the detachable cable secure when it\u2019s connected. When you plug the cable into the ear-cup, a simple twist locks it in place.\n\nRUGGED STRAIN RELIEF\nA strong, secure connection between the housing and cable is critical for both durability and sound quality. Our rugged strain relief connector dampens vibration for enhanced acoustic performance. \n\nGOLD-PLATED JACK WITH EXTENSION RING \nThe gold-plated jack incorporates an extension ring that works with most custom smartphone covers and cases. So you don\u2019t have to slip off your protective case to connect the headphones.\n\nPADDED CARRY POUCH\nJBL sound is always worth protecting. An included padded carry pouch keeps the headphones safe from bumps and bruises when you\u2019re not wearing them.\n\n\nPRODUCT SPECS\nSpecifications Type On-ear style Premium driver 1-5/8-inch (40mm) Frequency response 10Hz \u2013 24kHz Impedance 32O Flat-elastomer cable 4' 3-3/16\" (1.3M), single-side, detachable Plug 1/8\" (3.5mm) gold plated \n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * 1 set of JBL J55 on-ear headphones\n * 1 4' 3-3/16\" (1.3M), single-side, detachable, flat elastomer cable\n * 1 padded carry pouch\n * Owner\u2019s manual\n * Warranty card\n\nDOCUMENTATION\nSpec Sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEAR THE TRUTH.\nEven if you\u2019ve never owned a JBL\u00ae product, you\u2019ve almost certainly heard the JBL sound.
