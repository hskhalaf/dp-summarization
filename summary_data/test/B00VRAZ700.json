I use it with an old 27\" Dell 1080p monitor and while the setup works, I have to manually power off the monitor for the box to power down and without bluetooth, I have to use the volume control on the speakers which are connected to the audio out on the monitor.",

This was connected to my Virgin Hub and everything else in the house worked perfectly. In the end I used some home plugs and on ethernet the device is superb. The picture quality is brilliant and the codec support is spot on for such a small specialised device. On the whole I am very happy with it but if you are reliant on Wifi operation beware.",

Therefore you cannot add new music files,etc, that you've downloaded from Amazon without unplugging the drive and plugging it into your main computer.

      "text": "This was given as a present for Christmas to my uncle and he absolutely enjoyed it! So many features, compared to Google Chromecast for example (which I own). The setup of the device is a bit hectic (multiple steps, account creation over the internet) but once all is set, it's a pleasure to play with. I recommend to update the device as soon as possible as this would improve the wifi connectivity and add a few other features. There are tons of channels to add (news, weather, music, etc.) and every day you discover something new (1000+ channels). Would def recommend!",

We also have NowTV (save yourself the Sky fee and get one of these + movies for @\u00a310 a month), a home media server and now Amazon prime is available too. there are also many other channels depending on what your interest are. I'm even contemplating removing some of my Virgin Media services......",

Some good paid for services eg Netflix (no Amazon prime but Netflix don't charge extra for certain content), now TV, wwe network but if you want to just use free services you will probably be disappointed. You can get iplayer, 4od, ITV player, 5od. If you use any sort of HDMI switch be aware this device is always on so could cause a problem. Some demonstration clips show this box as having an option to search for content but this isn't available.",
