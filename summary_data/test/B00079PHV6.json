The best thing about their products is that they are soap-free, which means it's less irritating. She doesn't scratch or bite herself after I bathe her. It really conditions well, but it washes out easily and doesn't weigh her hair down. I highly recommend it!",

One tip that made is to much easier to use: I got a plastic bottle with a nozzle and a little lid, just like the ketchup bottles, watered it down a little bit, and can thus direct the bottle to the exact spot I need, with no waste. So much easier than the bulky bottle. Have done the same with all his shampoos and treatments.",

It smells great and keeps his coat oh so soft. I constantly get comments on how silky soft he is when friends and strangers alike take a moment to pet him. I also pair this with the spray deodorizer/conditioner to keep him smelling great between baths. Highly recommended!",

The shampoo works wonders for his skin problems and this conditioner works great, his skin has less of an alligator feel and leaves his coat soft. His flake spots loosen after several washings and healthy fur is very noticeable. I do wash and conditioner him everyday though.",

I have a Chihuahua / Min Pin and Dutch Shepherd. Two very different dogs with different coat types.",

We saw that it was so inexpensive here on Amazon and decided to just order our own bottles and bathe her at home for a small fraction of the cost. This conditioner with Oatmeal and Aloe does a great job of keeping her fur nice and soft. We highly recommend this product.",
