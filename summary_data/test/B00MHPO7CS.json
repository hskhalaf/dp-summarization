      "text": "So, first off, this rack is really cheaply made. Description says \"Handcrafted from solid hardwood\" but it's particle board with cheap veneer. It's poorly packaged and heavy, so it was damaged when WalMart shipped it to the previous buyer. She returned it, manufacturer then apparently sent it to Amazon without inspecting for damage - so my time is wasted returning a damaged unit. The old invoice was still in the box, hi L***** B**** from Carrolton Tx, lucky you only paid $88.99 when I paid Amazon $100.97 and they shipped me your reject. Yep, I'm not a happy Amazon customer today.",

All in all, it is an ok piece, but don't expect much and you won't be dissapointed.",
