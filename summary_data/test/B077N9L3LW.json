I will definetly be buying more of these next payday.",

It saves so much time and energy and you never have to worry about knocking too many out of the tray again.

I'm so glad to have these now so that I can get the ice out with ease and I don't have to let it melt some in order to get it out. I have rheumatoid arthritis and this is so much easier on me.

The lids that come with them are not a watertight fit, but they are sturdy enough to allow one to stack them one on top of another. I like to have a few of these as a backup in case the icemaker has to work double duty during the holiday gatherings.",
