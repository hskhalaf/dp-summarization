      "text": "P&G's Tide has been about the best liquid detergent for a decade. It gets my clothes clean without making colors fade. BE CAREFUL. The stuff with \"bleach alternative\" makes sweat stains purple and P&G won't admit it. Other than that version, I've never had trouble with Tide. It works and works.",

I didn't have to worry about whom I had to ask for a ride to the store when I realized I was close to running out of detergent. Cue Amazon Prime to the rescue. For $11 or so I was stocked with two energy efficient Tide bottles. Makes you wonder why people even allow themselves to be ripped off by Target or Walmart or any of the corporate giants that play the middle men in our daily consumption of products when you can literally just hop onto Amazon, wait a day or so and BAM.
