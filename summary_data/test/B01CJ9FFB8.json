I purchased it with the intent of having my shorter plant appear taller, fuller, and allude a more attractive and appealing presence in the room.. However, the plant stand hardly lifts the pot off the floor. There is very little difference between the height of my plant on the floor versus it being on the plant stand. At most, it lifted my plant less than 3 inches higher than it original floor position. The better use of this stand may be to raise a planter/pot off the floor to keep it from soiling a floor or creating a ring on the carpet.",
