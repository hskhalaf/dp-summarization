They are a little tight on the head but if you can tolerate the plastic headband and be careful, they will be perfectly ok for normal use, just don\u2019t expect any miracles. They are far better than the similarly priced competition and for \u00a320 you can\u2019t go wrong",

Comfortable enough to wear for about a couple hours as it's quite light and the cushions are very soft and springy but won't fit very well if you have big ears as the hole between the cushion is sort of oval shaped and not too big. Overall, they're a pretty good set of headphones for music or general use if you're not willing to fork out for a \u00a3200+ pair for extra quality",

The only downside is that the cable could do with another 20-30cm on it I reckon. It's probably long enough for most people though. I'm hoping they last for a long time - they don't seem to be serviceable in any way, so they'll end up in landfill eventually sadly.",

I suspect this is why Amazon heavily discount them now.",

Perhaps I have slightly bigger-than-average ears & head or simply the fact I wear glasses make them hurt my ears after around 45 minutes of constant use. Please note, that the actual ear pieces only slide up & down (not like most headphones where you can adjust the height of the overhead part) which is bit strange & I can bet it makes them slightly TIGHTER than my previous, similarly looking headphones. It's hard to judge really, but they might be OKAY for 90% of population nevertheless. For me, personally, I might need to replace these in near future - and check them in-store before buying.",
