      "title": "Super comfortable, great sounding Bluetooth headphones!!",
      "text": "Very impressed so far. Really comfortable for on-ear headphones, honestly I can wear these for ages with no issues, the headband also extend for a great fit on my fairly large noggin. Crucially these Bluetooth headphones sound fantastic (despite not using AptX codec). Bass levels are spot on for me - not overpowering, but definitely pronounced (might be a bit heavy for some, highly subjective area I know). Battery life seems good too, they look great too - understated and cool. Really delighted so far, can't recommend highly enough.",

I was very happy with the first pair and even more happy that the second are now half the price I paid for the originals. OK the sound is not as good as a beats set but I can buy 8 of these for the price of a set of beats headphones. Maybe not for hardcore musos, but for general video watching I think they are great",

Very comfortable, I've had them on for 6 hours today and only just starting to annoy me. Battery has lasted all that time so far on a full charge. Can't speak to their longevity yet, but will update when I can.",

They do pinch your ears a bit so to reduce the pressure ( I have sensitive ears\ud83d\ude14) I just gently bent the head band. It is very robust and made of metal so I didn't worry about breaking it. Sound is great for Bluetooth. Controls work nicely. And the call quality via the mic in the headset is great.",
