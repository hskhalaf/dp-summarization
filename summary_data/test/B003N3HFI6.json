Don't ask me why, but I thought I needed something updated, so I got a highly rated keyboard with cherry switches and a volume control wheel -- and I hated it. What a joy to find that my same Matias Tactile Pro is still avaliable! Some reviewers have said they started having problems after a year or two, but I'm hopeful I'll have the same great experience with this one as with my previous one.",

I think that given the cost, that is far too soon to have a keyboard fail. I decided to buy a DasKeyboard for Mac, and I am very unhappy with it design wise; just as I am unhappy with the dinky keyboards that Apple is putting out. I mean a magic keyboard for an iMac? I will keep the DasKeyboard and see how long it lasts, and most likely get another Matias in hopes that they have improved quality.",

Next (and biggest) issue was the space bar didn\u2019t work at all. Switches feel great otherwise. There was some solid potential but sadly Matias seems to suffer from poor quality control.",

Key travel to registration is about the same as for a membrane keyboard, but there's still a good 3/16\" travel before bottoming out, which gives plenty of time to stop finger motion before hitting bottom. It's not quite as loud as the previous generation, and the plastics seem to be much higher quality than before. And it appears to be mostly opaque, so it looks like it'll at least look cleaner than the previous one did. And with Apple not believing in ports, having the 3 port USB 2 hub on the keyboard is a great bonus, especially if you can't stand wireless stuff.",

      "text": "It feels solid while I'm typing (and yeah, it's loud). I wasn't prepared for the fact that the keys make noise even if you're not typing. The posts will rattle even if you apply slight sideways rocking pressure, so it feels like a cheap keyboard even though the typing action isn't too bad. The glossy white plastic looks cheap, too. I'll be replacing it. :-(",

When it showed up, I realized my mistake and returned it. I think the description should have mad the size difference a little clearer. However, when the full size tactile pro showed up, the h-key was broken. When you hit the key, it remained \"stuck\" rather than spring back. In essence, you cannot use the keyboard. I am going to return it and will not attempt to use another Mattias product.",
