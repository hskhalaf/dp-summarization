This also works great to clean ride-on lawn mower. I had some wet leaves at the bottom of a pile that it took care of as well. If you keep in mind you're working with a $16 leaf blower and you're not a landscaper, you won't be disappointed at all! Leaf blower is light weight and very easy to use.",

Keep in mind this is not a high powered, noisy, commercial tool and you will be completely satisfied. I've spent twice as much on a case of beer - it didn't help get the yard work done though. This blower is fully capable of light duty and quiet jobs - you could use it inside your home (not advisable). Sun Joe tools are value priced, quality tools that I have yet to be disappointed with. For the price, what have you to lose?",

The tasks i use it for: Inside the house - pushing out dust balls from under beds and sofa and hard to reach areas which i then vacuum later (be careful, this really unearths alot of dust and dirt, so beware for allergy sake and you might want to wear goggles) Garage - cleaning the garage floor vs. broom (i have a really large garage) Patio - saves effort and time vs broom Car: drying car after wash As you can see, im pretty lazy, and this serves me pretty well.",

My Mom for the last 50yrs sweeps off our porch and part of the driveway at least, sometimes twice a day. This little blower is just what she needed and she loves it.

It is great for light work to clear patios etc. The blow power is a little too light for major messes or clearing more than 6\" high debris. It can still be accomplished with some extra work and passes. But, I would upgrade to a stronger model for heavier jobs. That said, this is a great deal for light jobs. it is very light weight and pretty strong in a narrow blow area.",

Even on areas of packed down gravel it can clear wet leaves easily. I have used it for clearing the leaves off the lawn and can see where a more powerful or even gas-powered blower would be better suited. The nozzle is a bit too small for it to be effective at blowing leaves which are tangled in the grass. Overall though, I would recommend this for clearing flat surfaces like wooden porches and paved sidewalks/driveways. Great little leaf blower that's very affordable.",

I hate how loud and heavy gas ones are, and this one was easy to manuever around. The only slight problem I had was it seems to come unplugged fairly easily between the extension cord and the unit.

So if you want the power its gonna make some noise. It is very light and easy to handle for how powerful it is. We got it to blow off a large concrete patio. It was able to blow leaves, tree stuff that falls and rocks, so it works great for our need.",
