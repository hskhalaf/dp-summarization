The outside looks nice and our daughter loves the look, but the quality on where the zippers are is incredibly poor. This is really disappointing, This has not even been used heavily for sports and its already broken. Not worth the money. The company who sold it was great and send us a new replacement, but the replacement came with the zipper already broken we still have it and never even used it once. Still has tags on.",

However, the sole reason I picked this bag was for the shoe compartment. You have to kind of stick your hand inside and hoist everything inside the bag up so you can shimmy your shoes in there. I just wish the compartment had sturdier walls or a better way to organize it. Maybe it would be better as a vertical compartment instead of horizontal on the bottom? Regardless, it has good space otherwise and is comfy to wear at least to and from the Y.",

The door to the ball compartment had a zipper encloser and also a latch to keep the ball from falling out. The main compartment has room for a change of clothes as well as pockets for misc like phone, walet etc. The shoulder straps are padded and feel comfortable. Overall one of the best gym bags I have ever owned.",
