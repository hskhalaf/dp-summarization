      "title": "Good Player - Will not play VCD's & Other region DVD's",
      "text": "I bought it for a long trip to Colorado. This player is solid and the buttons are solid and the do not appear cheap unlike the players from Magnavox, Audiovox etc., Charge appeared to last long enough for about 3 movies or longer though i did not measure it. Included cigarete lighter adapter is a great accessory. One big draw back i found with this player is that it will not play VCD's or DVD's from other countries, though it plays burnt DVD's and burnt CD's/MP3s just fine. It is a great 8\" portable dvd player in the market for the price $119+9.95 shipping.",

      "text": "I got my DVD player last week. I got the blue one as it was less expensive by about $20 than the black, red or pink units. The unit is small, has an excellant picture and is fairly lightweight. However, the little speakers are very difficult to hear from. I am using an inexpensive pair of clip-on the ear headphones, and the sound is pretty good. I would recommend this unit to anyone that wants a little quality unit for a very good price",

I used this player in the fly from Seattle,Wa to San Francisco,CA (1.5 hrs), ; I saw one movie with the full battery charge and later for the fly from San Francisco to Mexico City (4.5 hrs) with the rest of charge, I saw 2 movies with the same battery charge, the battery works very well. The only complaint is that the sound is very low, you must listen the player with headphones, I recommend you the Sony MDR-V150, then the sound will be great.",

I must say, however, I had done review of available DVD Players on various web sites. The reviews posted by many other customers have been very helpful in making my decision. I could easily narrow down my search on this one based on the price, customer satisfaction and few other aspects I was looking for.",
