It has been fast, quiet, and cool, for the 5 months I've been using it. I frequently use it in games such as Arma 3, Star Citizen, Ark: Survival Evolved, Watchdogs 2, and several first-person shooters. I keep my graphics on the highest settings possible and in 1080p my framerate usually stays up in the mid 50s. I highly recommend this card. It has provided me with superb performance.",

Furthermore, the card was without ANY packaging, at least in terms of how the good packaging should look like. I take this opportunity to remind Amazon, that I bough a pretty pricey (at least for me) item and I would like to get it in the appropriate package, as befits electronics product!!!",
