In all applications I find that a non-rechargeable battery would perform slightly better/longer, however, to save the planet, these batteries are perfect for all but the most demanding, critical applications.

If you enjoy a battery-changing hassle reminiscent of 1990's technology, go ahead and buy these things. However, if what you want is batteries that last longer than about 4 weeks, just buy regular, non-rechargeable batteries. That's the route I'm taking after trying these things for several years.

Fresh alkaline batteries stay strong for over six hours and trail off the voltage slowly. These lithium batteries come on strong but burn like a rocket. They are no better than alkaline batteries, in my experience. Best to consider the Panasonic lithium batteries as the published performance is more reliable than these cheap imports.",
