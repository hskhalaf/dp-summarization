The shiny polished finish was gone after one use. I just couldn't see this holding up after long term. I would expect maybe a year of weekly bonfires and it would need to be replaced. The ash can be difficult to remove. On the positive side, there's very little smoke when used correctly and it looks amazing when it's dark and you can't see how the finish discolored after one use. Not worth the price in my opinion.",

You still get a little smokey smell on you, but I'd say it reduces the smoke by about 50% and you rarely (if ever) get those large blasts of smoke in your face. It lights easily, the fire is simple to maintain and it burns very efficiently. When I go clean the pit up the next morning after a good evening fire (3-5 hours) there is usually only around 1-2 cups of ash and no large wood chunks. I have been recommending this to all of my friends.",

Extremely warm, but the heat radiates at you from the walls and the fire is barely affected by wind direction, so I end up being warm regardless of wind. Wood burns down to a very fine ash. Only downside is not being able to put out the fire. However, once the fire is low enough, I can put a screen over the top to catch sparks. Bottom remains cool to the touch (won't scorch grass), so it's pretty safe to walk away from.",
