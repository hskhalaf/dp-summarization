      "text": "If you asked me 3 weeks ago today review this bag it would have been 4.5 stars. It wasn\u2019t perfect but it did what I wanted with little fuss. Today as I was wiping it out the inside lining started to peel and there was mold or mildew under the inner bag. Gross! I use this bag 5 days a week with a sealed ice pack and milk in a ziplock inside the bag. At the end of the day I turn it inside out to dry. Once a week I gently wash it with dawn and rinse. I consider this bag very gently used over less than 5 months. Really disappointed with this product.",

I've been wanting a wet bag since last summer so I decided to go ahead and get one for this summer. I LOVE the print. Very colorful and summery! The quality is great, as always. I just ordered another itzy ritzy snack bag but in the full size. These bags are definitely a mom must have! You can literally use them for EVERYTHING! Not just for babies and toddlers but big kids and adults too. There just awesome all the way around.",

The outer cloth may have shrunk a bit, and after stuffing the inner layer back in, it doesn't sit flush together. And getting the inner layer back in is not super easy. I'll keep it, and I do like it, but it's not my favorite. I greatly prefer the Bumkins wet bags.",

I may have gotten a defective one, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d buy another just in case it happened again since you can\u2019t do a replacement or return after you have washed items.",

Bigger than I expected too which I don\u2019t mind at all. I\u2019ll probably order another one and the smaller version because these are going to be handy AF.
