The IPS screen has a little bit of backlight bleed from a particular section, but is only noticeable when the screen is displaying black. I had to re-paste the CPU with Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut to eliminate the CPU thermal throttling that always occurred during full CPU load. Speakers evidently lack bass or treble, but I'll be using my headphones or desktop speakers most of the time anyway.",

The color with a little of copper accent give a rich feeling and it looks neat. It's fast - so far - not overheating; however, I have not used it for anything power hungry yet. The keyboard ilumination is splendid. You can choose from several different options to accomedate your perfect color! I think everybody would like this pretty toy and of course I wish it could be a little more affordable but it's money worth from any angle!",

No complaints. Fans can be loud at times but that is to be expected with any gaming platform especially a lightweight laptop! Track pad could be larger, but it was better than expected. Screen quality is great, a little light bleed when dark but it is very sharp and responsive! All around would recommend. Decided to get this instead of Razer Blade 15, no regrets for the saved $500",

This laptop is on the scale of some of the thinnest and lightest laptops I have used, but with the power of a gaming desktop. The sheer usability is excellent. It can also handle ours off the plug (4-5 depedning on use). It can heat up quite a bit, but the on board fans do a good job keeping up. You're best not keeping it on your lap when you are really getting into a gaming session anyways. Be prepared to be blown away by the improvements over previous computers.",

Laptop itself is gorgeous, feels great, love the logo love the case, hardware wise its fast but display is terrible, for 2k it should be amazing. We are a business and don't leave bad reviews unless we want others to read them for a reason, most MSI Stuff is good we have at least 10k + in their stuff and wont influence us not to buy more, but I think the bezel battery technology makes the display terrible.",

There is also the MSI function key when pressed only function keys are lit up.The powerful nvidia 1070 gives full performance towards games without any lag. Keyboard is really smooth and the touch pad goes along with it. With all this power it is really stealthy.",

When sent to MSI, they quoted 1300$ for motherboard replacement when the laptop itself is 1500$. It has been a huge pain since the day I bought it. Always overheating, collects dust to the fans and makes whirring noise (inspire of cleaning very often). Save some pain in your life. Go for a Razer or MacBook Pro for the same price.

It started with the battery no longer getting charged and then progressed to the ethernet port not recognizing cables. I am not sure what has caused all these issues, but after reaching out to MSI customer support I was advised to invest in a volt meter to test my AC charger. After spending $2000 on a laptop I don't expect to get told to invest in a volt meter and figure it out myself. Extremely disappointed with the customer service MSI has provided. A shame since the laptop itself was doing great up until that point.",

For its size and limited weight, it is a perfect \"lap\", laptop, but unfortunately this will burn your legs or crouch area. The fan is also loud and extremely obnoxious. If you are in the same room as someone while they are watching TV, and you are playing a game, it will drown out the TV. It's a real shame. This would be the perfect laptop otherwise. I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone buy this laptop. I will be returning it the first chance I get.",

Computer crashes often. 2. Wifi drops constantly. 3. Monitor flickers and dots appear frequently, mostly on battery. 4. These fails occur with multiple instances of the laptop. I would comment that the laptop is stunningly beautiful, slim and could have been a marvelous system, but is not reliable unfortunately.",
