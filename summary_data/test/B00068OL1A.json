Clearly the fixtures aren't actually nickel all the way through, they're plated, and the nicks had begun to rust horribly. Lots of vinegar later, the rust is gone, and an online tutorial told me to buy this wax and use it in the nicks to prevent the rust from coming back. So far so good!",

A lot more expensive with some minor smearing, but nowhere like this 'expletive deleted'.",
