I was hesitant at first, but once i bought it and used it at the gym, it helped my squatting formation even better. It was a great purchase. I also got it for my friend too! I would highly recc if youre looking for an inexpensive sleeve but still good quality. DEF RECOMMEND !! GOOD QUALITY !!",

The problem is that I tore both of them within about 3 months of use. I bought mine on Amazon from Amazon's LLC. I tried making a warranty claim directly with Nordic, but they diverted me to Amazon LLC, which then sent me back to Nordic. I'm not sure who's the responsibility it is, but either way, it definitely made for bad customer experience. I'll be buying my next pair of knee sleeves elsewhere.",
