      "text": "I needed something cheap that would get the job done so I decided to go with this mic. It actually sounds very nice and adds way better quality to your videos. I like that you can just grab and go and you get 10 times better quality than the mic on your phone. I would recommend this mic if you are just starting out making videos and need something that is not expensive, or if you just need something to travel with and you won't hurt your bank if you lose it or break it.",

I have been using this for voice recognition software and for online meetings and this works perfectly. The software usually recommends more high end products for much higher prices but this microphone does the job perfectly at much much lower price point. Comes in with extra accessories like additional muffs and adapter for extra additional compatibility. Overall i am very impressed with the product !!!",

I thought it was built with good quality and very sturdy, but I found it to sound a bit muffled when clipped onto my shirt as shown. My best results were when I held the microphone 3-4 inches from my mouth without using the clip. I like that it's easy to carry around for travel and if you don't mind holding it up to your mouth, it works pretty good! Very affordable and worth a try.",

We were concerned about the music playing, which could be heard but we were heard better. I would definitely purchase this mic again and have recommended it, already, to multiple people.",
