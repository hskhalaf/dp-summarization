We flip it over when not in use, so the holes don't get water in them and mildew forms. A little pink mildew starts anyway, so I just spray with foaming beach every now and then. This thing is exactly as advertised. It's very sturdy! It's fun and challenging. We've even flipped it over to use as a floating table for snacks.",

    "title": "GoPong Pool Lounge Floating Beer Pong Table Inflatable with Social Floating",
    "description": "GoPong's Pool Pong Lounge is a premium 6ft floating beer pong table with built in cup holders for social floating. This product is essentially a version of our popular Party Barge, but without the built in cooler. The 6ft x 3ft table includes 10 cup triangles on each end for full size pool pong play. Each side of the raft is also lined with 4 cup holders for social floating, so you and your friends can float and socialize around the table between pong games. The Pool Lounge can also be used as a floating tanning lounge if you're ever able to get it all to yourself. The Pool Lounge includes 6 pong balls (cups not included) and is retail packaged. This is a must have for spring break, summer pool parties, or lake boating. Manufacturer's Note: We inflation test and quality check all rafts before they are packaged, but rarely a bad unit will still slip through. If this happens, we will immediately send a replacement or issue a refund as customer service is our top priority.",
