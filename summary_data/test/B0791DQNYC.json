The tools needed are fairly common, so that wasn't a huge deal, Just thought I'd share my experience. The fenders, and tire materials are kind of cheap. Mine has no shocks, so it's very stiff riding. The instructions were not helpful in putting the bike together. However, once I got it together, and figured out, the bike was a lot of fun riding. I will be adding better tires though because the ones that came with it are quite thin.",
