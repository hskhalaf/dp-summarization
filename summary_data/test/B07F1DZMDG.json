You need a strong connection to use it, without a strong connection the following issues have happened: It has lost signal while out, but after returning home and turning it off then back on it worked fine again. When speaking sometimes the sound goes out and won\u2019t return until you close and reopen the app. I really enjoy using this little bot. Great for the price.",

I can accomplish the first step of the connection but not the second. There is no customer service number, no email and no website so get help if you can... I've contacted the seller so I'll post an update once I get an answer from the seller. So far just a lot of frustration with this product.",

The camera is 720 so I kinda wish it was HD but it works and the built in torch makes it easy to move around in the dark. I do wish it had motion detection and night vision I just wish it was $20 cheaper. But it works great and moves reasonably well on carpet . Has a 6 HOUR BATTERY LIFE!!!",

The two or three times that I actually got it to connect, it was ok -- not great, but kind of what you would expect for under $100. If you have $100 to burn, you can give it a try. But don't have high -- or even reasonable -- expectations. After countless attempts at trying to get it to connect and work, I've given up and shelved it. Eventually it'll go to the electronic waste recycling center.",
