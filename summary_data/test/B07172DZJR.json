This is my 3rd day with it and have already modified it to make it shorter. which makes it alot more challenging than its default length. I highly recommend this tool to supplement with your workout routine. It is very addicting. I only wish the line/string was more durable, as it has already started to fray at the end of the line close to the ball after only 3 days of consistent moderate to intense usage.",

With plenty of practice you'll soon be able to punch this thing like you would a pad or reflex pad. If you can accurately control this ball with punches from a boxing stance you'll see pin point accuracy manifest in your performance. Highly recommended! Here's a gif of me at day two",
