Usually not a problem but when you are typing a password-case senitive-no way of telling it was in caps or not. Lots of error messages for me. Small I know but a factor for me. Shop around I thought the price was a little high.",

She puts a lap pillow under the keyboard with her foot up on an otterman and blazes away. The keyboard seems to work better then the cord keyboard on her desktop.
