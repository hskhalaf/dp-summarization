After reading the reviews I ordered two humidifiers, one for home and one for the office. After one night using one on my bed side table I'm sold! This is a great product! I slept the entire night through without coughing!! I even kept the night light feature on and it's so soft that it didn't bother my husband or me. I just got in to the office and can't wait to see how much it helps me here!",

I would recommend this to others and after I try it out , I'll probably have to get one for myself. (I can't give it the 5 stars since I haven't tried it yet)",
