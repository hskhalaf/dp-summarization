It's just too smooth for indoor, and wears too easily for outdoor.",

I realize it's an indoor/outdoor ball, so it's not optimum for indoors, but I've seen better indoor/outdoor balls. It's a bit stiff and not supple. It doesn't have the good tack you expect when using a ball indoors. It's okay for outdoors since it has to hold up to rougher surfaces and it seems pretty durable, although I've been using it mainly indoors as a backup. The Wilson Evolution is much better for indoors, although it costs about $20 more.",
