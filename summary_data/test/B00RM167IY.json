Well made, sturdy, nice tread that grips well on ice and snow, and warm! My only complaint is that the pull-up-loop on the back is too small to get your finger through. Why?!!!

The past month the temps here in North Dakota have been consistently fairly cold... ten above to minus 40, and my feet, which tend to get cold, haven't! Boots are also very comfortable and have a foot box much larger than typical European design. Glad to see they're made in Oregon.",

Update. Still tight, no stretching, maybe order 1/2 size larger. Also there is a rubber bump under the sole insert inside at the heel. After wearing a couple of weeks, it feels like there is a rock under my heel, can't wear them. Can't return them, Going to see about cutting it out. It's not a defect, it's an oval piece of rubber, and the insert has a small indentation where the oval fits, part of the design, but very uncomfortable.",
