When it arrived the nuts and bolts along with the rubber feet were missing. Not wanting the hassle of returning I used my own nuts and bolts but had no feet. Quick click on product support and a few emails later and I'm sent a full pack of all the missing items. So well done product support and thank you Sofia at customer services. The BBQ by the way is great, very sturdy, perfect height and should last a long time.",

The grill area is enough for 3 to 4 people, a choice of different grilling heights avoids food being overcooked. The grill area is such good quality no food stuck to it and it was clean within minutes. The grill rack would also fit into a standard size dishwasher if required. Overall am very happy with this purchase and give it a 5 star rating!!",
