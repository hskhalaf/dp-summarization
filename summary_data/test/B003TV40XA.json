The bottom is indeed a bit tougher and takes more than one stroke of the knife to cut through it. The top cuts through easily with only one stroke. Do not count on this saving your fingers from a cut that starts at the back of your hand. The second issue is that the rubber deteriorates quickly if you get meat juices on it. Washing them even in warm (not hot) water causes the rubber to transfer to your clothes as the second picture shows.",

I don\u2019t recall those being characterized as having Kevlar. Zero way I risk my fingers using a mandolin or other sharp kitchen tools with these. I will keep these if someone can tell me how to determine they\u2019re made of Kevlar, w/o ruining these and preventing their return/refund. Otherwise, I\u2019m tired of all the sellers selling things that aren\u2019t what they say. That\u2019s my concern here.",

The worked great and dexterity is good (given that they are cut resistant). I just thought the dip thing was funny.",

This is an excellent product at a most reasonable price.",
