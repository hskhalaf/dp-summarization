I do not understand, since most electronics go down in price as time passes. This printer worked well for about 9 months, was very economical with the toner used. One day, it would not print more than one page at a time without jamming/stopping. Since I know this, I have to \"give it a hand\" when the subsequent pages print, after the first one. Do not use it much, so I will be keeping it for the foreseeable future.",

That is where the good news ends unfortunately. When I first turned on the printer there is a loud whirling noise and it comes on again everytime you print. Also, the paper curls unbelievable due to the sharp curve in the print output deck. These things never happened with my old Brother 1440. I guess Brother is just trying to make cheap printers, both in terms of cost and quality. This one is a shoddy product and I would spend the money to get something decent!",

    "description": "It's the fastest printer in its class, but it never breaks a sweat. With its sleek design and ultra-compact footprint, the ML-2010 laser printer looks good in any home or small office, even at the end of its most action-packed days.

And even at full speed, every document features sharp text and graphics with 1200 x 600 resolution. For added efficiency, TonerSave mode increases toner yield by up to 40% with the press of a button. You can save even more paper by easily printing two or more pages on a single sheet. Or, print transparencies, labels, envelopes and more, directly from the 150-sheet input tray if you'd like. There's also a convenient Cancel button to stop a print job instantly. Getting set up is quick and easy, too. Just connect the ML-2010 to your computer's USB port, install the software with just four clicks of the mouse and you're ready to go. Changing the toner is also a one-step process.
