As I said before, if they could have come close to the seasonings and taste of a Slim Jim or one of the Italian salami ones, I would have bought more . Maybe it has to do with trying to make it Keto friendly . Cheers !",

They travel great ,keeps me on track with my keto or carnivore diet and they are very satisfying.",

That said, maybe an option for no individual shrink wrapping (for freshness) & maybe bundling a dozen or so, before that shrink wrap, might save some costs which may be passed on to the consumer.?",

In fact my only recommendation is to buy a bunch or be prepared to reorder some more very soon.",
