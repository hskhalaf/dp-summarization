One of the reasons I went with this model was I expected the GPS data to be included in the exif photo file. Even with the GPS logging running, the location coordinates don't later show up in the photo info (iphoto 09), Camera reports no A-GPS file on the card, so I'm guessing the satellite almanac isn't available and even after leaving it outside with a clear view of the sky, it still doesn't have the almanac. Maybe if you are willing to use the included software, you'd have better luck.",

The flash on this pops up as needed. Where my hand naturally falls on the body my finger covers up the flash - keeping it from popping up. Not a real problem - but something you have to get used to which is different from comparable models.",

      "text": "Having had a couple of other brands, such as Panasonic and Sony, this is my favorite. Easy to use, menu is not complicated, really not much to dislike. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that on occasion, some photos are soft, however this is a common 'problem' with many brands of point and shoot cameras once in awhile. Given that is not an SLR, I think this is an excellent product, and I would recommend it.",

First, the flash has to pop up from the camera body to be used. I've taken a lot of underexposed pictures simply because the fingers holding the left side of the camera were keeping the flash from popping up. Second, there is a fairly long lag between pressing the button and actually taking the picture. That means action shots are almost impossible. But I have taken a lot of really good pictures with it, and it's relatively easy to understand and use. Good value for the money.",

You'll love it as long as 1. you are aware that the flash is in a counter-intuitive spot, there is nothing wrong with this placement it just means you need to move your finger [I don't understand reviewers who score a product badly based on where they like sticking their fingers on a device, get over it and move your finger haha] 2. you don't have shaky hands, because we had an issue with blur at first [No camera is going to take great photos while you shimmy around though so again, user issue] 3. you are aware of your lighting. Have fun!!",

The photos transfer into Nikontansfer or Photoshop without any issues. This is a good camera for the money. But, I'm not giving up my DSLR yet.",

You take the pic and it says it cant cos the flash is malfunctioning. Hmmm. That's a design flaw for user experience. But I'm happy with it.",

Apply in-camera special effects such as Low Key, High Key, Nostalgic Sepia, even Selective Color, and put a little variety into images and movies.

The best part: you can instantly share your creations with fellow travelers as they gather around the S9300's large, high-resolution 3.0-inch LCD monitor.\n\n\nPANORAMAS AT THE TOUCH OF A BUTTON\nEASY PANORAMA MODE FOR STUNNING PANORAMIC PHOTOS\nCreating expansive panoramic photos has never been easier. Easy Panorama Mode combines multiple shots into a seamless 180\u00b0 or 360\u00b0 panoramic image. Begin by focusing on your starting point, then start panning across the scene.
