Poolmaster has to circle back and figure out why their chlorine test kit has such a high failure rate. It's totally unacceptable. If the pool store comes up with a very different number, I'm filing a dispute to get my money back. If somewhat close, I'll give it a second star.",

After reading the great reviews, I purchased this kit and it told me right away, what my PH level and chlorine levels were. I felt like I was in Chemistry class!

My only complaint is that I am not overly confident in the Chlorine content accuracy, which is a big issue for my pool since it tends to burn through sanitizer like crazy during the summer. I wish the gradient levels of yellow were a bit more distinguishable in order to really hone in on the Chlorine level.",

This difference will ruin pool equipment and the pool! it is worth paying the difference for a better kit. Unfortunately, it is just outside the 30 day window to return the kit, so I am out the $16. It will be responsibly disposed in chemical waste.",

I\u2019m a designer and have been dealing with colors for over 25 years and I can tell small differences in color variations and with this kit it\u2019s impossible. I can\u2019t imagine how everyone else is getting accurate results. You all must be guessing which color is the right one.",

The PH tester is also very easy to read, and after I get the level with another drop solution. I add an additional solution and count the drops in order to find out how much muriatic acid I need to add in order to correct balance. No more over chlorinating with poor results due to high PH. When I run out of solution. I will try the Poolmaster 7 way tester. All in All, as a novice I am very happy with the results.",
