It fits a little bigger than I expected but nothing major. It does have some wrinkles in the top of the cover but that's also a minor issue. It looks great overall and I would not hesitate to order from My Spa Cover again.",

I also ordered it with the maximum length for the skirt which works much better then what I had before. Before I had a problem with it bowing inward and the wind blowing it open. The longer skirt and thicker insulation has so far stood up to some very severe storms. The clips also work great and are easy to install and hold it down well. I shopped around before going with this company and I am glad I did. They are excellent and offer a great value as well. A rare combination!",

If you keep your spa out in the sun, I advise getting an additional thin cheap cover (similar to your grill cover) to last much longer. There are a few options on amazon.

      "text": "I must admit that I was a bit leary ordering something that was not returnable and based on my getting the measurements correct, but in the end everything was great. The company sent an email almost immediately which in itself was a surprise as I expected a day or two lag. The email contained everything I needed to measure and complete the order. Delivery was within the estimated time frame, and the spa cover is perfect. High quality, perfect fit, and I'd say better than the one that was delivered with the spa when new. I'll be ordering my next replacement from this company.",
