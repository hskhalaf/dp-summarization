It also seems pretty accurate, a bit lower than at the Dr's which is to be expected. The one bummer was how quickly the batteries died, we had to change them just the other day. We put new brand name batteries in it, so hoping the batteries were cheapies.",

Haven't really played with the memory storage feature yet, but I plan to.",

Doesn't get too tight or cause pain on the wrist like some digital, bicep location styles do and the controls are all very intuitive so it's easy to work. I appreciate the large display, time/date, and memory function so that I can track readings as I work to lower pre-hypertension. This device also comes with a nice storage case so it stays safe. I believe it to be accurate as it measures in line with another device, but I did not test it side by side with a traditional sphymomanometer. Overall worth the low cost and very convenient!",

I've gone back to my manual bp cuff, which I don't love because It's more challenging to use without assistance. Definitely not worth the money. I'm also disappointed I missed my return window by less than a week. How dissapointing Amazon. :(",
