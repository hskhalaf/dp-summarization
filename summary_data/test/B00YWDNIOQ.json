      "text": "Worst piece of S*** I've ever bought. Don't even think about buying this. I love samung products but this they should scrap this. It has a mind of its own. installation wasn't hard but programming was very difficult. exterior keypad stops working for no reason at the most inopportune times . the alarm would off at the middle of the night again for no reason. I could go on and on . This thing doesn't deserve one star. AGAIN DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.",

Nice looking unit keep pad is very easy touch so you don't have to pound it to work.. th bad is the keys need to touch the unit which was a surprise I thought as long as it's close within an inch or so it would work but no...and the full on reset to factory default was difficult.. I some how did something to put in the main security code wrong and it was a pain to reset...but overall the unit works well and looks good.",

      "text": "As a Samsung user, I was super excited about this sleek, keyless entry option. I had the lock for less than 2 weeks when it started randomly beeping. I couldn't get it to stop unless I removed the batteries. Then I began to search for a customer service number but none existed. When I called Samsung directly they shared that these locks are not supported in the US and I would have to call Indonesia. When I sent an email to the vendor, to date I never got a response. I couldn't take it anymore so I returned the device. It's a shame because it was a beautiful piece.",

Someone could break the glass and open the lock, otherwise, this is an excellent lock for a solid door. Very poor programming instructions though. I had to go on youtube to learn how to program it, but after that, I really liked it. If you plan to install it in direct sunlight, you will have a problem seeing the screen when the sun is shining directly on it.

I did have to make small adjustments to the door frame in order to accommodate the installation as well. But all around it is great!
