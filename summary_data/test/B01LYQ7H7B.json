Also no warrenty in the box which is a pain given the price and since i have been very careful with the product and have no obvious reason for the problem to have arisen.",

I tried with adjusting how they sat in my ear etc etc but found the only solution was to adjust the balance on the phone. Which is annoying as, at lower volumes, it goes back to being fine. Meant switching from headphone to car etc you had to adjust the balance all the time. 1st world problem I know. Sent them back for a refund",

      "text": "I've been using them for about 2 months and they last pretty long before having to throw them back in the case. They work amazing and haven't fallen out at all. I'm a huge sol republic fan. I have almost every headphone they have come out with and these definitely don't disappoint. Sol always comes out with some amazing headphones. My only gripe is that the mic isn't that great most people say they have some trouble hearing me but I'm pretty sure it is because the mic hole on the silicone sleeve is too small. I'm really satisfied with my purchase.",

      "text": "awesome bass and audio, reasonable battery life However, Bluetooth Pariing can be an issue. The mono feature I think skrews the pairing up. I would say 80% of the time it doesn't pair correctly and only pairs with one earbud Then you have to go to settings turn off the mono turn on the amps air turn off the earbuds, etc, etc... took me 10 minutes one time to get it right. Maybe next version or firmware? will make easier. The Sol Amps Air sound however is awesome for the unit and probably worth the hassle... at least for now.... until I find the ultimate wireless earbuds :-))",
