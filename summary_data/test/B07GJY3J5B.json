Of course it is not as good as the real thing, but it is a close as a substitute as I have found. Definitely worth the money!",

The massage action, even on the strongest setting, is nothing more than a gimmick where you get vibrations but not the \"pummeling\" or deep massage some top reviews I've seen on Amazon. Overall, it's pleasant to feel the vibrations from this while you're under the influence or if someone else does the work for you.",

I was very very happy with it and used it daily to work out the kinks in neck and shoulders from having my arms up all day typing. I wouldn't be exaggerating to say I was in miserable pain and this is the only thing that helped at the time. My kids loved taking it away and using it, too. I would highly recommend.",
