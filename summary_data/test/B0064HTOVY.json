Now when he starts to shake his head, I clean his ears with this and it goes away. He doesn't like to have his ears cleaned so sometimes he shakes his head as soon as I get it worked in to his ear canal. It's pretty amazing the wax that comes out when he does that! If I am able to clean it out myself, its clear how much wax it removes. Although I can't say Hank likes the cleanser, it certainly makes him feel better.",

Now we wash his ears once a week with it. He's not \"thrilled\" about it, but he copes :P",
