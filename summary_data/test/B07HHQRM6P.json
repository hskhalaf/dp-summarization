As a mother, I first look at the comfort of my child and for that it certainly exceed my expectation. This is not my first baby lounger. For my first child, I had purchased one which left me with great disappointment. I lost my money on that. So this time when I bought it, I was just praying for a good and comfortable. I must say it is certainly my good investment. It is thick enough and nice. Base is firm and soft. It is also easy for travel. Overall I love the quality and comfort of using this baby lounger",

Turns out my 1mo old baby LOVES this \u2014 we use it every night. Ive been impressed by the quality, actually. We are able to move it in different rooms for night sleep/day naps but she still has a familiar sleep spot each time no matter the location. It even washes well. Great buy!!",

She is almost 2 weeks old and would pretty much only sleep well on my chest or my husband's chest. She would wake immediately if placed in her basinet. Well, this changed everything! She finally slept in her basinet at night in 3 hour chunks! We placed rolled up towels on the outside of the baby nest so that she would be more snug since she is still so small. And it worked! I highly recommend this for anyone with the same struggles. It literally worked overnight for us and we finally got some uninterrupted sleep!",
