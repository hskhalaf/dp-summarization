The plug inlet was oriented in a different spot and the motor mount was opposite on my old fan. Frustrating that this listing had so few specs and detail and no photos of the \"guts\" of the fan. If it had, I would have known this was the wrong replacement. Hopefully these photos will help others. Also it's a cheap price, but an equally cheap product - Note the poor blade-to-shaft connection, looks like it would melt off if someone accidentally left the fan running too long.",

It would have been helpful in the above product listing to know which exact model would ship, but we took a chance after looking at the Broan web site and were pleased with the results.

Also note, the opening is 3\" to exhaust, however you can purchase a adapter to use a 4\" flexible aluminum exhaust to the roof opening.
