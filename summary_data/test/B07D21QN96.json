To top it off it washes easily with no ink bleeding AND it covers our entire king bed and then some....I could not be happier sleep is amazing with this!!! A must buy:)",

The pillow cases have a little pocket to keep your pillow in place, which I didn\u2019t notice right away and was annoyed that they were short on my pillows! But they fit perfectly with the pocket in place. I would give this 5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f",

It's really neat and clean print work printed on both sides of the comforter. Absolutely beautiful. The comforter also came with 2 pillowcases, which was a nice surprise due to the fact that I wasn't expecting them. It came vacuum sealed so it takes a few days to unwrinkle, but once it does, its perfect!",
