The instructions are a little vague but having already purchased a similar cover I knew what to do. It seems to be very well-made and I felt that the price was quite reasonable. I found that I needed to move the pivot screws (of which you get extras) on the rear latch to the next location. Different trucks, different locations, maybe. I haven't been on the road with it yet but it feels plenty sturdy.",

It was very easy to install, came with easy to understand instructions, extra foam strips and a (under the bed rail) battery operated light. This is a quality made bed cover at a price you can't beat! It looks great and it is very securely held. If you have a Dodge Ram like mine buy one today!",

Instead believe the instruction to get the back of the assembly (the locking assembly within 1/16\" of the side rail - Step #5 in the assembly instructions). In my case this required bending slightly both side rails inward at the rear.",

It is not fun to have to stop on busy roads and risk life and limb for something as horribly designed as this awful piece of junk.

      "text": "I have bought many tonneau covers over the years honestly this was as good as any and at less than half the cost. The latch set up is plastic up at the tailgate but I have seen that on some expensive ones. Fit like a glove and appears to be made out of at least good quality materials. For the price you can\u2019t beat it compared to the stock cover and it even came with Storage bag!! The light that came with it was lame but the cover gets an A",

That put aside the cover itself also felt very cheap and I don't think this would last more than a year.",

I did like the fact the cover came in a travel bag so if you need to remove the cover from your truck your able to store it and keep it clean. I have a Dodge Ram 155 Quad Cab, the cover looks great. I did have to spend some time adjusting the rails to make sure the latch system for the cover fit correctly. Overall took about 20-30mins to completely install. I do prefer the roll up cover as well because you do gain full access to your truck bed and the cover rolls up for an easy tie off connection.",
