The sprinklers run at night and water still comes thru, which is good, less watering during the day. I made hoops so the fabric doesn't smash the plants when it gets really wet. I secure the cover with long stapled. Hail season is almost upon us, so i'm interested to see how it holds up. I'll do a follow up review then.",

After 2 years, these plant covers have done the job and are still in perfect shape. Be sure to wrap them snuggly at the bottom of your large pot (we use bricks) and don't forget to remove the coverings when the temps warm up. Otherwise, your beautiful plants will have a nasty burn in the spots that touch the covering and catch the most heat. Good luck. We are pleased with them.
