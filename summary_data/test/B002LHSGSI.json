It makes good use of force powers and action, while allowing you to explore the Dark Side of the force. Definitely a nice break from being a goody-goody all the time. Graphically, it's third person, with reasonably decent models and texturing. Controls are generally good, and game play is fast and furious most of the time. A good buy, even if not necessarily bargain bin priced.",

Luckily I had an xbox controller for windows laying around so I tried it out and it \"made\" the game for me. This game relies on lots of keystroke combos for special moves and without them I don't think it's possible to beat the game. Overall I would say the game was too easy on the \"difficult/hard\" setting. Some parts were overly challenging but overall the character is very overpowered. I also thought it was too short. The added content with this edition was fun though too namely Hoth and Mos Eisley.",

This game was made to be played on consoles, where, because of the design of the controllers you have the ability to truly unleash the force, however on a PC with the keyboard and mouse, the force of everyone is unleashed on you.

Other than that, it's a very enjoyable game, and takes some time to master all the moves and combos.",
