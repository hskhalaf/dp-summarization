The only drawback is the lack of a resealable package; not that the ration sections would last long enough to go bad anyway (most other rations take some encouragement to eat, not so much with these). Also, not at all thirst provoking. Highly recommended if your down for almost soft, lemon cake-y sweetness. Not so much if your looking for bland-pressed crumble-cake though, as there's none of that here.",

The taste is slightly citrusy on top of a shortbread flavor; very tolerable. I may get some more later to see what they'd be like topped or crumbled into like jam packets or something. I could see these being useful for camping as a dietary supplement; I think one could do well to crumble one into some mixed veggies and dried meat to make a soup, for instance.",

I can only hope that someday Mainstay creates other palatable flavors...",
