      "text": "NIce quality, but other than small side pockets two really large compartments so if only carrying 4 rackets and putting clothes, tennis ball cans etc in things go all over in the large bag. My previoius bag had 3 large compartment and two small side bags and things stayed better compartmentalized. If you are carrying more rackets and less clothes etc than it is great.",
