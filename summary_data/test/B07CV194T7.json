For minimal flash, these work quite well. I have incorporated these into my P90x3 workouts each morning, and it makes the pushup exercises a lot more bearable and manageable. I have had a great improvement in the amount of reps I have been able to do during each workout. I had expected something heavy and better looking, but these were low maintenance, light, and collapsible for easy storage. Very satisfied!",

Some very minor assembly is required (it'll take you less than a minute), and then they're good to go. Because they're so light, they'll travel easily. I try to do some low key strength training every morning, including body weight exercises. These bars have made my push-ups (always the most difficult for me) more bearable. Definitely recommended for any novices like myself trying to develop more upper body strength.",

There is a nice angle to the pushups bar which add to the comfort. The hold is nice too. Cons on this is that they are way too light. They are made of plastic; I wish some metal was used to make it more durable. Also, on my floors, even though there is some rubber on the bars, they still slip as I\u2019m doing the pushups. I hope this was helpful. Thank you.",

If you're a push up lover but you find your weak link is the strain on your wrists, give these a try. They feel flimsy and I was initially anxious about putting my weight on them, but they are solidly built, despite their light weight. Easy to store. Recommended.",

They are quick and easy to assemble and can be easily taken with you while traveling. The grips are comfortable with some foam padding (not sure how long it will last, but so far so good). These have really made all the difference in my workouts and I would not go back to doing push ups without bars like this.",

The ones I use at the gym are metal but this is a decent, cheap alternative for use at home or travel (really won't add much to suit case weight). Each bar weighs 8.35 oz, so around 1 pound for the set, very light weight. Odd that the logo was only on three of the four bottoms, maybe a quality control issue. It did hold my weight, male at 175. They gripped the floor and didn't slide around. For $15, is decent enough.",

And with so little weight, there's no way they'll stay in place! Well, don't I look sheepish now. Not only did they survive a number of push-ups, the rubber feet keep them securely in place on both carpet and tile. Yes, there's minor assembly required (the feet need to be shoved onto the bars), but that takes less than a minute before you're ready to go. Now get swole!",

The padding around the handles was also very comfortable and seems pretty sturdy. Like all grips like this, you can use them in a wide variety of angles and they allow you to take the push-up deeper than if just on the floor. For someone like me with a history of carpal tunnel, these allow me to do push-ups that I simply could not do before.",

It is easier to get the right form, the exercise is more comfortable, and you can dip down much lower than normal pushups for extra strength building. These are great quality and while made of plastic, they are super sturdy. I was a bit skeptical when I assembled (a ten second process of connecting the base to the hand bar) that these would be study, but they are so solid those concerns vanished immediately.",

The angle makes pushups less painful on your wrists but the pushups are harder, as you have a wider range to move through. Your wrists do get tired faster though! The rubber bumpers keep them from slipping, that worked fine on low pile carpet and a slightly rough tile but they did slip a bit on a very smooth floor. For fifteen bucks these are a no brainer.",
