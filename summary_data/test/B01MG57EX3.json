Easily installed in 10 mins and up and running within 20 mins of opening box. With the right software settings it scans from the sheet feeder and outputs to my Brother WiFi printer so works effectively as a small volume photocopier. Document naming needs a bit of care but once done works with no issues. Good quality scans too. Overall a great scanner thank you Epson.",

This makes it possible to scan more challenging documents such as books, passports and delicate items, whilst still quickly scanning in stacks of pages.\n\nThe small footprint of the scanner means that the DS-1630 fits into any environment, whether you are looking for a domestic scanner, in a customer facing workspace or need a high-quality office scanner.\n\nBoost efficiency with a number of intelligent features. The DS-1630 is equipped with Epson\u2019s Image Processing Technology, offering a number of smart colour and image adjustments including auto crop, skew correction, background and blank page removal. Long document mode makes it possible to scan over 3m of single-sided paper.\n\nThe DS-1630 boasts a scan speed of 25 pages per minute, making it one of the fastest amongst comparable scanners. With fast USB 3.0 connectivity, the speed is never slowed, even with scanning at 300dpi high resolution. Double-sided scanning capabilities saves time and boosts efficiency. Scan directly to server locations, the cloud or Microsoft SharePoint and create up to 30 scan jobs with the optional network panel.\n\nEpson software included with the DS-1630 enables dual image output, meaning you can scan once and send to two different destinations. The DS-1630 also encourages easy scanning to folders, email, online storage accounts and more.\n\n\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nProduct is sourced and shipped from the European Economic Area (EEA).
