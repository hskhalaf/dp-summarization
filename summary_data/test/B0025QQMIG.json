One visual alert for both K and Ka so you how no idea if it's a legit signal. It alerts for every single blind spot sensor, and of course nothing to differentiate between that and any real threat. Yet it barely detects a K band sensor I pass every day that my R1 alerts to from 100 yards out and then pegs out the R1 as I pass by.",

But I was surprised at the quality and performance of this detector and I have only owned it a week. Even better, I believe it might have saved me from a ticket yesterday. With collision avoidance radar standard on many new cars, my previous detector false alarmed constantly. This XTR-130 occasionally gets fooled but less often. A road I often drive has a fixed K-band radar displaying speed and the XTR-130 starts alarming at the same spot my previous detector did so the sensitivity is the same.

      "text": "This won't protect you from a ticket or detect a cop whose radar gun is down, but nothing really will. Instead, the incessant warnings from this device will keep you mindful about your speed. That's the real benefit of most radar detectors, and this one is a discrete and affordable option.",

    "title": "Whistler XTR-145 Laser Radar Detector: 360 Degree Protection, Icon Display, and Tone Alerts",
    "description": "The Whistler XTR-145 radar detection provides total band protection against all radar guns used today - including X-band, K-band, Superwide Ka-band and laser. It delivers 360 degrees of complete perimeter protection, detecting signals from the front, sides, and rear. The icon display provides distinct visual symbols of alerts detected and engaged modes, while the tone alerts provide audible alerts for bands received. Alert periscopes provide an additional visual alert by displaying LED\u2019s on top of the unit. Features VG-2 detection, vehicle battery saver that shuts off the radar detector when not in use, and alert priority, as well as 3 city modes that reduce the annoyance of false alerts caused by common X-band radar sources such as security systems or door openers. Included with the radar detector is a power cord, windshield bracket kit, a user guide, and a limited 1 year manufacturer warranty. Permits operation of traffic radar guns at X Band(10.500 - 10.550 GHz),K Band (24.050 - 24.250 GHz), and Ka Band (33.400 - 36.000 GHz). Note: A radar detector will only alarm if an officer is transmitting on any one of the above radar bands\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhistler's XTR-145 is an affordable, full-featured laser/radar detector. With total band protection from radar signals, 360-degree laser detection, Whistler's patented VG-2 cloaking technology, and plenty more, you'll get an effective detector that doesn't break the bank.\n\nEffective detection that doesn't break the bank. \nClick to enlarge. \n\n4.41 x 2.84 x 1.35 inches and just 5.4 ounces. \n\nThis unit features Whistler's low-profile \"alert periscope\" LEDs that flash when the unit alarms. \n\nTotal Band Protection\nProvides Complete Band Coverage of all Laser, Radar (X, K, and Ka bands), VG-2, and Safety Radar bands. \n\nIcon Display\nThe XTR-145's bright icon display offers easy-to-read display to indicate power, city mode, radar band identification, and signal strength. \n\n360 Degree Protection\nUnits with 360 protection detect signals from all radar, laser, VG-2 and safety radar systems wherever they come from; front, rear or from the side. \n\nVG-2 Cloaking\nThe VG-2, also known as a \"radar detector detector,\" is a special receiver used by police to detect signals radiated by a radar detector. Thanks to Whistler's patented VG-2 cloaking technology, your detector will remain invisible to VG-2 detection. \n\n3 City Modes/Highway Mode\nHighway mode provides full audio and visual warning of laser/radar systems while maintaining full sensitivity, and is the default setting of Whistler laser/radar detectors. City mode helps reduce the annoyance of automatic door openers and burglar alarm alerts by providing an initial alert (same distance as Highway Mode) then remaining quiet unless the signal strength becomes very strong. When the signal increases the unit will alert briefly to notify you of the change in signal strength. \n\nQuiet/Auto Quiet Modes\nPressing QUIET before a signal is detected engages Auto Quiet Mode, which automatically reduces the audio level after the initial warning to a low audio level setting. Pressing QUIET during a radar/laser encounter silences audio alerts, while allowing visual alerts to keep you informed. \n\nVehicle Battery Saver Mode\nThe Vehicle Battery Saver Mode automatically shuts off your detector within 3 hours if you forget to turn it off. The timer is reset if the detector is turned off, unplugged or any button is pressed before the 6 hours have expired. The detector will alert you with an audible and visual warning before it shuts off. \n\nAlert Priority\nWhen two or more signals are received at the same time, the alert priority is: Laser, VG-2, Speed Radar, Safety Radar. \n\nExample: If X band is alerting, then suddenly a VG-2 signal is detected, the VG-2 warning will override the X band alert. \n\nTwin Alert Periscopes\nWhistler's Low Profile Alert Periscopes provide an added attention getting visual alert. The two extra LEDs flash on and off when the unit alarms to provide a unique visual alert. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nWhistler XTR-145 Radar/Laser Detector, Windshield Mount, Power Cord, User's Manual",
