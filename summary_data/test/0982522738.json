If you want to learn the lifts, it would be better to watch Rip teach it on youtube. There is very little information on programming or the SS method here. If you want that info, you need to look at Practical Programming (same author).",

Strive to improve along a dimension you predict and measure, that's training. Try to do better than someone else or everyone else, that is competition. Mark Rippetoe suggests that exercise, recreation and competition will all improve when you train. Lifting a barbell is the way that homo sapiens sapiens become incrementally stronger on purpose. Mark is a trained anthropologist who knows how to observe by participating, in light of what we know about our species. If you like to exercise, relax, or compete at anything, following his instruction will improve your life.",

This is not some guru's opinion on what you should do. It is all scientific and with all the reason as to why and how. It definitely helped me. I had to decrease drastically the weight but by doing it correctly it actually feels like I increased the weight and tension time. Stop working out and start training. One of the best investments I ever made on training.",
