It has the flat sole of a tennis shoe (which can be a bit slippery if you're walking on, say, wet ceramic tile) and is not very quiet if you're walking on hard floors.

She had a problem with her pinky toe that makes wearing certain shoes, or walking around barefoot, uncomfortable for her. She says these are super comfortable and make it easy on that foot to walk around. Update: She loved these while they lasted, but they fell apart. Big holes developed on the inside soles. Cheap material I guess.",

This is definitely of a better quality than the cheapo slippers on Amazon, but you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere for more arch support or airflow. Doggos will immediate wish to eat them and will be a primary target, but it patches up really well with a knowledgeable sewing hand. Great buy for the price",

So I'm stuck with them scrapping all over the floor.",

The memory foam on these slippers does not compare to dearfoam nor isotoner. It felt not cushiony immediately after first wear. Lastly, these slippers are not as warm as mentioned brands. Practically not warm at all.",

I would definitely purchase these again, either for myself or a family member.",
