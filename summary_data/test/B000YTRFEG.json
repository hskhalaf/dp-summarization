It really seems to catch the light better and it almost looks like an illuminated TV in comparison. So not only can you put your speakers behind the screen for more realistic sound placement. But it catches the light and colors even better than PVC. Big thumbs up to this amazing screen. I've provided a few pictures.",

Takes a painfully long time for the screen to fully deploy, and the RJ-45 socket for the relay control would not reliably hold the connector. Biggest gripe is, and again this was a budget driven purchase so keep some perspective, because the screen does not use tab tension-ing to keep the screen sides tight, the screen material tends to curl in on itself as it drops...not enough to really affect the picture but it is kinda cheesy. In fact, that's how I would describe this screen; effective but rather cheesy.",

We honestly don't close it very often so not a big deal and the motor is fairly quiet.",

The problem is with the screen materials. The outer black edge has curled forward over 1 inch which causes warping at the edges of the image. I'm not looking forward to trying to get warrantee replacement based on other reviews I have read here.",

Not a single visible ripple or anything the very first time we used it. mounting with the included hardware was easy and fast. I am looking into purchasing another slightly larger one for the other side of our dining hall. The reviews were right about the initial plastic smell. But we left it rolled down for a couple of days and I don't even notice anymore!",

The good thing is you can't see the waves in the screen while watching movies. I really like the black edge on the side and bottom. It gives the projection crisp edges and looks very professional.",

For our application, it is hanging below a soffit and, when fully extended, is too low for our projected image (conference room). It would be nice to be able to stop it at a certain point.",

Similar priced screens include this. 2) there is no way to adjust the black drop top without voiding the warranty; there is a 12\" gap at the top which is way too long.",
