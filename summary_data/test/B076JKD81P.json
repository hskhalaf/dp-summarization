They were extremely light-weight, breathable and provided great arch-support for flat footed people. They arrived, and had rips and tears in the tongue of the boot. Stitching also seemed lazy throughout the rest of the boot with \"frilly\" ends. This was very upsetting after spending $150 on a product and ultimately receiving a lemon.
