I usually keep my powder container on top of the fridge but even if it fit up there, ti's so big and heavy I'd have a hard time getting it down to use it. I have to leave it sitting out on my counter which I hate since my counter is so small already. I wish they packaged it in smaller containers cuz I seriously have to consider getting something else just because it's so unweilding.",

This brand is made very clean, is GMP Certified and made in the USA. It\u2019s made with great ingredients and they have a new fan in Me. I would definitely recommend this to all!

      "text": "Casein powder typically mixes thicker than whey protein, so make sure you have enough of liquid of your choice to mix it, else it will leave it very chunky. The taste of the chocolate flavor is really good, very tasty. I try and take casein after a morning workout if I know I'm going to be hours away from my next meal, keeps me a little fuller versus whey. Good ingredient list in general, little bummed by the use of suclurose. I like this product, would like to try it in shakes as well.",
