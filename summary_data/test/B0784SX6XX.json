Having it delivered by my wonderful UPS driver was fantastic because he will set it inside the door -all I have to do is cut open the wrapper and take the individual packets into the cats' room! I have used Fresh Step for a long time because of it's effectiveness, but now all I have to do is throw away the empty packets in the trash. WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!",

When I opened it, the plastic around the bags had holes in it as well as some of the bags which caused litter to be all in the bottom of the box. Now I have to figure out what I'm going to put the litter in. I'll just buy it at the grocery store or pet store as I always have and avoid the headache!",
