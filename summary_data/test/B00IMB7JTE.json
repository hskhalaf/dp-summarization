Since it's leather, I will not wear it in situations where I know I will sweat a lot. But it looks nice in other circumstances.",

What\u2019s especially odd is that the light on both watches work just not keeping time.

I have had the watch for a couple of weeks and am still waiting for the strap to conform to my wrist. I might get a different strap if this one doesn't work.

It glows with a nice soft light at night which is not glaring or disturbing but yet light enough to see the dial clearly. Great job on this watch, Timex! It is a classic with style.",
