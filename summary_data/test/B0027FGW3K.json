I don't need all the channels but maybe some people do and I don't know how satisfied they would be with this product if this is the case. I just want to watch PBS and the morning news and its wonderful for this - I get about 10 channels in an area which has very poor signal. Well worth paying just the refurbished price. I bought one from a store for full price and then added this one from Amazon for less than half what I paid for the new one. This one works exactly the same!",

I went back to the old rabbit ears that can at least be redirected and adjusted to receive the best signals possible.

I got many HD and non-HD channels as soon as I hooked it up. This I was very pleased with. However, I cannot get channel 6 ABC. I've noticed alot of other people can't either. Very strange.
