I love that the surfaces are smooth, but I did notice the colored part of the seating was chipping in a few places within a few days. Other than that it's been a great set!",

This engineering goes into the stools and chairs, so everything is rock solid. Easy to set up and use quickly. The set almost has a museum look, maybe not even \"almost\" but looks like they would fit in a museum. Good quality set.",

The thing that captured my attention the most is the look--you can see it's high-quality, and sturdy. I expected Ikea-type quality, but this is far better, and far more sturdy. I highly, highly recommend this for kids rooms or, in my case, grandma's playroom :)",
