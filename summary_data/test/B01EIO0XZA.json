I've had it less than 2 months and used it 5 times at outdoor concerts and tailgating. The 6th time I used it one of the slats fell off and I noticed that others are loose. The boards are stapled on there and clearly not very well. I had a C&B table like this previously and it lasted YEARS without any issues. I guess you get what you pay for. Take my advice and spend the extra money!",

It is the perfect size for dinner for two. I highly recommend this product.",
