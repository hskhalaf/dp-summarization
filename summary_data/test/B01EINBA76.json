I'd say Embark is more accurate and detailed, but it's also twice the cost. :D Wisdom Panel: - Chihuahua 50% - Pomeranian 12.5% - Shih Tzu 12.5% - Undefined breeds 25% Embark: - Chihuahua 36.8% - Pomeranian 15.2% - Shih Tzu 22.5% - Miniature Pinscher 7.9% - Cocker Spaniel 5.2% - Others 12.4% The difference is minimal in my opinion so your call. By the way my dog is very cute!.",
