My sister and I actually started installing it and it was fairly easy with the help of the instructions but ultimately my dad finished it off for us, he has more experience. In terms of design it is very beautiful very shiny and the 3 pieces look beautiful together.",

I say this because the Brantford looks expensive, cleans easily and many friends have commented on how beautiful it is. The Brantford collection has many accessory items such as hooks, bars etc. You will love the Brantford - it operates accurately and installs easily. I own three of them and I'm sold.

The tub spout is heavy, we had to use clear silicone/caulk to get a better seal. However the old tub spouts distributor had a hissing sound that this spout fixes. As others mentioned the temperature knob is not flush, but that is true for most of the products I saw at the box store. It looks fine to me. The water pressure could be stronger, but I think that about all shower heads.",
