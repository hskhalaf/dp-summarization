So, you may want to keep in mind who has to put the dang thing up. Update today, March 14, 2019. Less than 18 months later, the dang thing is broken and headed for the trash. One of the screws in the flexible arm has literally broken off. The washer is worn out, not flat like normal, but warped. I only used this daily for about 20 minutes. I will be buying another, but certainly not this brand.",

I bought an \"open box\" item, but it appeared to be brand new, never opened. The box just had some slight damage to it, but the item had no damage at all. Great price and it works just like my old one did.",

If you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need a lighted mirror then skip this one and look for something else. If lighting is important, then also keep looking.

It's like using a candle to put on makeup with. It's also very heavy - heavy enough I would worry about it coming loose from the wall. It's much thicker than appears on the web page. It's old-school incandescent lamp design in a day that LED's are in. I didn't install it so I gave it a 3 on installation. The positive is that it plugs directly into a receptacle and has a nice looking cord.",

I made the mistake of mounting it to the wall with the base as the reference for height, but that put the mirror way too high for my face. Luckily, I just swivel it down so I can see in it. Make sure you mount it with the mirror as your reference point (duh).",

Following the instructions closely, I managed to install the mirror securely to the wall. It looks great, but the 25 watt bulb is too weak to outshine the illumination from above - you have to turn off the main light in order to get the halo lighting effect. I should have gotten one with a circular fluorescent tube for illumination.",
