It does say that if you use both shower heads at the same time, the water pressure will reduce. It did for me, but it wasnt that big of a deal. It was like being in a rainfall of water! Very relaxing. If you follow the instructions exactly and take into consideration the leakage tips, you should have no problems putting this together. Let's see how it holds up over time.",

My problems with it are that it's very difficult to change the water settings.I feel like the little tab that's used to change it from one setting to the next is going to break on me each time I turn it. Another problem is that the handheld portion always slides forward. You have to set it in the cradle just right, or it turns down towards the floor. I don't think I would recommend this to a friend.",

I turned the diverted off, and the main shower head works fine with no leaks, then try again to utilize both, and the diverted continues to spray everywhere. Cheap, junk product. And, for those of you thinking it's gotta be user error; I've been a plumber for 17years.",

Having the hand held also helps with the six year old as well as the 10 year old pug. You are able to switch between both shower heads, or use both simultaneously. The lights are powered by water, so no worry about batteries or anything electrical (HOORAY SCIENCE!).",

Still, the fact that I want to exchange it suggests (at least to me) that it's enjoyable while it lasts! The colors are really only dazzling if you're showering in very low light, like candlelight, but if you're a fan of quiet meditative showers in the dark, this might be the shower head for you!",

When I noticed the new device, I had hoped that the color issue had been addressed. However, with the currently purchased device, the colors do not correspond to the water temperature. There is no relation to the water temperature, unlike the previous device, and I guess I will have to wait to see how long the lights will last before they stop operating. Oh well...",
