      "text": "I bought both the AmazonBasics and Altura Circular Polarizer. Both are effective. I feel like the Amazon version threaded on to the lens easier. Possibly because the ring is considerable wider. There was no vignetting on a 24-105mm at 24mm with either filter. Attachment compares AmazonBasics, Altura and No Filter. Shot as Large Jpeg, no editing in post. To my eye, the Altura imparts a slight green tone. I liked the packaging on the Amazon version - the case has indentations/rings to keep the filter from flopping around when in the bag. Between the Amazon and Altura, I would select the Amazon version.",

I am usually very satisfied with Amazon basics products so I thought it was worth the risk, especially with the low price. I was not prepared for how great this filter is. Sedona has some great red rocks and blue skies. With this filter on, I was able to filter out unwanted lights and get deep blues & reds. I did not get any vignetting or flaring with my Tamron 28-300 lens. I do not have any Wide lens, so I cannot comment on that. I have attached one photo from Sedona taken with this filter on.",

It barely cuts reflections, does almost nothing to enhance the sky, and generally does nothing more than darken my photo. I should've known better than to buy $12 glass, but I was enticed by all the good reviews that I didn't even notice they were years old. DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER.

Some will prefer that thinking that the full effect is harsh. It came in a useful square box which will serve as a storage box when the filter is not in use. CAUTION: The filter ring is very thick.

Having owned a multitude of Hoyas and Tiffens before, I can say this $10 CP hits the sweet spot.

Note: we did not have any of the issues some reviewers have criticized it for: namely poor craftsmanship and bad thread machining. Not to say they aren't real, just pointing out at least my copy did not suffer from any quality problems.",

Having done this, when I went to remove the polarizer for a dark indoor concert, IT WOULD NOT COME OFF. It took two of us 10 minutes of manipulating to get this off my lens. I promptly returned it.

As others mentioned, if tightened too tight it is hard to remove, but if too light, then rotating the polarizing density will unscrew the filter:) I attached it on top of my UV filter (yes, two filters may deteriorate the quality of the image, but not perceivable so far). That way it is tightly screwed, and the lens ring is not being damaged. It does take practice using such filter, as you need be 90 deg to the sun, but skies are bluer and shooting thru windows is more pleasant.",
