These speakers are amazing. For those concerned about bass - it is honestly phenomenal - use the (free) EQ application and you can set your own settings. This is seriously one of the best purchases I have ever made. Audyssey is unquestionably a premier source of breathtaking music equipment, and these speakers are only a testament to their ability. Wow.",

The most expensive sony and Bose were decent, but not amazing. The bass wasn't all that tight and the high end wasn't all that crisp. I decided to take a risk and try the Audessy....nothing short of amazing. How that sound comes out of such a small package is beyond me. Highly recommended!",

It can play music from a docked device, via audio cable and wirelessly via Bluetooth. It also syncs iPods/iPhones to attached computers.

But I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how great the system sounds. It has a very full sound to it. Good highs, good lows, and good mids. I am the owner of an $1800 Polk audio theater system so I know good sound when I hear it. Believe the reviews. This thing rocks. Buy it.",

The representative refused to reimburse me for the shipping, stating that it was company policy not to reimburse. The defect was their fault, not mine.
