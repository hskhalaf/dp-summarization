      "text": "I have one myself and I also gave one to my girlfriend and it is now her favorite jacket ever! It's only been one week and she tells me that she gets compliments from random people all the time. Also, it's actually perfectly warm and breathable! Just right for Bay Area weather. It feels super high quality and light! The zipper is amazing and the cuffs are CRAZY! They are the most comfortable but weather tight cuffs we've ever felt! Amazing! Best semi-light but warm jacket you can find. I tried multiple Northface and Patagonia jackets similar to the Atom and none compare.",

      "text": "This jacket is inexplicably warm for how thin it is! I wore it out with only a long sleeve shirt underneath, in low single digit weather, and didn't feel a thing (though I was walking so that helps). It's pretty wind proof and waterproof, I tested it in medium-heavy rain. The hood is key, it keeps you warm and dry. For some strange reason, it's not too hot to wear this on a 50 degree day either. I also love the tapered cuffs that keep out wind! I'm so happy with my purchase that I got one for my husband and one for my dad as well.",
