So I figured I'd try the upgrade this time and bought the Matrix. Same problem. After a few months totally frozen. I've tried everything under the google sun, and nothing will unfreeze it. Major design flaw. I love the concept though. I have the circle saw attachment and it works decently well. But a replacement drill attachment is almost the same price as the drill itself. I wish the manufacturer would do something to remedy.",

May not be a problem for most, but just to let people know, this drill is not going to hold up to any thing high torque for very long.",

Certainly some jobs call for bigger tools, but I find that 90% of the time they stay in the truck, because this will do most of it. This has plenty of torque for most small - medium jobs. It is not as nice as a Dewalt, but I the convenience, and portability are well worth the sacrifice. The fact that you can interchange the craftsman version too, gives this even more uses.",
