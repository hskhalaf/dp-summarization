As a result, I was going crazy trying to figure out why my 10-year-old version of the 501BN didn't do what the docs for this one said it would. Turns out, it's just old (it still works every bit as well as it ever did, but it just can't do everything this one does). Both the old one AND this one are still great switches, though.",

Connecting the TV HDMI cable to this device Output, then using 3 HDMI cables connecting to the device Inputs 1, 2, and 3 connected the Cable box, Blu-Ray player, and PS-3. Each product plays back with perfect quality and performance, and to top everything off the device will automatically switch to the next device once you turn on to use. Extremely user friendly, high performing, and is barely the size of a cigarette box. Anyone not wanting to buy a new television just for more HDMI ports, this is a must buy.",

One has to push the cable all the way in (and then some) to make it connect. Any disturbance/motion of the cable afterwards will make it lose connectivity with this device. Once one's connected the cables and made them work, one can't move this device even one millimeter, since it will make it lose connectivity. This is very annoying and strange. HDMI connectors don't normally suffer from such issues. These ones do.",

      "text": "I have had this for a few weeks now, and I have not had any issues! Sad that I must start a review that way, but it's true. I have gone through many cheaper switches, this one is awesome! It truly works as advertised and provides clean switching....something that other switches lack. I appreciate the fact that there is no freezing or stability issues. I have experienced nothing but rock solid build quality and seamless switching each and every time I use this! Thanks for a wonderful product that holds up to the test of many items plugged in at once! The autoswitch feature is also appreciated, and easily bypassed with the remote if you need to.",

Its quite annoying. Beyond that, the remote has to be very direct to it, even with a fresh battery. Not a whole lot of leeway. Unfortunately it breaks just after the return window closes, so I'm stuck spending money on yet another product. Very disappointed.",

The fact that it will turn on the TV (if you have hdmi control on your tv) and switch to the correct input when I hit the power button on a system always impresses me. Definitely the best bang for the buck when it comes to HDMI switchers. I velcroed it to the back of my TV. It is so light and small, the whole operation easily tucks away and works flawlessley with very little need for the remote.",

This product worked perfect, ran all the HDMI's into it. Its always hooked up. Has the little remote to just change to the input I want. Has bright LED lights on it in the front. Probably not the fastest selector but I also think my TV is a little slow getting the input. I totally recommend for that home entertainment system. Thanks Kinivo!",
