Mashed pressing and starching my jeans and shirts a breeze! It's electronic so setting it is so easy. I also really like the steam feature. If you do a lot of ironing, or perhaps like me you don't want to spend hours ironing, this is for you! I'm a pressing fool now, everything gets the treatment. From my wife's scrubs to my t-shirts, ha! I recommend this item, sure it's a little pricy, but in a firm believer inn you get what you pay for. Press on, people, press on!",
