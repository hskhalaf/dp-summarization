Since I didn't want to add more plastic (most glitter) to our planet, I decided to try this. It worked great, a little more subtle then the other stuff but I didn't let them put that much. Maybe more would give more sparkle. The kids were happy with that little extra in their slime and I was happy to make a conscious choice in product. Glad some companies are trying to give the consumers better, kinder choices!",
