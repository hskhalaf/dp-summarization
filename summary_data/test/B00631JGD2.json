I had it on for 4 to 5 hours and the chocolate kept flowing nicely even as the chocolate was getting to be a smaller amount as it was used . I put out strawberries , Apple wedges , rice crispy treats ,gaffer cookies , graham crackers , marshmallows and pretzels . The strawberries , Apple's and rice crispy treats were all gone everyone liked those the best . We will probably use this for most of our family parties for now on .",

Also, the heater itself was not warm enough.

So, I pulled this out for a party on May 12th (to use this for the 2nd time since I received it in early February), and within 20 minutes the motor made a loud horrible sound then sputtered to a stop and died. I quickly ran to the kitchen when hearing it, unplugged it, let it rest a bit then plugged it back in...tried to start it....nothing at all. It's disappointing to try a new brand and then have it die so unexpectedly.",

We set it up about an hour before my daughters birthday party was set to start as we had never used a chocolate fountain before and wanted to make sure that it was ready to go when guests arrived. One hour later right as the first guest was arriving it simply stopped working. We read the manual and tried everything that was recommended. We tried checking for clogs, unplugging it and letting it cool off for a little while, nothing worked, you could hear a humming but the motor wasn't spinning so we were left with a bowl of melted chocolate and no chocolate fountain for the party.",
