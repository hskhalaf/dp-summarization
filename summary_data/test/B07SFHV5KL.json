      "verdict": "The Nike Zoom Fly 3 enjoys its fair share of positive reviews from consumers. Its quality is mostly held in high regard, save for the outsole which is apparently quick to wear off. Furthermore, the performance of the midsole has its critics, with some stating that the underfoot experience is a bit too soft for extended runs. But the same part also savors praise from those who like its push-off power. The design is also noticed by admiring eyes.Fans of road running shoes who are neutral pronators are the target market of the Nike Zoom Fly 3.",

        "The generous height of the midsole unit allow for extended running sessions, according to most runners",
        "The aesthetics of this neutral running shoe are praised for being highly appreciable and street-ready",
        "A couple of purchasers welcome the traction capacity of the outsole, likening it to a car tire that can handle the wet and dry ground"

Definitely NOT for walking or gym training because the hyper bouncy heel makes the shoe totally unstable for any activity where you put weight on the heel (true runners land somewhere in the middle of the sole so that's prefect for them and very stable in that case). Everything about this shoe feels very high quality, it's quite remarkable.",

If you are an inexperienced recreational runner who likes to do <3 mile runs at a slow pace you may find these shoes to be a bit much (maybe even uncomfortable). If you\u2019re a decent runner currently using something like the Pegasus 35/36 you will most likely start breaking all your PB\u2019s with this shoe. They almost auto-correct your form with the way they encourage you to be more forward leaning with a better foot strike. At ~ $170 I would say these are some of the best shoes on the market.",

The first few times I ran in them, they felt kind of wobbly. Basically, I really had to concentrate on my stride and how I distribute my weight. Once I got the hang of it, the shoes started feeling much better. I can definitely feel the bounce in them. One of the best things is that improving my stride has greatly reduced the post run pain in my knees. Love these shoes! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",
