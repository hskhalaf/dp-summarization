The \u201cbamboo\u201d fibers get stuck to any areas of skin the diaper touches, and these diapers leak faster than Pampers, Huggies, Honest Co, Seventh Generation, Earth & Eden, and most any other luxury or inexpensive alternative. Most significantly, these diapers cause burns so bad, a doctor had to prescribe medication to keep the wounds from infection. These diapers contain harmful chemicals, not advertised, and only acknowledged when you contact the manufacturer. The manufacturer takes no responsibility whatsoever, and is completely unresponsive and unhelpful, regarding any concerns brought to their attention. They state that, although they manufacturer and profit from the sale of these diapers, any issue must be resolved by amazon. Absolutely horrid product, and heartless manufacturer.",

By that time she was 27lbs which is the minimum for XL. She again leaked. It's almost too big for her. The legs have gaps. And she actually has big thighs. So it's just not elastic enough. I won't be buying these again. I really wanted to like them since honest makes her a little red but never had an issue with leakage.",

Baby gets wet thighs, and the seat of the diaper itself becomes wet. A total waste unfortunately. I didn't buy these due to issues with sensitive skin, so I can't comment on that....",

They are very wide and while it doesn't seem to bother my son or the effectiveness of the diaper, I am wondering if it will start to inhibit any movement as he is becoming more mobile now. I wish the company would just make them more narrow. If you compare size to other brands you can tell a significant difference.",

It was always squirting out the tops and sides and staining her clothes. They need improvement in that regard. Would be better to have a quilted inside like a Pampers or Huggies so young baby #2 doesn't get out. It's very liquidy at that age and the smooth surface makes leaks too easy. Never had any issues with urine.",

They do not irritate our babies skin and they make us feel a little less bad for disposing of diapers rather than washing. We have tried all of the major diaper brands, and most contribute to diaper rash. These don't. Definitely worth the price. If you are looking for a great baby shower gift or helping a mom, this is an amazing item. If you are a mom and can afford the steep price, these are definitely amazing. Another option, is to use cloth diapers during the day, and these at night. (Our typical process which helps keep the cost down)",

She\u2019s 3 weeks old and doesn\u2019t produce much waste each time around so I\u2019m shocked this is an issue. I bought 2 boxes - such a waste.",

These are my favorite, though. And they don\u2019t smell like ammonia when she pees. Has no smell when clean either, unlike the others. Now these will be the only diapers we use. Also fit better than the other diapers because they cover more area and fasten more securely.",

And I feel better using them every once in a while (complement to cloth) because they have little plastic (like normal disposables which traditionally take 450 years to break down) and are made primarily of bambu, a biodegradable primary material. As far as minuses, you can start to feel moisture when they are very full, but of course, that is important to avoid letting baby sit in his own pee for too long. Great product! Thanks, Andy Pandy!",
