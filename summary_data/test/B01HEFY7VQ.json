I used it around the house while I was outside one day and then the misting effect quit working. It's still a functional fan, but at such slow a slow speed and without the mist it's a waste. Too bad I barely missed the window of opportunity to return this for a refund! I'm not sure the little bit of enjoyment I got out of it was worth nearly $20. I guess that's the chance you take when buying generic products on amazon. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",

It functions great with it's multiple wind settings and the mist comes out nicely, uniform, and strong. The water container on top where the mist comes from seals pretty tight so even when jostling around in my backpack it never leaked. It's a bit bulkier than your traditional mobile mister/fan but that's the price you pay for more air and more mist. It fit nicely in my mini-back I took to Disneyland. And it's easy to hold. It's also very light. I recommend!",

The mist also has 2 settings for continuous mist or intermittent mist. The top part of the fan contains the water reserve where you would use the tiny bottle squeezer to get water into the small hole. Overall, great product, I would totally buy for the whole family!",

      "text": "Great little fan. Lightweight and small enough for my 6 year old to hold comfortably. I think my favorite feature of this fan is the speed setting. This fan blows much harder than any of the foam blade fans we have previously purchased. The water tank isn't too big, but it holds probably close to 2 tablespoons of water. Worth the money for the fan alone in my book. Will be getting much use in the future.",
