To my dismay I forgot to bring them with me when I left the birthday party (60miles away) or else I would have returned them, unused. Supposedly good for gardeners though (according to some reviews I read) . Had no idea- maybe these sacks are still good for something, just not sack hopping.",

This would be fun for any age and could work very well at field days, outdoor birthday parties, picnics, beach outings, etc.",

The only draw back is that they have a strong smell to them and they do leave \"burlap\" threads all over your clothes. However - for an outdoor party who cares? The size is also pretty good - can be used by an average size adult. (probably not an overweight adult).",
