The knobs for turning on the oven make clicking noises and shouldn't be turned to fast or else you can strip them (truly no big deal). The design is modern and soft on the eyes. We made ours more realistic by adding battery operated led touch lights to the microwave, oven, refrigerator, freezer and above the range (see photos). Hope this review is helpful",

Also a couple notes of things that I ran into that I had to fix during assembly! I hope the notes help!

If the price of the product can fall by $40 in a matter of 10 days, there is surely something not right!!",

The big downside is the construction. It takes time, effort, and skill to put it together. The only directions are pictures - nothing written. If you plan to give this as a gift, make sure it arrives a few days before the event to allow ample time for assembly. DON\u2019T start this after your child goes to bed on Christmas Eve. Watch for the two different heads on the screws. Use the brown ones for areas that will be exposed. (That\u2019s a minor cosmetic thing.)",

Also, does NOT come with any pots/pans/food items to play with. So, if your kid needs those for the kitchen you need to get separately.",

Of course, this was being built the weekend before Christmas... we called first thing Monday morning, KidKraft sent us the ENTIRE parts package, 2nd day!!! Received it Thursday and finished assembly in no time. Added the IKEA pots and pans set which fit perfectly!. Little one has been playing non-stop! Wonderful customer service from KidKraft as well!",
