She was just under 15lbs when she passed, and her remains fit in the small urn just so. It's very pretty, our girl was fawn and the colors remind us of her. It's quite heavy, and obviously durable. The lid screws on which I appreciate, it's a nice touch. This is much nicer than the flower print tin she came back to us in. Again, I'm sorry you're having to shop for this... thank you for being such a loving owner for your buddy.",

I just put my 52 lb dog's ashes in it last night, and they fit beautifully with a bit of space to spare - although that is largely taken up by the ziploc they're also contained in. My only negative whatsoever - and now that the ashes are in there, maybe it's not a negative - is that it was extraordinarily hard to open; it took a few of us working at it before it loosened enough to open. Still, I'm very happy with it.",
