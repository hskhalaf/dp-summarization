      "text": "This started out being a great radio for the money, but about 5 months into ownership, it started to make a noise like a clock ticking when receiving a signal. Some others suggested turning off the clock so it isn't viewed from the main screen, which I did, with no improvement. Changing the screen , like toggling through the Menu screens while receiving a signal, brings more noise hash to the audio. I assume the screen is somehow injecting noise into the radio.",

You can program analog simplex and repeater frequencies very easily from the keypad. I did it without even reading the instructions. Makes changes while in DMR mode are possible as well. Some may be easier while connected to the computer. Just because of requirement to enter different menu entries versus having everything on the computer screen all at once. I have no regrets buying this radio. It is my go to portable radio now. I would and have recommended this radio to many people.",

Radio comes with everything needed in the box - radio, antenna, battery, charger, belt clip, programming cable and software. Good internal speaker and get good audio and signal reports from ham operators. Even though it isn't a scanner, the scan speeds or acceptable. After market antenna and external mic I bought for the BF-F8HP fit the HT as well. It feels substantial in hand but is no heavier than the motorola ht. DMR and FM sound awesome on this ht. The battery lasts for a couple days when mostly scanning. I'm hoping for a mobile version with about 50 watts someday.",

Some of the steps were not as clear as they should have been (a few seemed to missing altogether) and the videos that are on youtube are not up to date. It took a few local hams to help get the wrinkles ironed out, but there are still some glitches with the code plug. However, all that aside, once the radios are programmed, they are great. The radio itself is sturdy and solid. The display is easy to read once one figures out what all is on it.",

If you're driving in a car with the windows down, there's no need for an external speaker, you'll hear it, trust me.",

FYI the 868 does not use the normal baofeng type cable it has a chip built into the radio so it just has a pass through cable. Baofeng cables will not work with it.",
