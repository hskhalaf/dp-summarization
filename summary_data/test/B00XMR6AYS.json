For me I would prefer slimmer and sleeker, but for my young daughter, the extra grip and the extra protection is just what I was looking for. Depends on what a person is looking for as far as phone covers/cases, but this one is well made and I definitely recommend it for someone that may need that extra protection without spending a large amount of money for an Otter Box case or something like that.",
