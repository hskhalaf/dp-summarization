We haven\u2019t had any accidents luckily but the puppy LOVES THIS BLANKET!!! He loves it so much I bought a 2nd one so he could have one at the office when he comes there with me. He lays on it, covers himself with it, drags it around, & is just crazy about it!!! Definitely a great buy!!!",

I just bought a new couch and had been using geriatric bed pads to protect it, but then got this blanket. It's SO soft and happens to match perfectly! It's not embarrassing so when guests come over, I don't have to quickly wrap it up and throw it in a closet. I just ordered the giant version to cover the whole rest of the couch. The only downside is that it's so soft, so now she wants to lay on the couch more than on her dog bed. #lifewithdogs",

I keep it thrown over the bed when I'm out to protect the bedspread and thought it would blend in with the bedding but it looks messy very easily because the interior waterproof layer is very slippery and the 2 outside layers shift easily. That wouldn't be so much of a problem but the bottom layer is larger than the top so when you straighten out one edge, it pulls up the opposite side to show the underside. Kind of annoying. It's a good \"throw\" blanket but don't expect it to blend in nicely over your bedding or upholstery, it can't help but look messy.",

I have used other covers in her bed and on my leather sofa but no luck until now. Not only is this blanket esthetically pleasing to look at, it is soft and water proof. I have already washed it several times and it cleans up beautifully... Thank you PetAmi for this great product... I will be purchasing another blanket!!!",

The guinea pig fleece blankets are too expensive for that and found these to be sufficient. The main difference is the water will sit on top of these while guinea pig fleece will absorb it and keep the dry. I think flipping this over might have the same effect so the water seeps through the plush side. Not perfect but good for short times.",

It's \"caught\" the dog leaking 3 times now. I'm just not sure what happens to the waterproof ability each time I wash it, but so far I'm thankful!",
