Now it takes longer for me to see any detail because the field of vision is reduced. now useless. Will have to find another brand of wide angle bike mirror. Update 8/22/18: Emailed the company and complained, they said they are going back to the convex mirror in Sept. Hope they do.",

Real glass, great vision, compact, well-built and designed except the attachment of the mirror to the arm is less than desirable. The chicago screw comes loose all the time and within a month the nut came off! Recommend use blue loctite at initial installation or better yet get a small 10mm screw and lock nut. The owners of this company have yet to address this problem that they have known about for years. They should either put blue loctite on before shipment or use a screw and lock nut. The stability and sturdiness would get a 5 if they address this long standing issue.",

The hinge for the mirror need more tension, as it is held together with a rivet so there is no way of tightening. The joint is loose enough that the mirror flops out of position as soon as you start riding. I read that another user drilled out the rivet and replaced it with a machine screw, this is what I will probably end up doing to make this useable. Aside from these shortcomings, installation is a breeze and is toolless.",

The second thing is the fact that it mounts directly to the side of the handle bar rather than sitting on an arm.

      "text": "This was a pain in the ass to install. It didn't come with the shimmies and my handlebar was in the zone of being too big AND too small for a proper fit. I don't have any tools so I had to get creative. It took an hour and a half of experimenting to get something to work (I used some weird plasticy plant name stakes as shimmies). It's easy to adjust to where I can see it and has a nice view. It feels like it crowds my hand a little bit I just need to get used to it.",

I had a trick that worked perfectly. Some soapy water in the two rubber pieces of the mirror helped it slip right in. I turned the mirror and let it get tight. I waited a couple hours to let the water evaporate and BAM! Perfect fit, nothing moves and it works great! It does not move when you hit bumps and has a large field if view. I recommend this to everyone.",

On the left side hand grip, which was stationary, the grip installed and has not moved since and provides a clear image. The right side was installed where the throttle must have the ability to rotate. Because of this the mirror must be installed farther out and vibrates creating a blurry image and need for frequent adjustment. This is not what these mirrors were intended for and I believe they would work flawlessly on a bicycle and I am happy with what I received for the price.",

One draw back is the instructions appear to be for a different type of mirror, but instalation is simple and straightforward. Highly recomended",
