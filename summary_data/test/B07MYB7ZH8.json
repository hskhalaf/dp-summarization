I'm returning theses, it's dissapointing because the style is nice. I was hoping for a \"dressy\" pair of supportive sneakers to wear to work with khakis.",

In general we recommend the following guidelines for cleaning the footwear:Cleaning: on a regular basis, brush away any surface dirt with a soft brush. After extended, rugged use, wash with mild soap and warm water. Be sure to rinse all soap off as it is hydrophilic. Drying: open footwear fully, remove the insole and laces and dry at room temperature. Never expose to heat! Conditioning: recommended treatment depends on construction and materials of the footwear (most treatments do alter color and appearance).",
