Removing and cleaning the grids are much easier than sand filter I used to have. I rented a torque wrench from autozone before I bought my own to torque the clamp nut.",

All new fittings. 3 slips to remove unit in winter. I do this every year to help protect filter and motor from elements. Used gorilla glue for all fittings. Solid connections. Very happy.
