The trimmer would start just fine, but would not run at full throttle. It would just bog down and die. If I let the choke at about 1/4, it would run ok. Called Husqvarna support but their suggestion was to take it to a service center. I just bought the thing, so I'm not wasting my time going to a service center for s string trimmer. Bummer, I just retuned it.",
