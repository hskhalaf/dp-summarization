The dimensions listed on Amazon is the size of the package, but the actual size of this figure is no more than about 2-ish inches tall. Apparently there were also extra pieces included and instruction were understandable. Definitely wouldn't recommend giving this to someone under the age of 13 to build. This also isn't a toy because the pieces will come off if you handle it roughly, (cough-cough KIDS).",
