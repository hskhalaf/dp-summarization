Not worth the trouble of taking apart packaging it back up and trying to return it. I would like my money back, but we all know that is not going to happen.",

      "text": "it isnt quite fine furniture, and it isnt super sturdy, but it looks great and is holding up well. i cut a piece of underlayment to fit on top of the slats and it has held about 230lbs without issue. I moved the parts around so both guards are on the left side and the right side is against the wall- glad the symmetrical design makes this possible without much hassle.",
