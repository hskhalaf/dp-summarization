The belt definitely looks like a normal belt (I got the black one) and fits quite well. It is reinforced and provides more than enough strength to hold everything in place, especially when quickly drawing from a holster. I wear a size 40\" and purchased the 44\" belt which gave me more than enough options to make the belt exactly as tight as I needed.",

I'm able to easily support a G19 in an IWB holster with a standard belt. Here's an idea...try your holster and gun with your standard belt before buying. I wish I would've done that.",

Belt only reached second notch from the tip of the belt when I tried it on. Would work fine for OWB holster but not for IWB holster. Had to reorder belt in the next size up (40). Again, love the belt. Works great. Would recommend two sizes up if you consider this belt. To big is better than to small.",

It's stiff enough with the insert sandwiched between the layers of leather to handle the weight of a weapon, and the belt is finished very nicely. The problem is that this belt only has 5 adjustment holes. When using an IWB holster you need to add approximately 2\" for the additional thickness. It often depends upon what position you carry your holster in. Two extra belt holes would help. Also, you pay by the length. I bought a belt several inches longer than I've used in the past and it's still not long enough to comfortably carry IWB.",

      "text": "The product is great so far, I'll update this review after a few months of regular use. But after a day of wearing it the improvement is definitely huge. Feels very sturdy and no belt sag! As far as size, if you carry IWB, you definitely need to add 4\" to 6\" depending on how large of a holster you've got. The sizes provided are very accurate, but reflect the size of the belt at the last hole. So if you order your size it won't be able to fit an IWB holster. But other than that it's awesome, so far. As I said, I'll update in a few months of use.",
