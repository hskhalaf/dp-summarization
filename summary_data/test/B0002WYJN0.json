The software has almost all the features I could want, like the \"find duplicate cards\" feature. (Because if you go to the same trade shows and see the same people, chances are you have more than a few duplicates in that pile of cards.) I do wish the scanner itself was a tad smaller. Or, for the price, I think it should have a feeder so it could scan a stack of cards at once, instead of hand-feeding each one... But it still works well and saves tons of time as it is.",
