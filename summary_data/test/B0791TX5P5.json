I'm using this primarily to watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Movies and surprise NFL Sunday Ticket! This is super easy to set up which I also was surprised at but you need to have on hand- they should tell you this ahead of time but they don't unless I missed something: 1. The wireless network number you're on, the network key that connects you to that network, the user names and passwords on apps that you might want to add like NFL SUnday Ticket, Netflix, etc. If you have that its easy.",
