This was my first Lexar purchase and will be my last. The card stopped working after one use, reported itself as constantly write-protected, and all efforts using disk check/repair tools, formatting tools, etc., failed. I recommend reading the comprehensive review posted by U. Bank, as I believe my problem was the same - these cards are clearly not going through an effective quality control check. Thankfully, Amazon took care of me with their usual excellent service.",

Again - I didn't use the card excessively or put it through extreme conditions. It simply stopped working. I will not be buying another one of these again. Spend your money elsewhere.",

This is quite upsetting as reviews for this card were great which pushed me to select it. Sorry, but I must downgrade my review to a 1 star as the footage of a VERY important and unrepeatable event was ruined. It may be a bum card and I would be open to a replacement to test it, but Amazon says it is too late to make an exchange. :-(",

I was able to load between 3GB and 20GB at a time before the device experienced thermal shutdown. Device was too hot to touch upon shutdown and had to cool down before the computer would see it again. Do I have a problem unit or is this the unavoidable nature of the beast?

Lexar just synced seamlessly with my mobile and so far hasn't caused any issues. Keeping my fingers crossed! It is pricey but worth it.",
