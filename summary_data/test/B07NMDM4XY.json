Installation is a snap, simply mount the monitor to iether the windshield or the dash, plug into your power port/cigarette lighter and you\u2019re done up front. Open up your tail light (iether side-doesn\u2019t matter) and connect to your power wire going to you\u2019re reverse bulb (you can also use full-time-power) and connect the ground. Done. Close up you\u2019re tail light, mount you\u2019re camera to you\u2019re license plate, connect the wire and you now have clear vision of everything behind you. Simple...and very effective!",

It had good directions that were easy to follow and easy to install, it only took me about an hour and I\u2019m no mechanic by any means.",

Wiring it to the reverse lights makes it so the camera only turns on when the car is in reverse so it\u2019s not always on whitch is a plus for me and the screen is Thebes perfect size not to big not to small. All around great camera and definitely a great option",

One wire to my backup lights and the other to a ground. I used the supplied cigarette lighter adapter for the monitor and it took less than 15 minutes to install it. Works well and the video quality is good enough to see what is behind you when backing up to a trailer I plan on adding a switch to the camera so I can turn it off and on without having the truck in reverse. It really is a good camera for the price.",
