I was cautious and mine did not break. I will say the plug was difficult to get to pop out. The mattress is deep and has nice thick corners. It's very comfortable and wavy which helps eliminate pressure points. The vinal smell is pretty strong though and I hope it goes away in time.. soon I hope it fade soon it is really strong. It was really easy to fold out and fill. Overall it is a good mattress and I'm pleased with my purchase.",

I now have glue on the tiny tiny hole and will try to patch my brand new mattress again. Just wish it was made of a thicker material. Never had a problem with my cat with the previous mattress.",

The cap couldn't be made any thinner and it's an accident waiting to happen every time you need to access it. All of my previous mattresses had a thick sturdy cap that never was a threat of slipping its threads when being pulled out when needed.",

It seems like a thicker vinyl which means the sloshing noise is reduced. I like the center fill location as that seems to make it easier to expel air. CON: The pull tabs on the fill cap broke the first time I attempted to use them. They just pulled off. It seemed like a good idea, but they are not strong enough obviously. The real test will be the durability. I had the old mattress for 33 years before it sprung a leak.",
