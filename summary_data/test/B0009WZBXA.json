On my 20' Regal I have six 6 1/2\" Kenwood speakers driven off of the internal amp (front 2) and the mid and rears driven off of a 400 Watt 4 channel amp. Sound was loud and clean but it was missing something. This is the perfect complement to any good system without a sub. Look to make use of the storage space under seats as the bass cabinet. It was a bit unnerving cutting into the boat but take your time, measure three times and go slow.",
