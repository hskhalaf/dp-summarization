I just guess temperature based on common sense like the middle would be medium....hopefully. Also, while the size of the cook surface is usually sufficient, I wish it were a little bit larger for when I want to cook several items.",

Do NOT use cooking spray on it. It will cause buildup and make foods stick.",
