      "text": "I wanted a simple, point-and-shoot to replace my defunct Kodak Easy Share LS443. After reading several reviews of this and another camera, I chose this L610. I've had it for two months now and have used it some and it's all that I wished it to be. Easy to use and takes great pictures of family, outings, kids' sports, etc. Software is a pleasure compared to the old Kodak Easy Share software, which was never easy or intuitive for me. I'm not a professional photographer, just a weekend, picture-taking grandpa and this camera does it for me at a good price.",

But they got it right with the coolpix l610 ISO settings are auto or you can manually change ISO for whatever your needs are. This camera takes 2AA batteries alkaline, lithium, or rechargeable. Only downside is battery not as good as my coolpix l 100 but that did take 4 AA maybe why it had better battery life but still a great camera great pictures. Consumer Electronic City is the seller and they delivered camera fast and everything was as they said thank you",

I have always been wary of the battery cover door because of the apparent pressure on a very flimsy locking mechanism. I dropped the camera from about 2 ft on a carpeted floor and the battery compartment flew open and the locking mechanism was broken. This is the \"Achilles Heel\" of this camera.",

But at sporting events, parties, baby smiles, and graduation, very hard to use, as the 'moment' passes by too quick for the camera to react. However, when taking still shots of adults or older children who sit still, nice pictures are produced. Therefore, i am not quite sold yet on this camera, because of the difficulty point and shooting quicky. I have been using it for 9 months and wish i had a different one now.",

My 5 year old Canon had one but no one has now. Pictures in bright sun just more difficult. Very crisp and good telephoto though. Also Nikon should really add just a little to the price and include lithium batteries as you are going to need them. I am a fan of AA batteries but get lithium. Nice size camera for me as I like to know I have a camera, not a credit card in my hands.",

The zoom tends to give fuzzy photos and the camera's response time is slow (for zooming, between taking photos, etc.).",

Just for fun, we zoomed in as far as we could and took a picture of the house at the end of our street. It came in perfectly clear. As far as battery life, so far no problems. We purchased Eneloop rechargeable batteries at the same time as the camera. We take a lot of pictures with just having a baby and have not even needed to recharge once.",

Maybe I'll have to resort to a card reader or get a different camera.",
