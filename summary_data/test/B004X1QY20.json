      "text": "The price is right and most importantly, the product works super well! My sister bought me the more expensive urban decay setting spray as a gift and it doesn't even compare. The urban decay I found still allowed my eyeliner and mascara to run within a few hrs and it also felt sticky all over my face. To be fair, I am one of those people, that no matter waterproof or whatnot, make up just runs off my face... Sad... and yet, this cheap little prodcut has been able to keep my face brand new all day! Granted, it also feels sticky when I spray it on but after a few mns, that feeling disappears so would definitely recommend this.",

Ordinarily, my foundation would have melted like butter, and I'd have lines everywhere. My husband kept confirming that despite sweating, my makeup was staying put. I just got home and checked? You can see the sweat on my face, but other than looking like I need a bit of powder, nothing budged! I have oily skin in spots too, but that hasn't affected me tonight! I'll definitely keep buying this!",

Now it holds for the entire day, and still looks reasonably fresh by 5PM. I'm delighted with the results--so much so that I'm ordering another bottle to give to a friend to try.

But its also perfect for refreshing your makeup halfway through the day, and its heavenly on a hot, sticky summer day. And you absolutely cannot beat the price.

It's nice in the summer as a cooling mist if you refrigerate it. It's useful for misting even if you are not wearing makeup. Spraying this gives me a dewy look. I think it's most useful for toning down dryness if you accidentally caked on too much foundation or powder. The fluid is unscented, and didn't break me out. Would purchase again.",
