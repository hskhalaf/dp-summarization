She told me, that every time the dog barks, she blows the whistle and he stops. What a relief !! Thank you!",

After one week of a short blow after every bark - coupled with the \"stop barking\" command, I think he is beginning to get it. He may still go tearing for the door at every sound but after the very first bark/whistle combo he quickly settles into a low, soft growl. I'd say it works. The lanyard is nice so we always have it at hand. Thinking of ordering another one so each of us can have one at the ready. Conclusion - it works if you use it properly.",

The quality seems good with a stainless steel body, so I expect it will last a long time. I really like the included lanyard, so I can easily take it with me on walks and keep my hands free for the leashes. The effectiveness of it will depend on the dog and how you use it.

Even if she can't see me, she comes running when she hears the whistle. Mind you, her initial reward treats where bits of pound cake, but she comes now without any food reward although she gets all manner of \"good girl\" attention. I highly recommend.",
