Screen The resolution is good with very crisp text and fine color and brightness. Keyboard Very responsive with comfortable keys in size and travel. Trackpad Very good and precise. Responsiveness It is quite good with the i5 processor. I have installed some Linus apps as well and they work fine. Quirks Some Android games only display a black screen. When copying files to an external UBS stick formatted as ExFAT, the process simply stop with no error messages at all. All surfaces are very receptive to fingerprints.",

Looking at my task manager it stays at a very low level. Naturally I group my apps and extensions into a picker extension which also allows quick disable all.

In general the screen look grayish and dirty, without any crispness. Lenovo has made this powerful laptop with very good internals and then slapped a cheap display on it, if you like good brightness then don't buy this laptop, it will disappoint you thoroughly, no one can work on a display that just not bright enough, regardless of the processing goodness.",

This is all aluminium body - very well built. Fast and clean looking. i5 with 8GB RAM is enough to carry out any work. I compared many Chromebooks and ended up picking this one. This is much better than chromebook. Fold this book and it becomes the biggest tablet you can wish for. Extremely happy with this purchase. Much faster than a windows laptop and much cheaper than an apple mac book.",
