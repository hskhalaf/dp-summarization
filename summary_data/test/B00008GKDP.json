Generously sized as well. PREVENT RUST after washing by drying it completely. Do not air dry. Do not use soap on it either. Hot water does the trick. Then dry it off and no rusting. Love cast iron!! No chemicals in your food like you get with non-stick pans.",

The steak actually sizzles like in a restaurant when you put it on the skillet.",

I wanted to make dough-less pizzas and thought that cast iron would be the perfect medium to try this out. Since the fajita skillet is meant to also be used as the serving plate, it worked great (since no dough = having to eat with a fork since it\u2019s basically cheese, sauce and toppings). My wife has used it to make fajitas and, as you would suspect, that works great too. Buy Lodge products...they will last generations and the likelihood that food will stick to it is pretty small.
