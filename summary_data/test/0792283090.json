It took me several tries to get it up just right. Lovely isn't it? (check out my pic)",

There are all the majour rivers and mountains, the oceanic ridges and interesting addition, lists of country by size and population. The surface of the states and the mountain heights are in feet, which is not great for Europeans. Latitude and longitude plus time zones indicators complete the map. The lamination is not the best I have ever seen, but it is good enough to protect the map from dirt and liquid spills. The map is meant to be put on a wall, so make sure you have space enough in your place. Overall a pleasant purchase.",
