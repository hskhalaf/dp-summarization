In the past I have used a blocking pad used by a local police department, but it tends to be too strong (more for absorbing strong kicks). This pad has been great. It is strong enough to not fully collapse under a strong hit, but also it doesn't hurt when you hit it. I am coaching 11 - 12 year olds and the size is perfect for them.",

But if you get people who are actually working on leg kicks and strikes, this will not help you absorb any of the contact at all. You will feel most of the power. I had to get two pillows behind the cushion for it to work properly. But who paid 40$+ to have to carry two pillows with behind the shield? This shield is trash.",
