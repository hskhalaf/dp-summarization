I almost threw it away but.. about 6 months later I redid my flower garden and noticed some really big lizards so i put some in the garden. Turns out I have a beautiful bright green gecko that's more than a foot long living in my tree who is now coming for food daily. Adorable :)",

He did this with all of them, so now these poor crickets are scattered about the cage. Uhg. So I guess they don't smell good to him, but he'll eat live ones. Ultimately I think it depends on your pet, but these were a no-go for mine.",
