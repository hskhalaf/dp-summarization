For the EOS-M series the question is: Go with the faster EF-M 22mm prime, ...sharp if you can get it to focus, or, go with this more versatile EF-M 18-55mm that might be a little faster to focus and a little less sharp. You probably want both. I bought this one used-like-new from Electronics Basket and it is perfect. The price was right.",
