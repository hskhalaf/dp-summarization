But my only complaint was the little design on the side start peeling off after about an hour in the pool. So if you are ordering it for the design then I wouldnt suggest it. If you are ordering it for a little more coverage for active water play, then it\u2019s pretty good.",

It is really affordable and she highly recommends it to anyone!",

I wanted to make sure that it was not as tight and hard to get on as my Roxy top. This one is thinner and MUCH more t-shirt like. Very flowing and not form fitting. The downfall is that it does float around in the water. But it is so hot here that it works perfect for me!! Thanks!!",
