      "GET THE SWIM GLOVES ON/OFF WITH EASE - we recommend spraying a small amount of silicone lubricant spray on your hands and spread with a rubbing motion. Or get into the water, fill the water gloves with water and put your hands in, then take the diving gloves above the water and squeegee down. To remove, just blow into the edge by your wrist and inflate them like a balloon. They pop right off",
      "MADE IN USA. GET THE RIGHT SIZE - the aqua gloves should fit tight and at the same time comfortable like a wetsuit. Look into the size chart to find the best size for your hands."
