      "text": "This is is a great sounding speaker dock, especially considering its size. It's sound is not as full-bodied and powerful as the larger Mini, but it's size is convenient as a desk-top speaker and I also use it to charge the docked iphone. My iphone six plus fits nicely. Stereo separation is very good for such a small unit and it has sufficient bass output. It also runs off three AAA batteries and so is very portable but it charges the docked phone only when connected to an AC connection. It also has a USB port to enable external charging. The sound will fill a moderately sized bedroom or office without distortion.",

Fail. Really disappointing JBL, especially because this clearly happens to a lot of folks. JBL support is nonexistent on their website and it seems there might be a firmware update for it, but you wouldn't see that on their website anywhere.",

I have had two phone cases, and neither of them allowed me to use the dock without removing the case, so I now have a case that easily detaches the bottom piece for ease of use when docking.",

Since I've only just received it, I can't comment on its long-term durability at this point. My one complaint is that the Amazon description indicated it was a new item, but it very definitely had previously been removed from the box and not properly repackaged. Description should have said it was an open box item and price should have been discounted to reflect that.",

      "text": "Great sound for the size, works fine with iPhone 6 Plus with Apple leather case. Very good price - cost the same or less than a good dock for the iPhone, and you get a speaker as a bonus. I was looking for an iPhone dock,most of them sell for 30-50$ without a lightning cable ,than came across this speaker, can't beat the price. For 30$ you get a charger dock with a very good portable speaker. Wish it had a Bluetooth connection.",

I prefer more bass like that with the more expensive Boise speaker dock ($249) but I bought this one for her, made her happy, and saved a bundle of money. She also liked the small size of this one. So far it has worked great and I definitely would consider other JBL products in the future.",
