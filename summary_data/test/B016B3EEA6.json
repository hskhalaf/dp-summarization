I put the coconut oil (it's not oily, it's thick and white - extra virgin so it's right from the coconut) on after I bathe, and it's not something you have to wash off, or blot - it is absorbed by my skin. My skin looks amazing after one week of use. I am using it on entire body and face/neck. I used it on my hair as a hair repair treatment (lightly), washing it out afterward, and it left my hair shiny and healthy. Bonus - tastes delicious. :)",

I now use it twice a week and I am seeing less breakage, more shine (without a greasy look or feel) and less of that brittle look and feel that comes with having severely damaged hair. I won't say it \"repairs\" hair, because nothing can do that. I will say that this oil, when used as a hair mask, does minimize the look and feel of \"fried\" hair.",

      "text": "So I bought this for my grandpa to use as a moisturizer because he has skin cancer. Before using it he was using regular lotions and his arms and legs were so dark purple almost black now the purple is starting to go away I can see patches of his actual skin color and the areas that are still purple are much lighter. He says it has really helped stop the itching which was my main concern as regular lotions have perfumes and chemicals which will dry the skin even more causing the itch to intensify. So as long as this stops him from itching I will give 100 stars.",

I use coconut oil frequently, to take off makeup and use as a hair mask but a little goes a long way so even now 8 months later i still have it. I recently started smelling a gross smell come from this oil, i always keep it sealed and in room temperature so nothing got into it. I've never had a product smell this bad and I've used a ton of different coconut oil brands that have lasted me way longer than a year. Not sure what happened here but this is not a quality product.",

I've used it on my hair, left it on a half hour before shampooing, and it makes my hair look a little shinier. I haven't yet used it to eat, and probably won't.
