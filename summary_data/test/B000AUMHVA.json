You have to make sure the antenna is right on a window sill (at least in the two places I have lived they had to be right by the window) but that isn't a problem since the cords are long enough that you can have the docking station near your other media devices but still have the antenna where it needs to be to pick up a signal. We've used these kits for several years and haven't had any problems with it stopping working or anything.",

The home kit might even be better because there is none of that dreaded occasional static that comes unexpectedly when driving by any large objects on the receiving side of the satellite (insert proper term here if there is one). My only complaint lies with the remote - I didn't find it to be very user friendly, besides the radio screen is too small to see from more than a couple of feet away. I enthusiastically recommend this product to anyone considering the purchase!",

(If you're going to do that too; first remove the screws on the bottom and take the thing apart so you don't damage the PCB. I almost made that mistake.) I'm very happy. This was the cheapest kit I could find. The remote even works for the XPress unit. The cord for the antenna is extremely long so I could place it in a location out of sight that gets good reception. I bought another kit to stick in the bathroom too :)",

    "description": "*:Standard PackagingDelphi SA10176-11P1 Roady XT Home Kit\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Delphi Roady XT Home Kit allows you to play the Delphi Roady XT Receiver through your home audio system. It includes a home docking station, remote control, AC power adapter, indoor/outdoor antenna, and an audio patch cable. The high-gain antenna gives you interior or exterior mounting options, and features a hinged base for flexible positioning. The antenna can be placed on any horizontal surface or mounted vertically to a wall. Delphi and XM radio recommend that the antenna be positioned near a south-facing window or outdoors with a clear view of the southeastern sky to receive the satellite signal.\n\n The included remote control is compact and contains a numeric keypad and a variety of buttons that make it easy to navigate XM radio from the comfort of your couch. The docking station is simple with a proprietary XT Roady interface, power input, antenna signal input, and audio output. Power is supplied via a round, five-volt DC connector for connecting the AC adapter; a single SMB connector is used to connect the XM antenna; and the 3.5-millimeter mini-jack supplies a stereo audio output.\n\n Note: An XM satellite radio subscription (sold separately) is required to listen to XM satellite programming.\n\n What's in the Box\nAntenna, docking station, remote control, AC power adapter, and RCA cable.",
