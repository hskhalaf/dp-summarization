GPS option is not synchronized with google maps or another GPS online provider, so you need to open the map on your laptop and see the locations, not so practical nowadays. A short time after I made the purchase, a wi-fi version was released, bad luck for me since currently this is a completely necessary feature. Robust as hell for outdoor use, specially hiking, camping and adventure sports.",

The main justification is that those disposable cameras take mostly unusable pictures, are unpredictable as to where you can buy them, cost a lot between taking (and yes.. developing) and oh yeah, two trips to \"develop pictures. How did we do it? . If you are someone that likes to chronicle life, thus needs to take the underwater and gritting pix, then go for it. But keep your land camera.",

It has many of the same features as my D200 at double the resolution. Besides waterproof, it's shockproof, freezeproof, and sandproof - something I can't say about the D200. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone no matter what they need a camera to do.",

Keep in mind that this is not a SLR camera with great lenses.

Only drawback is battery time not exceptional. Keep extra battery on hand just in case, especially if you use GPS function.",

We never reached the depth limit of 35'. as we were just over 25'. NO problems and the picture quality is better than I expected. All around I have to give it a 5 star rating!! Worked as advertised - no problems with battery life what so ever. I definitely recommend this camera!!",

I've had two of these so far - I had to get the first one replaced because it was fogging up (condensation within the camera), and Nikon sent me a replacement. The first time I took the replacement camera underwater, it took in full water. And I'm only talking a couple of feet deep. Ruined all of my vacation pictures of Aruba. Do yourself a favor. Buy the Fujifilm Finepix underwater camera. It's much cheaper, and I've had absolutely no problems with it. It takes great pictures.",

Water resistant maybe but if you submerge it then it will fail eventually. Read the other 80 reviews on amazon if you don't believe me. I AM PISSED.",

      "text": "This is a great camera. Pictures are sharp and clear with flawless color. Easy to use and very versatile. Took a great picture of a sea turtle underwater in Hawaii while skin diving. Shortly after the camera flooded and was returned to Nikon. Nikon is honoring the warranty and repairing the camera free of charge. This is very different from Casio which attributed every warranty claim to customer abuse and denies the claim. Great camera, should be good to 30 feet underwater. Think I'll keep it above 10 feet in the future.",

And all the pictures and videos turned out awesome. It's funny to think that I washed my camera in the sink after every underwater or sandy use.",

Didn't see any physical problems with the seal, so I don't know whats going on except that water is getting into the battery/memory compartment.

It is not designed for continuous water submersion as the seal design is just a very thin rubber pad to protect your battery, memory stick, and internal parts of the camera.

My camera picked up moisture, then water, and failed within 11 months. I am very disappointed with this product, especially based on the price.",
