I embrace the exercise aspect of golf so I walk and carry my clubs 18 holes and not wearing a good comfortable pair of shoes will simply wear your feet out on some of the courses I play. These shoes are like walking on a cushion of air and my feet are thankful for the comfort they provide. I'm thinking about buying a third pair to have on hand for the future.",
