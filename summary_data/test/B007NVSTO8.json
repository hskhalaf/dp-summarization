      "text": "got tired of running extension cords for my skill saw. so figured it was time to add another dewalt 20 volt tool to my inventory. didn't notice till after i purchased it was a 6.5\" saw but still does the job. And blades are about 25-30% cheaper for the 6.5\" then the 7 1/4\". Used to cut 2x4's, osb and sawed 2x6's and cut them all without a issue. Would recommend not leaving battery in unit. Safety switch works but would be easy to accidently hit safety switch and on switch while carrying it. so i always carry unit without battery and put battery in when i use it.",

      "text": "Excellent kit. Batteries are underpowered for anything but the normal drill. They operate the equipment fine but you are only going to get a about 15-20 cuts on a 2x4 with the regular battery. With two batteries you may be okay if your not cutting a lot fast but I built a shed and wished I would have bought a 5 or 6 amp hour battery earlier. I spent the first two days spending most of my time trying to figure out what I could do while batteries were charging then prime came through with the big battery and I was pretty solid the rest of the project.",

      "text": "I\u2019m really glad I bought this. It has plenty of power and is easy to handle. It cuts through 2x lumber with ease, using the included blade. The first day I got it I slapped one of the batteries from my driver on it and started cutting some 1/2 OSB. I did about 10, 8-foot rip cuts before the battery started to fade. Since then I bought a bigger battery and I haven\u2019t reached for my corded circular saw since. I would definitely recommend using the larger 5 ah batteries. It works just fine with the smaller ones, but it will burn through them relatively quick.",
