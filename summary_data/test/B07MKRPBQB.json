The only good things going for these low-top basketball shoes are its premium feeling materials and sleek style.Even though the Mamba focus retails for just a hundred bucks, testers are in agreement that these budget basketball shoes are simply not worth copping.

I've seen a few reviews around complaining about the size saying they run big, but they fit me perfectly. A little snug the first couple times but the material allows the flexibility to loosen up around your foot. My only SMALL complaint is the laces. They're a bit short for me and come untied sometimes, but not so frequently that it's an issue. If you've worn mambas in the past and liked them you'll love this shoe, and if you're looking for a slick affordable low top then this would be my rec.",
