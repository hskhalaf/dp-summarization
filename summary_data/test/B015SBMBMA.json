      "text": "Nice daypack! Good weight distribution to the hips. The pockets are great and roomy, and the pack cinches down small when it's not stuffed full so it is low profile. Hip pockets can fit an iphone 6s. Love that it has a rain cover. This is will also fit my 15inch laptop for traveling, but I plan to put something soft at the bottom first for protection. I also have the Jade 60 for backpacking, so I'm a fan of Gregory products. I am 5 feet tall, 16inch torso, the small fits nicely. Tried the medium on in the store and it was too big.",

Preformed wonderfully and I had it packed. It was 34 degrees when we started and had plenty of room for all the clothing I shed as the day warmed up.",

      "text": "This pack is definitely designed with women in mind. It fits perfectly! The padding is very comfortable. It is comfortable to wear even with a full 3L hydration bladder in it. In fact, it\u2019s really even more comfortable and stable with some weight in it. Plenty of compartments designed with hiking and backpacking in mind. All the clasps and seams are well made and sturdy. The frame is a flawless design for breathability and comfort. I ordered two other cheaper pack before getting this one and had to return them both because the sizing was off and the frames were terrible and uncomfortable. The difference with a well made pack is amazing. I highly recommend this pack!",

      "text": "I especially love the tiny design touch of a loop for my sunglasses on the shoulder strap! Ideal arrangement of pockets and quite comfortable. I have always been fond of Gregory packs but my Miwok has too many pockets (I didn't know that was possible) and is too floppy to make access easy. The support system makes the Jade a little heavier but it's utterly worth it for the easier access imho. Using it for dayhiking with hubs and kiddo - big enough for all our stuff in one pack.",

The two pockets at the waist are too small to fit a plus size iPhone though they are practical and could be used for other small items. The rain cover comes in handy and is very water proof (able to keep my backpack dry in heavy rain). Overall, it meets my need.",

I've used it for a couple of weeks and loaded about 20pds each time. Love all the compartments and open pouches. LOVE IT! I highly recommend as a woman's daypack! I bought purple and it's beautiful.
