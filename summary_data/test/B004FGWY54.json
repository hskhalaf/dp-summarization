It never has an error Beep or flashing light. It makes no noise. A red light simply changes to green when it is finished balancing and charging. All you need is the correct type of balance plug that has the two little ribs on one side . The charger is very light weight - it does get quite warm so I often let it hang off the furniture.",

Came with a wall charger. Had a drone propellar destroy the balance charger on a battery, and when re-wiring it I placed one of the lines in the wrong spot, the reverse polarity protection worked well and flashed green/red until I broke out a voltmeter to further check and when realigned it worked well. Gets slightly warm with use, but works well for the price.",

Just only charge ONE battery at a time of course, and if there is one con to this charger, it's that I'm not such a big fan of the power brick style of wall adapter. I would rather have a normal wall plug, idk what's the official name. Other than that, just an awesome charger, and I confirm that it did work for my 4s 1,500mah battery as well.",

This charger charges and balances cells, and disconnects once done. Since it is cheap, I suggest to buy one charger for each spare battery you have for your drone, so you can charge all of them simultaneously. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase, and can recommend this product to anybody who needs cheap and reliable charger for Li-Po batteries.",

Balance charges 4 different battery sizes, 1S, 2S, 3S and 4S. External Power Supply therefore can use a car-lighter cable (not included). Does not get hot. Con's: Slower than some other chargers. No lights to tell how far along it is. Only charging vs finished. As inexpensive as this is, you can have 2 or more running to get your batteries up to charge. And can even run the charger from a car battery so you can charge your batteries in the field. Great, compact, practical device.",
