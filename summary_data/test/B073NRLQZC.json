Nike Cortez has been around forever and will always be a good go to shoe. The only problem is that they don't offer an all black version with just the center sole and swoosh being white. It's either black with a white sole which gets dirty real quick or all black which is too much black. Obsidian seemed like it'd work but it was actually a dark blue and not black.",
