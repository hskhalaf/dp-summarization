      "text": "FRAUDULENT MARKETING PRACTICES!!!!!!!! GUys, this add needs to be fixed Immediatley. Your Clearly False marketing by having that Bike Pump in the pictured surrounded by all the other parts. YEAHHHHH I KNOW, now that I read the fine print, it does not list the pump as Included, but it CERTAINLY does not say its not included either. I am pretty sure you know EXACTLY what your doing by marketing like this and having the PUMP included in the picture. Read the other reviews, others have thought it was included also. RETURN COMING YOUR WAY for Misleading and FRAUDULENT MARKETING PRACTICES My recommendation and remedy: Either sell on Amazon ethically, or Close your Seller account",

We knew it did not include the bike pump, not a problem for us. If you go to a park or field bring water, have to refill bottle to 1/4 level each blast off.",

A hand or foot pump is probably better. When I used an air compressor, the pressure builds up faster and probably gets more pressure in the bottle. When it launches with more pressure, the fins fly off the screw cap with parts flying everywhere that are difficult to find. Launch it away from trees, it easy gets stuck.",

      "text": "We purchased this Delta water rocket and the 4M water rocket for or grandson's 6th birthday party. The Delta rocket, although more expensive, did not perform as well. We were operating in a large grass field under breezy conditions. The Delta rocket has a larger (think 2 liter) bottle that is not as aerodynamic as the 4M smaller and slimmer bottle. Also the Delta's fins provide a narrow stance and constantly tip over while being pumped up to fire. The 4M fins provided a very stable stance. The Delta parts were of high quality so I think a simple redesign of the fin stance along with a smaller more aerodynamic bottle would be an improvement.",

    "title": "Delta Education Bottle Rokit Science Kit",
    "description": "The Delta Education 110-1209 Bottle Rokit Science Kit is an educational supply kit for students to explore principles of rocket propulsion that turns an ordinary soda pop bottle into a rocket, is made from durable, vacuum-formed polystyrene, and includes a soda pop bottle, screw cap, O-ring, rubber nozzle, three fins, pressure tube, and support wire. The screw cap attaches to the bottle with the O-ring to create an airtight seal. The fins attach to the screw cap to hold the bottle in place for launching and measure 4 x 2.5 inches (H x W). (H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right.) A support wire helps hold the bottle upright for launch. The 5\u2019 long tubing has nozzles at each end and connects the soda bottle with a pump (sold separately) or a standard bicycle tire pump. \n\nScience education products incorporate applied math and science principles into classroom projects. Teachers in pre-K, elementary, and secondary classrooms use science education kits and products alongside science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curriculum to demonstrate STEM concepts and real-world applications through hands-on activities. Science education projects include a broad range of activities, such as practical experiments in engineering, aeronautics, robotics, energy, chemistry, physics, biology, and geology.\n\nSchool Specialty provides instructional materials and supplies under dozens of brands, among them Think Math, Delta Education, Frey Scientific, Childcraft, and School Smart. The company, founded in 1959, is headquartered in Greenville, WI. \n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box? \n\n * Soda pop bottle\n * Screw cap\n * O-ring\n * Rubber nozzle\n * Fins (3)\n * Pressure tube (5\u2019 length)\n * Support wire\n * Instructions",
