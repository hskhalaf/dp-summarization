      "text": "The camera works great. For clarity - it is ONLY compatible with 2.4ghz band. I would argue that the wifi signal strength far surpasses that of the Ring doorbell, oddly. The resolution is great and the motion sensor is accurate. The spotlight is pretty bright but the SOS alarm remains untested. Also lesser advertised, the boxiness of the camera is because, although it comes with only one battery, it has room for two batteries!! However, this review is for the camera only...the battery SUCKS. We loaded it with two batteries and with minimal use, they last about 6 weeks. Not bad I guess but I would expect a bit more when compared to the competition.",

When the draining battery hit 11%, the Ring started using the charging battery for power. When the charging battery hit 90%, it cut over to charging the 11% full battery. Very slick. I'm waiting to see how much a battery drains overnight, but I'm sure it won't take long for the solar array to recharge it.",

Blink seems more reliable than this, even though the alerts are late it would definitely pick up motion and you can have motion zones too.",

      "text": "The lid from the battery compartment is super fragile and sensitive, it won't stay in place. If this is the way it's designed, a bird or a squirrel could easily open it exposing the battery to weather conditions. I think this is a defective unit but I'm not bothering with it. I think I'll try simply safe instead.",
