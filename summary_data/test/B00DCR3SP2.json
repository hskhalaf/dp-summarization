Loosing the DVD drive (which you would get on the Macbook Pro) worried me a little, but now the space and weight saver is a much better trade off. Great for transporting and, as a moderate user, I don't feel I loose anything from the Macbook experience by only having the Macbook Air. My wife also spends a lot of time editing movies pictures, and she loves it. We progressed from the old white Macbook, and we were so impressed with that, we knew we only wanted a Mac again.

One important reservation is that the internal storage, being silicon rather than a spinning disc, is limited in size. This means that I have to maintain my photos and music on another machine (a Mac Mini) and the MacBook Air accesses them via a USB disc. The particular model delivered had a USA keyboard, but this causes no problems.",

Yes, it's an American keyboard, but the only differences are the placement of the @ key (shift-2) and the \u00a3 sign (shift-3, not marked). And so what? For 12 hours plus battery life, lightning fast start-up from sleep and super-slim, portable format, for \u00a3680, it's an absolute steal.",

      "text": "This is a truly superb product. It is fully booted up and ready to go just 10 seconds after hitting the power key and shut down times are similarly very brief. Then there is the phenomenal battery life and the lightness of the unit despite its very robust aluminium case which gets barely warm at very worst. Add to all these positive features totally silent operation and the unburstable UNIX-based MacOS and in the MacBook Air you have a real winner!",
