If you want long distance communication use the high power channels and if you want longer battery life use the low power channels.

In most use cases you're not going to get more than 0.5-0.75 mi, which is a very short distance (couple blocks). In addition, it has no privacy code, which means while you can hear from other talkabouts (that has channel like 4-1, or 4-2 etc), they cannot hear you because you can only transmit at channel 4.",

      "text": "Bought these after using borrowing my friend's unit during an early morning \"spirited\" group drive. Theses worked great with good range. They were very clear and bought the 3 pack for my family when we go on trail rides on our bikes. The range is shorter in the woods, as expected, but reasonable. These are much better than the walkie-talkie units of my youth. I wish these had the headphone jack. I like the small size and didn't want to get the larger model just for the headphones.",

Using the business channels, they have an ouside range of about a mile. I do live in a more rural area so interference that can effect range is minimal. The only drawback that I have incountered is that they are not water proof or very water resistant. Two of them have died because they were left out in the rain.",

Otherwise.. divide the distance over 15 to get a better idea.
