Never a slip on concrete or asphalt with or without snow. Also look cool on, impress fellow employees.",

While I was hiking I met someone with only one boot covered with spikes. He had lost the other one. He wasn't wearing the strap. I didn't ask who made the spikes he was wearing.",

The first day I got them I deliberately walked on all the ice in my driveway and I never slipped once. The teeth on these badboys dig down into the ice and keep your footing solid. I feel so much safer now walking outside and don't ever have to worry about falling again. Them being stainless steel means no rust stains on the floor in the house when I take my boots off. I am happy with the one year warranty. Yaktrax only has a 90 day warranty, they rust, and they are of poor quality. Thank you Leanking!",
