Its low-profile sole unit facilitates smooth heel-to-toe transitions. Meanwhile, you won\u2019t worry about slipping because of the grippy outsole.To top it off, the new upper construction ensures better breathability for longer-lasting comfort. It\u2019s easy to see why the Yourflex Train 11 retained its following.",
