The battery charges so quick, 38 minutes to full charge! and lasts all day with good usage, very impressed so far, super fast and responsive and the screen quality whilst watching Netflix challenged my 4k TV at home! definitely suggest this if you dont want to go with the generic brand leaders, best phone ive ever had hands down.",

I unboxed the device earlier and it was fully charged before I could even finish my lunch - SuperVOOC is a real game changer. The camera quality is stunning. The device takes really clear and sharp images with lots of detail and replaces the need for me to carry a physical camera. The quality of the product feels very premium and definitely challenges all other premium devices available. I would highly recommend the phone and it is nice to use a device with some real innovation :)",

On the whole it's fine; I like the size and shape, which is quite slim. Being able to use comfortably with one hand is a big plus. And there's tons of storage space.
