The Nikon is so much better......almost 4 times the zoom.....easy to use......small and easy to carry......easy to use.....great photographs even in difficult conditions....video capability is superb. My only complaint is the record button location which is adjacent to the thumb/index finger grasp area. I typically activate the video record button accidently several times when I'm just taking photographs. Honestly, this camera is a value gold mine, so why should I complain about such a minor detail?",

Funny enough I had seen some reviews with the same warning, but decided to roll the dice anyway since it had great features. So, all in all a great camera, if you want one that will only last 10 months...",

The images are sharp and close-ups are easier than ever before. The only thing I recommend is to get a tripod to help keep your shots consistent and clear.",

Otherwise this camera is amazing, panoramic pictures are easy, live motion both video and still images are outstanding. The best way to learn is to just play with it.",

Nikon says this is nearly impossible but I have the ruined images to prove it. I debated long and hard between the Nikon and the update to my trusty Canon SX200 IS (SX230 IS). I followed all of the glowing reviews for the 9100 so that is what I opted for. My mistake. Should have gone with my gut and stayed with the Canon.",

    "title": "Nikon COOLPIX S9100 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 18x NIKKOR ED Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nGRAB YOUR PASSPORT, GRAB YOUR CAMERA AND GO!\nADVANCED, POWERFUL, YET CAN GO ANYWHERE\n921,000-dot, ultra-high resolution display The new Nikon COOLPIX S9100 is loaded with innovative Nikon technology, like a 12.1-megapixel CMOS sensor that assures superb image quality in low-light conditions. Optimized with Nikon's exclusive EXPEED C2 processing engine, you'll capture natural looking pictures with exceptional detail. You'll also love composing images on the large three-inch Clear Color Display. This dazzling 921,000-dot, ultra-high resolution display, makes viewing photos and HD movies instantly gratifying.\n\nWhether you're people watching in Paris or waiting for just the right light to hit the Grand Canal in Venice, the COOLPIX S9100's High-Speed Shooting feature captures five photos in approximately one second at full resolution. And Subject Tracking keeps the camera automatically focused on your moving subject.\n\nAt 1.4 inches thin and 7.6 ounces in weight, the portable COOLPIX S9100 is the perfect travel companion, no matter where in the world you take it.\n\nWIDE-ANGLE, HIGH POWER, COMPACT ZOOM-NIKKOR\u00ae LENS\nProducing precision camera optics is at the heart of Nikon's proud photographic heritage. The COOLPIX S9100 is no exception. Its high quality 18x wide-angle optical Zoom-NIKKOR ED glass lens offers impressive telephoto coverage (25-450mm) with outstanding color capture and razor-sharp results. This is the only lens you'll ever need for exacting portrait studies, scenic panoramas, and challenging compositions. Plus, we realize that shooting from the roof of an SUV, a gondola overlooking the Swiss Alps, or a whale-watching boat in Iceland can get bumpy . That's why we've included a five-way, Hybrid Electronic VR Image Stabilization system with the COOLPIX S9100. It uses sensor shift in combination with electronic stabilization features to minimize the effects of camera shake, so you can say goodbye to unwanted streaky or blurred images. \n\nCREATE A SCENE AND GET THE MOST OUT OF EVERY SHOT.\nNight Landscape mode The world is brimming with creative shooting opportunities, and the COOLPIX S9100 has the advanced features to match. Choose one of 19 Scene Modes to assure optimized camera settings for specific scenes. Or, with Scene Auto Selector, the camera automatically selects the most appropriate mode from among seven choices for you. Plus, Nikon's amazing Easy Panorama mode allows you to pan the camera in any direction as it automatically detects, combines and assembles your shots into one seamless panoramic image. \n\nWith Night Landscape mode, the COOLPIX S9100 captures high quality images at night. It shoots a series of consecutive shots and composes them into a single, brilliant image. Night Portrait mode takes outdoor portraits against bright backgrounds and combines multiple shots to capture the essence of night scenes. And, the COOLPIX S9100's Backlighting HDR Mode automatically provides optimum exposures when you're shooting backlit subjects. \n\nBRING BACK FULL HD (1080P) MOVIES OF YOUR TREKS AROUND THE WORLD.\nSharing your travel adventures\u2014or posting them on the Internet for friends and relatives\u2014is even more exciting with Full HD (1080p) movies. While the COOLPIX S9100 can capture hundreds of memorable still images for you to easily print and save, its moviemaking features bring a safari, ski trip, cruise, or balloon ride to life. The One-Touch movie recording button shoots 1090p HD Movies\u2014complete with stereo sound. Plus, optical zoom and auto focus functions will bring you close to the action. You can even shoot still images while recording movies, or experiment with special effects like fast or slow motion. When the time comes to share your movies, simply use the in-camera playback feature or the convenient HDMI-CEC output for quick hookup to an HDTV or computer. \n\nIN-CAMERA SPECIAL EFFECTS THAT DON'T REQUIRE POST-SHOT PROCESSING.\nYou don't want to be hassled with post-shot processing, which is why Nikon equipped the COOLPIX S9100 with in-camera special effects. These advanced features help you take shots you've never considered before! You can re-capture yesteryear with the Nostalgic Sepia effect, or try some intricate black and white shooting with the High-Contrast Monochrome feature. This versatile camera also lets you highlight bright areas of a photo with the High Key effect, or highlight dark areas with the Low Key mode. A Selective Color feature boosts the vibrancy of specific aspects of a photo or movie, while Soft Effect subdues harsh elements for a gentler, silkier look. The COOLPIX S9100 even has a Creative Slider to adjust the brightness, intensity and hue of an image. \n\nCONVENIENT FEATURES\nWhen traveling on an exotic adventure, you can't afford missed photo opportunities. You'll find Nikon's Motion Detection feature to be important because it identifies moving objects and automatically adjusts shutter speed and ISO to assure crisp, blur free images. When conditions conspire against you, Nikon's Best Shot Selector automatically takes up to 10 shots and saves the sharpest image. ISO speeds up to 3200 will help you capture great shots in low-light. Blinking eyes and red-eye can ruin portraits . That's why the COOLPIX S9100 includes Blink Warning. It also offers in-camera Red-Eye Fix\u2122 that automatically corrects red-eye as you shoot and Skin Softening that smoothes skin tones. The COOLPIX S9100 also has Macro Shooting for shooting as close as 1.6 inches. And, when you're in remote regions, you'll appreciate the camera's 270-shot rechargeable Li-ion battery.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * COOLPIX S9100 Digital Camera\n * AN-CP19 Strap\n * UC-E6 USB Cable\n * EG-CP16 Audio/Video Cable\n * EN-EL12 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery\n * EH-69P AC Adapter/Charger\n * Nikon View NX 2 CD-ROM",
