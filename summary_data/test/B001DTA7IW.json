Cons: (all these cons are very minor) Memory Stick; Battery life; Have to remove battery to charge it; Turns on if you use a case (or pouch) with a magnetic closure. The Pros overwhelm the Cons. I just mentioned the only things I don't like about it, but they are very minor. Such a great combo, exactly what I was looking for. I was about to buy the Panasonic TZ5 when I found a review on it that recommended the T500:",

The 720p video quality is however, awesome, almost as good as my VadoHD 720p pocket camcorder. The fatal flaw in the T500 is the HORRIBLE touch screen and the goofy menu structure. Believe me, you will hate this approach. Lo-res screen, fingerprints everywhere, dim in bright daylight, buttons that require many presses to register. Finally, did I mention the 20-minute battery life? I could not even review 125 images I had taken over the course of a week without draining a freshly-charged battery.",

Since then this has been removed from the description. THE GPS WAS MY MAIN REASON FOR BUYING THIS CAMERA, it was just plain misleading. I am still figuring out this camera. NOT nearly as easy as my cheaper Cybershot. Point and Shoot does not describe this camera. But again I am new to photography.",

The HD video looked great, touchscreen made it easy to get around the menu system, and it took pretty good pictures.... Except under flash conditions. Using the flash will result in pictures filled with dust orbs, little flecks of dust reflecting light back due to the proximity of the flash to the lens. This renders the T500 useless under flash conditions, which is a deal-breaker for me. So back it went. Hopefully the Sony designers can fix this fatal flaw with their ultra-compact cameras.",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSC-T500 10.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization",
    "description": "The Sony DSC-T500 offers excellent performance and a stylish, elegant design. It includes Smile Shutter technology to help capture smiles automatically as they happen, as well as Face Detection technology to optimize focus, exposure and color for up to eight faces. The compact body features 10.1 megapixel resolution and a wide 3.5-inch touch-screen LCD for easy operation. The DSC-T500 completes the package with a Carl Zeiss 5x optical zoom lens and Sony\u2019s Double Anti-Blur solution, for crisp, clear images.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T500 digital camera features 10.1-megapixel resolution, 5x zoom, Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, and Face Detection technology, as well as the ability to record 720p high-definition video and even take a picture while recording. After shooting, you can play your videos back on the large 3.5-inch LCD touch-screen display, on your PC, or your compatible HDTV. HD videos are recorded in the MPEG4 format, which offers superb image quality in a smaller file size than comparable video formats. \n\nCyber-shot DSC-T500 Highlights \n\n10.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor\nA powerful 10.1-megapixel 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 10.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3 size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. \n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar 5x optical zoom lens\nThe newly developed Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens enables close-up shooting up to just 4/10 inches (1cm) from the subject (in Magnifying Glass Mode), while the optical 5x telescopic zoom offers superior visual acuity for a compact digital camera. \n\n3.5-inch Clear Photo LCD Plus touch-screen display\nCompose and review your images on a large, bright 3.5-inch widescreen LCD (230K) display, and use the touch-screen interface to navigate menus, specify focus points, or zoom in on the pictures you've taken for a closer look at details. \n\nCapture \n\nHD Movie\nWith the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T500, you can quickly and easily record video in 720p high definition1, and even take up to three pictures per movie sequence while shooting. HD videos are recorded in the MPEG4 AVC/H.264 format, which offers superb image quality in a smaller file size than other comparable video formats. This smaller file size lets you record more to your Memory Stick Duo Media, as well as upload them to Internet sharing sites to share with friends and family. \n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus and exposure to deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nDouble Anti-blur Solution\nThe combination of Optical SteadyShot image stabilization and High ISO sensitivity helps compensate for shaky hands, minimizes blur, and allows flash-free shooting to preserve the mood. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nHigh Sensitivity ISO 3200\nHigh Sensitivity ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take pictures indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to eight ISO settings (Auto, 80, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode for Movies\nWhen shooting movies in low-light situations, you can use High Sensitivity mode to help ensure clear results. \n\nConvenient photo modes\nChoose from eleven convenient photo modes to quickly adjust for specific shooting conditions. Photo modes include Auto, Program Auto, and Scene selections, such as High Sensitivity, Soft Snap, Twilight Portrait, Twilight, Landscape, High Speed Shutter, Beach, Snow, and Fireworks. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\n16:9 High Resolution Mode\nUsing the 16:9 High Resolution Mode, you can record high resolution images in the 16:9 aspect ratio favored by HDTVs. This setting is ideal if you plan to view your images on a compatible HDTV and invite friends and family members over for a slideshow. \n\n4MB internal memory\nWith 4MB of internal memory, you can still capture a limited number of shots, even without using Memory Stick Duo Media, then transfer them to your PC or removable Memory Stick Duo Media at a later time. \n\nMemory Stick Duo Media Convenience\nA built-in slot accepts Memory Stick Duo Media or Memory Stick PRO Duo Media. Both sold separately. \n\nStamina Battery Power\nProvides extended battery life and shooting capacity when using a fully-charged lithium-ion battery. \n\nView and Share \n\nHDTV compatibility\nView your photos and movies in high definition on your Sony BRAVIA or similar compatible HDTV using the supplied multi-output stand with HDMI connectivity. Just connect the multi-output stand to an HDTV with an HDMI cable (sold separately), then place your Cyber-shot DSC-T500 on the stand. Its the perfect way to share your memories with friends and family members. \n\nBRAVIA Sync\nWhen connected to a BRAVIA Sync enabled BRAVIA HDTV via HDMI output on the supplied multi-output stand (HDMI cable required, sold separately), the Cyber-shot playback screen will automatically display, and you can control camera playback using your BRAVIA HDTV remote control. Just press the Sync button on the remote to display a dedicated menu. Such easy operation makes viewing your photos and videos on a large-screen TV even more enjoyable. \n\nPhotoTV HD\nBring your photos to life and enjoy highly detailed, HD 1920x1080 images with PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTVs. PhotoTV HD fine tunes settings on your HDTV, such as sharpness, gradation, and color to display images that look more like actual printed photographs. \n\nWide Zoom display\nTo use the entire image area of the compatible HDTV screen, Wide Zoom display automatically expands standard 4:3 and 3:2 images to 16:9. \n\nPHOTOMUSIC feature\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music to produce fun and entertaining slide shows. Select from five visual effects (Simple, Basic, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish) and four pre-loaded tracks on camera or transfer your own music from a PC. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools Retouch and enhance your pictures on the go with three in-camera editing functions: Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Partial Color. \n\nMulti-Purpose Resize function\nThe Multi-Purpose Resize function lets you change the aspect ratio of an image right in the camera, so you can adjust images as necessary, whether you want to display them on a compatible HDTV, email them or upload them to a blog. Picture Motion Browser ver. 3.1: Sony Picture Motion Browser (PMB) software provides a simple, easy-to-use way to transfer video and still images to your PC, as well as sort, edit, and output to data disc and the Internet.",
