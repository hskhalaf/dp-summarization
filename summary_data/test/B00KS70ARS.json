Also at end of video i pour some out so you can see consistency of liquid and how it spreads. I simply spread with a rag on my hands and knees",

Our floors are 25+ years old and other than a few small spots that had chipped, the floor looks like it was just installed. I applied 2 coats and it really shines now!",
