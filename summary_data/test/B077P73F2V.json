I got the replacement unit and this one is consistently over by 12 degrees. At least being over by 12 degrees is safe so I kept the unit and simply subtract 12 degrees from my setting when I use it. Make sure you use a thermometer in the water to test the unit and compare against the units reading since undercooked meats can be dangerous!",

It is definitely extremely user-friendly, and one of my favorite kitchen gadgets that I have by far. It is very easy to use and more convenient than any others that I have tested out. I have never made a stress free and easy perfect steak, fish, and creme brulee until now. I highly recommend the Chefman Sous Vide to anyone in the market.",

It's pretty powerful, heats up quickly, and can take a beating. More than one person on my staff has dropped it and it still works fine.

      "text": "I bought this in order to Sous Vide some 30 day dry aged ribeyes that I\u2019m about to cut from a primal... today however I cooked some garlic/herb chicken breasts. Wow. My pot is quite large and the 1000 watt heater made quick work of heating to 140F. Temp held perfect for about two hours, then removed to crisp the breasts a bit. AMAZING. I\u2019ve never had chicken so tender and juicy... not stringy in the least. Sous Vide is not a fast method of cooking, it\u2019s a precision method of cooking. I cannot wait to cook my ribeyes! Easy to use, excellent packaging, superb results.",

We usually set it around 135 for medium rare for about an hour and then just sear it when we are ready for dinner. It comes out perfectly pink. I\u2019ve always had a hard time cooking meat to the prefect temp and this literally makes me look like a real chef!",

This cooker is very easy to use even though I have no idea when I open the box. All you need is the cooker, a pot, water, and your foods. I put every into the pot, and set the timer. I am surprise that the food tastes really good and less oily than usual.",
