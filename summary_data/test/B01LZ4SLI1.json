Pros: You can read/clear codes, get live readings from the engine which you can select and put in a list or graph and (supposedly) you can force regen. Not all scan tools can read paccar codes correctly but this one can. Cons: Occasionally hard freezes you have to restart to get out of, the graph is upside down and somewhat glitched, I tried on two different vehicles and so far haven't been able to force regen.
