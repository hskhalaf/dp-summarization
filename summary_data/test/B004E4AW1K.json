If felt cheaper coming out of the box and of course failed on the first night I used it. A seam tore in one spot and one of the pole loops came completed off, irrevocably collapsing a quarter of the tent. The bottom line is you can\u2019t trust this tent.",

The tent did fine in the rain, but the \"porch part\" had rain that came in through the screen. There was no where for the water to drain, so it puddled, making it cumbersome to take down and store. We'll keep using it, and we'll figure a way to rectify that, because we're happy with the rest of the tent.",

Big enough for a queen mattress with about 2ft of space on each size. Screened in section is just big enough for 2 camping chairs and a table. Not much room to move around but it works when bugs come out.",

      "text": "My only complaint about this tent is that it states it will fit 2 queen air beds, and it will, but boy is it a tight fit. We took this camping just outside of Yosemite, so we wernt in a position to get a smaller air bed. The 2 queens fit but i am honestly surprised we didnt rip the seams on the tent. So my advice is set it up before hand and make sure your mattresses fit. Other than that the tent is great! Easy to set up, pretty durable, and I love the mosquito net front room. Worth every penny!",

As with typical dome tents, it is very simple in design to set up and breakdown, but do to the height, it could be a little bit challenging for us shorter people to get the rainfly on. We've only gotten to use it once last year, but it did hold up to one day of heavy rain. Absolutely love the fully enclosed screen porch room which is my favorite feature of this tent. At around $140 on Amazon, it is a bargain. Our friends with their $500 Eureka tent were quite jealous at how easy it went updown and the price tag",

One takes up the majority of the tent. My only other complaint is that the port for electricity was only to the screened area, which mean to get an extension cord inside the tent it has to go thru the zippered door. All in all decent simple tent",

The video for this Coleman tent showed it withstanding a 60 mile an hour winds for 1 hour with rain. I've had better luck with an Ozark Trail tent from Walmart that I purchased 10 years ago.
