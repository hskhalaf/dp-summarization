As seen in the picture and video, if you try to position your barbell before benching (either moving barbell to left or right) the support bracket twists and can unlock. This is dangerous and cause serious injury. I am going to add some extra clamps so it doesnt move. The other issue with the support bracket is that it doesnt have a rubber coating, so the barbell is scratching the bracket. Will have to add some rubber on it. Otherwise great",

The steel was heavier guage than I expected so once the bench was assembled it feels very sturdy.
