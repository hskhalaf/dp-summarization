One pair of bathing suit bottoms was stained to the point of being ruined and I had to bleach any white fabric that came in contact with it. Oxyclean makes the stains much worse (bright orange!) and bleach is the only way to get it out. I don't wear white when I use it, or I try to wait 15 minutes before getting dressed and then bleach my shirts after.",

You won't be able to smell these unless you put wherever you applied it directly under your nose. I would recommend Amazon to update the product picture. The bottle I received does not match the active or inactive ingredients shown on the pictures Amazon provided; however, they do match the ingredients shown on the official Supergoop site, so this is a legitimate product. I assume Amazon just hasn't updated the picture to fit the product's current formula.",

      "text": "I had high hopes about this sunscreen but I was very disappointed. First off it\u2019s super greasy and not lightweight at all! I definitely couldn\u2019t wear it daily because I felt oily and sticky. Also the sunscreen is worthless! I put this stuff on and was out it the sun for maybe an hour and I got the worst sunburn. It did not work at all. Thankfuly I didn\u2019t use it on my five year old. It\u2019s not worth $50! I had better sun protection using my Alba Botanicals. I returned this immediately.",

      "text": "Wonderful stuff and on top of everything it is rear lly nice to finally have a sunscreen that doesn't sting the eyes. Found out about this after hearing the owner interviewed on public radio. Love that this has safe ingredients, the citrus scent is nice though very mild, leaves skin soft, absorbed beautifully. Really a perfect product. Now if the container could have been glass instead of plastic, it would have been outstanding, but you know, it's recyclable so that something. Definitely prefer this over other sunscreens.",
