      "text": "I bought this unit twice. The first one stopped working after about three months when the unit would only read \"HI\" and would not function. I suspected it was the probe so I bought a second unit, which was cheaper than buying the probe alone. When the new unit arrived I inserted the new probe into the old unit and sure enough it worked perfectly. The new probe worked, you guessed it for about 3-4 months and then the unit would only read \"HI\". I'm done, this is a great unit when it works but if you buy it you are throwing your money away. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT until they fix what is clearly a poorly designed probe.",

I keep buying it because I like it.... i keep hoping I'll get one that works longer. When it works it's good for baking and also for yogurt making. The problem lies in the cord that goes from the device to the probe. You just need to make it stronger somehow. Please try to make it better quality. I'm not going to buy it again this time. Let me know when you improve the quality.",

Then suddenly, it stopped working and was registering my milk temp about 20 to 30 degrees hotter than it was. I cleaned the probe off again just in case there was residue on the probe itself. and it was registering the air at 100 degrees. Having said this, the displays were wonderful to read. Its a shame that the manufacturer allows for weak points in its item. My recommendation for others -- avoid this item and avoid disappointment when you can least afford it.",

The plastic around the wire where the probe starts would break. It was like the probe had a sharp edge that slowly cut the plastic with careful use. It was very poorly designed. I have already called to use my warranty and while I was sent a new one, it quickly broke as well. I unfortunately, had given these as gifts before I realized this flaw and regret it.

      "text": "I love this timer better than any other timer I've had. Why? It beeps every minute after the time is up so if I'm zoned out or distant during the first ring, I catch one of the following beeps. I have two of these, and no brain. So I put one timer right next to the thing I'm supposed to remember, and when I go to turn it off on ring 2 or 5 or 10, , there is my project/food/phone right beside it, so I remember why it's ringing, and I'm ready to go! I think I'll buy a third one!",

Ultimately, the probe was within a few dollars of an entire thermometer with probe. The build of the new unit is similar to the old. The power switch on the new unit feels much cheaper than the old, and significantly cheaper than the remainder of the new unit. Given the price, and how many years of service the old unit provided - if it fails, I'll just buy another. Great value vs. purchasing the item locally.",

    "description": "Style Name:1470The Taylor digital cooking probe thermometer/timer provides superior results For professional and amateur chefs alike. This digital meat Thermometer accurately measures temperatures from 32 to 392 \u00b0F. A durable stainless steel probe with a 4 ft. Silicone cord allows food to be easily monitored without removing it from the oven. Additional features include an automatic time and temperature alarm so you can gauge how much time is left before It's time to eat. The cooking thermometer also features a stand-up display for countertop use, or a magnet for attachment to an oven door. 2 AAA batteries are included.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nOpening the oven to check on a food's temperature means wasting the cook's time and losing oven temperature and moisture--not to mention a face full of steam. This thermometer prevents those problems. Insert the instrument's 6-inch stainless-steel probe into a roast beef or turkey and monitor the time and temperature (from 32 to 392 degrees F) on the thermometer's large digital display, which connects to the probe with a 4-foot cord. The control panel sets cooking time and temperature, and an alarm sounds when either is reached. Fully opened, the thermometer/timer is 5 inches high, but it folds flat for compact storage. Magnets on the back permit it to be temporarily mounted on a metal surface. --Fred Brack",
