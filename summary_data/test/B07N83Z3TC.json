I use it mainly indoors and the ice will last all day. The assembly was easy for my husband but there was a bolt already where the can opener should be that we had a hard time removing. We did scratch the paint trying to remove this bolt but when we put the can opener in place, you can\u2019t see the scratches made. The cooler looks really good and with the wheels make it easy to move around. I love it!",

      "text": "This cute cooler in true Coca Cola red color arrived packaged very well and looked exactly as pictured and looks very high quality. The Coca Cola emblem are not stickers, they're metal and part of the cooler construction. It seemed a little smaller than expected but the size still works. If I had to order again I would maybe have ordered the 80 quart size for a little more storage but then again the construction looked less quality from the picture for the 80 quart size. Great purchase to keep beer and sodas cold and to display on the patio for a conversation piece with its retro look!",

The exterior was a little scratched from the packaging which I believe others mentioned too. I\u2019ll post pics so you can see.

Featuring a design inspired by the iconic Coca-Cola logo, this whimsical icebox is a union of classic charm and modern-day function.
