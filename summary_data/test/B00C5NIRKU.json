Part of the reason for the rough finish is that they are not true (wobbles a bit on drill press). I purchased this set based on user reviews and price. I didn't return them because they are OK for my \"once in a while\" use of the item for DIY house projects. If you desire or expect a better countersink finish, I would suggest buying a different set.",

I used the 2 largest ones to chamfer some #8 screw holes in 6061 and ended up having to touch up the edges and slow them down to a crawl to get a clean cut. I will try the single flute next time and buy a countersink made by a real tool maker. I imagine these will work for wood ok but for 6061 they didn't do a good job.",
