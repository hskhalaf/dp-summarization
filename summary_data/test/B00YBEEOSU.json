      "verdict": "Merrell tailored the profile of the Siren Edge for ladies as a crossover of athletic and hiking shoes. Its straight-out-of-the-box comfort, no break-in period and true-to-size fit were undeniable. A considerable number of users were convinced that getting a second pair is worth it with its steadfast comfort and support. Its grippy outsole received praises too. As perfect as these hiking shoes may seem, it missed achieving the quality Merrell has been known for. Over and above, Merrell Siren Edge is still a go-to shoe from daily chores to light hiking on the trails.",

        "The Merrell Siren Edge delivered a right-out-of-the-box comfort",

        "A substantial number of Siren Edge purchasers commended the Vibram outsole",
        "They said that it was able to grip well on muddy and concrete grounds",
        "The support from these Merrell hiking shoes was lauded by the majority",
        "There were no hot spots, no blisters and no foot pains according to a couple of satisfied users",
        "Several wearers liked the adequate toe box room offered by Siren Edge",
        "They noted that there was enough room for them to wiggle their toes",
        "It required virtually no breaking-in period, according to some users",
        "A couple of Merrell stalwarts were enthusiastic in getting their second pair",
        "The design and colorways of Siren Edge received praises from numerous wearers",

        "More than a handful liked that these shoes fit true to size"

      "cons": [
        "Some buyers questioned the Merrell quality",

        "One even experienced that the entire upper separated from its sole on the first day",
        "Siren Edge's lack of cushioning on the heel made a few users felt they were walking on a post"
