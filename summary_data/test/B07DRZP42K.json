BUT, most importantly, I bought these to walk around cobblestones in Europe, hike in AZ and I am slipping and sliding on the shoe that advertises 'good traction'! Rainy day in AZ, tried to give these shoes another chance, stepped up on the running board of the expedition, slipped off and banged my knee. Then walked up the saltillo sidewalk and almost went down if not for my husband holding my hand! This happens on wet sidewalk, driveways, etc. I just can't wear these! Past return date or they'd be gone!!!!",

I'll probably get used to them and they'll loosen up, but I've been accustomed to just putting them on and loving them, that I'm ever so disappointed in the fact they don't feel as comfortable. Went for a couple mile hike and my feet were hot. But I also felt they are well-built and should hold up.",
