      "text": "Overall very happy with these bath bombs. The box contained twelve individually wrapped bath bombs. The box is nice and this would make for a good gift. We have used three so far and like the scents of all three we tried. They had a nice scent that wasn\u2019t overly strong. They are slightly smaller than the largest bath bombs we\u2019ve used before. These dissolve slower than others we\u2019ve used, which I personally think is a positive. Also liked that there was no oily residue In bathtub or on my skin after using. Overall I think this product provide a lot of value with the price and we plan on reordering once we\u2019ve used them all.",

All in all these are good bath bombs, and a HUGE pack for the money. Also great options for teachers' gifts, etc. Always nice to get them something they will use vs another coffee mug. A bath bomb and a small coffee gift card is often what we give to teachers. They seem to always love it.",
