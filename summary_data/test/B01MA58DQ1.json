      "text": "The new/out of the box garmin gps/sonar would not stay on. it would shutdown every 2 to 10 minutes, I tried different circuits and different batteries. Finally, I hooked it to a battery in my garage and the same problem happened. I contacted garmin support and they sent a new backplate and power cord. The new parts did not solve the problem. After two days of installation and troubleshooting, I'm thoroughly frustrated that the device is defective. I don't know if I got a one in a thousand lemon or if more of these defective units are out there. Mine is now in a return box to Amazon.",

We went dipnetting at the mouth of the Kenai river when sockeye & chinook salmon were schooling below the boat and seals were chasing them, really cool to watch on the fishfinder! Depth is extremely accurate!",

Installation was super simple. I needed a little help with wiring to my VHF, but Garmin had fantastic customer service and I was able to get it hooked up. The downside is the size of the transducer. It is so long, that I was unable to mount it on the starboard side because the propeller of my trolling motor would have hit it, so it is mounted on the port side. I will see how it goes.",

My second time the charts had shown the most shallow elevation of 128 feet deep, while cruising directly over that spot, the fish finder showed 73 feet and boom! Snagged cannon ball. The fish finder depth has been on spot. Make sure to set your depth alarm and don't trust the charts.",
