I have gray-green eyes and the black color is way to intense for me that's why it so important for me to find the right shade. This eyeliner is not going to work for me because it's so dark. Other than that - I would say this is a good eyeliner. I liked its staying power and it was easy to use it. It looks mat, no shine at all which I personally liked.",
