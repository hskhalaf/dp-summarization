Every once in a while I would go out and get the pry bar, crow bar, and hammer, and break a few up at a time. On average would take about 15 minutes to disassemble one. Couldn't wait to try this tool.. Went out, tossed the first one flat on the ground, and applied the breaker. 2 minutes later.. It was apart! Can't believe in the 4 years I've been making stuff out of upcycled pallets I never came across this tool before!",

      "text": "The articulating heads are very important. Pallets are very fickle because the individual boards behave differently as they are being pried off. Since I'm using this to reclaim wood for other uses, having the articulating heads helps prevent the boards from being rolled in the direction of the pull thus making it much less likely they will split or break along the length of the board. This is huge, because it probably increases your recovery of usable boards by 75% or more.",

This is a very well made heavy duty time-saving tool with much less damage to wood and am glad I found this on Amazon and for a reasonable price too! The only disappointment I have is I never received the prybar that was supposed to come with this. You'll be glad you bought this tool!",

The leverage is great, because the bottom hangs and adjusts to where you put it. Hard to describe, but you'll see. This saves you from wrenching your body and from flying shrapnel.

My only complaint (and it's a small one) is that the tool weighs a ton. By the way, don't take the free nail puller into account when you are deciding. The nail puller is a piece of junk.
