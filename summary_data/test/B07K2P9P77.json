Buying songs from iTunes and changing to mp3 is an extra step but no big deal once you learn how. And you can listen to books as well as music. If you swim, get it.",

Pretty disappointing to spend this much money on a product that couldn't even manage to work for 45 minutes. It also doesn't have great sound quality, but I don't expect a whole lot while I'm swimming - anything is better than nothing, which is what I ended up with.",

I was very pleased with this, as other companies often don't even honor their own guarantees.

I swim all year round when possible, so hopefully, I'll get a lot of use out of the replacement MP3 player.",

Perfect solution, once you find your earbud fit. Plenty loud over bubble sound, easy to adjust with buttons on back of head, and super easy to add and delete music. Playlist will play in order you added files. I recommend normalizing the volume through your tracks...or the volume will blow your head off on that ONE Portishead track!",

It clips to your goggles strap and is very secure in flip turns. Earbuds are pretty good, you have to jam them in firmly to get a good seal. Once in they also stay put during flip turns and underwater pushoffs. You tuck the slack wire in your goggles strap too. You have to let the MP3 player dry out before the usb connects properly to the computer. It takes iTune files as is, easy drag and drop to file explorer. Good buy, makes an hour swim fly by.",

But what is so key here, other than the reasonable price, is that the volume is actually loud enough for a swimming pool. I wonder how many other swim mp3 companies have even tested their products with actual swimmers. I have had to return several devices because I can't hear at maximum volume at the pool, let alone the ocean. This mp3 player is a bargain.",

At first these were pretty good, the sound quality went in and out, but it was not too bad. But, after 3 to 3 1/2 months it totally stopped working.",
