The mattress arrived several days EARLY. It took a few hours to put together, no damaged/missing parts. The mattress opening is 74\". The 75\" twin mattress fits in the top because it can hang over the platform a bit on each end as the ends are open. On the bottom the opening between the legs is 74\" which does not allow for the mattress on a trundle platform slide into the opening. I will have to find a slightly shorter mattress or somehow extend the length of the bed?",

Easy to put together alone, would be a tad easier with two persons. Only snag occurred at the start of assembly due to the mis-labeling of 2 similar parts.

A twin mattress from Sams Club fit the bed nicely. But adding another to a trundle below does not really work well. Twin mattresses are all about 75 inches long. The inside clearance between the bed legs is 74\". Once bedding is added it will be even tougher to push the mattress in or pull it out. We are now looking at buying a custom cut foam rubber mattress. The bed doesn't advertise using a trundle but I am surprised the bed wasn't designed just an inch or two longer.",

I decided to proceed on and it's barely noticeable (the mattress is thick enough to cover the hole). This was a step up bed for my five year old. It looks nice and is a very stable bed...no movement whatsoever. Very satisfied with our purchase.",

The instructions were relatively clear and straightforward, and assembly was pretty easy - EXCEPT for the dang slats! Putting and keeping the back slats in was VERY VERY difficult, and for that part alone I wish I'd had someone helping me. But, I got it done and my daughter loves it. The bed itself is really well made and seems very sturdy and will hopefully last her a long time.",

I had my doubts when we were putting it together about being sturdy; but, when we where done we ended up with a very sturdy bed. Some advice: when you assemble the bottom long boards the ones holding the mattress, put on the one on the back first. We put the front one first and the back one wouldn't fit therefore, we had to take it off then put the back on then re screw the front one again.",
