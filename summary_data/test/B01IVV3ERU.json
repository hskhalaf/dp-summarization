      "text": "Dandelion weeds are a pain in the behind to get rid of. The reason is those long deep tap roots, you pull the top off but those roots ensure it keeps coming back. This is designed to allow those roots to be loosened and pulled out. The V tine cuts through compacted dirt and allows access to the root. This weeder is nice in that it has a cantilever point in the middle making it easier to rock the root out. The handle has a solid but comfortable grip. It also has a hole in the end of the handle to add a strap or use to hang.",

I actually enjoy weeding with this tool knowing that it is friendly for the environment. Far too many people over-use products like weed & feed which actually can be counterproductive.

This handle is definitely comfortable, but because the forks are much less sharp, and there is the additional piece of metal to help pry weeds out of the ground, I cant' get in as accurately around the base of the weed. It would likely be fine in looser soil in a garden, but I'm using it to remove weeds in a lawn with pretty compact soil. Because the soil is compact i can't get this weeder in nearly as deeply as the cheaper versions.",
