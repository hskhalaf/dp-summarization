There's barely any light coming from it and only five different animations to it, also the USB connection feels cheap and you would be much better off buying the Kraken Pro V2 instead of these. Like I said it feels quality but having it break only 5 months into its lifespan makes me think they just cheeped out on the internals and focused on the looks.",

You\u2019re paying for a moderate pair of Gaming Headphones. They work as expected and I haven\u2019t had a problem with them at all, good sound, clear voice for the mic and cool colors on the headphones. Only thing is they feel cheap but aren\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t recommend for young children.",

I can wear them for 8 hours or more and my ears will not hurt. the sound quality is pretty great as well and the dampen sound from the outside world which is a plus when you live in a house with 5 other people.
