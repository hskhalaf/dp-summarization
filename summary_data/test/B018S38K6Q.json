I wear 7.5 and I got 7.5 and the size is just right. On the side note: leather stains. Someone dropped a piece of apricot on the shoe so I had to wipe it with water right away. The area I washed looks darker when it dried. There is no dirty spot from fruit juice. The color is just darker now. So I wiped both boots with water entirely and now they are same darker color. BTW, I like the new color :) So maybe spray them with suede protector before going out.",

There does, however, seem to be an extra bit of room at the toe, so perhaps I could have gone with a 7 1/2 instead. Either way, I'm very happy with them.",

Also, the heel isn't too tall, so they're comfortable to wear as a more casual boot than some of my others. I got the dark stone color, but am tempted to buy the black ones, too.",
