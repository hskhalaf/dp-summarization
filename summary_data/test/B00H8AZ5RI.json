Anyone who has been to Sedona, there are a lot of picture taking opportunities. :) This is will be great for running to have my phone along but not needing to access it often.

The belt does not comfortably fit the larger waist sizes advertised, but must stretch significantly to do so, which felt uncomfortable. And while I realize that ultra-compactness may be a desirable feature to many, I could not fit anything more than a small phone in the pouch, certainly not a wallet as well. However admittedly I am probably not part of the target demographic. And on the plus side, a big, big plus, it is made in the USA.",

That's what made me love this; it's only ever as big as you need it to be and I try to keep this bag very discrete. It doesn't bounce, and despite my being a very small woman, it fits so tightly that I can put a phone or water bottle in the strap and it won't bounce around/",

      "text": "My kids have peanut allergies. These SPIbelts fit a single EpiPen and an inhaler or two EpiPens, plus a canister vial of antihistamine tablets. They have a low profile. My son wears his backwards, so it's hardly noticeable. My daughter wears hers in front. They look a lot \"cooler\" than fanny packs, so kids don't tease them. They hold up great. We probably have to replace them about once every 18-24 months, which means they're very durable, given that my kids wear them every day, all day, when they're away from home.",

I like that the pouch is stretchy, so it conforms to whatever you're carrying.

      "text": "Time to replace my old worn out Spibelt! The new one looks the same--still a super slim profile---but it has enough room now to comfortably hold my smartphone and ID. Other reviews I've read are correct in that it does run much smaller than older ones...it is several inches shorter when put side by side. It is still very comfortable though. I had the old one for close to ten years and, by the end, had to cinch it nearly as much as it would possibly go due to it having stretched out over the years--so perhaps Spibelt is trying to avoid that. Could not run without this :)",

It's small and compact but can expand as it is made from stretchy fabric, and the belt itself is elastic as well. It exceeds my expectation. My only concern - as wife and mom I'm going to be asked to carry everybody else's stuff now! :)",
