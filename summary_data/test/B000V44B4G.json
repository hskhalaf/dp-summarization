We liked the concept and it worked well for a bit. It has a light weight chair in it and only ever used by one small child gently. Risky. Really like this but two things to watch. Kid can tip if they want. Second is that it springs back super hard and fast so be careful putting on and off. Would buy again. Also, if table is low or has an overhang, night have trouble fitting under with kids legs.",

If I did have a complaint I wish that the height were more adjustable but it should fit most standard sized tables just fine. Bar level height tables may be more of an issue.",

Searching high and low, there are not many options for counter height chairs, and she still needs to be strapped into a chair - so we tried Kaboost. This worked perfectly! It took just a minute maybe to install, what a great idea and product. I like that when we don't need the high chair, we can use it to boost a regular chair afterward, so I see a lot of use out of it in the future. An added bonus - the chair is even sturdier WITH Kaboost, win-win.",

I also like that they don't significantly detract from the appearance of our dining room chairs like regular boosters would. My one (tiny) complaint is that they are a little harder to put on than advertised, but that's totally minor. Overall I highly recommend these.",

It allows for our child to use a regular chair, reach the table when sitting, climb in and out of the kitchen chair by herself, and it keeps it secure to the ground. We have to lift it up to push it in, but we only do that at dinner time and it's not as bad as I thought. Bye bye bumbo!",

I thought that this booster was a lovely shade of grey, but it's actually a sort of hospital-industrial-complex beige-tan. At any rate, after his initial resistance, which lasted for an hour or so, my two-year-old LOVES climbing into his chair. And while I worried about him tumbling from the (higher) chair, he really seems safer, because he sits right at the table, and on his bottom rather than on his knees. The Kaboost gives him some autonomy, too, and it's a lovely transition from the hippo chair that suspended him from the table, legs dangling in the air.",

You can use these to get normal height seats to be, more or less, counter-height. For like, a 5 year old or older. Yes. It will work. And the chair will be sturdy and stable.

Unfortunately even the lowest setting was already borderline for our tall 2yo toddler and it seemed obvious she would be uncomfortable in it within a couple of months. Additionally this thing isn't a very attractive addition to your living area. I feel like this is yet another case of someone trying to solve a problem that didn't really exist - we got a nice booster pillow instead which cost way less and serves us well, reliably, and neatly.",

This gives you two choices, so it is not entirely adjustable, but the higher adjustment was what we needed. I needed a second pair of hands to steady the chair while I pulled the third and fourth pieces out to the length needed. The buyer might need to be aware of that if they are buying it for an adult's use. Possibly a parent buying this for children is young enough and in good enough health to secure this without the help of another person.",

Consequently my 3 year old always needs help getting properly adjusted. Not a deal braker, but slightly annoying. The product is constructed well, functions exactly as promised, and seems extremely safe and secure.",
