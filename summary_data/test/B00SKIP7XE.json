I opted for the larger size and couldn't be happier! Arrived on time(ty Amazon), was packaged well. The quality of this collar is spectacular! I'm SURE this will be the last collar I ever have to buy for my Oz! The leather is a solid piece(not sandwiched like some 'leather' collars), wide, with a sturdy buckle and beautiful finish! It's definately made for a large dog! Do NOT try to buy this thinking it'll make your little dog look tough because this collar is heavy! I couldn't be happier!",

I figured I\u2019d get a cheap $14.00 collar and upsize again when needed. I had NO idea this collar was so nice! It\u2019s wide, soft, durable leather and I am more than impressed. It\u2019s better quality than the expensive one I bought a few months ago! I will definitely be buying this collar again when he grows out of the medium. Awesome collar, looks fantastic and super fast delivery. Definitely recommend this one!!",

It's extremely sturdy and well made with six rivets holding one ring and another six holding the buckle and another ring. Easy to buckle. The fittings are brass and the collar looks high quality. The leather is dark brown, thick and of course being wide it is a big collar, I suppose there are thinner and more comfortable collars out there, but if you want something with strength to hold a big dog ... this is it.",
