      "text": "Super cute book, with very important and helpful information. I knew this would be good starting at the first page. It shows a baby typical of whayou see on TV- plump cheeks, clean, smiling, ect. And then it shows what your baby will actually look like when it is born- wrinked, red, crying, ect. I thought this was perfect for first time dads, with not a lot of experience with children. Great read, and my husband said it was informative.",

Definitely a worthy buy for dads to be!",

It has a lot of humor in it but also A LOT of practical and helpful information such as maintaining and cleaning breast pumps, swaddling, ideas on how to calm a crying baby, eating habits, etc.",

First page talk about what you think baby will looks like (with example of a plump full of emotion 3 month old) and an actual newborn (looking old and wrinkly and thin)... I just thought every piece of this was so relevant, would buy it for every expecting father I know!",

Right when he started to skim through if after opening he was already reading passages out loud and cracking up at the wording. It's very well written with a lot of helpful pictures. Since most books are directed towards moms to be I was usually the one with all of the baby knowledge and now he is telling me things that I didn't know, it has made him much more involved. Who knew that a book could do so much :) My dad also skimmed through it and said that he would like a copy. Very highly recommended.",

He said that the easy-read and humorous nature of the book combined with the actual hints and instructions for how to deal with both me, and our new baby was great. He loved to read this book, he'd laugh and read me parts of it as well. I think if you're looking for a book for men to read about new babies, this is it! He likes it because it covers not only what to expect from the birth itself (what the baby will look like, act like, etc) but the different phases as they get older. How to deal with feedings, sickness, sleep patterns, etc.",
