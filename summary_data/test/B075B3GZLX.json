This year we decided to step up to automated watering and went with Spruce and the matching sensors. Wow, 185 lbs of vegetables later, we are blown away! Spruce has helped us grow way more than we previously had and is so much easier to setup and monitor. The garden is at our local Synagogue and with Spruce I can see exactly when it has been watering and even monitor soil moisture all from home. Highly recommended.",

What a night and day difference. I could easily setup a schedule that used weather to adjust or skip watering all year round. The schedule they call connected, setup the times automatically after I set the different zone areas up. From the charts I can see the water times decrease as we have moved into winter. Now it is barely watering at all and I didn't need to touch a single setting!",

They respond immediately, usually within the same day, and always provide answers to my questions. Even beyond normal technical support as been provided for Home-Automation, and sensor structures. Hopefully this new batch of sensors will work out and this will be 5 stars soon!",

I wish it would have worked for my situation. Everyone's situation is different so it is a trial situation in the end to see if it works using wireless sensors. It is a nice controller and I was impressed with all the settings for watering that could be changed for anyone's situation.",
