      "text": "This is an excellent conditioner for dogs with sensitive skin. We have an apricot poodle/yorkie mix & other shampoo/conditioner combos leave her with itchy skin. So far, this has been TOPS--no residue, no itchiness & it seems to have soothed her skin. I recommend pairing it with the matching Isle of Dogs shampoo; they seem to work really well together, though in my opinion, you only need one container of conditioner for every two bottles of shampoo. Works great and smells good, especially as the scent gently fades over the course of a week: A+!",

After one day of use, I ordered a second batch. It is satisfying while bathing and there is no greasy residue. In the 6 years working in the pet grooming industry, I have never experienced a conditioner that has left so much gloss, gentle on skin/coat, repair, de shedding, volume, and - for the professionals out there - scissor/clipper ease. Summary: I wish there was a gallon priced economically. It is a miracle product reviewed by a dog groomer/skin/coat nerd.",

It has a light pleasant fragrance that lasts for several days after the bath - and more importantly it does a fabulous job of smoothing out tangles after shampooing and continues to keep their coats easy to comb for days after. I diluted it with water to lightly spray on \"trouble spots\" before their daily comb outs. Highly recommend especially for long haired dogs!!!",
