She would sit there for a pretty long time (in baby dictionary that is between 15-30 min) and be very amused by the multiple toys on the tray. That means mommy can finish the dishes or has hot meal. The different kind of toy is a great stimulus for my baby to learn and I love the fact that the height is adjustable. I would definitely recommend this booster seat!",

She liked the rainforest addition on top of the table for the first 2-3 months, but we stopped using it after 9 months. The rest of the chair is still functional though. This seat is portable, attaches to any dining chair. We have taken this seat to restaurants, grandparents house, and trips. I highly recommend this!! Must have!!",

He had a concussion and has been throwing up ever since. We are super lucky it wasn't worse. He had a very expensive CT scan that came back negative - thank God!!
