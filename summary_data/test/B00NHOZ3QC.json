It was especially disappointing because I had more than 15 hours work detaching and aerating the lawn prior. Even more disappointing is the fact that I asked Scotts to honor their money back guarantee for just one of the bags and never received their promised check. Months later I called Scotts again and they said they would immediately send out another check, which also never came. I will never buy their product again.",

The areas to be reseeded were scattered throughout my yard, some in shade areas and some in full sun. Germination wasn\u2019t consistent, I still have bare spots in both areas. What\u2019s puzzling is that I got good germination in one spot and none in another. This happened in both sun and shaded areas. My irrigation system is on a timer and I have good water depth throughout the yard. I also applied fungicide and insecticide prior to reseeding. Will try and reseed remaining bare spots this fall.",

The lush green grass that sprouted from this seed was nice, but it only lasted about six weeks before it eventually turned patchy and brown. Even with tri-weekly watering, there's only about 20% of my grass left. Anything over 80 degrees and this grass will die. So I do not recommend this product. It is not a 'long term' solution to a nice looking lawn. It does not withstand heat, and it isn't very dense either. I would recommend spending more on Bermuda or Zoysia grass.",

In shaded areas the growth was even slower, hopefully few more weeks of sunshine will contribute to the strength of the grasses. Would I buy it again?
