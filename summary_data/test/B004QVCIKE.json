The first time I used it, my face burned like fire, and I questioned why anyone would use it, it seemed to make the razor burn much worse. This turns out to be an indication of improper shaving technique. After adjusting my technique, the razor burn went away. Now when I apply alum after shaving, there is a mild sting for a few seconds and then it's good to go. I rinse it off after it dries, and then apply some diluted Cerave hand lotion. This combination gives a very smooth, irritation free shave.",
