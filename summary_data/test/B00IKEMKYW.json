      "text": "Bought this laptop about a year ago. There's absolutely nothing i can complain about. It's touchscreen, folds backwards into a tablet, contains enough RAM and space for graphic work, and some music production. Wonderful Brand, Great experience, would definitely recommend! *do note that this model does not come with the thinkpad yoga stylus/ pen included. At first i thought i can just buy the thinkpad yoga stylus separately, but it doesn't work on this model (as this model isn't pre-programmed to work with that particular stylus). Any other capacitive stylus/ pen will work just fine though. So it's still an awesome buy :).",

It seamlessly works streaming via Chromecast to my TV with quality (currently streaming a live Avett Brothers concert). The versatility of the screen position is impressive. It is a little heavier that I thought it would be given the size, but it makes it feel durable, so it is not a bad thing. Doesn't get too hot and I can barely hear the fan when it is running.",

This made the keyboard pretty much useless for serious technical users (that edit code, etc.) who use the f1-12 keys a lot. Furthermore, on brand new unit, the down-arrow key cap keeps falling off. Lenovo was unwilling, for 5 months straight of knowing about problem, and even after 3 more BIOS releases, to fix the problem.",
