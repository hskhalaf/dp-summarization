I knew I wanted to get a food processor where I could steam and blend in one place and the babycook so far does not disappoint. Not only is it sleek and does not occupy much space but it steams and purees food so well. I love that everything is at a push of a button. There is also a great beaby babycook blog with tons of recipes which was useful to a ftm like me.",
