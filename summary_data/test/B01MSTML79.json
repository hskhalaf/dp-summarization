I re ordered the larger size directly from UnderArmour.com and they were less expensive for the correct size (in fact less expensive all together) with free shipping also! Not right to charge more money for a bigger size...in fact, one size bigger at that. I thought amazon.com had the least expensive price but I guess that isn't always the case. It pays to research so I am not happy about that.",

Most important for those with wide feet like me this shoe is definitely not wide enough although it is advertised as wide fit, and its printed on the box but compared to other brands i have owned, Asics, New Balance and 5.11, this shoe is slimmer. Under Armour has very few wide shoes in their Product range apparently the \"wide\" market is not big enough for economies of scale.",
