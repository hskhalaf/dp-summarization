I contacted the company and told them what happened and they offered to send me a new backrest with the new designed zipper. I was able to remove this cover with ease and wash and put it back on.

Well, 7 days later, it's still compressed and sagging. I purchased this for my daughter to have in her college dorm room, but it's unusable for it's intended purpose. Since I can no longer return it, she's outta luck and I just threw $20 something bucks in the garbage.",

I've tried adding bed pillows to the front of it to see if that would support my lower back, while I leaned back head back against the upper part. Still, it was very uncomfortable. Very disappointed. I would not buy another pillow.",

When I unzipped the cover, I found the cover lining is falling apart. I won't go through the bother of returning as this is for the guest room, but if you are buying a foam backrest, look elsewhere for quality!",

If you flumph it, it helps only a little. BUT, then, as advertised, in a day or so it fills itself out as the stuffing breathes. It is a good reading pillow. If I had a complaint, I would want the back to be higher. But it is a good looking, comfy accessory.",
