I liked the mattress when new because it has the right firmness for my comfort; however, after a year and half, it has softened significantly on one side where I normally sleep. I had to rotate the mattress so that I sleep in the firmer side of the mattress. That means, I will have another one and half years before I have to buy a new mattress. I think it might be a better value, over a long run, to buy the hybrid type of mattress, we which has springs, from the same manufacturer.",
