This got me so excited I used it in my bathrooms and kitchen I was blown away with all the bacteria and other contaminates that illuminated when I thought the areas were clean. I cleaned again with a stronger cleaner (Full strength La's Totally Awesome All purpose Cleaner which is also available on Amazon) and then checked with the light. Oh what a difference!!",

Those also require yellow glasses to really see everything; the PeeDar does not. I'm sold.",

However we were grossed out at how well it worked and did not realize how bad our carpet was with pet stains to point we are just going to replace the carpet. And then take it into your bathroom and you well have your bleach out cleaning the toilet . This light even works in the daylight but of course shows up much better at night.",

As soon as I turned it in on I could immediately see all the different spots throughout the house. It was very easy to determine where she has had an accident before. The spots glowed super bright. I wasted my money on a cheaper black light that did not work at all. So skip any other black light you may be thinking about and purchase this one. It really does work!",

After I read an article that said 380-385nm was the perfect spectrum, I checked the product that I was using and it was closer to 400nm (which worked fine for vomit, but not urine). I immediately ordered the PeeDar and was overjoyed to find that it does illuminate my cats' urine!!! If only I had known earlier! This product is fantastic!",
