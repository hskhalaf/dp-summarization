I've had to play with the laces a bit to get the right feel for overall shoe tightness, and someone with a wider foot might want to go a half size up.",

The cleats on the bottom are pronounced, but shaped as to not be sharp or have turf stick to them. The fit is standard, perfect for a normal foot (not needing narrow or wide shoes). The laces can be adjusted to fit various foot types as well, there is plenty of adjustment to get a fit that you prefer.",

She said these look like space ships from the top side so not a fan of the coloring still but at least they aren't pink or orange. Fit well and seem to have a little more cushioning that the men's cleats she has been wearing. Good grip on the ball and cuts well doing skill moves.",
