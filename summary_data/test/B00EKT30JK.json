I wish there were more detailed instructions on how each airbrush can be adjusted because I got in a mess with the brushes pretty quickly when trying to figure it out. The beginner guide could be a little more detailed but I eventually figured out how to get paint to spray out haha.",

I was meticulous about cleaning after each use. Then after 6 uses, the nozzle broke on the G25 gun. Argh! Broke halfway on screw threads so it was not easy to get broken piece out! Now I have to buy new nozzle and needle just to finish my project. Disappointed in fabrication of this part. It's made to be taken off for cleaning, and in less than two months it broke. Will update review if company contacts me to replace the broken part.",
