My original order was missing one of the extra silicone pieces that go on the headrest pillar. Normei has excellent customer service and solved my problem at once. I installed the hooks in my car and the work great. They are long enough to accommodate a two handled purse. Plus, they have locks so as not to come off at inappropriate times. I am quite satisfied.",
