The lenses aren't gradient as I expected and also looked a bit cheap. Another con - I like large glasses, but these were far too big and looked bug-like. Perhaps this is because you can't see through the lenses. The brown may have been a better look since you can see through them so they may not give the bug appearance. I returned these and opted for Jimmy Choo sunglasses instead.",
