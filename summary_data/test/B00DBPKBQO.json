      "text": "My Pentax K-50, purchased in 2014, finally succumbed to the dreaded aperture block failure. There are plenty of reviews about the merits of this particular model of camera, so my review is not about the camera itself. (although I must say it is a very fine piece of equipment, IMHO) I just wanted folks to know that I was able to click the shutter 22,942 times before it failed. There is a Pentax site that can determine the number of clicks by reading the data from a JPEG file you upload. I'm not thrilled it has failed, but 3 1/2 years and just shy of 23,000 pics - probably got my moneys worth.",

If it keeps doing this I will be forced to sell it at a loss just to get rid of it. Other than that, love the weight and feel of this camera in my hands.

I tweaked some of my photos in Adobe Lightroom before posting them here. Also, the Fotodiox lens hood was purchased from amazon and did not come with the kit.",

I did my research and decided on the Pentax over the Nikon (they seemed very close) mainly for cosmetic reasons. Upon first powering up it was a little intimidating but I took time and read the manual while playing around with it. I love the fact that if I think I have messed up the Menu button just sends me back home. The picture quality is beautiful and for my purposes easy to use. It is apparent that the more experienced photographer will enjoy this also. It has so much more than I would ever use.",

I am very disappointed that some of the manufacturer supplied accessories had been removed from the box: Owner instruction manual, Pentax battery and charger.
