My sled had a screw that was stripped upon initial delivery and I contacted them directly and they were able to send me a replacement foot and screw very quick. My wife and I have used the sled for conditioning a few times so far and we love the quality and workmanship of it. You can definitely tell it's built to last! If you're wondering what all you can do with this beast; just lookup prowler training and enjoy! You can make it a great total body workout",
