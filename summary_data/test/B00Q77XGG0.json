They look kind of odd because they are not symmetrical and remind me of soccer shoes with the laces off center for better ball contact. We'll see if that makes a difference with time. Typically, for me, the Asics last fits my foot well and I think I'll like these. I'll try to remember to comment in a couple months after they've had some wear.",

      "text": "These shoes are excellent for weight training and general exercise in the gym. They have a solid base that is stable during squats and a low stack height with minimal heel drop so you are closer to the ground for deadlifts. These shoes make for an excellent alternative to other minimalist lifting shoes that have giant toe boxes, and give someone with a narrow foot a better option",

      "text": "Use them for lifting. Pro: The foot bed/arch is very supportive. Cushioning is minimal, so when under weight you don't feel spongy. Con: The offset laces are an acquired look. The upper material is not designed to breath. At 40 degrees it's hot. Can't wait for the summer. Three months later: The shoe is too narrow. The synthetic material does not give. Too painful to wear everyday.",

      "text": "Bottom Line: - I like the idea of this design, but the overall fit is too narrow for most people. - Performs somewhat like a minimalist shoe. - Looks good, but could use a color option: Earth Tone which hides dirt better. - Performs well for weight lifting and short-mid distance running. Modification suggestions: - Smoothen the heel transition with the upper shoe. - Add material to connect the sole with the upper laces to provide a natural medial arch support during foot movement. - Thin out the tongue by 40-50% for more comfort.",
