This is a real accordion just smaller for smaller hands. I never noticed, but no matter what you do with an accordion it always sounds good lol It really does, My Granddaughter & I have been having such a great time with it! She says when she plays, the music sounds sad and when I play the music sounds so happy, a lot of fun, totally recommend",

Quality and sound is great for the price! I recently ordered a second one for my daughter who is almost 3 because she couldn't stop borrowing her brother's. Both of them have a lot of fun with these and play them frequently. I totally recommend this. It's a great toy to help kids learn about music and to just have fun!",

The size is perfect to put the strap over the head and walk about playing the drum. The drum is loud enough to be heard but is not over bearing. Many hours of fun were had with this drum for a little over a year until the clear skin broke. There does not seem to be a way to replace the skin, but for the reasonable price lots of fun was had.",

    "description": "Style:AccordionOur finely crafted accordion had wood construction with a durable plastic coating. The easy to learn instruction sheet has songs included! You will be putting on a show in no time! This is a great way for a child to start to learn the accordion in a simple and easy way.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nYour child probably doesn't know Lawrence Welk or the accordion he toted around so famously for years. That should work in the favor of this sturdy, enjoyable instrument. Compact and well built, this starter instrument is a great introduction to the accordion--or just a lot of ephemeral fun. The accordion fits nicely into the palms of an adult's hands, but isn't too unwieldy for its target audience. The number of keys are minimized for ease of use and simplicity, but it's still possible to crank out a complex favorite such as \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (a brief \"basic instructions\" leaflet is enclosed) only 10 minutes after the instrument's out of the box. --Keith Simanton\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThis finely crafted accordion looks and feels like the real thing. It includes an easy-to-learn instruction and song booklet. This accordion measures 7.50\u201d wide, where it plays the whole scale. It is great for ages 7 and above.\n\nSee more",
