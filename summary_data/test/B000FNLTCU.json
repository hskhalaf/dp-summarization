I want to know what I am purchasing with first hand experience. Big pots, available in high end cooking supply stores are way too costly to even consider. This pot, at $145, is a real bargain.",

It is shorter with a larger diameter than many I've seen but it's working our for the best. My immersion chiller diameter is based on a 5 gal bucket and it fits perfectly in this pot with ample room (a few inches) around the outside to promote really good heat transfer. I just installed a weldless 1/2\" kettle valve and now the brew pot is nearly complete. Thinking about a brewmometer.",
