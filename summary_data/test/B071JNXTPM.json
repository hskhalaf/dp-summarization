Keep in mind that this likely only works well on areas where there would be no grout lines under the suction cup. Our tiles are quite large so there is the smooth surface for easy adhesion.",

UPDATE: it is great if I hang it on the mirror which I do. However, my husband doesn't like it there so he tries to attach it to his cabinet door. It lasts a few hours there and then falls off.
