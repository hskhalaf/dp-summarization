The sound was watered down, not full, sounded like cheap $5 ones you could get from your local 7-eleven. The noise canceling was non existent. Horrible, absolutely horrible sounding, lowest quality headphones I've ever used. Absolutely disgusted with this purchase and that I actually believed the reviews.",

(A subjective judgment based upon limited use, your opinion might differ.) The over-the-ear design generally muffles outside noise -- but much more isolating when playing music through them.

They will break if you run them over with your car ;-) Don't think they were built for that. I have big ears and these were very comfortable, a lot of over ear headphones hurt after a while. These do not. Great product, especially for the price.",

It is not an active noise-canceling headphone, but that's good, since oftentimes added amplifiers increased the distortion (THD). The over-ear design is comfortable and isolates outside noise pretty well. When music is on, you cannot hear what's going on outside, so you don't get distracted. All in all, I'm very satisfied by the product.",

      "text": "These headphones, for the price are amazing. They have beautiful audio quality almost akin to the earbuds that came with my Galaxy S8! The ear cups fit snugly around my ears and the band has enough room that it doesn't hurt the top of my head like many other headsets I've had in the past. Definitely recommend!",

      "text": "40 hours a week, I live in a cubicle with some neighbors I'd rather not listen to any longer. Between the peanut-cracker on one side and the water-swisher on the other, and the near-constant bickering between them, I'd had enough. Today, for the first time in 6 months, I can hear myself think thanks to the Edifier H840 headphones. Having them on muffles the sound enough that I can hear only murmuring when I'm not playing music. When the music is on, they're completely drowned out and the volume is down pretty low. The sound is fantastic, too. Ear cups are soft and comfortable for long-term use. Thrilled with this purchase.",

I wish they were slightly larger, as they are quite snug around my ears. Not enough of a problem that I would take away a star though. I would definitely recommend these headphones. Don't waste hundreds of dollars on a name brand when they are only slightly better. (I'm looking at you Bose)",
