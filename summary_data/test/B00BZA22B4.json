I ordered at the end of June and received quickly, however only a month old and the silicone band has already torn almost completely through. For the price, I expected better quality. I have contacted the seller to see of they will assist in replacing the product. Update- the seller said the item did not meet warranty coverage. Very disappointed that it broke in less than a month with lacking customer service of product quality",

The information plate is almost as wide as my wrist, but now that I've worn it for several days it's getting \"broken in\" & I'm adjusting to it. I'm very pleased with it, but will order one that is a bit more narrow next time to decrease the bulk.",
