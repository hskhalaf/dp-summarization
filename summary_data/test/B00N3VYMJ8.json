You open the package, it's beautiful and tight. But as it is used, it begins to wobble within itself (still very tight to the wheel). The wobbling got me too nervous to keep the device installed; thus looking for another elegant non-flashy one... Sorry, cannot recommend at all.",

Now the negatives- the knob relies on a \"friction clamping Pressure\" to prevent loose rotation on the steering wheel. It is inadequate for the safety necessary- you will end up fighting this loosey goosey knob mount until you find something else that works. Personally, I drilled a hole in the steering wheel and knob mounting base and \"popped in a rivet\" This gave a secure connection.",

      "text": "I just tossed away 8 ball which I bought from a truck stop and install this one. Much better quality and fit perfectly for my 2018 Cascadia. I gave four out of five stars because after one week the rubber coating starts peel off from outer turning knob. I know this is just cosmetic issue and unit still functions well as should be. My recommendation to manufacture is do not add rubber coat outer wheel area, just rubberized center circular area is sufficient enough. I\u2019m still recommending to other truck drivers this unit is far better than 8 ball you bought from the truck stop.",

For the product maker, I would recommend you texturize the plastic to feel like rubber rather than coat smooth plastic with a rubber coating that won't stay on. Thanks.",
