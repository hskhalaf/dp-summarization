If I had a wider foot, the 7 would probably work. I think a 6.5 would probably fit me better because the fabric does seem like it will loosen up. The fabric is nice. It\u2019s a very thick velvet. Actually it\u2019s so nice and thicn that they are hot. They would be better for cooler temperatures. The sole is extremely comfortable. I will order these again is a smaller size.",
