To put in perspective, when someone says \u201cthis cocktail is disgusting with the vanilla and citrus and leather flavors, I\u2019m the guy that turns into a garbage disposal for the team\u201d. All a long winded way of saying that I suffer through bad decisions just to get my mileage, but this stuff made me toss that junk in the trash and go steady.",

I use mine for my everyday part, leaving a little mess, or giving my hair a little lift. Super easy, a little bit (dime sized or less) goes a long way, in fact I used my previous one every day for almost 6 months. The scent is the other amazing thing about this pomade, since its made with hops, it has this fresh, floral, yet manly scent that is addictive. I love the smell of my head in the morning. Recommend this product for people who want a decent hold, and those who want a nice, non-glossy finish.",

I believe this product could be that perfect one if my hair were thinner, smoother, and straighter, but it's not, so for me this product is good and of high quality but did not quite meet my needs.
