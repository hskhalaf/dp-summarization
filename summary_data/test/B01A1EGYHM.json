My towels take forever to dry and then they start to smell. Mi also am constantly cleaning mildew off the walls. After a month of using this dehumidifier I'm am so pleased! No mildew or smelly towels!, it is so quiet you don't even realize it's on. Easy to use. Easy to empty the tray of water. Would purchase again",

Now we no longer have a humidity problem! One of the best things I've ever ordered!

The RV is never damp works great. Being so compact we're able to leave it on our counter. Easy to empty runs quiet.",

I have a lower lazzarette in my boat that tends to hold damp air and while i was only using one for the longest time the two of these units keep the provisions dry. Couldn't be happier with the performance and the amount of water they pull out of that environment. I highly recommend them.",
