In nearly every chapter I experienced an \"aha!\" moment- a fact that definitely reinforced my enthusiasm while reading through. This book is segmented into easily digestible chunks, which aids in its readability and re-readability. You could read this book for fifteen minutes during a coffee break or you could whittle away an evening working through the post chapter challenges and, in either case, feel as though you had not wasted a second. The Self-Taught Programmer has helped to evolve my curiosity into a great interest- one which I cannot wait to explore further.",

This was more like a simple Python tutorial with a little bit of scratches to other fields (version control, data structures, databases, bash etc.) Maybe a good read for a total newbie.",

I've supplemented the book with tutorials from PythonProgramming.net and I already feel like a pro. If the thought of programming has crossed your mind, get this book. You'll be hooked after just a few pages.",

      "text": "This book is a roadmap of the practical skills necessary to become a computer science career-ready candidate. While it can absolutely guide the novice to develop expertise, it's also valuable for current computer science students because it goes beyond academic cs skills and covers the technical skills that employers are currently seeking. As an additional bonus, the end of the book focuses on the job search process with excellent advice on preparation for technical interviews and how to get noticed by recruiters to score that first interview. I'm a career coach and will be using this book to prepare my clients for technical job interviews.",
