Even if I never use it that way it was still totally worth the money. Cute!",

Just press down (use a good amount of pressure), and you'll see the imprint on the bread. Use the little pick to cut out the eyes, mouth, etc. So far, I've cut out pieces in cheese (use thicker harder cheese, don't use Kraft singles because it's too soft and will just melt), ham (again, thicker cuts tend to work better), and bread. Would recommend!",

It is very easy to use. I recommend using the body outline to cut the bread , meat & cheese, etc first before assembling the sandwich. The face portion just needs to be used firmly and it gives a good cutout. If you use it for PB&J, definitely spread the sandwich after cutting. A great purchase. She is not a huge sandwich fan, but these get eaten no matter what i put in them.",

Older or supermarket bread sometimes leaves jagged edges. We also use cheese or jam/sunflower butter with the bread. Meat may be a little harder to cut since it's not very sharp for safety reasons.",
