Starts torquing right before 3.7 display would show the ft/Ibs. At this point you may look at the display to set the torque for any range less than 10. You will not have access to buzzer or setting. The alarm and buzzer setting only would work and apply for greater 10 ft/Ibs . Pictures to proof it.",

When tightening to low torques, you just have to watch the display. The display can be set to show peak torque, so it really isn't a problem, just something I would've liked to have known before I ordered it. After I abuse the wrench a little more, I will try to report back on how it is surviving.",

What I do not like the torque wrench is ranging from 4 ft-lb to 99ft-lb is not really going 10 ft-lb to 99 ft-lb buy the thought that was 4 ft-lb but that is a deception.",
