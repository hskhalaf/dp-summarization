We got back home from vacation today July 24. I went online to return this item and it says the return window has closed . I would like a refund. I do not recommend this item .",

Pros: Very cute Easy to Put On Has a Harness Grip for Leashes Cons: Chafes her Underside Fin Won't Stay Up Not as Much Floatation Help as I Wish Stitching started to come undone because she pulled on the leash Probably fairly good for smaller dogs. It's not great for my lab, but it was most definitely better than nothing \ud83d\ude0a If you found my review helpul, please let me know with an upvote :)",

This jacket fit great and it was a good thing that it had a handle so we were able to pull him out before he about had a heart attack.

He does not care for water so I figured a life jacket would make him and me more comfortable having him on the water on the boat and in the water. He is a 25lb beagle and the medium fit him perfectly. He did not seem to mind having it on one bit. It did it\u2019s job and kept him afloat while he was in the water. The only downside is the fin didn\u2019t like to stay up but that did not affect the functionality of the jacket at all.",

We were able to lift him - see video - jackets held up nicely, no tears, rips, etc. Honestly for the price I didn't expect the handle to make it through the weekend but it did and they have now been placed in our life jacket collection ;0) size XL 65lb labradoodle",

(But we ordered it before summer came) so he grew into it. The straps were also a little hard to tighten and loosen. That is the only downfall I see from this product.
