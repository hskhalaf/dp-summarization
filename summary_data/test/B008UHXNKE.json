This new model is pricey at $600, and has a new, less-good, way of drawing air into the unit. They basically messed up their already-excellent design and made it less horsepower, less cooling, and more expensive. Buy the other models I mention above and I promise you'll be cooler and happier.",

So if you plan buying be aware of what I have found out. I will only use for short periods of time. Also one wall and garage door , and attic not insulated.",
