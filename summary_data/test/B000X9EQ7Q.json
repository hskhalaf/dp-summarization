I would say that you need to be careful of the blade and the sharp prongs that stick into whatever you are peeling. Best kitchen gadget ever:-)",

The only problem I have so far is that for small apples (for small children) it does not seem to peel as well as it does for medium and large apples. That is why I gave it 4 stars, not 5. As I get more experienced with this, I may up this to a 5 start review. Otherwise it is great time saver, even with one apple and great for aging hands that are not as flexible as they once were.",

The corer/ slicer works well also. Yes it is plastic. Don\u2019t be discouraged, it is high quality and sturdy and made well. Takes up very little space and is very stable with 4 suction cup feet with quick release tabs. No need to mention price, it is about the lowest out there.",

However I had it in the sink and rinsed it then discovered water inside which took a long time to dry because there are tiny holes on the bottom and little ventilation. However, you sure can see when there's something inside. The other comment is it takes a lot of muscle to wedge it with the bonus cutter and my wedges weren't even in size. But it's a bonus I guess. Other wedgers I've used have been as hard to push through and a sharper one might be dangerous.",

I'm not sure it is going to last for decades like a nice metal one would be expected to do, but for $14 it was a pleasant surprise. The wider blade takes a wider ribbon of skin off in one go. The only problem is that water gets in between the parts and you have to get a screwdriver, unscrew it and air dry. They could definitely improve on that- 'wipe dry' is not adequate- it should stand up to being hand washed, so they need to re-engineer it so you can more easily take it apart for air drying.",

My problem is with how this gets juice from the apple and water when rinsing it to clean it into the inner cavity. It cannot be taken apart and cleaned. This shows water still inside after sitting to dry for two days. And discoloration from the apple juice. The only thing you can do is put some water in through holes on bottom and shake around hoping it gets all of the apple juices out and doesn\u2019t stain it too much. I assume this will eventually start to grow mildew due to this design flaw.",

The apple doesn't have to be perfectly round. but big divets or irregular shapes make blade dig in and stop. I'd imagine a way more expensive all metal will cut through those for you heavy users.But for the money, this is great for the average user",

Leave a message and a contact number at their toll-free number in Quebec, 1-800-361-6232 (press 2 for English). They'll call you back and take an order over the phone.

This one is cheaper than both and is perfect. It gets the apple top to bottom and is so nicely done it only removes the very fine layer of skin, not taking too much apple with it.
