Does not connect to my Wi-Fi router. My router does not recognize it, therefore I can not use this Seagate as a home network cloud like I intended. All my other Seagate HDs connect to my router just fine?! Not really the hard drive's fault, but it is really unfortunate. I will always be a fan of Seagate. Just wish my router could recognize it.",

Although it is quite a bit faster than the 1TB Toshiba I have (which has a single drive,) I worry that in the long run it will not be as durable. When either drive in a 2-disk RAID fails, you lose all the data. If your data doesn't exist in at least 2 seperate locations, as they say, it doesn't exist. Always back up important stuff in at least 2 different locations (family pictures, tax records, etc.)",

I'm a mac user, so I reformatted it to MAC OS Journaled and my macs read/write has been great. So far, so good!",

Both of these units have similar transfer speeds on large files but it would seem this portable device has trouble with accessing small and random files quickly. Good for fast backups but that's about it. Might have to bight the bullet and look for an external SSD solution.",

The RAID 0 config gives others cause for concern but I feel no need to worry about it. Besides it improves data transfer speeds. The cable is about 0.3 meters in length which works perfectly for me. As mentioned in the description no power adapter is needed for it - a huge advantage in my city where power outages are frequent and unpredictable. Overall one of the best purchases I ever made!",
