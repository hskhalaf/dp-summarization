They will fail after about 2-3 years and leak profusely. This is just a fact of life with o-rings. However, I contacted the manufacturer and they do not offer replacement o-rings. They did, however, offer their condolences and said that if I had only paid for a filter subscription, they could have sent me new canisters with new o-rings. The o-rings and canisters cannot be purchased separately. Other manufacturers sell o-rings for approximately $5 to $8 per set. If I were you, I would purchase another brand.",

Installation is easy (if you haven't worked with PEX before, make sure to cut the ends of the tubing square and remove any burrs) and takes only a few minutes. However, it leaks. Not from the tubes or any fitting or the filters, the faucet itself drips. This is unacceptable for a new faucet. If the leak was due to my mistake (improper installation, not fully seating the tubing, etc.) this would probably have gotten 5 stars. With the leak due to poor quality on the manufacturer's part, and the fact that the drip costs money in wasted water and the environmental cost of wasted water, it gets 1 star.",

      "text": "I bought the Aquasana primarily because it removes chloramines (chlorine and ammonia), which most water purifiers don't. Some purifiers remove chlorine, but not chloramines. Most larger cities use chloramines instead of free chlorine as a disinfectant to reduce the formation of carcinogenic disinfectant byproducts (DBPs). The Aquasana also does a good job of removing over 60 other contaminants, The Aquasana is also economical to use as it treats up to 600 gallons of water before the filters need replacing, which are comparatively inexpensive at $65. One minor negative is that the flow is somewhat low, so it might take 10 seconds to fill a glass of water instead of 3 seconds straight out of the tap.",

I am a pretty handy female but have limited plumbing experience. With a few basic tools, I had this installed in about an hour. Some reviews indicated that the unit would eventually leak, but what plumbing device doesn't eventually leak. It's the nature of water.

The half a gallon per minute is sufficient but if I were to do it again I may look at purchasing the larger unit with higher flow rate. It would save some time when filling up the tea kettle.

And unlike reverse osmosis units, this one doesn't waste water or strip healthy minerals from it (and our city water is already pretty good, this is just a little extra protection).",

I saw some for $10 and they're better than the tiny glass bottles and keep the taste better than any open pitcher could.
