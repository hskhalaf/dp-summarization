I could not get the TP system synchronized with the D-Link (although the TP system synchronized without any drama and works wonderfully). I also looked for a single D-link powerline adapter thinking maybe it was a manufacturer thing. No luck. I sent it back and got a refund.",

I really like the PowerLine AV feature, as this allows the wireless to run at full speed, instead of having to share the wireless for both connected devices and connection to my network. UPDATE: after using the DHP-1320 for a few months, it now needs to be reset (power cycled) frequently to connect to my PowerLine network. It will run anywhere from 1 hour to one week before a reset is required.",

    "description": "The D-Link Wireless N PowerLine Router (DHP-1320) works seamlessly with D-Link's PowerLine AV adapters\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe D-Link Wireless N PowerLine Router (DHP-1320) provides network connections to anywhere in your house using the electrical wiring already installed. Simply connect your router and plug it into a power outlet to turn every other power outlet2 in your home into a network connection. The powerline feature provides up to 200 Mbps3 over your electrical wiring, and you can also use the Wireless N connectivity up to 300 Mbps1--fast enough to stream HD video, support enhanced gaming and share large files across your home.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n * Wireless N connectivity for superior wireless performance, clarity, and coverage  \n   \n   \n * Single-band Wireless N connectivity  \n   \n   \n * Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) for secure, simple 1-button setup  \n   \n   \n * Capable of streaming audio and video to compatible UPnP-enabled devices  \n   \n   \n * Uses your home's existing electrical wiring by plugging into power outlets \n * PowerLine Sync Connection (ENY) button \n * Power saving mode \n\n * Intelligent QoS technology prioritizes both wired and wireless Internet traffic to enable enhanced gaming and phone calling (VoIP) experience  \n   \n   \n * Active Firewall protection  \n   \n   \n * 3 High Speed Ethernet ports for fast wired connectivity  \n   \n   \n * Supports secure wireless encryption using WPA or WPA2 \n * Supports 128-bit AES encryption for PowerLine Network Security \n * Plug & Play installation \n * 24/7 basic installation support \n * 1-year limited warranty \n\nWE CALL IT POWERLINE. YOU'LL CALL IT AMAZING.\nD-Link understands that people like options. With a DHP-1320 PowerLine router in your home or small office, you get exactly that. Not only will you get the wireless freedom to stream HD video like Netflix, but you can also transfer files, play games, or use VOIP applications from anywhere in your house. If you prefer to have a wired solution, this is where the Powerline comes into play by producing the blazing fast connectivity, reliability and security you've come to expect from a conventional wired network. \n\nPowerLine technology uses the existing wiring of a building's electrical system to transmit data between connected devices, and transforms any conventional power outlet into a fully-functioning Ethernet port. With PowerLine, your entire home or office is transformed into a high-speed network, delivering Internet connectivity, exactly where you need it. No messy wiring, tools, or assembly required. So, no matter where you live, you have amazing options that will ensure your network is running at its best in every corner of your home! \n\nWHEN WE SAY BLAZING FAST, WE MEAN IT. \nBoasting transfer rates up to 200Mbps and D-Link's patented Traffic Optimization Technology to prioritize high bandwidth traffic like 1080p HD video, PowerLine lets multiple users browse, download, or use VOIP applications like Skype and simultaneously deliver high quality digital entertainment anywhere in the network, without annoying skips or lags. \n\nWIRELESS FREEDOM. WIRED RELIABILITY. \nPowerLine transmits data along the wiring of a building's existing electrical system, providing a secure network connection to places impossible to reach with a wireless signal. Data and electricity transmit at very different frequencies, so there's never a problem of electrical interference or shorting in a PowerLine Network. Connect your Blu-Ray player, HDTV, gaming console, PC, media-players, security cameras, network storage drives and even your existing wireless network, all at once--PowerLine gets the most out of your broadband connection.\n\nPLUG AND PLAY... AND STREAM, DOWNLOAD, OR SKYPE. INSTANTLY. \nPowerLine Networks work with any wired or wireless device. All you need is an Internet connection, and you're ready to go. Connect the first PowerLine AV device to a router (or modem, if you're using a PowerLine router) and an outlet, then plug each additional AV device anywhere you require internet connectivity. D-Link's 'Simple Connect' button will establish a security encrypted connection and that's it--your home or office is a high performance network, instantly. \n\n128-BIT SECURITY ENCRYPTION\nPowerLine protects your network with 128-bit security encryption--the same technology used in ecommerce or online banking. Create your own network name and password or put it at the tip of your fingers with 'Push Button Security' standard on every PowerLine device. \n\nIPV6 READY: GET READY FOR THE FUTURE\nWith the growing number of Internet-enabled applications requiring IP addresses, the supply of IP addresses under the current Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) system has already been exhausted. The IPv6 protocol solves this network addressing exhaustion by creating more IP addresses, but migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is not necessarily automatic.\n\nBut, you don't need to worry about service interruption if you go with D-Link products that are IPv6 Certified. Your network will be automatically IPv4 and IPv6 ready when you use an IPv6-certified D-Link product like his one. With D-Link products, you can rest assured that you'll be covered for the current and the new standards without any hassle to you.\n\nCOMPLETE HOME NETWORK SOLUTION WITH POWERLINE PRODUCTS\nWith D-Link PowerLine combination routers, adapters, switches and extenders, you can build bandwidth solutions to fit your needs. \n\n * Combination router (example DHP-1320): Great for providing wired and wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. \n * Adapter (example: DHP-306AV): Ideal for connecting a single device like a laptop into your PowerLine network. \n * Switches (example: DHP-346AV): Perfect for connecting an entertainment system into your PowerLine network. \n * Extenders (example: DHP-W306AV): Plug this into your PowerLine network to provide wireless connectivity into areas that can't be reached with your wireless router, such as your basement or attic. \n\nD-LINK GREEN\nPowerLine Network devices automatically power down when not in use or connected, and the LEDs have a manual 'disable' switch to conserve energy. D-Link Green devices provides alternative without compromising performance. They are designed to help conserve energy, protect our environment from harmful substances and reduce waste by using recyclable packaging. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nD-Link DHP-1320 PowerLine Wireless N router, power adapter, two detachable antennas, Ethernet cable, CD-ROM with setup wizard\n\n1 Maximum wireless signal rate derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors, including volume of network traffic, building materials and construction, and network overhead, lower actual data throughput rate. Environmental factors will adversely affect wireless signal range. Wireless range and speed rates are D-Link RELATIVE performance measurements based on the wireless range and speed rates of a standard Wireless G product from D-Link. Maximum throughput based on D-Link's 802.11n devices.\n\n2 Power outlets and electrical wiring must all be part of the same electrical system. Certain electrical conditions in your home, such as wiring conditions and configuration may effect the performance of this product. A minimum of two D-Link PowerLine AV Network Adapters are required to create a network. Connecting this product to a power strip with a surge protector may adversely affect the performance of this product. For best results, plug adapter directly into a power outlet.\n\n3 Maximum throughput based on theoretical transmission PHY rate. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors, including volume of traffic and network overhead, may lower actual data throughput rate. Interference from devices that emit electrical noise, such as vacuum cleaners and hair dryers, may adversely affect the performance of this product. This product may interfere with devices such as lighting systems that have a dimmer switch, short wave radios, or other powerline devices that do not follow the HomePlug PowerLine Alliance standard. \n\n\n\nSee more",
