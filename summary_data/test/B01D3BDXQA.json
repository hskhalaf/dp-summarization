The other problem was that the monitor wouldn\u2019t accept a 1080 setting.

The glossy white curved design is very attractive. However, the monitor itself takes a bit of getting used to. No ability to adjust the height, and reaching behind the monitor to change the input is not very convenient. Overall, it is a nice monitor at good price.",
