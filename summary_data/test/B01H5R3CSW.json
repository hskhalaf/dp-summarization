I liked the idea so much that I bought two of them. I did purchase an extra shelf for each of these being that it only has two shelves. So I could get extra storage for my printer paper and shipping labels. I also purchased wire baskets to hold small items that I use all the time. I also purchased some storage bins to store odds and ends. Plus I went and purchased caster wheels from the hardware store so I could roll both around with ease.",

      "text": "I bought this to replace another kitchen storage solution that had completely fallen apart after a couple of years. I was slightly concerned that this item would have the same fate, and look cheap, as it cost less than half of what I paid for the item it was to replace. Couldn't be more relieved and satisfied with this! It's super sturdy (and I think will stay that way), looks great, and was easy to put together. It's able to hold all of our pots and pans on the shelves, and the hanging rack holds a six-piece cooking utensil set, plus 4 measuring cups (had to buy some more hooks from Lowes), with some room to spare. TLDR: Love it!",

Instead, this is composite wood, and with no other details provided, it is not even clear to me that it is food-safe (manufactured with food-safe resins), despite what the products reference as a \"cutting surface\" would imply. As I intended to use it for just that, this is quite disappointing. I suspect that the first time a knife touches the thin, soft surface it will scratch, though I am hesitant to verify that until I have decided whether it is worth the hassle to return this misleading product.",

      "text": "Really like this mini bakers rack. It fits perfectly in my kitchen, i use it for the microwave and we put our fresh fruit on the top rack. The butcher block shelf is just about abot the same height as my counters which creates a nice flow in my kitchen. I only wish it was a tad bit sturdier when we open and close the microwave it moves slightly.",

I had no idea what I was going to do with everything, and I am so glad I ordered this! It holds a ton of stuff! It was relatively easy to put together, the instructions are useless. Luckily it is self explanatory....except for the black plastic things that go over the metal legs to hold the shelves up, those can be put on the wrong way so be sure to pay attention to that! This was a really good purchase!",
