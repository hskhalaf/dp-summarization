      "text": "Two weeks after using this mattress, it sprang a leak. I wanted it for out-of-town holiday company, and it was so embarrassing when my guest ended up laying on the floor, sunk into a flabby piece of vinyl, hardly being able to get up. I was very careful not to overfill it, I made sure there were no sharp objects anywhere near it, and my guest only weighed 150 lbs which is considerably less than the 700 lb weight limit. I would not purchase another one of them in the future.",
