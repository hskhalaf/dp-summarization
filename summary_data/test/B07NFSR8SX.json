      "text": "I had never had a kayak before, and had bought a Perception Sound 10.5 and a Perception Pescador 10. The Sound was very comfortable, and stable. The only downside is that the paddle holder, that used to be included, and is shown in some of the pictures, is no longer a standard feature for this kayak. I had to buy a clip, add a bungee, to create this feature. Not sure why they would discontinue a great feature, since this is marketed as a recreational/fishing kayak. If you are going to fish, you need to secure the paddle somewhere.",

      "text": "Purchased to replace a Field and Stream 12' from Dicks that wore a hole through the thin flooring. First time out my husband caught 18 fish - he was very happy. We hoped the groves on the bottom would help keep the tracking straight but it still moved more than his old 12' kayak but it handled well overall. He liked being able to turn easier. This is no frills so be ready to trick out with your own, better formed, rod holders. The milk crate groove in the back is very handy.",
