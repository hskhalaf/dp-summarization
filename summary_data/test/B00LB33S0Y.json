Unfortunately it has torn and no longer stops the ball when it hits the net. This results in a VERY frustrated basketball player. We went for the more expensive version hoping that meant better quality, but probably should have gone with the less expensive brand. Hoping to receive a replacement under warranty. Update: We received a replacement net very easily and my husband finally installed it. Great customer service.",

Although it is designed for a 5 or 6 inch pole, we had no problems at all adding this to our 4 inch pole. It is stable and does what it claims...keeps the ball on the court and not on my landscape! Great purchase and it is being used..A LOT. Update: We have never taken the guard down. It was been through all of the many changes in NE PA weather. It honestly looks and functions like it's brand new! We still love it.",

    "title": "Goalrilla Basketball Yard Guard Easy Fold Defensive Net System Quickly Installs on Any Goalrilla Basketball Hoop",
    "description": "The Goalrilla Yard Guard is a defensive net system that installs on your Goalrilla Goal and keeps ball from bouncing out of the court. The Yard Guard protects your lawn and landscaping, allows players to have more efficient practice, and acts as a safety feature. This innovative accessory is built to last and will change the way you play basketball. The Goalrilla Yard Guard adds safety to your basketball system by keeping balls in the court, so players don't have to chase after them into the street. Usually after a missed shot, a player must chase after the ball, wasting valuable practice time. With the Yard Guard, missed shots stay in the court, allowing the player to quickly retrieve the ball and try again for maximum repetition. The Yard Guard keeps stray balls out of the landscaping. Spanning over 12 feet wide and up to 9 feet tall, the Yard Guard is a significant barrier between your court and your yard. After using your Yard Guard, the net and poles easily fold into a discreet storage position; simply gather the net and poles along the main pole of your Goalrilla system and clip them into place. Then when you are ready to play again, unclip the net and the Yard Guard collapses into place in seconds. The Yard Guard easily installs in minutes by attaching to the main pole of your goal. Included brackets allow the Yard Guard to fit all Goalrilla units with a 5\"x 5\", 5. 5\"x5. 5\", 6\"x6\" or 6\"x8\" pole. Already have a Universal Pole Pad on your goal? The Yard Guard also includes an adapter that allows you to keep your pole pad and use the Yard Guard at the same time. Goalrilla is known for outstanding performance and quality and the Yard Guard is no exception. With steel poles and a nylon net, the Yard Guard will stand up to years of play and will look great! The Yard Guard comes with a 90-Day Limited . Once the Yard Guard has been installed, you are still able to adjust the height of your Goalrilla goal as usual. Whether you're playing at 7. 5\" or 10\", the Goalrilla Yard Guard offers the same benefits. Installed Dimensions Width: 153\" (12. 75 ft) Height: 9' (at Highest point) to 7' (at Lowest Point)",
