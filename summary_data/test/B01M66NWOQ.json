At night this camera stands out in the darkness, actually alerting the potential intruder of its location and field of view. This blatant and intentional flaw makes my house actually less secure because potential intrude is made aware of camera's location and is able to bypass it. I called Nest and requested to return the camera for a refund, since the camera is now useless as a security device, and my request was denied. Google cares more about someone else's \"privacy\" than about the security of its paying customers. Will never purchase Nest or Google again.",

Will subscribe to Nest Aware when 1 month trial is over as will be adding Nest indoor camera. Only negative I found is power cord is unwieldy and can\u2019t really disconnect it to run wire for setup. Overall great camera with better night vision than my POE Vivotek cameras",

The corners are pretty beat up and some of the product plastic was torn (from shipping). I\u2019m glad my building has a secure package room where the item was waiting for me, but not having the outer box just invites package thieves to walk off with some pretty expensive equipment. I will try to install the product and follow up this review after installation. Just disappointed in the shipping.",

Unfortunately, they constantly go off line. My router is very close to the cameras so signal isn\u2019t a problem. I went into the app and made sure the cameras are constantly on, the problem still occurs. I am buying a new house and will instal Ring cameras. I do not recommend these cameras.",

Costs around $5/month for cloud storage of 5 days of video, but a small price to pay for peace of mind. You won't regret buying one of these.
