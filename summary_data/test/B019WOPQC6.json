      "text": "Just love these, first few times putting them on was a bit challenging because they are tight but after a week they fit and feel great. I wear them at night instead of the big bulky boots for plantar relief. I can walk normally in the morning when i wear them at night, and during times that require standing for several hours they provide good support and seem to prevent pain. Glad i purchased, would definitely recommend buying these. If you have flexible spending, they are considered a eligible expense so this really made my purchase even better.",

Buy one of those 2-3 inch rubber balls that you can roll your foot over. Use a frozen bottle of water for the pain - roll it back & forth under the arch of your foot for pain relief. Custom orthotic heel supports might help long term.",

I responded and mentioned the sock tearing...they were kind enough to promptly mail another pair to me and I couldn't be more satisfied with the sock and their service.

I am so pleased with the relief the Physixs gear compression socks have given me. I am back to walking again! I have also ordered them for a family member who is struggling with foot pain and I have recommended them to others.",

Since I liked the product (and some other manufacturer's compression sleeves on Amazon are about as \"compressive\" as a tube sock), I ordered from Physix again but this time in \"Black L/XL\". Same size, different color -- but the compression is awful. There is MUCH less compression in the brand new Black pair even compared to my several-months-old and worn-out Beige pair. I'm disappointed that this second pair are basically useless to me, as they offer very little compression and do little to help with my foot pain symptoms.",

I worked as a cashier and was on my feet 9 hours a day and my left foot was causing me pain. I had developed plantar fasciitis and wear a night splint. I have tried many different insoles and none worked. Tried foot compression socks and arches, which worked better than insoles. Your foot sleeves are the best and I have thrown out all my previous brands. I wish I had discovered your sleeves last year. Thanks for a product that really works!",
