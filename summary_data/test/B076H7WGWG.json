That means it is not of the quality that their two thousand dollar made in USA boxes are. That being said it is a great tool box for my machinist tools. I don't ask it to be carried around and hauled in my truck, but for stationary service in my tiny hobbyist machine shop it serves well and looks good.",

There was no damage just a loose corner joint and the support between the drawers was loose too. Instead of returning it a little glue and a couple clamps fixed it up perfectly. Normally I would have returned the item but if too many people complain and return items such as this they will disappear from the market. I applaud Gerstner for offering a decent chest at a price point where hobbiests can buy. Would definitely buy another Gerstner International product.",

But it does show they are not the same as they were. Would I buy one again, yes as it is the best in on the market unless you want to go into the $1000.00 range",
