Idle up takes it off the gyro. Keep the toggle clicked full forward to have gyro assist. It does what you want it to do. I have two, and have yet to crash one.",

If you have a fair/small bit of coax experience, you can do this, just go slow to get your head-right and wait for good weather days with no or slight wind. Work on a smooth surface and ease the machine light on the skids and get eye, hand coordination good. Stick with doing that and you may be a dozen battery charge cycles in before you are in the air a bit, but if you have patience, you can learn without a crash. Really is a great unit.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re an old Heli pilot that\u2019s built their own helis and know how to actually fly a heli, this is fun, easy and stable. My very first heli was a BladeCP. I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. Several years later and many hours of sims and flying 450s 500 batter and 50 size nitro, things were much different. I bought this Heli on a whim to see if I would \u201cget back into it\u201d its fun to fly and surprisingly durable(I had a hard, throttle cut landing on pavement when flying it at night with minimal lighting, goofing off). To my surprise nothing was damaged!",

Overall it came in great condition, it flew great for the first two flights or so (swash was very level out of the box, etc) then the tail motor randomly failed mid-air and caused a horrible crash. The tail motor had/has completely failed in the span of the day after I received it. I am an experienced pilot and have a Goblin 570, Blade Fusion 360, Blade Nano S2 and none of these have ever had these issues. This is my first \"bigger\" motor driven tail though, so I'm guessing it's just a fluke. We'll see when the new one arrives.",

One thing that can get annoying is that every time you fly it and want to charge the battery. You have to take the canopy off to charge the battery or replace it with a charged one. Lastly this heli falls more in the 150$-200$ range. Reason is priced in the range that is, due to HH parts availability in local hobby stores. Note:This RC Helicopter falls under the FAA Recreational Flyers & Modeler ,before flying register with the FAA and download the app B4UFLY. (Google rc faa)",
