After watching some confidence-building YouTube videos, we went back and what do you know? we were less pathetic. By the fourth time out though, we were actually pretty good. We have yet to catch them on the return, but we're really getting close. This is a fun boomerang, watch the videos, practice, and be patient. The boomerang is well built and its easy to see if you're holding it right or not. Most of the effectiveness, and the fun you have will rely on polishing your technique.",

The black paint comes off easily, and I've never really abused it - the plastic seems to have a fairly low surface energy, almost like polyethylene so it isn't surprising the paint is having a hard time sticking to it, I've only ever hit grassy fields with it. I am surprised people report breaking theirs, the plastic seems too soft to be excessively brittle - so soft it doesn't really hold a dihedral set for long on a warm day which isn't great.",
