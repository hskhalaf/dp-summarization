I like the matte finish and the green colored ball is even more bright than the yellow Srixon to me. I think they have comparable bite with approach shots to the green and I don't seem to lose distance of the tee with these. I think these are going to be my go to ball for a while.",

I can\u2019t speak for the other colors. The red ball has no shine and a real sticky feel. The white ball does not.
