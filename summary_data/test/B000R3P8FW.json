My cellphone (Nokia N73) take better pictures using zoom than the ones taken with my Camera!!! I couldn't believe it!!! In general the cam is great, it is totally user friendly and easy to set... but if zoom is something that matter to you consider buying something else!!!",

I did not even get the charger out of the wrapper. I just got off the phone with Casio, they did not help at all. Yes, I am looking to get it replaced so now I will try to see what Amazon can do for me.",

I sent it to Casio repair and they said it had suffered water corrosion and the damage was NOT covered by warranty. I did not get it wet, take it out in the rain, or treat it badly...yet it broke down in almost no time...and I am out $300 bucks. So, I MUST warn anyone considering buying it: WHY TAKE THE CHANCE WITH A CAMERA SO OBVIOUSLY FRAGILE?? DON'T DO IT!! Needless to say, I'll NEVER buy a Casio camera again.",
