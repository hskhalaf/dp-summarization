      "text": "I was leery initially about purchasing a curved display, but I'm very happy with my 43\" Samsung. It has a beautiful and sharp picture. Thank God glossy displays have fallen out of fashion! I considered the 49\" version in this line, but decided the extra 6\" was a bit too wide, but also that the 49\" only has 1080 vertical resolution, whereas this 43\" monitor has 1200. The only thing that might make this monitor \"perfect\" is if it had about 4\" more height and 1600 vertical resolution, but I'm being greedy :) This is my 7th Samsung monitor ( I have a small business ) and all still operate even years after warranty. No dead pixels.",
