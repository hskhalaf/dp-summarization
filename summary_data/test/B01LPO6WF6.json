Just reminding people that there is no dialogue in this game, but if you are a Harry Potter fan you will definitely know what's going on. If you know the story then you will not have trouble at all figuring out what's going on it's quite fun to just run around in the Harry Potter World. I highly recommend this game to any Harry Potter fan.",

You can play all the characters and do fun missions that follow the movies. You can fly on a broom and make potions and cast fun spells.

All that you need to do is restart the console and any glitches fix right up.
