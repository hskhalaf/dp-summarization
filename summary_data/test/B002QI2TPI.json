The two tones are AWESOME for doing fading brows, and the product goes one smoothly and cleanly. One thing I've noticed is that the wax gives your eyebrows a shiny finish. I'm going to start powdering mine with translucent power to make them look more normal. When I run out, I might switch to something different but I'd consider buying again.",

I find in my case, applying the wax first, helps the color cover those stubborn white hairs and also spreads more evenly. I have very dark eyebrows naturally, and I ordered the lighter shade so my eyebrows don't look harsh.",

Sometimes my red is darker at the beginning when i just dyed it so the darker shade can be mixed with the lighter one to match perfectly. I get brow compliments all the time now. The only thing that isn't great is the brush, i use a eco tools flat liner brush and a small brow brush from some old milani kit and an elf spoolie brush. The one that comes with it is too stiff and thick to really do anything.",

The wax makes me break out in my eyebrows, which can be annoying and painful. I suggest using the wax sparingly and washing it off thoroughly. The color stays on pretty well through the day as long as you don't rub it off.",

I was wrong, they blend really easy with your eyebrows, but they make them visible and defined. The brush makes it really easy to apply the powder to your eyebrows, and the mascara-type brush allows the color to evenly spread across your eyebrow without making it look messy and fake. The wax also helps your eyebrows look evenly trimmed and thin. I would strongly recommend this to anyone with dirty blonde eyebrows or blonde-brown eyebrows, as long as your hair color isn't bleached blonde or too light, this will work for you.",
