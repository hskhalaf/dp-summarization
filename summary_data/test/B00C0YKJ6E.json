When near full you can conveniently apply an air hose and pump the oil out. For me, I pump into a large tank on a skid where I store oil for burning in a waste oil heater to heat my shop.",

I am currently looking at the ARSKEN radiator tester as well.",

Manufacturer welded a nut on both sides of the tube allowing a knob to thread in and lock against the sliding tube. Problem is that the welds were poorly done and prevent the threaded knob to go deep enough to make contact with the tube... impossible to use as intended. I had to use a clamp for my first use... very disappointing and totally out of character with the rest of the product. If it weren't for this issue, I would love the product and would have given 5 stars.",
