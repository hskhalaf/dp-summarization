Charging an extra $20 for the extensions is poor customer service. This thing is short, and not made to reach the same height as an adult bed. My bed is not tall at all, and I had to use the whole extension kit to get it lined up.",

There's all this netting on it and there's nothing precious or baby-like about it. BUT - we absolutely love it now. All the compartments are SO convenient. We store the extra sheets below and are able to load up the side pockets with receiving blankets. The fitted sheet is sometimes a bit of a pain to put on but it's not a deal breaker. It was a little complicated to put together but we haven't had any issues with durability. Our cat has never jumped inside. :)",

Only slight complaint would be the maneuvering of the side that comes down, I always had difficulty getting it back up. Also makes a great bed when baby needs to sleep elsewhere (another room, grandparents house, hotel, etc)",
