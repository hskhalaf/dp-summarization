I was a bit disappointed that it doesn't want to update Kitkat to Marshmallow (its says that it is fully up to date), but Kitkat, despite now being old software, actually does everything you could wish, and its not a big problem. I would have liked to update it if it had let me, however. This is a magic tablet, and I got it particularly to use around the hot-tub, without having to use protective sleeves, etc, so it is just what I wanted. **UPDATE - 5th January 2019** So good, I've bought a second one!!",

Zero battery drain overnight. In fact the Lenovo consumes more battery life standing unused than this Sony does when I'm using it! OK, I'm only a 'light' user, checking emails, a reasonable bit of web browsing and playing scrabble, but no outrageous gaming! It took a while to update itself to Android 6 Marshmallow, going through all the intermediate stages one at a time from KitKat, but it was well worth the wait. I really can't fault it - an excellent buy!",

      "text": "I chose this tablet mostly based on the sound quality reviews from multiple sources. Not interested in the internal speakers. The sound quality from the headphone jack is quite poor.Just did not realise the output from the headphone jack would be so low. It's too low for my needs. Not good at all for plugging into a sound system really. You have to turn the volume up too high on the sound system to compensate. My old Samsung S3 mini telephone has better sound quality. Waste of money for me. Let down.",

My device was in a case when dropped and still shattered. I recommend you choose a device with a sturdy screen and look at the cases available for the device before you buy.",
