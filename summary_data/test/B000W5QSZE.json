She was uncontrollably itchy and had hot spots everywhere. Literally tried every food the vets recommended. Finally I came across Taste of the Wild and even though its expensive, its by far the best food my shepherd has ever eaten. She is 80% better and only gets itchy once in a while. Also the fact that I can switch between flavors is amazing. She gets excited every time we have a new flavor. I would highly recommend this food to anyone that has a dog with allergies.",

It is not an extravagance to feed higher quality dog food when they consume less to get the required nutrients. It's interesting that we can usually order the big bag delivered to our door cheaper than buying locally and paying tax on it...so we do.

Cons- It\u2019s not GMO Free or organic but I understand that if it were, it would cost a great deal more.",

Although still very food motivated even after a year of having him, the higher protein diet seems to satisfy him and settle him down more after eating. And his cow ear chews also help too!

And if that's not enough, a quality grain-free food is more absorbed by the dog's body, leaving a lot less at the back end, if you get my drift. There are a lot of higher-priced foods with this quality, this is one of the more readily available and comparatively reasonably priced.",
