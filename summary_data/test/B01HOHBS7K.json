I was surprised when I tried this and it worked. I originally only tried the water gel and wasn't satisfied. But after I bought all 4 products - toner, serum, eye cream and water gel - and use them all together, my skin is in great shape. Very hydrated and soft. I'm extremely pleased, but I wanted to advise others to use as a set instead of just individual products and you'll have better results.",

I am sensitive to fragrance, so that is part of the problem, but no facial product should have that strong a perfume (especially a clinging, artificial one).

My dermatologist recommends applying in this order: wash your face, toner, serums, medicated creams, hyaluronic acid, moisturizer and finally sunscreen. Make sure to let each product absorb into your skin before applying another. Your skin can only absorb so much at a time, so do not rush the application or you will not see results you want. For nightime routine, skip the sunscreen but still follow the steps in order.",

It is a pleasant smell but I do wish Neutrogena would use less irritating perfumes in their skincare lines.",
