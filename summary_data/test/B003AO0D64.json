Materials and construction are pretty decent and impressive considering it is a piece of furniture that is under $100. Seat cushion itself is a little firm (I can say the same about many comparable chairs that are 10x the cost), but nonetheless the chair feels comfortable to sit in because of the design and how the back and arms wrap around. Chairs come with legs detached, very easy assembly and very stable when finished. All around a great buy!",
