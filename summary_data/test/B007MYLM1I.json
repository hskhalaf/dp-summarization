The thickness makes me feel well protected! :) I wear it mostly on days I'll be out in the sun a lot because my regular moisturizer is only a 15, not 50 like this one. I have sensitive eyes, and sometimes this can irritate them a little but it usually stops pretty fast. I've never got burnt in the sun while wearing this so I think it does a good job at protecting the skin from the sun. I definitely recommend this moisturizer!!",
