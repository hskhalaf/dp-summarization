If you want to have some Smash action but don't own a Nintendo device, or you want to play Smash with your favorite Sony characters; especially if you don't want to spend a whole lot on it, this game is fine for you. For someone who's expecting the same experience as Smash, you're not going to get it. For the 5$ I paid, I'm not upset. I would probably be upset if I spent more than 10$, however.",

A lot of interesting characters from various franchises, and they carry the \"special moves\" from the original games. Interesting power ups and environmental hazards that spice up the game. Control scheme is actually well thought out, not the arcade remapping. Small downside: expensive to purchase DLC for additional characters; online mode is somewhat slow. Overall, highly recommend for Vita. Overall,",

It can get a litttle repetitive if you play it for long lengths of time, but it is fun for a quick few matches here and there. My only complaint is that playing single player mode has a HUGE curve between the difficulties. Going up a difficulty goes from the game being too easy to having difficulty winning matches (or even having much fun)",
