A lot of the bad reviews were mostly due to the item appearing to be used, but I got mine today and it looks pretty new. Plugged a battery on it and it works, so far. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of the packaging. Even though the bag has a label with the product, it was in a brown box, I expected it to be in its original box just like an impact wrench I purchased earlier this year. Will update on durability after some use",

He was screwing boards down about 4x faster than me and I couldn't figure out why, until I used it. I immediately bought one to add to my Milwaukee tool bag and I've been using it non-stop since then. It makes quick work of any screws. It's fairly light in your hand and of course the Milwaukee batteries last forever. If you are thinking about getting a new hex driver, get this one.",

    "title": "Milwaukee 2656-20 M18 18V 1/4 Inch Lithium Ion Hex Impact Driver with 1,500 Inch Pounds of Torque and LED Lighting Array (Battery Not Included, Power Tool Only)",
    "description": "For driving heavy fasteners like lag bolts or thick screws, you need a powerful impact driver. Milwaukee provides the power you need with a simple, compact design that will consistently outperform the competition. The 2656-20 impact driver has the necessary features that make a successful power tool. A powerful motor, controlled by a variable speed trigger, creates up to 3,450 impacts per minute, more than enough for a wide variety of jobsite tasks. The LED lighting and textured handle help you work in slippery and dark conditions without a problem, giving you precise control over an evenly-lit work surface. The electronic components in the power tool communicate with the M18 batteries that power it, reducing the risk of overheating or otherwise burning itself out from overuse. Combine that with its compact size and ambidextrous belt clip, and you\u2019re looking at a tool that you can bring to most jobsites and find some utility from.
