I ordered a strap and had to cancel it because there is no place to hook the strap on this guitar.",

I bought the Yamaha CGS102A half-size guitar 4 months ago and regard it as one of the best musical purchases I've ever made. It is comfortable to hold, has a lovely sound, and stays in tune well. I wasn\u2019t sure how committed I would be about learning to play guitar, but my experience with this instrument has redoubled my enthusiasm. Thank you, Yamaha, for offering such a pleasing and affordable guitar!",

It probably doesn't have the volume to project for a performance, but for personal play, there isn't a big difference in the sound from a full sized. The feel, is much better. I never really cared for full sized guitars, from the way it made my body torque, to the tension in my left hand. This is just *so* much more comfortable to play. I'm done with full-sized guitars - if I ever want to get another guitar, I'd go for a higher quality 1/2 or 3/4 size, but this is good enough.",

I wish it had an end pin, and it would be nice if there was a strap button option, but we can deal with that. We have now purchased 3 of these for different grandchildren. All have been great.",

She had a \"toy\" model guitar and I offered to trade this one. Tough call, and she tried negotiating to keep them BOTH. Is this a budding guitarist or what!? The frets are flat and tuning true. Sounds like a real guitar, just smaller.",

The reason it's a low rating is because the strings are frayed and basically ruined and I've only had it a few weeks.. strings are an important part of a guitar an for the strings to c**p out after so little use is very disappointing...",
