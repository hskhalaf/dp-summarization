I didn't realize how big these tires where gonna be. They make my quad look great. I wanted a good mud tire without going over the top and these are just what I needed. Another thing to add is these tires also have a deep bead with rim guard so basically they stick about a 1/4 past the rim to protect it from scratches. Would recommend to anyone and would definitely buy again.",
