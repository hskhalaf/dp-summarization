Superficially, a gong is a one note instrument. Not so in practice: hitting at different distances from the center will activate or deactivate certain harmonics and a variety of chords (not in the usual chromatic scale) can be produced. Also, the quality of the sound depends on the way you hit. Interestingly, the gong is activated by nearby noises (for instance, a loud conversation). No wonder that composers like Olivier Messiaen were endlessly fascinated with the sound of gongs.",
