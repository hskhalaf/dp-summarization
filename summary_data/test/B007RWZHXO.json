Very easy to set up, unlike some Casio products that require long sequences of button pushing. It meets my needs: updates the time and date automatically via an atomic clock signal, is solar powered, is water resistant, and displays the important information at a glance. Glad I paid a little more for this model than some of the Casios that have thick operating manuals and lots of button pushing to adjust. Well worth the money, and Amazon did a great job with prompt delivery of the correct product on top condition.",

It is made in Thailand, Fit and finish of GW-M5610-1ER is excellent, almost like it is made in Japan. Cons: I received GW-M5610-1ER (European model). Because it is a European model it came with an international Warranty (not US warranty). Final thoughts: It is Tough Solar, Casio g-shock, and has atomic time keeping, whats not to like. It is made in Thailand. I highly recommend it!",

The GWM5610 -1Tough Solar is functional, No need to replace the batteries ,atomic and Great Looking!! I give the watch 5 stars. However the packaging was not. I give it 1 star. Amazon, what happened with the Great Decorative Tin Box shown by other customers? This watch deserves to be displayed and kept in it's full glory. Amazon owes me the Original G Shock Decorative Tin Box.",

I was really disappointed to get my new solar/atomic timekeeping G-shock only to find out that the alarm function now rings half as long (only 10 seconds) and at a SIGNIFICANTLY lower volume than previous watches. I use this function constantly and I think if is very unlikely to wake me under all conditions (background noise, furnace, air conditioning, wind, etc.). I don't know why Casio would take a tried-n-true product that's earned its reputation by being a real utilitarian performer, and then cheapen it, reduce its functionality and ruin its reputation.......but they did.

I should add that the watch band of my prior watch didn't last the full 10 years. The strap with the holes started breaking after some years due to bending it backward when latching or unlatching it.

Wish I had one of these for the last 36 yrs of my career. Bands a little short. Large wrist may have issue. Doesn't sit centered on my wrist. I wear loose due to the physical part of my work. Highly recommend this watch. Great service through Amazon. The flip of the wrist and the light comes on for a second, works great.",

If you have small wrists, want a thin profile watch that wont snag on things, looks good in work or dress, is totally shock or waterproof, works in freezing weather, takes a beating, solar capable and never needs a battery...then look no further. Living in the mountains, I would never pick anything different. The classic G Shock line in is the way to go!",
