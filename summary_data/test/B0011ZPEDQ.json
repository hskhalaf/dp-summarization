They are great for tossing salads or whatever else and having 3 different colors is lovely to keep things organized in my fridge. I normally like to use stainless or glass containers but they don't make large enough sizes with a sealed lid. Tupperware has been around forever for a reason. I know these will last me a very long time and I'm super happy I finally purchased. Funny how having the right equipment in the kitchen makes all the difference in my food prep. Just get them, you'll love them!",

These were very expensive and I feel I should be able to put the covers on the bowls - the way they work now - they are useless. What can I do about this? Peggy Lenyo lenyopeggy@yahoo.com",
