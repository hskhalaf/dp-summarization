      "text": "The headphones themselves are excellent - the battery life is extraordinarily good. I was aprehensive about Bluetooth headphones because I thought they\u2019d be a pain and always need charging. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by these! The only issue I\u2019ve had is that the ear pads sometimes fall off. They\u2019re pretty fiddly to get back on and obviously if you\u2019re on the move this gets very frustrating. Ear pads themselves are a good size and really are over ear. They\u2019re soft memory foam pads which don\u2019t deform over time. They feel very sturdy and durable. The folding mechanism isn\u2019t flimsy like some - beats particularly. Just don\u2019t get your skin trapped as you will cut yourself!",

Very pleased I did. Excellent sound quality & the snug fit cuts out all exterior noise, so they are great for travelling. Pretty strong too.",

So I hate them for ruining a great song but maybe I should just blame JT",

The touch controls to close calls, change volume are also really stupid - small target areas but easy to inadvertently hit them and drop a call. I wouldn't buy these again.",
