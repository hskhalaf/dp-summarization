So I was glad to see that this kit includes a remote transmitter as well as a receiver. The kit arrived very quickly. The new receiver's measurements and layout are identical to the old one's, so installation was not a problem. And I was glad to see that the fan and light are fully functional again. As it turns out, the old remote transmitter still works, so now we have two.",

Out of sight and works like a charm! Made replacement super simple. Done in 3 minutes.",

CFLs haven't reached 'dimmable' like incandescent bulbs. The remote probably does reduce the time that the A/C is applied to the bulb. But all I see is the CFL getting *brighter* as a go from 100% to 80%, then the bulb begins to dim slightly, then it's off. If you're getting this remote, prepare to use incandescent bulbs in your ceiling fan.",

It didn't fit in our fan until we adjusted the mounting bracket. It might have been more trouble than it's worth.",

One key feature not mentioned is that, unlike the cheaper controllers, this one remembers the setting when powered off. So you can use your wall light switch to turn the light on and off. With my previous controller, I had to use the remote to turn the light on if I used the light switch to turn the unit off. Apparently it doesn't dim the lights (or I just haven't figured out how yet).",
