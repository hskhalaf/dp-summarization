It's more than lukewarm, but once you've added cream, you're close. Also the carafe doesn't keep the heat in nearly as well as our former brand. I'm disappointed. If I could replace the old Bonavita glass carafe, I would.",

The coffee doesn't stay hot in the carafe because the plate does not keep the coffee hot. 2. It often drips onto the plate when you take out the carafe. 3. After it finishes its cycle water still remains in the well and you have to manually pour it out. 4. The flow from the carafe is very slow so you have to remove the cap in order to pour the coffee into a mug/cup. One final comment. I've also decided that I prefer a glass carafe so I'm switching back to the Moccamaster!",

      "text": "I was attracted to the features of this machine in that it replicated a pour-over coffee and brewed a gold standard cup. However, after cleaning and setting this up discovered that the water wasn't coming out hot enough and way below the described brewing temperature. When the coffee came out of the cone basket with paper filter, it was only 145 degrees. The brew temp should be between 195 and 205 degrees. Plus, as other commenters have mentioned, the water container doesn't empty completely which concerns me from a mold or bacteria perspective. The product's documentation manual states that retention of some water is normal. But why? Anyhow, I am returning this product, it's not worth the price.",

Breville took it back and fixed it and sent it back but the same thing kept happening. they have a YouTube video that shows using your vacuum regularly to clean the coffee pot. I'm not putting my dirty vacuum on my coffee pot, that is ridiculous. It should be easier to clean, have some sort of sensor that tells you it needs to be cleaned instead of just stopping. Really a pain in the rear! Amazon was kind enough to take it back outside of the return period. I will go back to my Cuisinart or try Capresso, Breville, never again.",
