Keeping in mind I only have two devices hooked up to the router, my laptop and my PS4 and somehow the PS4 is getting greater speeds, almost half of the original speeds I was getting initially without the router.",

Updating firmware did nothing, power cycling did nothing. It still starts a state of constant connection drops about once a week, and sometimes more often.",

Some overheat and crash, others (inexplicably) don't support UPnP, and then there's the DIR-655: every hour or two of moderate use, the network cuts out, and nothing but rebooting the router causes it to come back. It's not overheating - it doesn't even feel warm. The network just vanishes, interrupting the movie, game, file transfer, or whatever I'm doing at the time. And since it's using the latest firmware, the problem can't be solved with a simple firmware upgrade. Save yourself a headache - look elsewhere. This thing's less-than-impressive feature set isn't worth the stability problems.",

We use up to 5 devices at a time--including streaming Netflix and TMobil wireless phone service. It all works great! Not one problem so far. Would give it 5 stars, except that I would recommend dual-band, and will probably upgrade later.

My old router did not cover the entire house, this router covers it all and extends into the back and front yards as well. From a performance standpoint, I see improved throughput passing packets through to the internet compared to my older router. This is not wireless performance, since 802.11N is faster than 802.11G by design... but is rather an indication of the packet switching performance of the router itself. Highly recommended.",

The laptop works just fine even in the backyard about 80 feet from the router. No failures to connect and no dropped signals any longer. So far there has been no need to reset the router or contact customer support. The improvement was very noticeable even with the one-year old laptop that has a G-rated wireless card. So there is no question that the router is backward compatible.",

      "text": "Everything about this router was great. Performance, size, setup. The menus are really easy to use. Has a great form-factor. Then after 3 months of use being solid as a rock, it locked up once needing to be rebooted - then a day later, it went totally bonkers. I sent it back to Amazon (returns after 30 days are not very simple) and got a Netgear N900 - better, but costs over twice as much. Was mine just a lemon or does this line have a high failure rate? Who knows. The DIR-655 a great value if you can get it to hang with you.",

After I could not get this router to hold an internet connection, I called DLink tech support. I spent two hours on the phone with them only for them to say, \"It sounds like its a hardware problem and I should get a replacement unit.\" I asked how often this happens and she said, \"Quite often.\" Yikes. Just spend the extra couple bucks and get a Linksys/Cisco.",

      "text": "I've been Buying D-Link products for a long time. This is actually the second DIR-655 that I have purchased. Bought one for my Son In Law to use in his new place and was so impressed with the speed and range, that I bought one for my new place. Easy to setup, great feature set (especially the gigabit ports), and outstanding range are good features, but the speed of the 802.11N wireless is awesome. Even my television likes it, connecting to Netflix and downloading instant shows is almost too easy.I would strongly recommend this router.",
