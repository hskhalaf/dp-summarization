For me, I wear socks, so its just a tad bit small, but I bought some thinner socks and it works great. If you are no-sock runner these should fit as expected. For running, and protection against impact... AMAZING.. I really love these shoes. They are nicely balanced and I can run on hard surfaces (although I avoid that generally - prefer grass/ground). I slightly pronate but I haven't twisted my ankle at all, although I run on uneven surfaces. Super shoe. worth it.",
