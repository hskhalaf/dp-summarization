The fact that I cannot use my PC for anything other than streaming steam in big picture mode when activated makes this very undesirable. I can just do this better myself with an additional monitor cable attached to my TV. No streaming needed. My only thought is that this is for people with much larger spaces than me.",

Not sure how to fix that, but there is probably just something that I have to change internally. Otherwise, a great buy for that reason: little to non-existent input lag, or latency.

I've tested it on several computers, and it clearly works a lot faster on the ones with dedicated graphics cards. There's about a 0.2s delay on my network when playing games, so it's not ideal for games like Hollow Knight or Dark Souls that require a fast response time. Otherwise, it works really well. It doesn't completely replace my Chromecast because screen sharing (Steam Link) is a lot more resource/power intensive than streaming directly from a dedicated box (Chromecast).

I've only ever used it for playing games or music through our stereo system. You can minimize Steam Big Picture mode and just use it to remote control your computer which is cool, but streaming Netflix or video seems too choppy to use properly.",
