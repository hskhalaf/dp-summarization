I love that two of the main compartments have locking zippers (take a look at my photos), and that the bag strap is slice-proof. All of my belongings will be safe! It's also great that the straps can be adjusted to wear over one shoulder or be made longer to wear across the body (check my photos). It's comfortable and can store a lot without feeling bulky. If you are traveling, buy this bag!!!",

After 6 months of use, one of the front magnetic buttons fell apart (see picture). After 1 year of use, the main zipper fell apart (see picture). It is now unusable because I can't get into or secure the main compartment. I had very much hoped to get more than 1 year out of the bag, but nothing is ever built to last anymore. The Travelon bag has proven to be yet another cheap bag with a very limited life before it breaks and falls apart. I suggest finding another manufacturer to buy from.",

The main zipper brought almost immediately (after sticking), the inside zipper broke before that, and it started looking worn out pretty much after a few times out. I had to throw it out. It lasted maybe 6 months; the first one lasted a long, good time, to Greece and back to San Francisco, to Panama and back to San Francisco 2x. But this one is useless. I just threw it out and purchased a travel purse from another, more reliable vendor. A waste of money.",

My biggest issue is that the main compartment zipper, by about a short few months of use, began to open itself up from the start point; it just began to separate. It has progressively gotten worse. I hadn't used it for some time since we didn't travel but now I'm using it again and it won't stay closed at all. I've had it long enough I doubt it's returnable but it is definitely a defect. I would probably give a 4 star rating for travel except the opening invalidates that.",

Also mine did not have a carabiner for the strap to purse part like in the photographs, instead its a pull clip ( see picture I uploaded) but it is of good quality. Part of why I chose this was the carabiner (because of strength) so that was a bit of a bummer.",

I liked the security features very much, it gave me a little peace of mind while traveling in South America and Europe, especially the locking zippers. Unfortunately, within the first trip I took( 2 weeks to Argentina), the seams on the shoulder strap began to fray. I was discouraged to see such poor quality. The fraying got worse in Europe, also a 2 week trip, and the front zipper pocket started to fray. The purse held all my things nicely and was a good fit, I was just frustrated that it fell apart so quickly.",

I'll use it again in the future, I just wish it was more comfortable. I had been eyeing different options. If I could choose again, I would pick one with a water bottle holder on the outside. It can be quite annoying to have to lock and unlock the zipper every time you want some water.",

The straps and body of the bag are cut proof and the main pockets \"lock\" with a clip. This provided me with great peace of mind as we were in very crowded places where pickpockets lurk. In addition, it has RFID protected pockets to prevent from identity theft for your passport and cards. You will not be disappointed, plus it's fairly stylish.",
