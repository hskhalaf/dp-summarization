Signal at the hot tub was 0 to 1 bar, depending on wind. After the 90 second WPS install, signal strength on my phone was full bars and download speeds more than doubled. Before this was installed, there would be a 5 to 10 minute buffering period if we tried to stream a movie during prime time. Now the living room AppleTV is like watching a dvd.

Here's a tip: If your primary WiFi signal is on channel 1, choose channel 6 or 11 for your extender That way, one signal woun't interfere with the other.
