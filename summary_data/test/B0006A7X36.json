      "text": "After a week of fighting with this router, I am going back to Linksys. I have a Macintosh network with 11.b Airport cards in both desktop and laptop G4s. After restarting the computer, everything works great UNTIL the computer goes to sleep. Waking from sleep, the Airport absolutely cannot find the Belkin network until after a complete reboot. Interestingly enough, the computer never has any problem finding my neighbor's wireless Linksys network! I called tech support, and talked with someone named Adrian who knew far less than me about the system I am using. After he could not suggest anything else than things I had already tried, he just hung up on me. Thanks, Belkin--never again. Sticking with Linksys.",

Their signal was pretty weak from across the condo and it made for slow transfers and some faulty connection attemtps. When I put in the Belkin router all the signals boosted significantly, and I really like the web-based setup. It has lots of advanced controls (I needed port forwarding and MAC address filtering) but comes with logical defaults for those who are afraid to configure it themselves. I'm not even using Pre-N network cards to experience the full benefit of the router, but so far it's been great!",

Then the wireless side started behaving erratically. We've ordered the \"final\" Belkin N product, and are living on an ancient D-Link G wireless access pointand an even older Netgear wired router. Ah well, the vicissituedes of solid state technology when it goes less than solid . . .",

My home network used to require a repeater to reach the other end of the house. I no longer need the repeater with the Belkin Pre-N router, and I'm not even using Belkin Pre-N network interface cards. The range seems really excellent. I am still a little skeptical about using a networking product from Belkin, but for the home user it's a great device. I am glad I chose it over a new D-Link device. Plus, Belkin has an excellent warranty policy.",

      "text": "I bought this thing because I needed more power than my old D-Link wireless router could give. First, I couldn't get the unit to connect properly despite over an hour with the Belkin service people on the phone. They gave up and said that they didn't know how to fix it. Second, I measured the wireless signal that it put out and it had less range than the D-Link that I already have! Maybe its just a bad unit, maybe not.",
