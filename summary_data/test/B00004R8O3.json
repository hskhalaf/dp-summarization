After charging, I was good to go and my drill was back to being the powerful tool it was when I bought it!",

By the way, the battery I am replacing is Dewalt and is 13 years old. It still works, but doesn't hold a charge very long. Very good products.",

Now he borrows my drills for any of his projects and admits I was right. Huh, go figure!",
