Don't get this and think you're going to be an expert by any means, but this is a fantastic little starter if, like me, you know nothing going into it. It works, and its fun. I upgraded mine to a 1200 mah battery and it flies just fine with even more flight time. Had to cut the battery clip off to get it to fit though cause it was pretty big. Anyway, definitely a decent product.",

Days later still unable to get the things working, I followed the instructions to the letter. Please send call tag so I may send the replacement back for a refund. I am just going to have to spend a few $'s more.. great price, and advertised correctly. Just don't think this is the best choice for me.",
