      "text": "I wish I could have a big pool, but this is a wonderful way to cool off or just relax in the heat of summer. I often get in after working in the yard, and my grandchildren love it. It sits at the back of our patio, so it is easily accessible, and we use it often. I like the filter, as it makes keeping it clean much easier, and I bought some chemicals to keep it chlorinated and pH balanced. I am considering giving this to my daughter so I can justify buying the 12 x12 pool! It was a great purchase, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.",

      "text": "364 days ago, I purchased this pool, under Amazon Prime, for $49.95. It lasted the season fine, but as the season ended, the plastic started to deflate. I really wasn't worried about it because it served it's purpose. THIS YEAR, the same exact pool increased in cost to $399.95, without Amazon Prime, which means you get it when it's shipped from China, where it is made. I spoke to Amazon Prime via CHAT, since they no longer take calls, and they said there is nothing that they can do. I even wrote a prior review but it was not acceptable to Amazon. So, what is a review worth? Your guess is as good as mine.",

The pool lasted 1 week before the entire thing drained out. A brilliant idea. If you are lucky enough to get one without any holes, it's probably a great product for a month or two (which was all I was actually hoping for). It's just that there is no way to test the liner without filling it. So you never know what you got. A pool for $50? Too good to be true.",

      "text": "I was thinking this is gonna be great but t the top ring on pool had air hole leaks the next day. Very thin. Just like the cheap blow up kiddie pools. Also drain hole threads defective. Had to put a sandwich baggie on to get it to fit tightly so water quit dripping out. Figured I'd keep it because cost so much to send back.. But the top ring on pool continues to leak air. Patched twice already. Have to pump up every time use it. Little disappointed in quality.. Pool was great size for my grand daughter.",
