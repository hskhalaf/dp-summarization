They will now sync whereas before this splitter they would not. Once connected I unplug one of the speakers and it's still in dual pairing mode so does this splitter really work?

Both sides connect nicely and aren't hard to plug and unplug. Both sizes are stereo which was a problem with other splitters that I was looking for. One think i did notice is that when you plug in 2 pairs of headphones the volume does drop a bit but its not a big deal.",

It does exactly what it should, it splits the audio from a 3.5mm jack into 2 separate 3.5mm jacks. The nice thing about this one compared to others is that this splitter doesn't send just the left pan to one pair of earbuds and just the right pan to the other, it sends the full audio spectrum to both pairs of earbuds which is exactly what you want! I'd recommend this any day.",
