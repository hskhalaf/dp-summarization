It arrived promptly, was securely packaged and in perfect condition, and was absurdly easy to assemble. It is my new work table in my art studio and I am absolutely thrilled with it. Much of the storage in my studio is on open shelving, so it is nice to have the cabinets in this island for bulky/unwieldy things and the drawers for various tools. I also love the fact that I can expand the table top for larger projects, or drop the leaves for more space in my studio.",

My boyfriend and I spent an entire day removing the doors and part of the door frame to get it in. It was totally worth it because this island is awesome and stores a bunch of our stuff. But just be careful about size because it'll be a pain to return it if you cant fit it into your house",

When the top is not extended it is 42\" L fully extended it is 66\" L The color is buttermilk but it has a yellowish tint to it. It is still a nice color. The top does have a decrotative crack around the edge like my kitchen table which does collect food so I would suggest getting a piece of glass for it. It is on the bigger side, I would recommend this to anyone with an open concept floor plan or a large kitchen",
