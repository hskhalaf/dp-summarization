It is extremely difficult to put it on, even when it is completely unlaced, because the opening doesn't spread much, and you have to negotiate the bend in the shoe between the ankle part and the foot bed. I am 75 years old, and still do rigorous aerobics, need the ankle support, and am willing to put up with the problems of putting this shoe on, because once I have done so, I feel confident that my ankles will not turn and my knees are protected as well.",
