My thermometer was pegged at 300 degrees while I cooked a meat & potato dinner during the winter, which took about 60-75 minutes on a nice clear day. It holds enough food for one person, or 1.5 in a pinch. Clean up is easy, I just line the cooking tray with aluminum foil, which I discard after use, then I rinse the tray with water after it cools. The design of this oven is awesome! The clamshell mirrors make setup easy and foolproof. The materials and construction are top notch and make this something you will be proud to own and to show your friends.",

I'm not sure what it's for, but I've been using to try to direct the oven at the sun, in optimal position. The oven came with very meager instruction, and there is no reference to the bubble.
