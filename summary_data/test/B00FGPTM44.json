Be careful with the lid rack though it is a little weaker and will start to sag a little if you put some weight on it. It worked great for veggies, but when I put about 2lbs of meat on it to add some more wood chips the rack did say some. All in all you couldn't ask for a better grill for a better price.",

As I have been looking to downsize and wanted something smaller.I am happy with my purchase of this Kingsford barbecue kettle charcoal grill. For one person putting this together takes maybe 45mins to 1 hour. The directions are very simple and very easy to read. I believe this grill is sturdy and well made and it is very easy to clean. I hope this will last me a long time with great care. Time will tell though. Love my Kingsford grill!",

I cooked on it the same night I finished putting it together. I was able to fit 2 chicken breasts, asparagus, zucchini, and potatoes on the grill at once (more if I had also used the warming rack). Overall, it's a very nice grill for the price and I'm happy with the purchase so far.",

It isn't totally normal but functional, which is a bit disappointing for a brand new purchase. It is a good sized grill and looks like it will be just what I needed, just disappointed with the poor packaging. I have left this feedback with Amazon, hopefully they will take note and make some changes to how the grill is packaged and shipped.",
