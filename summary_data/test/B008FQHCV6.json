(this step isn't mentioned in the instructions!) \"It seems that the issue is due to the batteries not being connected. Take in mind that the batteries on these units come disconnected so that they do not get drained during transit. Can you please make sure that the batteries are connected after the installation is complete. Please allow the batteries to charge for at least 48 hours before testing the exit sign. If you continue to experience the same issue, please contact us directly so that we may further assist you.\"",

I wired it just like the instructions said, and had no issues. The sign and emergency lights work perfect. The only thing is... Remember to plug in the battery first!! It doesn't say that anywhere in the instructions. Do that, and you'll have no problems.",

Given the cost of a new battery this replacement was a good option plus the led lights are much brighter than the incandescent lights they replaced. These lights don't use Sealed Lead Acid batteries like the older models. This makes the overall product much lighter, although ,I am unsure how the new battery chemistry will affect longevity. The batteries in this model are user replaceable.",

Only took about a half hour to replace 3 old exit and emergency lights with these 3 combos.",
