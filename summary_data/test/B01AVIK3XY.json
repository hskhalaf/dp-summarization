My 2009 Mini does not have smart phone connection so I needed something to amplify the audio from the phone when traveling at 70+ mph. Did not realize that the wireless connection cuts out whenever there is a brief pause in the audio and then cuts back in when the narrator speaks. This makes the audiobook very choppy, missing the first part of many sentences, just enough to be noticeable. Sound quality is much better than the phone Just a technical issue with how these speakers work I guess. People should be aware if this is what you are buying them for.",
