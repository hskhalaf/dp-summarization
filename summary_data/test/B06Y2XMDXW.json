It hadn't been dropped or mishandled. Very disappointed. We also spent a whole 6 hour flight with 2 toddlers and no dvd player. Update: the company contacted us and the lense that reads discs needed to be cleaned. It worked great after this. Update 5/3: However, I'm a couple months past that review and the hinge on the plastic piece that covers the dvd has broken. So it will not stay in place and not read discs.",

The buttons on the device itself and the joystick were inoperable. My grandson was quite disappointed. The game quality seemed like it was pirated.

When using flat of any pressure is put on the screen the buttons that lay behind are pressed and skip or shut off the movie. Using it in the mount is pretty much the only upside of the purchase.

We have to keep it plugged in, but the cord easily reaches the outlet in our sedan. We downloaded the games, but couldn't easily access them from our thumbdrive, so we downplayed this function with our kid (keeping the game controller out of sight).",

The battery life hasn't been fully tested but does work without being connected to a power source. I think the quality of the screen is pretty good for the price.

I strongly recommend you keep looking. Take this from a person who didn't take a bribe for a review.",

With some DVD's, I barely can understand things, even though I turn the sound to the highest level possible. I would not recommend this DVD-Player, and would not buy it again.",

Also if you download the game link they have and put it on thumb drive, you get about 180 classic nes games.

So you have to guess where the play button is by hitting the screen twice or so you can initiate the play again. very annoying and defeats the whole point of user friendly.",
