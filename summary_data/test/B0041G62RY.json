Bought this due to its screen not being made from LED lighting technology which causes severe eye problems. I'll keep it though, as the older non-LED screen and lack of any wireless capability is actually what I am looking for as all wireless devices cause health problems also.",

Although I can get this to play the Audible books, it is not very user friendly and jiggling the earbuds while on my elliptical is a real pain.",

Sound quality is good but running \"Dub Muics Player\" on my Android is so much more better than this Sansa. IMO if this device would cost $20 it would be a keeper.",

I had a 32gb class 2 card sitting around, and when I tried to get music on it, nothing but problems. Put in a class 4 card....buttah. Also, be sure to do the firmware update. It's there for a reason.

    "title": "SanDisk Sansa Fuze+ 4 GB MP3 Player (Red) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Color:RedFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nWith the versatile SanDisk Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player, you'll get more features for less money. You'll be able to watch video on the 2.4-inch screen, share photos, listen to FM radio, record voice memos, and more--all in a device that is just 0.43-inches thin. Internal memory and a microSDHC expansion slot give you plenty of storage options for your digital media, and you can expand your enjoyment even further by adding an optional slotRadio card for an instant library of songs. \n\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player has a vibrant 2.4-inch LCD screen that makes your photos and videos pop. View larger. SLEEK PORTABLE PLAYER FOR AN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player packs a seemingly impossible number of features into a slim profile that fits comfortably into a pocket or purse. Take it with you to the gym or on the road; you'll have your tunes with you wherever you go. The stylish Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player measures just 3.82 x 2.03 x 0.43 inches and weighs just 2.25 ounces. It comes in a myriad of different colors, so finding one that best fits your wardrobe or personality is easy.\n\nBRIGHT 2.4-INCH QVGA LCD SCREEN WITH CAPACITIVE TOUCHPAD CONTROLS\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player has a remarkably large and vibrant 2.4-inch QVGA LCD screen (320 x 240). The bright display showcases your favorite album art and makes videos and photos pop. Also, the easy-to-use capacitive touchpad controls provide the sensation of using a touchscreen without obscuring the device's viewable area. The touchpad makes navigating through the graphical user interface fun and easy. \n\nBUILT-IN MEMORY AND MICROSDHC CARD SLOT FOR MEMORY EXPANSION\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player comes in three different capacities: 4 GB, 8 GB, and 16 GB.* To find out how many songs and photos each capacity can hold, take a look at the chart below.\n\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player also has a microSDHC card slot for expanding your storage possibilities. A 16 GB capacity Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player can take a 32 GB microSDHC card, enabling up to 48 GB of total media file storage--the equivalent of roughly 13,000 songs! \n\nEXPAND YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY WITH A SLOTRADIO CARD\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player supports slotRadio cards, which give you instant access to a veritable music library without the hassle of downloads. slotRadio cards feature handcrafted playlists and hundreds of artists from top music charts. Choose from genre-specific cards like R&B/Hip-Hop, Rock, Country, Latin, Motown, or Oldies, then insert the card into the Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player and you'll enjoy up to 1,000 songs\u2020--no waiting, no Internet connection necessary, no subscription fee. \n\n \u2020slotRadio cards contain songs pre-programmed in music playlists for unlimited playback with slotRadio-compatible devices only. Visit slotRadio.org for slotRadio-compatible devices. Much like radio, these songs are played in sequence and cannot be rewound or rearranged, yet individual songs can be skipped as often as you want. Song and playlist files cannot be copied or viewed (for example, on a PC). \n\nRECHARGEABLE BATTERY PROVIDES FULL DAY OF OPERATION\nWith a long battery life,1 the Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player lets you enjoy more of everything. The internal rechargeable battery lasts up to 24 hours during audio playback1 and up to 5 hours during video playback,1 so you'll never have to worry about running out of music while on a long flight.\n\n\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player comes in five colors. \n(Click your favorite.) LISTEN TO AND RECORD FM RADIO\nIf you feel like taking a break from your music collection, or if you want to dial in a TV frequency at the gym, the Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player has you covered with a built-in digital FM tuner. The tuner gives you the ability to program up to 40 presets and even record FM radio broadcasts, so you'll never miss a beat. You can also pause FM radio broadcasts during recording to filter out commercials or other unwanted portions of the broadcast.\n\nVOICE RECORDER LETS YOU CAPTURE AUDIO\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player includes a voice recorder with built-in microphone, allowing you to capture audio in a pinch. Use it to take memos, record lectures, or capture funny moments as they happen. Play the recordings back later or copy them to your computer so you can edit and share them with others.\n\nVERSATILE BEST-IN-CLASS SUPPORT FOR YOUR DIGITAL MEDIA\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player provides highly versatile support for most of your music, videos, photos, and audio books.\n\nThe Sansa Fuze+ MP3 player supports the following music file formats: MP3, WMA, secure WMA, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC/M4A (iTunes DRM-free music files), and WAV.
