This from description seamed ideal but no i have yet to get a spo2 reading and the programs seam to always want to count the number steps and does so, i am wheelchair bound and the blood pressure has not moved from 120/80 I suffer from hypertension and bp is always high until medicated in morning So this item has yet to perform as described and certainly has yet to perform as was hoped for So a useless purchase and am highly disappointed",

According to the Pulse Ox, I burn the same calories regardless of the intensity of the exercise, for example a 1 hour session, playing 5 a side football burns only 150 calories!! I cannot recommend this product for anything other than walking and for that you can get a free app on your phone!!",

Tracking hourly activity, heart rate, blood oxygenation (SpO2), sleep monitoring, and daily travels (distances and altimeter), it provides an incredible amount of information into our lives. Combined with the Withings Scale, we also see our heart rate, weight, and indoor air quality as part of our daily metrics. We have been incredibly pleased with the Withings Pulse O2 and we'd recommend it to friends.",

You have to remove tracker, take a reading, then put it back. I don't see how that would make anyone's life easier. Because it's difficult, and does not provide continuous data, it's essentially worthless. Worse yet, mine died a week into using it. Bricked for no apparent reason. Thankfully, Amazon is the world champ at making things right. I returned it and I'm waiting on a different brand now.",
