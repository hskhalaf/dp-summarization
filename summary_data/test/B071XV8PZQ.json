Edit: After a couple night drives, I must say I'm very satisfied. The bulbs are brighter than what was originally in the car, but not overly bright. The beam pattern seems pretty spot on too. Advice: If you want these bulbs to fit perfectly in an 8th gen Civic, you need to use the O rings from your previous bulbs.",

That in itself is awesome but even better than that is the quality of these lights. They are by far the best bulbs I have ever had in a vehicle. These bulbs are definitely worth the money. I replaced all of my front light bulbs with the 9006 as my low beams and fog lights,and 9005 as my high beams(2004 4runner) . The 6k color is perfect as well. Thank you for such a well built amazing product. I sell people on these bulbs everytime headlight conversations come up.",

I've only got them installed in a car in my pole barn, and the car isn't driveable at then moment, so I hooked up a jump pack and that let me check the lights. That being said, I have tested it on the road, or outside, but inside that dark building, you could definitely tell the difference. The harness on lights is sort of short, so using the provided double-sided tape to mount the adapter is kind of tough, but you could always use the zip ties instead.",

Only thing I got is that you have to make sure you have a really small Allen key to adjust the bulbs to make them point to the sides. The set screw is located under the o-ring, just remove the o-ring loosen the set screw and adjust your bulbs so when it\u2019s installed the leds point to the sides.",
