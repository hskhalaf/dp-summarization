One place I tried was especially frustrating: they had blocked input switching on the in-room screen and replaced the remote with one that had no input switching button. We have used RoKu at home for several years, and love the simplicity and integration of our different streaming sources.

We utilize it for Spectrum, Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, ESPN, BigTenNetwork, etc. Since we won't have to pay a monthly rental fee for another box through Spectrum....this will pay for itself if a few months!",

I knew the Roku 3 would be a lot faster because it's more expensive, has better specifications, and has no wait time or button lag but the load time for apps and shows is ~10 seconds faster. That's fine especially considering the price difference; it just takes some adjusting when going from the speed and snappiness of the 3",

I would say I prefer Roku! Chromecast has the advantage of easily cast your current chrome tab, videos. However, Roku gives you easy access to mulitple channels, let you set up netflix, hbo now, amazon prime and whatever channel you want. It also makes it easy to search for movies and provide some interesting recommendations.",
