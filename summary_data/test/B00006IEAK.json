I like these pens because they're a smooth ballpoint that doesn't leave any weird lines, and comes out smooth and evenly. The caps on these pens fit really well so you won't have to worry about the cap coming off in your bag and getting ink everywhere. They come with a rubber grip that makes writing more comfortable, and the circumference of the pen itself makes it comfortable to hold. After I bought these pens they were shipped quickly and arrived in a box. I recommend these pens and the distributor.",

The purple, in particular, really bleeds through thin paper (especially test prep workbooks, which I annotate all the time) and over time, the purple does fade to pink. Green seems to be more stable.",

This pen delivers, it is easy to hold because i write a lot on genealogy, the price is perfect, and it is very comfortable to hold while writing. yours Truly Eileen Hamilton.",
