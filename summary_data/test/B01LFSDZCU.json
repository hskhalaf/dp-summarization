It is completely incapable of client mode, so I can't use this to get a wired device onto my wireless network. This is extremely frustrating. Beyond that, the UI is pretty terrible. It feels like Netgear hasn't upgraded their interface in a decade, and in fact I remember their other products having slightly better UIs. So this is a step backwards. Anyway, I can't say if this is a good product for what I want it, but on the grounds of it not living up to the promise of the product description, I'm panning it.",

I ran two ethernet cables from the primary router in the middle of our home to connect to NETGEAR AC1200s at opposite sides of the house. Not difficult to setup. Good range. Great WiFi distribution across our house and to the front/back yards as well. WiFi range outside reaches out to 150 feet! Really good home solution and beats having to buy enterprise level hardware.
