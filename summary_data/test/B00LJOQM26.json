      "text": "Not often I write a review but these glasses are nice. A darker tint than appears in the photo but that's ok with me. These are actually quite stylish and in my opinion a great look. The most impressive part though is the magnification of the lens, it's consistent. I find with the cheaper ones you normally get one little area in the center that's the correct magnification then it's gets blurry and changes towards the outside edges of the lenses, and is very distracting when your eyes drift off center and even causes headaches, not these, these are actually pretty darn good at a great price.",

I have four extra pairs, all which came with individual sleek pouches, in storage. ((The first pair I chose are still the same quality as when I first purchased.)) Helpful Tip: These are great for BOOK/ARTICLE reading. Highly recommend getting reading glasses with the Blue Light protection.

However, the second lot of glasses I received (ordered May 2015) are of noticeably lower quality, with the glasses scratching more than the first lot, and the legs coming off from three glasses so far, with hardly any wear. It unfortunately looks like a typical case of grabbing custumers with a fine product then cheaping the quality control. It really is too bad, for these were the best reading glasses ive ever owned for the price. The sad fact is that even with the legs coming off, they may still be worth to buy. Just buy replacemente screws and or, tighten the screws every so often..",
