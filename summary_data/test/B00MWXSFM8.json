Invest in small disposable storage containers 4. Removing the crisper drawer allows for much more room.",

Also make sure it isn't on a fuse circuit that has much on it, I had to relocate it to several different rooms before I found a place it wouldn't blow a fuse (older house) Overall I recommend",

It doesn't have self-defrost in the freezer, so it needs to be defrosted about every 7 to 8 months, but that's easy. Electrical consumption is low, and it's not noisy. It's been completely trouble-free and easy to clean. Overall an excellent purchase.",
