      "text": "I love this light. I've purchased several. They are very compact, don't get hot, are extremely bright, and use an externally charged batter pack that uses standard USB Type A connections. Unfortunately, I must give this product a 1 star rating even though the product itself is good. This is because the unit I got has a broken handlebar mount. The piece wasn't broken in transit so I suspect someone returned the unit and someone just packaged it back up without checking to make sure the mount was still good. The company has been unresponsive to send me a replacement mount, which would cost them only a couple of dollars probably.",

I sent an email to the Te-Rich customer service department including my proof of purchase, but never got any response whatsoever.

I like the light and used it as a backup to my Creo/Magicshine unit. This unit is poorly made. The most important part of a cycling light system is the wiring. 90% of my failed light systems are due to wiring. This one as too quick - less than 2 months of daily use.",

The handlebar mount is very complicated and it comes lose frequently. If I put it on just right then it's solid for the ride. I have had other bike lights that used a stretchy piece of rubber to attach to the handlebar, and I tend to prefer that style of attachment. But for the price, these are the best lights I've had and I'm very happy with the purchase.",

The external battery means you have a long run time and can easily swap for a different USB power pack if this one ever runs down.

Charging requires a special dual-ended USB cable. Lose it and it will be hard to replace. Kind of wish it had a flashing mode, but that's a minor point.

The battery life is great, the focus of the light is perfect and I finally feel comfortable riding at high speed in (otherwise) pitch blackness.

Cons: usb recharging cable came apart during first use -1 star. Didn't use the rear light, rather had better quality charge cable, also comes with head band why whould anyone use this as a headlight??? Initial thoughts: I wish that they get rid of the headlight band and rear light and include a better charge cable. I've only used this on 1 ride so far will do an update in a few months.",

This model is much brighter than lights I own that claim they are 1600 lumens with double the size battery packs. In addition, I really like the easy to install kit and small (but light) battery. Worth every penny. Five stars! The little red light that is included is worthless.",

I use the handle bar mount and don't need remove the light so its no problem for me. Considering the price i could not be happier!",

The light housing is aluminum and the battery is made of a hard plastic...very sturdy...The USB battery charges quickly...and it's easy to mount. There are very similar lights that REI sells for hundreds more....I'm sure the build quality is a tiny bit better but it's not worth +$100 more difference.",

Took it for a test ride right before dawn on a trail with no lights and it was great! I can see everything in front of me and to the sides and even on the 2nd setting it was good enough. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves riding but doesn't want to wait till it's bright enough :)",

This light has been a constant friend friend on my handlebars in very challenging conditions...intense rain, high humidity, salt air. This light has always lived up to the challenge, both night and day (strobe mode). Makes paying high prices for name brand models seem silly. Wherever I have a bike, in the US or the Philippines, I have several of these great lights available. The only thing I would suggest is to make the mounting system more compatible for larger diameter handlebars.",

Package also came with a headlamp strap if you wish to convert to a headlamp. Only had the opportunity to use it for 4 hours so far on medium and low setting.
