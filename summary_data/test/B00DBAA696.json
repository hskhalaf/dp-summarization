I purchased two of these for various areas in my house and they work great. They have a nice warranty on them (note: that you must register.. so don't forget). They look nice and work as designed. They've been put to the test so far and I do not have any complaints. For the price point, I'd recommend them.",

We are protecting a firewall, router, switch and 1 single pc w/17\" LCD and 1 ext USB HD with this 850. Easily gets 15+min backup time. I will buy CyberPower again, especially now that specs are better, dollar for dollar, than APC equivalent. Now if they can offer a competitive rackmount server unit........",

Then you turn it back on(without charging) and it then runs again for 100mins. So basically it probably lacks battery charge circuit?? and that is made up by having a simple timer.",
