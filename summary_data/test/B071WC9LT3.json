It seems to be an electricity saver as well compared to our old microwave which guzzled it up. Highly recommended!",

I have contacted Toshiba for resolution. Let's see how long it takes. Maybe they should think about advance replacements on returns since this seems to be an on-going problem until they can QA it.
