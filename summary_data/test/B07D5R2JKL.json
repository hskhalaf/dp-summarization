The arms cracked, but Parrot said it was operator error, even after we sent in multiple videos and photos. Then we purchased the arm repair kit from Amazon, but we cannot open the original arms to remove the wiring and motors because there are no screws. Parrot customer service was completely unhelpful, they suggested we pay to have our brand new drone fixed. This is not an Amazon issue but a Parrot issue; we will not be purchasing any more Parrot Drones.",

    "title": "Parrot ANAFI The Ultra compact Flying 4K HDR Camera Drone - Grey",
    "description": "Configuration:Anafi BaseANAFI is the flying 4K HDR camera that you can take with you everywhere on the go. It unfolds in less than 3 seconds and is made from a lightweight carbon frame. This ultra-compact drone has a 25-minute flight time and takes high quality photos of 21 MP. Thanks to its USB-C charging system, you can charge your Parrot drone anytime, anywhere. ANAFI comes complete with a foldable controller, Parrot sky controller 3 and its 180 degrees vertical tilt gimbal is ideal for low-angle shots, this unprecedented feature has never been seen in a leisure drone before. ANAFI is the smaller and quieter consumer drone. The drone is capable of restricting its flight to a predefined area if setup by the user before the flight and is capable of returning to the last synchronized location with its automated GPS flight, IF the GPS in the phone and drone are able to connect to the GPS network at the beginning of the flight. The connection can be verified by the GPS icons for the drone and phone in the app. If the GPS icon appears red it means no GPS signal is received, therefore the Return to Home function will return the drone to the previously stored location.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1x Anafi drone 1 x long range controller 1x 16gb micro sd card 1x usb cable 1x box of 8 additional blades 1x carry case instruction manuals",
