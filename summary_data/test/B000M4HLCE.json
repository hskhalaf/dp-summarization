It takes good pictures and has nice settings for taking various pictures but none of that really matters because it doesn't last long. Now, whenever I try and turn it on, it stays on for a second and then shuts off after a couple seconds. It is cheap, compared to higher quality cameras, so I guess you get what you pay for.",

It's a solid weight so it doesn't feel cheap at all, and the screen resolution is crisp. I would definitely recommend this camera for people who find themselves taking pictures on a vacation and special-event basis.",

There is no external microphone input, and the audio is terrible. There is no external battery adapter input, and the battery life is marginal. video records at 320x240.

The only complaint I have is when you are recording a video you dont have sound playback. Also, once uploaded to the computer the sound quality isn't that great. It is very easy to upload your photos to a computer with a very easy-to-use program layout. I would rate this a 4 out of 5.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWith 7.2-megapixel imaging, high sensitivity and up to 460-shot, Stamina battery power, the Cyber-shot DSC-S700 digital camera is an ideal camera for starting out, stepping up or making the switch from film to digital. Its 3x optical zoom lens, 24MB internal memory capacity and bright 2.4-inch LCD screen add up to a great combination of high-value features for first-time users. Boasting a sophisticated metal body, compact design and affordable price, the DSC-S700 easily fits into your travel plans or budget. \n\n Cybershot DSC-S700 Highlights \n\n 7.2-megapixel Super HAD CCD More megapixels give you more detail and definition when you make big prints or crop in tight on your subject. The advanced Sony Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. \n\n 3x optical zoom lens 3x optical zoom helps the DSC-S700 bring distant subjects closer and lets you frame shots quickly for better composition -- a real advantage for family sports, outdoor fun and travel photos. \n\n High sensitivity With high sensitivity of ISO 1000, the DSC-S700 gives you better shots in low light so you can shoot without flash to preserve the mood -- great for birthday parties, indoor gatherings and candid portraits. \n\n Stamina battery power With optional Sony NiMH rechargeable batteries, you can capture up to an amazing 460 shots -- shooting capacity that\u2019s about the equivalent of 13 rolls of 35mm film. With supplied AA alkaline batteries, the DSC-S700 can capture up to 100 shots. \n\n 24 MB internal memory You don\u2019t need a flash memory card, because the DSC-S700 allows you to capture images with in-camera convenience -- then easily transfer your shots to optional Memory Stick Duo media, upload photos to your computer or make prints directly from the optional Sony Picture Station digital printer. \n\n Memory Stick Duo media convenience The DSC-S700 also has a built-in slot for optional Memory Stick Duo media -- the compact, high-capacity storage media that are compatible with millions of devices worldwide. \n\n Bright, 2.4-inch LCD screen The DSC-S700 provides a bright LCD screen composing shots, checking results, sharing your photos on location and reading camera setup menus even in full sunlight. \n\n Convenient photo modes To adjust quickly for specific shooting situations, the DSC-S700 lets you choose from several convenient photo modes: Auto, P-Auto, and Scene Selections for Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Soft Snap, Snow, High Sensitivity and Beach environments. \n\n QVGA Movie Mode The DSC-S700 can capture 320 x 240 audio/video clips at high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second3), with length limited only by the capacity of your media. \n\n Burst mode You can fire off three shots automatically at 1-second intervals (VGA standard mode) or 2-second intervals (7.2 MP mode) -- a great way to capture a child\u2019s first steps or a pet\u2019s best tricks. \n\n Cyber-shot viewer software New Sony software that makes it easier to upload images from camera or Memory Stick Duo media -- then organize and browse through photos on your PC screen by simply scrolling through thumbnail images.",
