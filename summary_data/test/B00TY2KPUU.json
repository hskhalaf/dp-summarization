Learned over the years to place a rubber mat or carpet under any appliance will cut down on noise. As unit was placed on wood, placed piece of carpet under unit and can hardly hear it run. Did not need a freezer, so very much appreciate the extra room for refrigerator. Regards, Gil Alligood",

I have had zero issues with this unit and would happily purchase it again. If you are going to build it into a cabinet like I did, be sure to leave at least a 4 inch gap behind it and a minimum one inch gap on top so it can breath. This will prevent the unit from overheating helping insure years of use.",

Unpacked, leveled and powered up with the thermometer on the center shelf. Allowed unit to cycle overnight. Checked internal temp the next day to be 38 degrees Fahrenheit. Placed additional items being careful to not crowd shelf adjacent to the thermostat. Verified daily and weekly thereafter. 38 degrees has been maintained to date of this post. Space between the back of refrigerator and wall, 6\". Internal temperature does rise quickly if door open more than briefly.",

The one we got has to be tipped forward by 10\u00b0 to stop the rattling. There's no way to adjust the condenser to stop the rattling either (short of presumably taking the motor/fan assembly apart and rebuilding it). At $140, it's not worth shipping back; and the repair options aren't so great.",

I contacted Magic Chef and they said they would send one out but it was out of stock. I used a shim for a temporary fix but I find it odd that part is not available, tells me I am not alone. Poor quality control. Three weeks later still no part, again told it is on back order which is equivalent to check is in the mail.",

I used self tapping metal screw which worked well. The unit cooled down fast and as it will be used in a garage I guess I can put up with the dents.",
