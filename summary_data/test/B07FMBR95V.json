Since I read the reviews first about only charging on a PC or the Switch I've had no problems with battery life. Button response feels solid with no lag. The hardest part was syncing up the controller with the switch just due to the switch menus. Once we figured that out it was off to the races. Would recommend and buy again.",

It's accurate, easy to pair and has a decent battery life. Buttons feel good, not too stiff or soft. Same with the sticks. I do like the LEDs on the buttons. It lights them up. It has motion control too so it's compatible with practically every game. It's certainly worth it to me.",

Neither we're dropped, just normal game play, and both have the latest firmware. Just save up your money and get the Nintendo Pro. Money wasted here.",

However, I was also hoping to use the Hycarus's dual shock and six axis tilt options. That's when I found out, through thorough searching, that there are no gamepad Android games that support vibration/dual shock/force feed feedback or six axis tilt/accelerometer/gyroscope. That's why I deducted 2 points in my rating. I'm guessing that I may have prematurely bought this gamepad and should wait for another six months or a year till the Powers That Be at Android Games Central modify their TV games to support gamepads which come with gyroscopes and haptic motors.",

The instructions are clear and setup is easy. There is only one motor for the rumble and it's on the right, so you will feel the imbalance of vibration while playing. The turbo button is not really what I expected though, it goes at about .422 button presses per second and that makes the turbo button somewhat useless since about anyone can press a button faster than that unlike one of my other controllers has a turbo button that goes at .119.",

It is a shame that third party controllers cannot start up the switch, but if I am lazy, I can grab an original controller to start it up and then switch to this one easily. I recharge about every other play session, whether neeeded or not and this is working out fine, I don't run out of charge. Great job. Need a steering wheel and stuff now. :-)",

My advice if you're buying for older kids and adults this my work for you but if you have younger children you might have to find a more durable product.",

The buttons have built in LED lights and light up in use which is a nice addition. Games are also pretty responsive. If you're familiar with PlayStation it will help with the learning curve of using this controller. The biggest drawback I found with this was that you need to download a firmware update to get it to pair with the system, which absolutely must be done before playing. I find this slightly inconvenient but Hycarus works with you and assists with the firmware update if need be.",

Love playing Paladins and Fortnite with this controller. The best part is that it's a fraction of the price compared to the Nintendo Switch Controller. Its a STEAL!!!
