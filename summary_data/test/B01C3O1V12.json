      "text": "I have been using it for a week now. It works great. Water filters through the sides of the device and flows downward to the bottom. The only flaw I find is that the slit at the bottom of the dripper is rather small and can make it difficult to see how much water has been poured into your mug. Not a problem if a small cup, but can be problem if pouring into a tall mug or tumbler. Also grinds build up at the bottom and makes cleaning just a bit more laborious as you sometimes have to dig it out. Works great with paper filters though. No difference in flow rate.",

Just wanted to give you guys a heads up. I waited too long to fix it now i cant return it.:(",

I actually have both the one-piece unit (this one) and another where the filter is separate from the stand. I do like the separate filter/stand, as the mesh runs all the way to the bottom tip of the cone, which means less puddling. This filter is well-constructed, sturdy and makes the best cup of coffee.
