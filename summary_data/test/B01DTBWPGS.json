The help line was called again and after a little discussion we were given a supervisor and he cussed at my husband and hung up on him. This was a horrible experience.",

Using Echo powerblend 2 cycle oil. I imagine like all small 2 cycle gas engines, it will take some tinkering as it gets older, but that's no problem for someone with a little experience.",

It's straight shaft, works great. The cutter that this comes with works wonders. Yes, a better blade helps, but I haven't swapped mine out yet. It'll cut small saplings as is. The trimmer head is NOT an attachment. It is just the head and requires you to switch it out. Honestly, I bought this one for the 27cc motor and will not use the trimmer u less my other goes down. I bought this to add attachments. BUY IT.",
