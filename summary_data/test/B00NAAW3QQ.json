      "text": "Great bag. Strong canvas with sturdy stitching and no loose threads. No rips or tears on arrival. The only hassle? It could use some extra pockets in the interior (I got the extra large) to make finding and organizing all the stuff I carry in it easier to manage. I got the bag in black and it\u2019s a nice deep shade which I hope doesn\u2019t fade too soon. I\u2019ve received a few compliments on it. I did spray it down with Scotchgard to make it a little bit more stain and water resistant, and overall I gotta say, it\u2019s a classic looking messenger bag, well worth the purchase. 4.50 stars! WooHoo!!",

I wear this to the office, it basicall carries all my stuff. I'm trying to give it a real rugged looked. I'm constantly trying to make it look more worn and torn but it's really sturdy.

We travel often and the big rolling bag he uses as a professor just isn't needed. This bag has an interior section with extra padding for his laptop but, to be clear, this is not a hard side, protective bag. There are several interior and exterior pockets for extra organization but not so many that things get lost in revolving \"not this one\" infinity. We would both highly recommend this bag for anyone wanting a mid weight, attractive bag for transit with a big lap top.",

Delivery was swift, and the product was in good condition. This will definitely fit a 17.3\" laptop in a snug fit, with room in the outer pockets for the supporting impedimenta.

The straps and bottom corners are a thick but pliable leather. Same for the canvas - soft but sturdy. This bag is a great purchase for the price and would be an excellent gift.",

They easily fall off, and I have already lost 1 of the buckles. It is the only reason I'm giving this Item 4/5 stars is because of the issue with the buckles. Great product, faulty design.",
