That's a steal. The shoes came in quickly, and fit as expected. (I wear size 12-13 US, in this case 13.) They are relatively comfy to wear and look super good! The build looks and feels well-made and they seem pretty durable in terms of casual wear. These shoes pair up so nice with spring and summer outfits. So glad to have bought them. Hope to make some memories with these bad boys!",
