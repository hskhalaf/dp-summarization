Great results of local outdoor scenery. High resolution. I shoot RAW, then go right to editing with my software. Much fun and getting real good results that please me. Camera does a super job on auto. Then I branch out and do some manual setting. Just ordered tripod and remote shutter release cable to reduce shake on slower shutter speeds. The 3 attached photos have different degrees of photo editing to brighten.",

My wife favors the point-and-shoot, and it fits her needs well in that respect. My one complaint: the \"auto\" settings tend towards the bright, and we often end up with photos that are washed out with light, or are blurry for having a longer exposure time. It's nothing that can't be adjusted, but it is a little irritating to have to adjust the brightness settings every time the camera is turned on in \"auto\".",

I kept pressing it and realized it was not recording. Other than those, I am enjoying this camera a lot! It takes wonderful pictures and the size is perfect to bring around.",

The system will not focus automatically, and the motors & drives make such a racket that any sound in the video is lost. If you want a great DSLR this is the best for the price!",

I still have a long way to go in learning all of the tricks and techniques that this model has to offer. I have tried the video feature and it is also top notch as well.

    "title": "Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Body Only)",
    "description": "Style:Body Only| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Canon\u2019s new EOS Rebel T1i is packed with features, both refined and new. In addition to its admirable performance with an all-new 15.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor, DIGIC 4 Image Processor, a 3.0-inch Clear View LCD with anti-reflective and scratch resistant coating, and compatibility with the EOS System of lenses and Speedlites, the EOS Rebel T1i adds remarkable Full HD video capture at resolutions up to 1920 x 1080. \n\nAn HDMI port allows for quick connections to high definition TVs and monitors for easy viewing of your stills and video. The entire operation is simple and easy even if you are a beginner. You\u2019ll have uncompromised EOS Digital performance with power and flexibility right in the palm of your hand. \n\nEOS Rebel T1i Highlights \n\nNew 15.1-megapixel CMOS sensor with DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same new technologies as used by Canon\u2019s professional cameras to maximize each pixel\u2019s light gathering efficiency. Its APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format). Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor dramatically speeds up all camera operations for intuitive operation and offers improvements in both fine detail and natural color reproduction. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel T1i\u2019s image sensor to achieve unprecedented levels of performance in all lighting situations. \n\n14-bit A/D Conversion\nWith the EOS Rebel T1i, analog to digital signal conversion is executed by a 14-bit processor, which generates digital data with incredibly smooth tones. A feature that originally appeared in top-of-the-line pro digital SLR cameras, the 14-bit conversion gives incredibly smooth transitions from light to dark colors with far less risk of \"banding.\" A sky at sunset is a perfect example. With this rich 14-bit gradation, the EOS Rebel T1i offers RAW images of the highest quality that can be processed with Canon\u2019s Digital Photo Professional software. Even JPEG files, which are always finished at 8-bits per channel, use the full 14-bit conversion initially to generate the best possible color and tonal detail. \n\nFull HD video capture at 1920 x 1080 resolution\nThe EOS Rebel T1i shoots brilliant video, even in full high definition. By simply selecting Movie mode on the EOS Rebel T1i\u2019s mode dial, the camera\u2019s 3.0-inch LCD lights up, and it's ready to go. Shooting is at a frame rate of 30 fps when shooting SD or HD quality video (640 x 480 and 1280 x 720 pixels, respectively) and at a frame rate of 20 fps in Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) recording. Sound is recorded through the camera\u2019s built-in microphone. Playback modes are simple to access, and all Live View AF features can be used in shooting video. \n\nLive View Function for stills and video\nWith Live View Function on the EOS Rebel T1i, you can enjoy nearly every camera function available in normal shooting, all with the convenience of composing on the camera\u2019s brilliant 3.0-inch LCD monitor. You can zoom in and navigate the composition and there\u2019s even a grid overlay for architectural shots. Live View focusing modes include Quick mode, Live mode and Face Detection AF mode and these are easily selectable through the convenient Live View Function menu. \n\n\n\nWide range ISO setting 100-3200\nThe EOS Rebel T1i features a greatly expanded ISO range that makes shooting possible in situations previously impossible without flash. With an expanded setting to ISO 3200 (ISO expansion: 6400, 12800), along with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor\u2019s improved noise-reduction technology, your creative possibilities are nearly endless. Combine the EOS Rebel T1i with one of Canon\u2019s EF/EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer and watch your shooting possibilities expand even further. \n\n3.0-inch Clear View LCD (920,000 dots/VGA) monitor\nThe EOS Rebel T1i has a 3.0-inch high resolution LCD monitor that features 920,000 dots/VGA for far more detail than previous Rebel-series LCDs. It\u2019s the same screen found on professional models such as the EOS 5D Mark II. A number of features enhance usability: an anti-reflective and water-repellant coating provides a clearer and more smudge-resistant surface and screen brightness can be adjusted in 7 steps in accordance with ambient light. \n\nAuto Lighting Optimizer for superior highlight-shadow control\nThe EOS Rebel T1i\u2019s Auto Lighting Optimizer is yet another image-quality tool that comes to the rescue in tricky lighting conditions. It can actually lighten dark areas of a scene while ensuring that bright areas maintain tonal detail. It\u2019s available in all shooting modes, including P, Tv, Av and Manual. \n\nCreative Auto goes a step beyond auto allowing control\nEspecially for beginners looking to expand their photographic horizons, the EOS Rebel T1i offers Creative Auto mode. While basic settings are based on full automatic operation, shooting guides on the LCD screen enable you to make corrections based on simple to follow guidelines. In essence, with Creative Auto mode, you can learn about photography while taking stunning photographs. \n\n\n\nCompatible with over 60 Canon EF/EF-S lenses and most EOS System accessories\nEOS Rebel T1i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L-series lenses, and Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer technology is featured in select lenses, including the EF-S 18-55mm IS lens bundled with the EOS Rebel T1i, to minimize the effect of camera shake. With Canon lenses, you can truly maximize the quality and performance of the EOS camera. \n\nFlash Photography\nThe EOS Rebel T1i features Canon\u2019s acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any EX-series Speedlite, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering--giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there\u2019s a menu setting to change to \"Average\" flash metering--where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure. \nT1i DSLR with optional Speedlite \nSoftware \n\nCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 20)\nThe EOS Rebel T1i comes bundled with a Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer. These include Canon's EOS Utility (Version 2.6), Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.6), ZoomBrowser EX for Windows (Version 6.3), ImageBrowser for Macintosh OS X (Version 6.3), the Picture Style Editor (Version 1.5), PhotoStitch (version 3.2), WFT Utility (version 3.3). Each application is designed to perfect the captured images and streamline the digital workflow.\nCompatible Operating System\nWindows: Windows XP SP2 or SP3/ Windows Vista (all version except the Starter Edition)\nMacintosh: OS X 10.4 to 10.5 \n\nEOS Utility (Version 2.6) for Macintosh or Windows handles the connection between the camera and computer, whenever they\u2019re connected via USB. It allows remote controlled shooting from the computer, handles downloading of images from the camera to the computer, and allows seamless linking to either Canon\u2019s ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser or Digital Photo Professional software once images have been copied to the hard drive. Furthermore, it\u2019s used to upload settings back into a USB-connected camera. \n\nDigital Photo Professional (Version 3.6) is an image processing program that enables high-speed RAW image processing, high-speed previewing for real-time image adjustment and support for sRGB, Adobe RGB and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because it\u2019s CMS (Color Management System) compatible, Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy-PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images. \n\nPicture Style Editor (Version 1.5) enables you to create custom Picture Style profiles that can be used to customize the appearance of JPEG and RAW images captured with EOS Digital SLR cameras. Picture Style files created with Picture Style Editor can be loaded into the EOS cameras that support Picture Style and may also be used when processing RAW images in Canon software applications Digital Photo Professional, ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows) and ImageBrowser (for Mac). \n\nZoomBrowser EX (Version 6.3) for Windows and ImageBrowser (Version 6.3) for Mac OS X are the easy, user-friendly options for viewing and editing of JPEG and even RAW image files. Both allow viewing of numerous types of images including finished TIFF and BMP files. Both also have a variety of search options for finding images, allow re-naming of single images or batches of files, and offer a variety of options for printing without using a separate image-editing program. \n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n \n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Canon EOS T1i Digital SLR: Preview by dpreview.com \n\nJust 14 months after the launch of the EOS Rebel XSi (450D), Canon has unveiled its latest model, the Rebel T1i (500D). It's the fifth generation of Rebel and enters the market at a difficult time - in the midst of a global economic downturn and against the fiercest competition we've ever seen in the entry-level DSLR sector. So what has Canon done to make this latest model in the longest-established family in the sector live up to the edgy and exciting image implied by its US naming? \n\nThe 500D/T1i doesn't quite have to be the everyman camera that its predecessors were. The introduction of the Rebel XS (1000D) in June 2008 means the T1i no longer has to appeal to everybody who doesn't want to stretch to buying into the 50D class. As a result, the 450D was able to bulk up its feature set to include a selection of features that price-conscious shoppers don't necessarily realize they want, such as a larger viewfinder and spot metering. The result was probably the most complete Rebel we'd seen. \n\nThere's a full explanation of the differences between the 500D/T1i and it predecessor on the coming pages but, in general terms, it's a gentle re-working of the 450D. So you get the 15MP sensor much like the one that appears in the 50D, helping this to become the first entry-level DSLR to feature video (and 1080p HD video at that). You also get the lovely 920,000 dot VGA monitor that has been slowly working its way down most manufacturer's DSLR line-ups. There are a handful of other specification tweaks that come from the use of the latest Digic 4 processor but essentially this is most of a 50D stuffed into the familiar 450D body. \n\nAnd, if the loss of the letter 'X' from the US name seems a bit disconcerting, you can comfort yourself with the knowledge that the Japanese market will still know it by the odd-to-European-ears 'Kiss X3 Digital.' For simplicity's sake, we'll refer to the 500D/T1i/Kiss X3 by the name 500D throughout the rest of the preview. \n\n>Read more at dpreview.com",
