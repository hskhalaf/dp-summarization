Save yourself some aggravation and if you are looking to condition high quality leather boots and shoes- purchase the Dubarry Leather Cream.

Some darkening may happen at first but will usually lighten over time. Leather is a porous surface and will darken when wet or in this case conditioned. It's a natural surface, not a dyed or painted manufactured product. Live it and love it. That's the beauty of leather. And love your leather with leather honey.

I microwaved 5 ml of conditioner in a tequila shot glass for 30 seconds and used an old Cotton T shirt to spread it out on the leather. Heating the conditioner makes it runny and less viscous and does help in spreading. However applying the conditioner is the hard part. It takes patience and little bit of technique to get desired results. It does alter the look of the leather immediatley. It gives it a very dark color.

      "text": "I have a leather jacket that has to be 15+ years old and it's a fantastic jacket and perfectly broken in. I just needed a good product to condition it and this worked great. It brought back some life to the collar and elbows abs just gave the overall jacket a good feel. The jacket was expensive - even 15 years ago when I bought it so I didn't want to dump just anything on it. This was gentle but it worked. Once I was done with the jacket I treated an old overnight bag and an old messenger bag and I used it on a few watch straps as well.",

Not so on this 500.00 wallet. Thank goodness it was applied to a small section on the inside so not all is lost. When used on full grain leather it darkens the leather just like all the others. If you use this product, always try an inconspicuous area first. I will use it on bridles and dog leashes, but never again on anything for human use such as a jacket, travel bag, belt, purse, etc. Use at your own risk.",

I have had my leather couches for over 20 years and they are still in great condition. I attribute that to brown polish and leather honey. I highly recommend this product.",
