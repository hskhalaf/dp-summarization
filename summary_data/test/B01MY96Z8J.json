Whenever I find a new multi layered track, it gets put to these. These are the ringer, I test every song and every new headphone against these and while some may sound more dynamic or exciting they just don't ever BEAT these. My only reason for a four star review is comfort wise I found the ear clips can pinch slightly after extensive use. I start off not even aware I have them in, but eventually it can get distracting.",

      "text": "Sound is good when connected to an Astell&Kern AK300, although I'm still playing with equalizer settings to optimize the sound with the standard audio cable. I was very much looking forward to trying these earphones with my iPod touch. In fact, the sound seemed quite good when I connected them via the included Cipher cable, but only for a few seconds; the earphones stopped working and I thought I had pressed the wrong button. But in fact the Audeze apps tells me that \"No cable\" is connected. So it looks like the Cipher cable only lasted about 5 seconds. Much has been written about the comfort of these earphones (or lack thereof); I actually find them quite comfortable.",

Through my Chord Mojo they sound even better. Note the cipher lead is not included in this particular package and will buy when available in the UK or direct from the US to try their DAC via mobile and Hi Res performance. Overall comfort is not 100% for listening for long periods, but happy to sacrifice that for the gorgeous hi end sound.",

I can only comment on them via lightning of apple products and my comment is they\u2019re phenomenal.",

You may want to adjust the eq settings a bit for a higher low mid and bass and also some more treble to really improve it.",
