      "text": "Opening up the back cover was easy. Upgraded DRAM and SSHD. Installing the SSHD was a bit tricky due to very tight space. Experienced slow speeds on both WiFi and wired Ethernet in the beginning. Did a bit of research and found out Omen Command Center has a Network Booster setting that seems to throttle network traffics. After changing the Network Booster setting to Custom and set web browsers priority to High, I now got consistent maximum speeds from Speedtest.com and Fast.com from both WiFI and wired Ethernet. A bit confusing to start, but now this HP Omen is rocking.",

      "text": "Great specs for the price. I had bought a Helios 300 with similar specs that died in three days. This one has been much more reliable, and played most of my games on high/maxed out settings with a consistent 60fps. The Division 2 on Ultra looks and plays great. Great benchmarks on Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins as well. Still poking through a bunch of new games but it\u2019s been consistently rocking it. Dropped in a 2.5 inch SSD and 16GB of RAM tonight and getting to the internals was hassle-free. Highly recommended.",

When I open up for Ram upgrade , surprise, there is a two 4gb ram + 4gb ram on both slots no room for upgrade. I was planing to get 16gb upgrade but I got 12 Gb ram, 4Gb original + 8Gb purchased separately (4gb in garbage). BTW there is a room for 2.5\" HDD besides 256gb ssd, flex cable and hdd brackets are included. Why didn't mention that ? Nvidia G-sync is it crossed over, why? When it's absolutely compatible, just need a mini display port. Kind regards, Not satisfied Amazon customer",
