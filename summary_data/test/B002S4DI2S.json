After a year of regular use, the heat has caused the tank rim to start cracking. Pros: Water temp is precise and correct. Stainless thermal pot is high quality and keeps coffee not without venting flavor. For this money i expected much better engineering in a single purpose brewer.",

This makes excellent coffee with absolutely no bitterness. I use a little half-and-half in each cup to round out the flavor. Once you have the proportions to your liking, you'll never use any other coffee brewer. I had been using Tassimo latte with 2 shots of espresso. But the Moccamaster far surpasses that combo!

Only problem with this model is that the middle detent in the filter basket is pretty weak, so if you bump it accidentally it will move to full open or full closed. Full open not a problem, full closed can make for a surprising mess all over the kitchen counter. Still love it anyway!",

With fresh ground beans and filtered water the MoccaMaster makes a solid cup of coffee. It's extremely easy to clean and use and the coffee it makes has nearly the body and flavor of more manual methods like Aeropress or hand pourover. Definitely worth the investment if you're like me and want a good cup of coffee that you don't have to work so hard for.",

If you pt the other serving lid on the carafe it's too tall to fit back on the coffee maker. There's a detachable drip plate under the carafe that loosly clips onto the coffee maker, clearly an afterthought. The filter drips coffee even if the little drip lever is closed.",
