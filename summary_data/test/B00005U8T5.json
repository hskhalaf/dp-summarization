      "text": "I purchased this product with My own hard earned money to protect my infant. This review contains my thoughts and experience with the product. Purchased Aug 2019 Protecting a baby from possible electrocution is very very important. Their little fingers can fit into outlets. These outlet covers are designed to be difficult to get off unlike basic insert style covers. They are difficult to get off and it even takes me a few tries to get them off holding in the buttons for the release mechanism. I have the covers in place in the babies play area and bedroom where furniture isn\u2019t blocking an outlet.",

He hasn\u2019t figured out how to press the release buttons but he doesn\u2019t need to. He simply pulls on the outlet cover really hard and off it comes! I\u2019m very disappointed!

The problem this creates is that the top of the outlet cover can tilt out enough for fingers to grasp behind it to them have the surface area to pull hard enough to make it pop right off. So, it doesn't offer any more protection than other covers.",

In fact, I rarely have success getting them out, and usually rely on my hubby. I selected a few hard to reach outlets and put in different plugs that I can get out more easily, but have these deluxe ones in most all outlets.",

They are fine if you don't intend to use the outlet very often, or if you have Houdini Jr running around. We also have an older home, and these won't work in the two-prong outlets.",

It didnt look like the plug moved at all, but with my left hand still on the left button and holding the new \"pulled\" position, i inserted a screwdriver at the top to better push the plug out. Plug came off easily and I almost jumped with joy. Good luck!",

Yes, they do take a little work for an adult to remove- you have to kind of wiggle them out-but it is pretty simple. Overall a great no fuss product at a great price!",
