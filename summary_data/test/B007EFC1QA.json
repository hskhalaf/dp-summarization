I went to a cooking class and saw how many options crepes can be used for from snacks, desserts etc. After much research, I settled on the Le Creuset Cast-iron 10-2/3-inch Crepe Pan, Cherry Red which matched our kitchen. It is a little heavier so I would suggest doublechecking the weight and finding a comparable item to ensure you wouldn't have a problem lifting and using during crepe cooking.",
