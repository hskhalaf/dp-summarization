I purchased this belt thinking I would end up with the same quality that I have come to trust over the last ten + years of duty and carry but not so. This belt is thin and the clasps and buckles seem cheap. I think it would be okay if my expectation wasnt set so high by the belts I purchased so long ago.",

Only downside is that it makes one o'clock appendix difficult in regards to holster selection bc the belt doubles over after passing through the buckle and folding back over and this caused the holster to tilt forwards and pushed the grip into my concealement garment. However as a 3/4 o'clock CCW holster it's great.",

The belt is great as expected, solid webbing, double stitched. Obviously very durable. However, I have a 32\" waist and ordered a medium. The medium comes at 46\" long, leaving 14\" to wrap clear to my back. God help the guy who needs a rigger belt and also has to order the large. If you are an averaged size man, the small will more than suffice. The fuzzy part of the Velcro is 25.5\" and the hooked part of the Velcro is 4.25\". You can't cut and burn it. It will have to be returned.",
