Make sure to give them the serial number located on the back of the printer. They will send you a new set of 127 for free. Good luck. This printer is great, easy wireless setup. Mine is connected to my desktop using XP via wired internet cable and to a Mac laptop, vista laptop and window 7 laptop. All were easy to install with no problems. I was able to scan and print from all of them with ease.",

So not too bad with the exception of the scanner never working. The Epson was easy to set up with my XP laptop and desktop. I have a work laptop with Windows Vista on it, and there was some trouble there. I blame Vista since Vista operating system is horrible. So far printing has been very good. I have not had the opportunity to test the scanner, fax, or even copy something because I ran out of printer paper. But, I will update the review when I do those.",

It will only process 24 pound and heavier paper (it eats up the 20 pound paper), the nozzles require constant cleaning, it goes through a lot of ink (especially since the nozzles are needing to be cleaned a lot), and the ink has somehow gotten on the rollers and we have been unable to clean it off so roller marks show up on all the printed pages. The customer service department could not assist us at all. Even though it still technically works, we are tossing it and getting another brand.",

Also the instruction says to push either the color or B & W button, the same button appears for the fax as the copier, the first time I pushed the buttons on the copier side by mistake and a copy printed instead.",

Note that after it's all setup, on each computer open the Epson utility and check for driver updates. The print and scan drivers both needed updating from what was installed from the media.

Paper tray could be smoother to close around paper sizes, but it holds everything nicely in place. Envelope printing is flawless as well. Initial setup was a breeze, as the software guides you through the paces with relative ease. I chose to connect via the ethernet port, as my home network is hard wired. This was a huge selling point for me, being able to print from any computer in the house via my hard wire system. Few printers offer an ethernet port. Pros: Ease of setup Looks Small footprint USB, wireless, ethernet connections Print quality and speed Cons: None so far",

It prints wirelessly, scans wirelessly, including double sided scanning, crucial to me. I have not had it long, but the print quality is excellent and the scanning is a snap with an icon loaded right onto the desktop. Great product.",

Jacobi and Melissa Riofrio (March 28th, 2011) \n\n\n\n\nFast speeds for any small business or home office As the world's fastest all-in-one in both single- and two-sided printing1, the WorkForce 635 features ISO print speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black) and 7.2 ISO ppm (color), plus two-sided ISO print speeds of 7.5 ISO ppm (black) and 4.5 ISO ppm (color)\u2020. With the WorkForce 635, you get great quality, without sacrificing speed. The WorkForce 635 makes it easy to work more efficiently. With automatic, two-sided printing, you can easily save paper, without any user intervention. Or, use the built-in, 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan and fax stacks of one- or two-sided documents. Fax in as fast as 3 seconds per page, save up to 180 pages in memory, and store up to 60 numbers. With the included PC-Fax5, you can even send a fax right from your computer.

Use the front-side USB port on the printer to upload files from any thumb drive straight to your PC.\n\n\nAdditional features that save you time and money 127 Extra High-capacity Black ink cartridges are also available and give you about 2x more prints per cartridge2. So, you can print more and change cartridges less often. Plus, individual ink cartridges give you control over ink usage. Replace only the cartridge you need! The built-in, large paper tray holds up to 250 sheets of plain paper, so you don't have to interrupt your busy day to attend to your printer. Saving is easy with the WorkForce 635 \u2013 you save money and paper. In fact, with automatic, two-sided printing, you can save up to 50% of your paper supply.

See www.epson.com/mobileprinting for more information.\n\n\nThe new international ISO print speed standard Print speed is critically important when buying a printer or all-in-one. But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the \"MPG\" ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n * Save time \u2014 with the world's fastest all-in-one in both one- and two-sided printing1\n * Speed through critical documents \u2014 ISO print speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black) and 7.2 ISO ppm (color), two-sided print speeds of 7.5 ISO ppm (black) and 4.5 ISO ppm (color)\u2020\n * Save paper \u2014 save up to 50% of your paper supply with automatic, two-sided printing\n * Print twice as much \u2014 get about 2x more prints with 127 Extra High-capacity Black ink cartridges2\n * Individual ink cartridges \u2014 replace only the color you need\n * Less hassle \u2014 built-in 250-sheet paper tray means you re-load paper less often\n * Do more \u2014 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originals\n * Easy wireless printing \u2014 built-in Easy Epson Wi-Fi makes wireless setup, networking and printing fast and easy3\n * PC-Fax \u2014 fax documents directly from your computer5\n * Front USB port \u2014 insert thumb drive and upload files directly to your PC\n * High-speed faxing in black and color \u2014 as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pages\n * Protect important documents \u2014 smudge, fade and water resistant prints; documents rival those from a laser printer\n * Save energy \u2014 uses up to 70% less power than laser printers4\n * Product protection you can count on \u2014 one-year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product6; plus, get free templates and \"how to\" tutorials\n * Packaging Specifications (W x D x H) \u2014 Dimensions: Printing 17.6\" x 21.9\" x 9.1\", Storage 17.6\" x 14.2\" x 8.9\" and Weight 16.8 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * WorkForce 635 All-in-One\n * Instruction manual\n * CD-ROM with drivers and bonus software\n * Free sample paper pack\n * Power cord\n * Telephone cord\n * Four DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges:\n * Four 126-series Extra High-capacity ink cartridges: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)\n\nEPSON INK SUPPLIES\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Black ink cartridge (T126120)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Cyan ink cartridge (T126220)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Magenta ink cartridge (T126320)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Yellow ink cartridge (T126420)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Color Multipack (CMY) (T126520)\n\nEPSON PAPER SUPPLIES  * Premium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)\n * Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)\n * Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)\n * Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)\n * Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WORKFORCE SERIES\nEngineered for Business.

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nJon Konrath1.0 out of 5 stars Great replacement for my old HPReviewed in the United States on March 7, 2011Verified Purchase I've had an HP PhotoSmart C5280 for about three years, and I figured that I could either buy my next two ink refills, or just buy another printer that had more of the features I wanted. I've been pretty happy with this printer so far. I haven't used all of its features yet, but I immediately tried out the big differences to make sure this would be a winner for me.\n\nDouble-sided printing - The instruction manuals are not that clear on this, because they use the same one for all 63x printers. But this one DOES do double-sided printing. Just select the option in the print setup dialog box, and no crazy acrobatics are involved with printing the odd pages, then reloading the printed ones and printing the even pages. You just print, it goes, and will print on both sides of the page just like every book published in the last 600 years. Your paper bill has been halved, no questions asked.\n\nWifi - works awesome. I plugged in my router and password, and suddenly all of my Mac computers could see the Epson in their Bonjour print sharing.\n\nMac setup - I've got three Macs here, so I didn't want to get stuck with something that insisted on me running a SETUP.EXE file to print. No problems, though - I found the printer in Bonjour, and when I added it, it went and downloaded then installed a driver from Apple's web site. Within a couple of clicks, my OSX 10.6 machines were printing away. And when I went to Preview and did a File > Import from Scanner > Include Networked Devices, it magically saw the Epson and let me scan from it.\n\nADF - This thing has a document feeder, so you can just dump that pile of a dozen or two pages in the top and let it pull in each page as it scans. No more sitting around waiting for the page to scan so you can open the lid and drop in a new page. (You can open the scanner lid for your odd-sized items that don't fit in the ADF, like your butt.)\n\nThe only minus I see so far is that the paper tray isn't that great. It's one of those things where three sides of it have adjustable runners so if you're printing photos or your country's money still has a picture of a Queen on it and you have some weird metric paper, you can adjust. I wish it had a lock or something to keep it in the standard 8.5x11 configuration, because I will eventually load it up crooked and jam the thing.\n\n1/3/12 update: I've dropped my review to 1 and would drop it to zero, based solely on the piece of garbage tray. It is almost impossible to reload the tray in under 91724917 tries. There are two slides holding the paper. When you adjust one, you knock the other one out of adjustment. Readjust that one, you knock the other one. If you get both of them, there is a 99% chance the paper is loaded askew by about ten degrees. And the tray does not cleanly push into the printer. If you try to push too hard, it locks or freezes and you have to pull it out. There is a 100% chance when you pull it free, you will knock one or both slides out of place and have to start over. I am two seconds from going Office Space on this thing, and the only two things stopping me are that I just bought this, and I don't have a baseball bat in the house.Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Regular Joe4.0 out of 5 stars Solid Home Office All-In-OneReviewed in the United States on July 22, 2011Verified Purchase Our flatbed scanner died and my daughter's new MacBook Pro didn't support my ancient HP. Plus the kids were always whining about the slowness of the old HP. After much research I settled on the Epson Workforce 635 as the best balance of features for my needs. In particular, the things I like:\n\n- Fast start-up (typically the first page starts printing after 10 seconds of warm-up coming off a long idle period)\n- Plain text pages are printing about 20 per minute (haven't tried any pictures yet)\n- Duplex (2 sided) printing right out of the box\n- Drivers for Windows XP, Windows 7, the Mac and my kids iPhones (uses a free application not the \"cooler\" Airprint support by HP). The iPhone app was recently upgraded to support document printing in addition to pictures.\n- Duplex copier works as advertised and has a 30 page document feeder in addition to the flatbed scanner, I haven't tried the scan to PC feature or the FAX.\n\nThe printer supports wireless networking or hardwired Ethernet (it's either one or the other, you can't hook both networks up at the same time). I chose wireless so the kids could print from their iPhones. Set-up was painless and worked the first time.\n\nInk usage seems to be as advertised. I purchased extra cartridges just because another reviewer mentioned nothing on the printer works if any cartridge goes empty, but I'm still on the set that came with the printer.\n\nIf it lasts as long as my HP did, I'll be really happy (and no, the kids haven't stopped whining).Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Long-Suffering Technology Consumer4.0 out of 5 stars \"all-in-one\" no longer means \"none done well\"...Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2011Verified Purchase ...this all in one does an excellent job at all four of its tasks: printing, scanning, copying and faxing.\n\nWay back when, audiophiles were convinced of a direct relationship between the number of separate components you had and the quality of sound that came out of them. The concept of an \"all in one\" anything meant none of the functions would be done well. Nine years ago, when I bought my first inexpensive all in one, this old audiophile concept held up: it was pretty bad at all of its functions (print, scan, copy).\n\nGood news, everyone: those days are gone.\n\nThe Workmate 635 does all of four of its functions pretty well, and offers three connection options (USB, Ethernet and wireless). I chose Ethernet (to free up a rear USB port on the desktop it's paired with). It holds 250 sheets of paper, and lets you print from memory cards and make copies without being connected to a computer. This is the fastest inkjet printer I've ever used.\n\nImage scanning offers options to save as .jpg, .bmp, .pdf or .tif formats. Bundled OCR software allows you to scan text documents into editable Word and .pdf formats.\n\nTwo small things keep this from five stars: printing may be fast, but is also rather noisy...especially when printing text. Also, even though the included drivers on the installation CD claimed to have installed successfully, they did not. After visiting the Epson website, I was able to download the most current drivers, and then it installed fine.\n\nOverall, an excellent performer at this price.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States \n\n\nWHAT OTHER ITEMS DO CUSTOMERS BUY AFTER VIEWING THIS ITEM?\nPage 1 of 1 Start overPage 1 of 1 This shopping feature will continue to load items when the Enter key is pressed.

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the \"MPG\" ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n * Save time \u2014 with the world's fastest all-in-one in both one- and two-sided printing1\n * Speed through critical documents \u2014 ISO print speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black) and 7.2 ISO ppm (color), two-sided print speeds of 7.5 ISO ppm (black) and 4.5 ISO ppm (color)\u2020\n * Save paper \u2014 save up to 50% of your paper supply with automatic, two-sided printing\n * Print twice as much \u2014 get about 2x more prints with 127 Extra High-capacity Black ink cartridges2\n * Individual ink cartridges \u2014 replace only the color you need\n * Less hassle \u2014 built-in 250-sheet paper tray means you re-load paper less often\n * Do more \u2014 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of originals\n * Easy wireless printing \u2014 built-in Easy Epson Wi-Fi makes wireless setup, networking and printing fast and easy3\n * PC-Fax \u2014 fax documents directly from your computer5\n * Front USB port \u2014 insert thumb drive and upload files directly to your PC\n * High-speed faxing in black and color \u2014 as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 60 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pages\n * Protect important documents \u2014 smudge, fade and water resistant prints; documents rival those from a laser printer\n * Save energy \u2014 uses up to 70% less power than laser printers4\n * Product protection you can count on \u2014 one-year limited warranty; phone support, without charge, for the life of the product6; plus, get free templates and \"how to\" tutorials\n * Packaging Specifications (W x D x H) \u2014 Dimensions: Printing 17.6\" x 21.9\" x 9.1\", Storage 17.6\" x 14.2\" x 8.9\" and Weight 16.8 lb.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * WorkForce 635 All-in-One\n * Instruction manual\n * CD-ROM with drivers and bonus software\n * Free sample paper pack\n * Power cord\n * Telephone cord\n * Four DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges:\n * Four 126-series Extra High-capacity ink cartridges: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)\n\nEPSON INK SUPPLIES\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Black ink cartridge (T126120)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Cyan ink cartridge (T126220)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Magenta ink cartridge (T126320)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Yellow ink cartridge (T126420)\n * 126 DURABrite Ultra High-capacity Color Multipack (CMY) (T126520)\n\nEPSON PAPER SUPPLIES  * Premium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)\n * Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)\n * Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)\n * Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)\n * Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WORKFORCE SERIES\nEngineered for Business.
