I highly recommend these! I used to use a regular tennis ball, but these definitely make a difference and now these are all I use. Great value too!",

Aside from getting different shoes with more stability for my ankles, I needed something to help massage those overworked muscles. I really like that this set has a variety of sizes and hardness so that I can vary the pressure and coverage to suit the area I want to work on. I regularly go to a massage therapist who works on myofascial release and trigger point massage, but this gives me the ability to self-massage between appointments at my convenience. Try rolling the softer red spiky ball on the TOPS of your feet. Those muscles need attention too.",
