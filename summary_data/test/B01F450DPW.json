      "KEEP DRINKS COLD LONGER: The double-wall construction adds a layer of insulation between the inside and outside glass. So whether white wines are your jam or you prefer to fill them with hot coffee, these glasses keep your drinks hot or cold longer.",
      "MADE OF HANDBLOWN BOROSILICATE GLASS: They're pretty, but tough and durable too. While lighter and thinner than other glasses, they're made from hand-blown borosilicate glass and are built for everyday use. And they're dishwasher and microwave safe.",
      "CONDENSATION RESISTANT: The insulation effect of the double-wall design also enable the glasses to remain room temperature and resist the formation of condensation on the outside glass. So you won't have to worry about rings on your favorite table.",
