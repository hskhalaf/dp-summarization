I'm going to have to find a workaround, and I shouldn't have to. There is really no excuse for advertising expandable storage and then not letting people use it for apps. Ridiculous.

I don't think the bloatware is as much of a problem as some of the other reviewers. Just my opinion. It's just the right size for me. I agree that the battery life could be better. Using the display settings you can improve battery life. I'm happy with the tablet and would buy it again.",

It plays videos beautifully. The screen is amazing, no matter what angle you have it at you can see it perfectly. Go Asus for making such a nice product.",
