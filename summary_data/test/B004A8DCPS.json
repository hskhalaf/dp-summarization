But this time I bought it from Amazon and the eyeliner I received from the seller lasted 2 weeks (with normal use!). And I had bought 2 eyeliners with my purchase so it wasn't just an unlucky purchase where I somehow got a faulty one. Both eyeliners ran dry after 2 weeks each. Something's fishy from this seller. Definitely fishy if an eyeliner that normally can last 3-6 months now runs out after two weeks of daily use for very conservative and \"barely there\" eyeliner?!? I'm sticking to Sephora next time.",

In some cases, the tips of other brands dry out on the very tip and I have to cut them, which makes the tip fatter since I cut off the skinnier part. Highly recommend this color!",

Now, I have to go over the line 4 times for it to get as dark as one swipe of the real product. The tip is also starting to dry. With the actual Stila product it would last months.

Also, the eyeliner is kind of thin, and doesn\u2019t go on as boldly as liquid eyeliner in a \u201cinkwell\u201d format, or a cream/gel eyeliner in a pot applied with a brush.

It was a choice between this one and another and reviews -good and bad- were about the same on either product. I applied this eyeliner this morning at 6:30 AM and it's now 9:30 AM and most of it is gone. It's cold so there is no heat or sweating to cause it to melt off. Waste of money. I've had better luck with $7 store bought eyeliner.",

Also love the tip, which can give a thick or thin line, depending on angle of application. It's not a brush-type tip, I don't care for on my liquid liners. All day staying power, slightly wet look but dries quickly to semi-gloss. All in all one of the best liners on the market.",

I decided to take advantage of this deal of the day. I would have bought double and more colors, had I known I would love it so much! It glides on smoothly and effortlessly. It really does last all day, and sometimes it even looks fabulous the next morning! It does not flake off or look cake-y at all. You don't have to worry about raccoon eyes if you cry or have allergic, watery eyes. I hope they make this another deal of the day again soon, because I'll be stocking up!",

Am very surprised at the number of glowing reviews I gave it two stars because it is easy to apply (though not so if you want a thicker line) and it's very neat to use. At the price, I wish I'd gotten my money back.",

I had to work with it for a while and keep adding layers. Once I did, it stayed put for over 12 hours. The deep teal color is vibrant and beautiful.
