It takes a few more turns to cut pipe vs. the larger and much heavier cutter, but that was to be expected and is not a problem. A couple items of note to clarify conflicting info in the Q & A and Reviews sections: - The 104 does not come with a spare cutting wheel. - The 104 does not have notched rollers. What else can I say? I love all my Ridgid wrenches and cutters.",

It fits in tight spaces and makes nice, clean cuts. It does take a good 2 minutes to cut a pipe with a fair share of manual turning. And so if I had a lot of cuts to make in non-constricted areas, I'd likely use something else. But given expected limited use of this tool, it seems right for all of my applications.
