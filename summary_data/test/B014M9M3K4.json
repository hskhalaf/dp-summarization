      "text": "I had tried several other tools to break through the hard, compacted earth in my new home's back yard and none of them could make more than a dent in the earth. While I've just discovered exactly how out of shape I am, this pick axe sunk deep into the earth with my first swing, almost effortlessly! Even when it wound up stuck under, or even IN large roots, I was able to pry them out of the earth as well without the slightest hint of complaint from the pick axe itself. And the flat blade was actually able to chop completely through the roots which would normally take me several swings with a hatchet! I'm genuinely impressed.",

This pickaxe, I planted an adult tree in a half hour. 1 callous. 1 big grin on my face. It's awesome! Feels sturdy, doesn't transfer shock, and digs like no ones business. I love it!",

My yard has been taken over by a grass that grows in huge, well-rooted clumps that can reach heights of six or seven feet during rainy summer months. I gave myself sciatica last year, trying to dig them out using a sharpened spade (during their winter dormant season), which was slow, exhausting, and largely futile. This year, however, my new Fiskars mattock actually made the chore EASY! Yes, it was work, but not exhausting, and with no sciatica. I am so glad that I invested in this high-quality tool.

As I held it in my hands, I felt a tingle in my chest like non other. My wife gasped in delight as I transformed from a modern day man - to a rugged burly miner! I instantly knew I had purchased the Pickaxe of all Pickaxes. (Review by the Husband of account holder)",
