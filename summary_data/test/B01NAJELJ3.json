You can even put a full size NFL ball inside for autographs or four smaller balls which I did. Strap is adjustable and even as a large man, it worked across body. I liked the zippered top feature which will help keep your stuff dry as it did when we had a slight rain the evening of the Enshrinement ceremony. No problems getting through game day security at the stadium. Had several people stop and ask where I purchased my bag. Definitely a great buy!!",

Pros: But it's cheap, and the shoulder strap works, and it seems as good, if not better, than anything else I saw on Amazon for what it's designed to do",

I'm so glad I chose this bag with the cross-body length strap because hands free in a crowded stadium is always a good thing! I rated 3 of 5 stars for traveling because I would want a smaller zippered compartment if I were flying or taking a train- the bag is really roomy and I would want somewhere to tuck smaller items. For my purposes (metal concert and Drum Corps show) the bag has been perfect.",

The military security guard told us that he really appreciates when people use the clear bags, because he just has to turn them around to check all sides, rather than digging through them. The zippered top keeps items secure. I like that it has a zipper pull on each side of the bag. I also like the detachable shoulder strap. My husband in particular appreciated that, as he didn't want to carry a \"purse\". Two bags for the price was an excellent deal.",
