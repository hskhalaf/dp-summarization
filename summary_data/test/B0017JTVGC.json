Additionally, since we have a dark brown/black door, we spray painted it black so it wouldn't stick out. With the instructions they provided, our dog learned to use it within an hour. What really helped was taping one of the flaps up at first so she could get used to going through just one flap. Our tape didn't hold and by the following morning the second flap had dropped but she went through it anyway. So nice not having to wait at the door while she does her business!",

The magnetic double flap system works amazingly well and there is no draft. I recommend running a thin bead of silicone around the edges inside, outside and the overlapping seam between the inside and outside pieces (all the way around, between the flaps) but that is almost overkill. My dog is a 32 pound border collie and the extra large is a perfect size for her.",

I think I had to order an XL because they don't have a large, it was still smaller than my last door (about 4 inches narrower and 2 inches shorter). My 35# wheaten can still fit through it easily (she is tall but narrow), but it's too narrow for a person to fit through. This will hopefully keep us much warmer in the winter, my last one would swing right out at the slightest breeze which was not great for a New England winter.",

The Medium size is perfect for our 40lb sheltie (a *large* sheltie ?mix?). You wouldn't imagine he could fit through it, based on the flap size specs, but he barrels though the door at break-neck speed out to the backyard, so it must be plenty big. The Small size is perfect for our cat, without allowing the sheltie access to cat-only areas.",
