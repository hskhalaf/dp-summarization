Wanted a ball that wasn\u2019t like all the other teams. This one fit the mark. It was also a Mikasa. I played water polo with only Mikasas so it just felt right. The volleyball is a volleyball. Unique, durable, comfortable... most importantly it\u2019s different from all the Wilson and Spalding balls popping around. We aren\u2019t doing much better with this ball but we at least look legit when we show up for our matches.",

It is a little harder to set than other beach balls in my opinion, but it also is significantly more water resistant than the other balls and, unlike some other beach balls (*cough* Spalding King of the Beach *cough*), this ball has stayed in a spherical shape. Others whom I play with, particularly those who are more focused on offense (I am mainly a defensive player) have complained that it \"feels\" more like an indoor ball than an outdoor ball, so there is that potential downside.",
