DoMatcha ranks the second with a bit flatter body. Kenko is the most flat, a bit watery.",

It's pretty pricey, but it's ceremonial grade quality and you can tell it's up to standard so I don't mind paying ~$50 for 60 g. I tried it hot and iced side by side and both offer very different, but fantastic teas. The hot one was smooth, creamy, and very balanced. The iced was a bit frothier because I shook it in a protein bottle shaker and it was definitely on the more floral side probably because it didn't hit hot water?",

It didn\u2019t mix in. Then when I started drinking I noticed a bitterness that even cut through the creamer I use.

It has half the amount of one cup of coffee but the L-theanine in it makes for a much mellower and prolonged focus. I've tried a few matcha brands, but keep coming back to Encha. Great quality and taste. They routinely offer a gratitude program for 15% off that is hard to beat.",

All those benefits in such a small amount. I add a teaspoon of erythritol in mind since I like sweet. You must be used to having some type of green drink. It\u2019s so beneficial and helps so much!!

I drink it every morning instead of coffee now, and sometimes as a pick me up in the afternoon- it doesn't keep me up at night like coffee or black tea.

It's a small packet, but I only drink it twice a week or so, and it's been lasting me awhile now. It seems to be the smoothest I've tried. I drink it with a little honey and a lot of frothed almond milk, and it's a fabulous treat (and keeps me awake for a full day's work).",

I do like the flavor better with the Jade Leaf matcha powder as this encha brand leaves a little bit of an unpleasant aftertaste. It's not the prevalent, so it may not be a big deal to most. It is definitely comparable with other high-quality matcha brands.",
