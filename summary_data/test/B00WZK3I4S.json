I opened the package to find a 9 3/4\" diameter server and the wood it self is only 1/2 thick and with the feet on the bottom it still only measured 1 1/2\" not the 1 3/4\" stated in the ad.",

I wish this came in a few different sizes - I would definitely buy a set. Perfect for fall/winter entertaining. I bought it specifically for a fall-themed Sip and See for a new baby, but will also be using it for Thanksgiving and Christmas parties for sure.",
