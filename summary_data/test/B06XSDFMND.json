I was sceptical about the Samsung AC 1300 but decided to give it a try. Had some difficulty with connecting one of the units, called Samsung and the lady guided me and problem was quickly resolved. This system does everything it claims. I now have excellent wifi (over 100 Mbps) throughout the house, no need to change wifi networks, all the 4K TVs are smiling sharp. The Samsung Connect app works great as a hub. I highly recommend this product.",

Also, it says that this mesh network works as an extension of your smartthings hub, but it does not extent zigbee nor zwave devices. I primarily bought this so that zwave devices that are far away from my hub would work, but it doesnt help that at all. I'll likely return it and just buy some zwave wall switches Instead. I think the advertisement for what this product does is misleading...",

This became a particular nuisance as I started purchasing smart home devices. The Connect Home system improved my wifi to perfection and simplified my smart devices and Alexa control. It also allowed me to integrate my z-wave devices that I had already, but couldn't integrate with the other smart devices until I got this.",
