The Bluetooth charging port is a bit tricky to find but it\u2019s nice because it\u2019s not in the way. It\u2019s at the back side of the helmet under the padding. I broke the cover off right away but it\u2019s nothung important. Ordered a little bit darker visor but with the drop down inside visor I might not need it. Overall I\u2019m happy with it. Haven\u2019t used the Bluetooth yet but will update later.",

Pause us talking and go right back to listening to music. It might just be my head but after a while of riding in new hampshire my helmet felt loose. Loose to the point of it moving around and bouncing and making a bump on my head haha. So go down a size if you can, my head may just be in between sizes. It's an easy fix for me, I just put on a bandana. If your not sure to buy it or not, I feel like it's a steal for the price. \ud83d\ude01Happy riding!",

Quite a bit of wind noise, so if you\u2019re on the highway, you won\u2019t really hear anything over the crappy speakers. The padding isn\u2019t very good either. It\u2019s not dense enough or something. The helmet gets looser and looser as you\u2019re wearing it. Wore it once on a 900 mile trip. Big mistake.",

The sizing guide is spot on I myself have a 57 in head and even though it fits snug all helmets will at first until the pads relax more. This type of helmet is great for long road trips where you just wanna ride and enjoy your music! Will definitely buy another helmet in the future for my wife!",
