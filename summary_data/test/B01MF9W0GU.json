I needed a device with physical buttons, affordable with a bright and responsive screen and the Sony has it all. I was particularly worried about the resistive touch but I am glad I got this. I had it professionally installed in an 09 Hyundai Tuscon with a backup camera and they are working perfectly. I live in Cape Town and the sun is very bright in summer but I can still see my screen. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and hope it continues to perform at this level.",

Nice simple and functional software - kind of like Apple does things - not gimmicky. One thing I like is there are good shortcuts - including a quick way to shut the screen off for night driving. It comes back on as soon as you hit a button. I also liked being able to shut off the silly guide lines on the reverse backup screen. Hooked mine up to a power amp and a sub and it sounds absolutely great. Outstanding unit.",

Unfortunately, the FM Stations stopped coming in clearly a few weeks ago, so I tore out the dash and checked to see if the antenna lead had shaken loose. Sadly - nope, AM works but FM I get no reception for any stations, just weak signal and static. Any ideas on why the FM stopped working? If the FM worked its and easy 5 star unit.",

You even have to dismiss it before you can change the radio station using your steering wheel controls. So the message is distracting in itself. It drives me so insane it makes me regret buying this unit altogether. On a more minor gripe, it takes something like 15 seconds to boot up which can get annoying when you want to set something before setting off. I like most other things about the unit, but the warning message really destroys my enjoyment of the unit.",

Initially I had a different brand unit for navigation but in many ways this head unit is far better. The Bluetooth works well with my phone for calls and streaming and the sound is just fantastic even with my stoc speakers. Really blew me away with the quality. IMO it's worth it just for that and android auto completes the deal",

Otherwise it was a glitchy unit. when listening to FM, it kept switching to camera input and saying nothing was there. Hopefully the next one will be acceptable. I also updated the firmware before I installed it in the car, so this one just seemed to have problems.",
