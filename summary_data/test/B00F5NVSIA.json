What sold it for me is seeing photos of reviewers with black spots, which I thought were the blackheads being pulled out. So I bought it, and the item arrived in 3 days. It spreads evenly, looks like any other clay mask. Thos blackheads being pulled out? Turns out they are parts of the volcanic lava sediment bursting. Um...ok. But the cooling effect is LOVELY. Washes off like a regular clay mask. After patting my face dry, I look at my t-zone. Matte, but not dry & ashy. My blackheads are clear! And the cooling effect lingers. Love it.",

      "text": "The bottle isn't that sanitary so you definitely need an applicator when applying it (don't use your fingers!) and if washed off incorrectly, it can cause pores to clog. I've used it twice now, and the first time was AMAZING, it reduced the inflammation of my acne and reduced the appearance of blackheads. However, upon the second usage, I actually ended up getting a pimple. Make sure you exfoliate after use to make sure you get all of the mask out.",

I was originally interested in it for its claims of cleansing naturally yet gently, but my favorite thing is how it tightens the pores! I had one large pore on my nose, and after using this (even just once) there was a very noticeable size difference. It now looks like I am wearing a pore diminishing makeup, even when I am bare skined. It also cleansed both gently and without irratation which is great for someone with sensitive allery ridden skin like me. I know this product is pricey (especially on a college budget) but it is worth every penny!",
