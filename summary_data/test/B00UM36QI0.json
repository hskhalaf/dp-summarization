For years I have kept a small inventory of extra long shoe horns to donate to offices where they want your shoes off (sometimes with everything else!), but do not offer assistance with putting them back on. These are the best that I have found in that they are inexpensive, durable, nice looking and the handle is a plus. Although made of plastic, they seem like they will last.....if the offices don't let them go out the door with the patients and customers.",

It has gotten to the point that it would be easer to do so if I had a long handled shoe horn. I took a measurement to see how long it needed it to be and these are the right length and price, besides I got two so I can have one upstairs and one down.",

Since it comes in a pair, I have one in the mud room and one in the house by the entrance door on a command and every one now uses it! Cheeky baggers! Lol! Awesome product and sturdy. Just place it at the back of the shoe, slip your foot in and go! No bending down. Love it!!!",

Not sure what size foot they were trying to squeeze into what size shoe, but unless the shoehorn had a defect, I can not see how the plastic would split with normal use. The ONLY DRAWBACK is the handle is oval instead of round so it DOES NOT hang over the doorknob. I'll have to add something to make it hang. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone.",
