It works really well as long as the sun shines brightly and you keep it oriented towards it, like at a perfect angle. Clouds did affect charging and it would stop completely but the sun was not always very high up in the sky due to the northern latitude so I'll give it a pass on that. It worked great for me.",

Doing so will overheat the solar panel.

Plug in up to two devices at once and let Nature take care of the rest.\n\nSmaller, Yet Powerful A lightweight portable device that will be no nuisance during your most adventurous treks. Hook it up to your backpack, tent, or up the nearest tree, and make sure to get as much power out of the sun as possible. The ideal choice for camping, hiking, cycling, and any other outdoor activity where fun matters and running out of power cannot be a concern.\n\nCharge Smarter The advanced combination of iSmart and Smart IC technologies will detect all connected devices' individual input and distribute the total output accordingly to the appropriate charge they can benefit from.
