They fit very much like athletic shoes. A little stiffer of course. But not too stiff. I didn't even have to break them in. Very comfortable. Right amount of cushioning and support. And my feet never felt cramped even after spending an entire day in them.",

It appears the glue problem with the sole was stopped by additional layers of glue further down.

The first pair of shoes I've had that held the arch in my foot so well. Also, from looking at the shoes you wouldn't think they were 100% water-proof, but I have tested them and they are definitely water-proof. My feet have never been so happy in a pair of shoes/boots. The tread is great on the soles as well. I haven't been hiking in them yet but I plan on doing some hiking soon. But from what I can tell so far, they won't have any issues in the field.",

Time will tell how well they hold up but they seem well made and I'm looking forward to years of service.",

It is hard to say this early on if they are durable but so far so good. I will update if things change.",

I walked a quick 3 miles, and have only one concern, the boots are little difficult to tighten at the top. The lacing system is such that it is a little difficult to keep the laces snug at the top of the boots. Other than that the fit and feel are exceptional. I will update if any issues arise, but I looked a long time before pulling the trigger on these over other brands. I think I have a winner.",
