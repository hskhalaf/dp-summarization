Pros: - Fast response time - HDR looks gorgeous - Screen size is perfect if sitting 3-4 ft away - LG had gamers in mind when creating this beauty. Cons: - Owned the unit for less than 24 hours and it developed a small group of dead pixels in the center of screen. Amazon handled the situation professionally. I had Amazon exchange the unit because I believe the picture quality this unit provides is worth it. Contacted LG initially with the issue and they weren\u2019t willing to provide quick turn times and customer service was unpleasant. Thank you Amazon for being uber awesome as always.",

On X1X Tomb Raider looks fantastic and is noticeably different on the different graphics options. I love that the screen goes completely vertical as well! Gunbird for Nintendo Switch is a blast vertical as well as Namco Museum. All in all definitely worth the money spent. Won\u2019t be looking for another monitor anytime soon!",

      "text": "Pros: The 4K picture quality is great. Very simple to make adjustments using the \"joy stick\" located on the bottom of the monitor. Using it with a MacBook Pro. Connection was simple. I purchased (separately) a Display Port Adapter capable of supporting 4K resolution rather than use the provided HDMI. Do yourself a favor and spend $15 on that cable. Cons: Cosmetically: The monitor has a white plastic back rather than a black plastic back which I don't particularly like, but I knew that going into the purchase. Functionally: There are no USB ports on the back of this monitor which would have been really handy.",

Anyway, the docking station/DP is fine with 2 other laptops. The 9 year old desktop (now retired and recycled) could only manage 1080 resolution which looked horrible on this monitor.",

I havent really noticed a latency issue in terms of gtg refresh rate, its been solid in games like destiny, rocket league, fallout 76 ( if it doesnt bug out hint hint Bethesda) skyrim looks incredible though. Cant wait for whatever elder scrolls they're currently working on. Huge fan of the series. Anyway anthem looked good on the monitor. Its capable of 4k at 60hz. But the monitor is locked at 60hz for anything. I think. I'm still learning. Good monitor though. Worth it",
