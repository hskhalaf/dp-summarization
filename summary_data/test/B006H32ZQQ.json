So you have to hunt to find wrestling shoes that fit those with wide feet. After trying a number of shoes we found these. We still had to buy 1 1/2 size up - my son usually wears size 7 sneakers and we ordered 8 1/2s - but he can get the ball of his foot into the shoe and it fits comfortably.",

Summary: I recommend the Dan Gable Ultimate 4 over Split Second 9 because of the superior traction, flex and ankle support (though not as good for wide feet). If your on a budget, than the split second 9 is a great choice. The Dan Gable also was more of a moccasin style having no actual toe box.",

Only then does the tread on the shoes feel less than adequate. In the ring, the shoes feel great. I can pivot without shifting my center of balance dramatically, and for jumping rope the additional flexibility in the sole is crucial. They also help out with pushups and quick pivoting immensely. The tread on the toe gives you great grip to take off on sprints, and your ankles feel very secure.",

I found out later most wrestling shoes run small, unless you can find wide. He returned them and is ordering a larger size, which are also wide width. They are exellent quality and they match his school colors. Returns are so easy with Amazon, it wasn't a problem. I also enjoyed the sale price. Stellar shoes !! Thanks, Amazon",

They seriously need to fix the sizes on these.",

His wrestling season was only 3.5 weeks long; by the end, there was some wear on the shoes at the \"bendy\" spots. I'm a little disappointed at that, but when I look at how much some people spend on wrestling shoes, it is clear you get what you pay for. I'm just not ready or willing to spend upwards of $150 for shoes that will only fit my kid for MAYBE two seasons.",
