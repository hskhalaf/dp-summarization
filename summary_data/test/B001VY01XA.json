Toyota makes a synthetic (Type IV) for 2003 and later and doesn't recommend using Type IV in a 2002. This makes the Mobil 1 synthetic ATF a perfect fit. It's well worth the price! BTW: If you are switching from a non synthetic, especially if your old ATF is brown, I would strongly urge you to do a 12-16 quart flush using the cooler lines. This will ensure you have a clean install.",

Here in the desert climate, the extra protection against heat build-up will help my transmission run cooler and last longer -- and when I go to the cold country, the synthetic fluid will flow properly at extremely cold temps, too. Amazon's price was lower than the local parts/speed shops -- it's a no-brainer!!",
