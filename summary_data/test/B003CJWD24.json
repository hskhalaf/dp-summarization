If you have wayfarer sunglasses go with the original size and thanks to the other reviewers who said they would fit because they do and they are thinner behind the ear on the earpiece than the large version.

When I took this off my sunglasses, it pulled the rubber comfort pads on the ear section out of their housing a bit. I was able to push the pads back into the grooves, so no permanent damage done. But with repeated on/off, it might eventually tear or disfigure the rubber enough to ruin them.",

I wasn't surfing or doing anything crazy with them, just going to work and normal daily activity. Finally I got sick of their unreliance and looked for a reliable switch. These Chums have no plastic attachments, so nothing to break - they just pop on the glasses ends very easy, and mine haven't had any problems like slipping off or anything.

I have not used it in a water environment, so I can't speak to the dye bleeding. However, the cotton is good quality so I kind of doubt they will bleed turquoise on your neck - but that's just a guess.",
