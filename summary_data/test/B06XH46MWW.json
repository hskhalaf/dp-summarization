I finally gave up and plugged my Surfboard back in, which worked perfectly fine. I cannot be certain as to whether this was an issue with the modem or an issue with Xfinity. I'll add that the Surfboard is built like a tank, though similar in size. The Netgear unit is lightweight, bordering on flimsy. Both are only DOCSIS 3.0, despite the Surfboard being years older.",

Original review: It was perfect for the first two weeks, but since then, modem keeps resetting once or twice a day, usually at very bad times. Its pretty irritating.
