      "text": "So far, I have only owned this camera for a day. i owned a LUMIX 10 MP camera and an 8. The 8 died on me, so I decided to upgrade. I was not crazy about the rechargeable batteries, but i bought two spares and I intend to buy a car charger as well. This camera works nice, it is smaller in size than my other two LUMIX. What I like best about LUMIX is the LEICA lense. This camera takes nice close ups and has decent zoom features.",

Have had it over a year now and still in great shape. Works great and takes good photos too. One of the better digital cameras weve owned and being small with 16.1 MP is awesome. Easy photo tansfer to computer. Easy to figure out camera settings too.",

Those printed using the Panasonic are far less than desirable for me; grainy. They look alright in the camera if that's the only record you are looking for. I guess for the money, I didn't make a big mistake. But, if I had a way to try before I buy, I would not have bought!",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH5 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n FH5 \n\nPanasonic LUMIX FH5\nThe ultra-compact 16.1 megapixel LUMIX DMC-FH5 features newly-developed retractable, high-quality 28mm wide-angle LEICA DC lenses with a 4x optical zoom. With the new retractable lens, the LUMIX FH5 has approximately 20% slimmer profile than its predecessor, while maintaining exceptional performance. LUMIX DMC-FH5 also record 1280 x 720p High Definition (HD) video. \n\nVenus Engine VI\nThe high-speed, high-performance Venus Engine VI is incorporated in the DMC-FH5 to enable the recording of beautiful images with higher quality signal processing including the Intelligent Resolution technology. An advanced noise reduction system in the Venus Engine VI applies noise reduction (NR) to luminance noise and chromatic noise separately. As a result, beautiful images with minimal noise can be reproduced all the way up to ISO1600 high sensitivity at full resolution for beautiful night shots or dimly lit indoor shots. \n\n\n\n\n\niA (Intelligent Auto) Mode\nWhen you don't know which mode will give you the best shooting results, or when a sudden photo opportunity pops up and you don't have time to change any settings, simply choose the iA (Intelligent Auto) Mode and let the camera do it all for you. You just choose the iA Mode, aim at your subject, and shoot. Six detection and correction functions are simultaneously activated to optimize the settings so you get stunning photos every time. In addition, the Intelligent Resolution technology is always activated in the iA Mode which results in clearer and higher image quality in every photo with extended zoom range equivalent to 5x by the Intelligent Zoom.\n\n\n\n\nMEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) Shake Detection\nThe MEGA O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)* in the DMC-FH5 compensates for the blurring caused by hand-shake. Even slight hand-shake movement is accurately detected by a sampling frequency of 4,000 times per second, and compensated to produce sharp, clear images. The Venus Engine VI controls the shifting of the blur-stopping lens with even greater precision to further increase the detection accuracy and correction effect of MEGA O.I.S. It lets you shoot in dimly lit rooms or evening illumination to preserve the mood, and works for macro shots and zoom shots, which are especially susceptible to hand-shake. In short, it lets anybody take beautiful, blur-free shots with ease.\n\n* MEGA O.I.S. is automatically turned on in iA Mode and can be turned on or off in Normal Picture Mode or some Scene Modes. \n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent ISO Control Motion Detection\nThe Intelligent ISO Control function* in the DMC-FH5 made possible by the Venus Engine VI detects subject movement and automatically adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed to best suit the movement and lighting conditions. When it detects subject motion, it automatically raises the ISO setting and increases the shutter speed to prevent motion blur. On the other hand, when the subject is still and no movement is detected, it takes beautiful natural photos with a low ISO setting. The Intelligent ISO Control gives you stunning images with ease because there is no need for complicated settings. \n* The Intelligent ISO Control function is automatically turned on in iA Mode, and can be turned on or off in Normal Picture Mode. \n\n\n\n\n\nFace Detection AF/AE\nThe Face Detection AF/AE function*1 detects faces and automatically optimizes the focus and exposure settings. It prevents the blurry faces that happen when the camera focuses on something in front of or behind the subject, and keeps faces from appearing dark when shooting indoors or against the light source. It detects up to 15 faces at a time, making it extremely convenient for group photos. Once the camera detects a face, Face Tracking follows it even when the subject moves around. Plus, the system keeps detection on if a face turns sideways to the camera. The DMC-FH5 is also equipped with Digital Red-eye Correction (Red-eye Removal). The camera takes care of the red-eye effect that often happens when shooting with a flash, to ensure attractive facial expression*2 \n*1 Face Detection function is automatically turned on in iA Mode and can be turned on or off in Normal Picture Mode or some Scene Modes.\n*2 Digital Red-eye Correction must be turned ON in the menu prior to use.\n\n\n\n\nIntelligent Scene Selector Scene Detection\nWith the camera in iA Mode, the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically sets the Scene Mode to one of Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait*1, Night Scenery or Sunset. The camera judges it from the various detection results such as focusing and brightness level of the circumstance*2. You are free from choosing different settings every time the scene changes when taking images with these frequently used Scene Modes to get beautiful results.\n*1 In iA Mode, Night Portrait is not identified when the flash is turned off.\n*2 With some subject and shooting conditions, it is just not possible to judge the best shooting details. When this happens, it is recommended that you shoot with the Scene Mode that best suits your purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7-inch, 230,000-dot High-resolution LCD\nThe DMC-FH5 large 2.7-inch LCD features high 230,000-dot resolution Intelligent LCD. It automatically adjusts the brightness in 11 steps according to shooting conditions. This LCD provides sharp, clear images in virtually all shooting situations, ranging from nighttime to bright daylight scenes. And it lets you share the fun of viewing images with family and friends.
