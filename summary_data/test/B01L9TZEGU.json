The battery is super large and the battery-holding pocket is in the back. So its uncomfortable to sit at all times. The bigger battery does not produce a larger amount of heat. Also just the jacket itself feels like wearing cardboard b/c it doesn't move like clothes (rigid). I'm still very cold when wearing it its like having no jacket on at all. NO insulation.",
