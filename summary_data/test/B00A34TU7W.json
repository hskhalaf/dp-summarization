Some reviewers said that these earphones need a better source than an iPhone, that is not true. Some people say these need an amplifier. I tried that but it was not necessary. If you can afford the best, these are worth it but don't get conned by fakes. Only buy an unopened box and verify the code on the box with Sennieser website. My new iPhone 6+ seems to have a better DAC than the 6, maybe I had a duff one with that.",

Slightly high on bass though but i actually like it that way. I cant put these down amazing sound and comfort. If u truley love your music and have that extra cash just go with the ie800. You wont regret.",
