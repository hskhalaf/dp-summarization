Do yourself a favor, look up the best or most useful apps for Nexus 4 on the internet and download the ones that suit you. Another tip: Take advantage of the folder option - group similar apps together (photography, navigation, files, communication, social networking, hobbies, health...) for a well-organized phone that works for you and makes your life so much more organized. Very soon you will be wondering how people without this phone manage anything!",

A UK USB plug was supplied within the Amazon packaging which is good however it was a Samsung branded once whilst this phone is from LG. This shouldn't matter but isn't what I expected. Unfortunately my device was faulty and an area of the screen did not work correctly so it has now been sent back. I expect this to be just unfortunate rather than anything to do with the supplier and Amazon have taken it back without any issue. From using other Nexus 4s I can say it is a great device but I was unlucky with this purchase.",
