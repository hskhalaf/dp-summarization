I cleaned the counters and stone backsplash thoroughly, let them dry. Then, instead of spraying, I poured some of the sealant out on the counter. I applied it with one clean microfiber cloth, timed 2 minutes, then buffed with a new cloth. I waited 2 hours and repeated on both the counters and backsplash. I think that it did the trick. I know now how they should feel, so I'll see how long the sheen and protection last. They really look new, and they are very smooth and silky to the touch.",

It gives you the most smooth and polished finish ever. With such little elbow grease. My granite counters were rough and water stained and tall. After just one application of this, the shine and luster and smoothness is restored. I am absolutely amazed. I highly recommend this product and this will be my go to for granite polishing.",

One spot in the counter had been covered up with a cutting board since new, and it looks a lot shinier than the newly sealed/polished surfaces. Hmmm.",

I am very happy with this product and feel confident my new granite will remain as beautiful in the future as it is today.",

      "\u2705 Do the Water Test - The best test to see if your granite needs to be sealed is to put drops of water in certain sections of your granite and wait 30 minutes. If the granite absorbs the water, you need to reseal. If not, your granite is protected. However, we still recommend using the Granite Sealer at least once a month to prevent stains from happening in the future.",
