If you are comfortable with Pilates and using a Reformer solo, this machine is great given the price point. Every time I look at it, I fall in love. I subscribe to the website Pilates Anytime and do rigorous workouts. Their are some advanced moves you will be unable to do (like Snake) - but you won't feel like you are missing out on performing different positions. After paying $110 for private sessions for years, buying this Reformer made complete sense. Very happy with this purchase.",

I am one of thousands who had complications from a metal on metal hip replacement, and I needed to continue strengthening after I left PT. This machine requires some assembly, but the directions are decent. The construction is very strong and the machine works well. Because it is a lower-priced model than some of the $3500 models with springs, it has elastic bands like bungee cords for resistance. It's not as good as springs, but you get used to it and it's effective. If you need a Pilates Reformer and you can't pay thousands, this is a good machine. It has helped me continue my recovery.",

Otherwise, the machine is awesome. I do not care for the dvd's that came with this. They move too fast for me and then trying to fuss with the remote to stop so you can finish and then re-start is just cumbersome.

    "title": "AeroPilates Pro Reformer with Free-Form Cardio Rebounder",
    "description": "AeroPilates \nWhen Stamina Products and Marjolein Brugman developed the first in-home Pilates reformer, it was groundbreaking. Previously, reformer Pilates was only available at Pilates studios, and that was pricey. The inception of the AeroPilates reformer made it easy for anyone anywhere to get a gentle, low-impact, total-body strengthening workout. But AeroPilates is more than a machine; it\u2019s a lifestyle. \nBenefits of AeroPilates \nThe benefits of AeroPilates are numerous. Our patented Reformer technology will give you the best Pilates workout you\u2019ve ever had. Some of the benefits include: \n\n * Low-Impact and Easy on Joints\n * Total-Body Workout\n * Mental Clarity\n * Easy to Use\n * Tones and Strengthens\n * Increases Endurance\n * Over 300 Possible Exercises\n * Increased Mobility and Flexibility\n * Fixes Imbalances\n\n\nBut perhaps the best part of AeroPilates is how fun it is. When exercise routines become boring and stale, they can be hard to stick to. You won\u2019t have this problem with AeroPilates \nThe Patented Cardio Rebounder \nAeroPilates isn\u2019t just a way of strengthening; it provides a means for no-impact cardio with the patented Cardio Rebounder. Stamina was the first to develop this rebounder, which allows you to jog and jump while laying down on the reformer. We are the only company to sell it with home reformer units, and we allow one commercial company to use the technology as well. It sounds easy, but it\u2019s actually quite the workout. If fact, your heart rate while using the rebounder will be higher than with a treadmill or elliptical. This makes it easy to stay in that fat-burning zone while also increasing your cardiovascular endurance. \nWhy AeroPilates? \n\nWith a proper diet and regular use of AeroPilates, you can achieve the stronger, leaner physique you\u2019ve been dreaming of. As we\u2019ve mentioned, the exercises are extremely low-impact, even on the Cardio Rebounder. For people who are worried about exercise causing them to bulk up, rather than slim down, AeroPilates is a solution for that too. The resistance is light, and you use your own body weight, so the results will be lean muscle while losing fat. This leads to a stronger, healthier you. Also when compared to a Pilates mat, which allows you to do about 50 different exercises, a reformer allows you to do over 300! This will keep you motivated and it will prevent your body from becoming familiar with the motions, leading to better results. Finally, you\u2019ll find that along with your newly toned body and your additional strength, you\u2019ll be much more flexible and mobile. By using an AeroPilates reformer combined with a healthy diet, you can be healthier, stronger, leaner, and more limber than ever before.",
