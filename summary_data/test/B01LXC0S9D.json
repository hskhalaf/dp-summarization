This is fine, since I like to be able to layer socks inside for him, and MAYBE they'll fit next winter also. He says his feet are warm and dry and we've had a very cold and snowy winter this year. The laces loosen up enough to make it easier to put the boots on and take them off. The boots meet my expectations, and I would probably order them again.",
