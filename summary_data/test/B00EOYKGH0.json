Tuning Pegs have to be pushed in very hard in the Peg Box. Every new violin has to be plaid longer to develop a better sound. The video shows after tuning and first add on of resin on the bow. (played by my oldest son stopped playing multiple years ago). But he thinks it is a very good price-performance ratio.",

You can tinker with the tuning as well to get used to it. I recommend handling it lightly the first few days so the strings don't snap if you handle it too quick. Looking online to figure out how to work your violin also helps a lot. There's a lot of videos on youtube. I haven't touched one since middle school so I'm basically a complete beginner again. It came nicely packaged and all in one piece. I highly recommend.",

He did mention each bow will only last for 6 months, but for a beginner and it comes with two bows, win win. I did buy better rosin because of what I heard in other reviews.

I took it to an instrument repair shop, and they fixed them. $6.00 bucks each to repair, and I was off and running.

I have always wanted to learn to play the violin and when I saw this violin at such a low price, I had to get it. The sound is beautiful, but I would not recommend using the rosin that came with this bow. The rosin is cheap and just by getting a better quality rosin which wasn't very expencive, my sound improved SO much. Other than the rosin, everything else is fantastic. LOVE this violin so so much.",

I probably re-tune it once a week so it isn\u2019t like it\u2019s happening every day. Overall Fantastic experience and I would purchase again without hesitation.",

I'll make a real investment if I find myself playing for a while. otherwise, no guilt on this purchase. only wondering if the $80 violins are any different",
