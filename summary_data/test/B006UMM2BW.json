Focus gets confused, although there's lots of activity on the screen. - Big film, zoom, with optical viewfinder. The CMOS sensor is a bit different in color rendering than what one gets used to with Canon CCD. But the G1x is what I wanted at the time and what I got. Probably going to spring for a Fuji in the future. And, as with other reviewers, I have a G12 as well.",

The camera itself is great, with fully manual controls and the images are amazing.",

The camera itself even accept's 50mm filters (with a relatively inexpensive adapter). The Bokeh is quite pleasing for such a small camera; the sharpness at small apertures is quite impressive. If you already own a DSLR collection, this camera is a worthy addition to your stable, for those times you don't want to carry 35 pounds of equipment on your back :)",

The features offered a great variety of functions and the quality of the shots I take at a low ISO are great. The sharpness of the lens on this camera is excellent at f8.0 which is perfect for landscape applications. One drawback I have is that the camera needs a better grip. I can even get around that viewfinder issue, but holding this camera is difficult even for my normal adult hands. Using a tripod has proven to be the best action for truly sharp and clean pictures.",

Limited 3X zoom and macro capability but I can live with that. Remote cable shutter release is nice. very well built. Buttons and knobs to access features and sub meneus helps a lot. So far the only thing I don't like is when I set the metering to Center-spot it reverts to the default when I turn the camera off.",

The viewfinder, which has been much discussed, is a welcome retention but except for an approximation, is not very useful. For a travel camera, which is why I purchased it, the need to put the camera up to your eye when in sunlight, is a requirement. Would be nice if canon made a reasonably priced 28mm viewfinder..... Image quality is very good...surprisingly so indoors. My Fuji xe1 is better outdoors, however, more saturation. But with interchangeable lenses, and my desire to keep the weight down, I wold still take the canon on road trips.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot G1 X 14.3 MP CMOS Digital Camera",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFull range of shooting and recording modes including 14-bit RAW + JPEG for ultimate creative control\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n The Pinnacle of PowerShot\n\nBright, fast and more creative than ever: advanced technologies come together for an exciting new camera that moves beyond anything the G-Series has seen before. The PowerShot G1 X digital camera will inspire advanced amateurs who have embraced the G-Series to explore new realms of photographic expression, and give pros an excellent camera that complements their creative demands. The new 1.5-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor approaches DSLR size, with a light-sensitive area that\u2019s approximately 6.3 times larger than that of the PowerShot G12 digital camera. The new 14.3 Megapixel sensor, combined with a new lens and DIGIC 5 Image Processor, creates the HS SYSTEM that delivers image quality previously impossible in a compact camera, with beautiful blur, lower noise, and extraordinary resolution in low-light shooting and can shoot at ISOs of up to 12800. The PowerShot G1 X also has 14-bit RAW capabilities for even greater creative control and Full HD Video recording. Manual settings and operability inherited from EOS cameras impart a high-level shooting experience, and open the door to new creative possibilities. Substantive luxury defines the design: a neatly clarified sculpture with a firm grip, huge Vari-angle LCD and optical viewfinder. \n\nCanon DIGIC 5 Image Processor \nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background. \n\nCanon 1.5-inch, 14.3 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor\nCanon engineers developed a sensor for PowerShot G1 X digital camera that is nearly the size of an EOS DSLR camera\u2019s APS-C sized sensor, and built with a similar pixel structure\u2014each pixel site is larger, allowing more light to be captured\u2014giving the PowerShot G1 X a completely different level of image quality than compact cameras that have come before it. At 1.5 inches, the sensor is approximately 6.3 times larger than that of the PowerShot G12 digital camera. This heightened degree of sensitivity, along with 14.3 Megapixels, delivers several distinct advantages. Noise is dramatically reduced at high ISO speeds for clear low-light and nighttime shooting. Resolution at low ISO speeds is incredibly rich and precise. And, most atypically for a compact camera, the PowerShot G1 X digital camera allows you to create the intensely beautiful background blur that is the hallmark of DSLR cameras. \n\nCanon HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 14.3 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot G1 X incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable range to an amazingly high ISO 12800. The HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur. \n\nShooting and Recording Modes Including 14-bit RAW + JPEG\nThe PowerShot G1 X offers a host of shooting and recording modes ranging from fully automatic to fully manual, plus Full HD movies and full-resolution High-Speed Burst HQ at a maximum of 6 frames*. The camera recognizes 32 shooting situations, automatically optimizing settings for achieving the highest quality shots on the go. Alternatively, you can exert complete creative control over the look and feel of your images. 14-bit signal processing, just as in EOS series cameras, gives images notably rich detail and smooth gradation. Compared with 12-bit processing, 14-bit offers a 4x increase in RAW data, makes a visible impact, giving images rich detail in both highlights and shadows as well as smoother, more natural tonal gradation for outstanding image quality. \n\n*Continuous shooting speed is 4.5 fps.\n\nCanon Full HD Video Advantage\nIn addition to the HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot G1 X digital camera makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot G1 X digital camera can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.\n\n*Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps.\n**Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nDedicated Movie Button, Wind filter feature and Optical Zoom for easy video capture\nIt\u2019s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot G1 X has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot G1 X also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot G1 X lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you\u2019re shooting a video.\n\nHDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support\nIt\u2019s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot G1 X. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot G1 X supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u2019ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u2019s remote control. (CEC \u2013 Consumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\n\n\n\niFrame\nWith the PowerShot G1 X, you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.\n\n4x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom and 28mm Lens\nThe PowerShot G1 X digital camera is equipped with a newly designed 4x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom and 28mm lens (35mm equivalent: 28\u2013112mm), built with the knowledge acquired over decades of Canon leadership in optical technology innovation. Canon engineers specifically designed this lens to take advantage of the PowerShot G1 X digital camera\u2019s exceptionally large sensor. Bright and fast, the f/2.8 lens captures a wealth of subtle detail, even indoors and in dark scenes, and easily covers a full range of shooting situations. It incorporates the latest in Canon UA lens technology, suppressing lens aberration for outstanding image quality throughout the entire zoom range. Images are richly expressive, from areas of highest resolution to beautifully artistic background blurs. The wide angle gives you more to work with in every shot, expanding your avenues for creative photography. Zooming is fast and precise, and 4x power takes you in for the close-up.\n\nUA Lens Technology\nPioneered by Canon, UA Lens technology makes possible compact lenses with remarkable optical performance. By using molded glass with an ultra-high refractive index in aspherical lens elements, Canon has succeeded in reducing lens size while significantly reducing image aberrations. Another stellar example of cutting-edge Canon optics, UA Lens technology helps make PowerShot digital cameras pocket-friendly and capable of astounding image quality.\n\nOptical Image Stabilizer\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that shifts a lens group to correct unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations of up to 4 stops without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. \n\nIntelligent IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image. \nNormal Panning Macro Dynamic Powered Tripod Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in (close-up) shooting. Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \n3.0-inch Vari-Angle PureColor System LCD\nWith the PowerShot G1 X digital camera, difficult shooting angles won\u2019t stop you from getting the shot you want. The camera\u2019s big 3.0-inch Vari-Angle LCD screen swivels out and rotates, tilting up and down to give you access to the highest and lowest angles for shooting flexibility that greatly enhances your creative expression. You can also capture perfectly centered self-portraits or put yourself into group shots. The LCD screen\u2019s benefits don\u2019t end with mobility. A resolution of 922,000 dots gives you an unprecedented level of detail in the images you\u2019re composing. The high resolution level also makes it easy to read on-screen information when you\u2019re adjusting camera settings and accessing shot information. Full-spectrum color is true and natural. As befits a high-performance camera designed for advanced users, the PowerShot G1 X digital camera is equipped with an optical viewfinder as well. Shoot SLR-style with the real image optical zoom finder, and customize the viewfinder for your vision with dioptric adjustment. \n\nElectronic Level\nThe PowerShot G1 X even has a built-in electronic level that calculates the camera\u2019s horizontal angle of tilt and displays the information on the LCD monitor. The feature makes it easier to capture a perfectly level shot every time.\n\nHigh-Speed Burst HQ\nUtilizing the increased processing speed and power of the new Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor, High-Speed Burst HQ makes it possible to capture fast action stills at full resolution during continuous shooting. The results are exceptionally high-quality images recorded in rapid sequence. In this mode, the PowerShot G1 X can capture a maximum of 6 shots in a single burst.* \n\n*The continuous shooting speed is approx. 4.5 fps. \n\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Program \nThe camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.\nMovie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into a video.
