One is in my primary (kitchen) tool drawer and another went outside to funnel sand. The sand was pouring too slowly through the small exit, so I modified it by cutting the bottom off, opening it to about 1 inch. That was really and served my purppose. It was clean sand so I washed it off after use and will store it away. I loev that they smash down to take up no space - just what I was hoping for.",

It takes a lot for me to leave a bad review but if I could have handled them prior to purchase I wouldn't have even considered buying all 4 for 75% off.
