      "text": "I bought this for my daughter (who bears the same name), and we just finished our initial launch(es). It was excellent. This is a simple, straight-flying rocket that we were able to recover and launch a total of three times (before we ran out of A8 engines). We'll try some B6 engines, next, and I suspect this rocket will last for as long as we can successfully find / recover it. The rocket comes pre-assembled, with easy instructions to pack it together and launch. Note: This is the rocket only. It does not come with a launch pad, igniter, wadding or engines. You'll need all of those before you can blast off.",

I think mine's still in lower orbit, zipping by the International Space Station and probably causing alien 'sightings'. All in all it's a great little starter rocket. Easy to snap together and set up. Pay mind to how to properly wrap the parachute. If you don't, the rocket will come back to earth and taking the express elevator. Goin' down!",

I bought two and launched them twice each in drag race fashion on C5-6's at a high-power rocketry event. They flew straight, high and well. The chutes deployed properly and retrieved both of them undamaged. I am Level Two certified though Tripoli. (Look it up.) Make sure to read the instructions and have proper supervision when launching this model rocket. When used properly, you should have a great time. I've ordered another Athena to add to the drag race fleet. I've not had any problems with the Estes ready-to-fly rockets.",
