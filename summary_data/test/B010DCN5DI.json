      "title": "Terrible camera - unreliable",
      "text": "I have purchased several of these for business use. Every single one of these have the same faults. They don't always focus when videoing - often going in and out of focus, the record button often sticks so it either doesn't start or stop filming, the zoom often sticks. Worst camera I have ever purchased. The picture and video quality is excellent when it works, but complete waste of money since it doesn't work reliably",

      "text": "An excellent camera overall, takes pictures every bit as good as my old Pentax K20D with fewer lens artifacts and distortions in a much smaller, lighter package. Why only 4 stars: it's too easy to set the autofocus onto the wrong subject/area by accidentally touching the screen whilst moving it or positioning the camera. By the time you've adjusted the settings (difficult to do if you are holding the camera aloft etc) you miss the shot.",
