The wipes themselves are big, but I don't use them for a baby, I use them on myself. So I just tear one in half and put the other half back in the package, make it last twice as long haha. 6 come in each box. It will take me a while to get through them so I'll be gifting them for sure. LOVE that they're biodegradable AND body friendly. 10/10 would recommend",
