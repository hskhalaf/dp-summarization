This is not a stiff duvet, if that is what you are looking for. It is comfy like you might find in a hotel. I purchased a King for my pillow-top king that requires deep pocket sheets. It fits perfectly. I paired this with this comforter: \"Chezmoi Collection King Goose Down Alternative Comforter with Corner Tab, White\" because they tie inside so it doesn't slip. I am very happy with both.",
