I was hesitant about ordering a similar product but decided to take a chance. This B&D unit is built stronger and works better. As others have noted, it is heavy. But it cuts well and stood up to my trying to cut a wire fence a couple of times, with no damage. I am able to get through 6 or 8 small bushes and two 6ft bushes without the battery getting depleted. The angled head allows both overhead and ground level cutting which is quite convenient at times.",

It doesn't have enough angles on the head (only up, 45 and 90 degrees) so it makes it hard to get to the very back of the hedge. Worst is the cutting action. I spend most of my time with it watching it push down the leaves just to watch them pop right back up again. I wish I would have returned it in the 30 days. I have a full set of B&D cordless tools and this is the only one I'm genuinely disappointed with.",

You can angle the trimmer from the pole - although it needs to have a couple of additional angles - and then you can trim lower to the ground or taller bushes. The \"balance\" of the design is not ideal because the trimmer is heavy and the pole extends out several feet, but the battery lasts for a reasonable amount of time (bring 2-3 batteries with you for a larger project). If you are going to buy a pole trimmer, this is as good as you could hope for since it is reasonably priced and uses the standard B&D 20v lithium.",

If you are cutting shrubs higher than you are tall, then your arms better be in great shape, otherwise, you\u2019ll have to take breaks. Maybe I am a little out of shape too.

If the electric Moyer was closer to the handle it would be fine or if they made some sort of harness to help maneuver it that might help.

One the pro side, the muscles in my forearms have grown significantly since getting this! 2.

      "text": "Good power to weight ratio. Good balance of weight to duration of battery... we always want a battery to last forever, but the trade-offs were well balanced in this device. Good reach. The only draw back is that the connectors between the grip and the motor head and the extension are a screw type that comes undone with some amount of standard usage vibration. So, I have to check to make sure it's solidly connected about every battery change. If I don't check it, the device starts to be sporadic in running... typical faulty connection behavior, but gives the impression of a dead battery or semi-burned out engine. Tightening the connectors again and it runs like a champ.",

Also, the ability to angle the head is nice, but because there's no real handle on the pole, you have to apply a lot of torque to keep the head from rotating towards the ground. Overall though, I'm quite pleased with this, it definitely gets the job done.",
