The cord is very short which made it hard to plug in. Finally this appliance is gargantuan and takes up too much space on the counter.",

The basket is large enough that you can cook chicken in it also. The only downside is emptying the oil for future use as there is not an easy way to drain the oil from any food particle bits. We have it figured out now, but it was a learning curve. I would definitely recommend this deep-fryer.",

The oil drain tray didn't work well for me. Oil never leaked down or out while cooking. However, the seal did allow air to enter up on more than one occasion while I was frying. It would start to aggressively roil up. The last time it exploded oil it went in the trash (thankfully the lid was on but hot oil ended up all over my counter).",

At a glance the designs are all very similar but the integrated drain and filtering system makes this a huge upgrade in terms of cleanup and workflow.

Temperature control is good, with only a slight undershoot vs the thermometer I tested with that could easily be within the error margin of the thermometer. If I was going to change anything, I'd raise the max fill line and the reservoir capacity slightly as a few larger chicken drumsticks had to be turned to ensure they were completely cooked.",

It is very well & smartly constructed so I'm fairly confident it will perform great for some time. Includes warranty .",

      "text": "It controls temperature quickly and accurately, cleans up pretty easily, the filtration works surprisingly well. However, for it's size, the oil is confoundingly shallow; perhaps an inch deep at max. No chicken legs or bone-in breasts, a hush puppy would have to be flat or tiny, and so on. The metal parts are quite a thin gauge, I haven't damaged anything so far, but I'm not confident that will last. The cover should be hinged, it's an annoyance having to find a place to rest it while you tend your meal. It would be nice if the heating element could be removed from the control unit for cleaning. It's tremendous at fries and chips, but be aware of its limitations.",
