It's a nice looking block but they use pine from old pallets oozing sap for the inside. I was able to clean one but the other kept leaving residue on the knife. I almost exchanged the block but decided to return it. If they used cedar or oak for the inside would be a 4 star block.",

The edges were not sanded, there is splintering around all of the holes. 2. If you put knives next to the scissors, then they all touch and don't sit nicely. 3. This block is only bamboo on the outside. The core looks to be made from pine",

Some reviews mention that steak knives are too close, and while they are a little tight, they remain easy enough to use. The nearly square hole might be good for a knife sharpener, however, it is not suited to holding shears due to the proximity to adjacent knives. But, I can't remember the last time I used these, so they live in a drawer now. So, this slot stays empty and because of its size is a bit awkward. Otherwise, a great knife block.",

      "text": "Very well made and attractive. Openings are as shown and plenty long enough so the knife tip doesn't hit bottom. A great value!! Don't buy one of the holders with thin plastic inserts, the knives will not rest properly and you can't get them in all the way. The blade sticks out and is quite dangerous. I tossed mine after getting cut again trying to get a knife in the holder and bought this. Very pleased!!",

As this is the first slotted knife block I've owned (always used magnetic strips before) I don't know if the slots being open on the bottom is normal or not. I like it because it will make cleaning the block easier but at the same time, I have to be careful what knives I put into the slots so I don't nick the counter top. All in all it really has made food prep in the kitchen easier.",
