I bought these because of the intricate \"iron work\" look, but I was nervous to purchase because they were so inexpensive. When I got them in the mail I was shocked by how heavy and sturdy they felt. My fiance was very happy with them. Although we don't think they were made conventionally, they are definitely sturdy and elegant. We are very happy with them! I'd suggest to anyone looking for beautiful cuff links, but on a budget.",
