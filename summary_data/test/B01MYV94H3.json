It is extremely fast, has all of the apps you could want, and also allows you to stream PC games to your living room (as long as you have an Nvidia graphics card). I got the pro version but one can get away with the 16 gig and save some cash. All of the features of the pro I have barely used. Extremely happy with this purchase and I tell lots of people about the shield.",

Really frustrating for an android box that costs 10 times what other boxes cost to stop working in under a year and have tech support tell you there's nothing they can do. Even when it was running, it was a very buggy OS, geoforce now no longer had any games you would want to play, significant controller delay, even with a great internet connection that works for 3 other gaming consoles, it would register ad having a bad internet connection and could only run at 30 fps with lots of twitching. Please, avoid this POS.",

Plex transcoding on the Shield works with acceleration turned off, but that makes the Shield a much slower Plex server. Suggestion: If you need Plex for transcoding, before purchasing, check the Plex forums, search for the string about the transcoding crashing on the Nvidia Shield, and see if a fix has finally been found. It's been broken for 7 months. Not fixed as of 3-30-2019.",

There\u2019s plenty of tutorials out there on YouTube for Kodi builds specifically for this device, easy to follow. The key to getting this box to run at its peak is to download a good quality VPN, IPVANISH is what I recommend.

      "text": "It seems Nvidia has some known bug with the remotes and its common. Give it a search. Without the remote, the system is unusable. So at this point, my new system doesnt work, and I see little hope that it will work. Overall I wasnt super happy with the system. I liked the layout and the speed, but reboots were regular. I was expecting at this price, that I had a system my family could use without asking for my help. Maybe if this thing was less costly, I would less inclined to give this bad review.",
