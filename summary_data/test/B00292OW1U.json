I'm using my new normal keyboard and I'm already scouring ebay for a 4th merc stealth.",

The game setup on the side is the best thing since sliced bread, and in my opinion better than sliced bread. However the cord at the USB end is frayed and causes it to not work so well. I'm a bit sad about this fact. The keys are fairly stiff in the push, but they are basically the same type of key press you would expect from any normal keyboard, clicking and all. If it wasn't for the fact that the wire is going, I wouldn't have had to buy a new keyboard yesterday.",

So I went to manufacture and submitted a support ticket. 10 days later I get a automated response that had nothing to do about my question (Can you simulate a key for a mouse click). So I replied, 7 days later I got a message \"It's not possible\". So it took 17 days to get a simple answer, not good customer service. You might look for a product that is better supported.",

It does work well and the left side directional pad is great for gaming where you have to move around quickly. Buttons to program to do action is conveniently placed above. I also have key programmed for teamspeak or mumble.",

I love the different backlights and dimming options. The only real complaint I have is the number pad layout and functions. The 0 key placement definitely takes some getting used to and having to turn numlock off to use the delete key is annoying.",

It is the best keyboard going for gaming, and the price is about 1/3 what it was when I bought the first one. I have never had any trouble with the first one, so I hope for the same with these new ones. The keyboard is very fast and accurate, and will never let you down not matter how long you are playing or how hard you use it. I would recommend one to anyone who has the room for a slightly larger keyboard and loves to game.",

I guess that's a bonus? For the price compared to the original merc it's a steep, very steep, increase just for the fact that it glows and has a few more macro options compared to the original.

Your Insert / Delete buttons are on the 10-key pad too, so you have to remember to turn on/off the num lock. My wife seen my keyboard and she liked it so much, we ordered her one shortly after.

However, I can't really feel comfortable for game controller area where placed left side of keyboard. some keys are too higher than number keys so it bothers me using spells in the game. However, this keyboard is very nice and cool overall. The important fact is cheap. I won't complain this product is suck compare to price. It's fare price compare to its quality.",

Even though it says that is not mechanic, it still feels as mechanical as it gets. You can change the colors of the keyboard and are very bright even when the lights are on. On the plus side, there is a small built in game pad on the side. This keypad is so easy to get used to and it is as if you are using a game pad such as the razer nostromo. Cons about this keyboard is the length of it, it is very long.",
