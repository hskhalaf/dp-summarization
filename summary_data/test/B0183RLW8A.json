I am a builder who uses my impact driver everyday, and this tool does not live up to my needs. I have all Dewalt cordless tools (hammer drill, 6.5\" circular saw, grinder, multi tool, sawsall) and they work great, but the impact driver has had trigger issues right off the bat, as well as quick bit change issues, and most importantly driving issues. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TOOL to any hard working builder or professional who depends on it to get their job done.",

This is when driving screws in basic 2 by lumber. I\u2019m returning and going with the other 20v Dewalt impact model. It doesn\u2019t have the safety shutoff!",

Settings 2 and 3 have crazy torque but are also impossible to precisely control. You can't drive screws into wood and expect controllable depth. Much more useful for manipulating nuts and bolts than screws. I wish that setting 1 was between 1 and 2 and that the impact clutch had adjustable torque.",
