I like the shoe compartment for the winter months, where he's bringing his sneaker to and from. He'll be using this for school, but it would make a great pack for sports as well. It's sharp looking with plenty or room, and the kids are crazy for UA brand. The only thing I can't speak for is the longevity since we just got it. It doesn't look as well made as LL Bean, but here's to hoping it'll last until he's tired of it and wants a change.",

It was barely used to hold a folder and lunch box. Waste of money.. ***UPDATE*** I contacted the seller and they were very apologetic and great customer service! They say they are refunding me the money for the backpack which is such a relief! For that I am changing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars.",

Only minor flaw is the lowest front pocket is EXTREMELY deep, and it's the only pocket of that size. I wish there was one that width and height that wasn't so deep. (Things get really hard to pull out, you have to stick half your arm in to reach all the way down.)",

The quality is excellent, and I think it will wear well, and last , even with a 9 year old!!! We would recommend this for any student!!!",
