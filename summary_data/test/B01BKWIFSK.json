      "text": "I am a 55 year old woman who put this together by myself. It\u2019s awesome. I did assemble the first of the square upside down and then flip it over. Then I added all the other parts. Holes are predrilled, you just need to carefully match them up. I also put wood post into the legs for stability. Concreted the legs into flower pots with 40 lbs in each pot. Looks like I have a room addition. So happy I bought it.",

I have firmly attached the base to my deck and there is still a lot of play in the pergola structure. It will sway side to side / front to back a couple of inches at the top when pressure is applied (or a good wind blows). I will at some point add angle bracket to attach one side to my home for additional support. I would recommend adding secured 4\"x4\" wooden posts at least 4' to 5' under the vinyl sleeves for support.",

We originally set it up on a tiled patio and then moved it over to the hot tub several days later, so there was no anchoring during that time. We had several high wind storms come through those days (up to 60 mph wind gusts) and the pergola withstood it all beautifully. Of course, it is anchored down now in it's permanent positioning, but we were very pleased with how well it is made.",

This generous structure turns any section of lawn into an outdoor room, for you to relax in your backyard for many seasons.
