Glad I ordered a size up because they seem to run a bit small. I agree with other reviewers that the fit is a little tight around the ankle area. But overall, they seem like they are comfortable and well made",

The more agessive soles are great for playing outside on playground, in backyard or in icy parking lots.

Other good name brands are also heavier which makes kids tend to complain more as they get tired. Recommend getting size up, that way can wear thick socks or extend the use of the boot into the next season perhaps.",

However the length is about perfect, as expected. We'll keep them and hope they stretch out a little, or he doesn't need to wear very heavy socks ;) Overall the boot quality though is spot on.",
