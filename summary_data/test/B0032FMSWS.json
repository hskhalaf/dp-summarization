We opted to hang them on the enclosed lanyards to increase their reach. SIGNAL ---In our case...the sound from the bell reaches all areas of our home (from an upstairs bedroom with solid wood closed door to all areas two story home). After determining it would meet our needs, we ordered additional call buttons. The buttons are lightweight. However, our dependent adult preferred not to wear the call button around his neck so, we ordered additional call buttons and placed one in the bathroom, by the chair-side, by the bedside &.in the kitchen.",

She was able to summon us when she fell and also when her phone wasn't working. She has one of those life line buttons but this was an additional level of security for her. I am very satisfied with this purchase.",

Two receivers allows one to stay where you are headquartered, while you wear the other clipped on as you move about. Reasonably priced. When clients became unable to \"hit\" the center of the call button, I found that taping a hearing aid battery atop made it foolproof.",
