Put a small dab on the problem areas of your hand, rub your hands together, and wave them around for 7-10 seconds. Boom. Hit that bar.",

Consequently it does dry really fast, but not before you can coat everything on your hands that you likely want to--which is a plus. The quality feels nice, but I think I personally would seek out a thicker version for a repeat purchase. To whatever degree it matters, I was using this for indoor rock climbing.",

You can't really re-apply this to sweaty hands and even when towling off, I'd find it was hard to get a re-apply to dry correctly mid-workout. I suppose your mileage may vary based on how much you sweat, but it's back to block chalk for me.",

      "text": "I tried this chalk for the first time last week doing deadlifts and I have to say it really made a difference for me. The bottle itself just clips to my bag, so it stays out of the way but is easy to grab whenever I need it. It's super easy to use, just a small amount gave me pretty even coverage and lasted through six sets before I re-applied any. Also I sweat a lot, and while it did trickle down my palms, just rubbing my hands together brought full coverage back. You have to really wash thoroughly to get this stuff off, so for marathon sets or particularly intense work outs this chalk is perfect!",

You can use a drop of liquid chalk, rub it in your hands, and air it out as you watch your whole hands covered in chalk in a thick layer.",

WITH THE CHALK i did 315 for 7 reps and had to stop myself. I went up to 405 and beat my record by 70 lbs just using chalk. Mind blown, i thought i just had a weak grip that made the bar rollout out of my hands... Try chalk if you havent used it before.",

It does feel weird when you wash it off, but that's something I can get used to.",
