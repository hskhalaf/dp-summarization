Whilst not quite on par with Lie Nielsen or Veritas, with a bit of work it most definitely can be the equal of any chisel on the market...for less than half the price! This particular blend of British steel falls sonewhere vetween O1 and O2 steel in its properties and some feel it is the best choice available for an artisan chisel. Definitely holds an edge longer than O1 whilst being easier to sharpen and more corrosion resistant than O2. A great buy for a set of lifetime tools that will be passed down to your great grandchildren!",

Way better dovetail experience than using the cheapo contractor big-box 10 dollar chisel set. These are at least square, let alone sharp. I am happy with the purchase overall.

Scuff up the handle\u2019s cone end (that inserts into the chisel and whack the handle back into the chisel a few times and it\u2019s in. Doesn\u2019t guarantee to stay but certainly more snug than initial use.

A little tuning (minor flattening and micro bevels) and they will be near as nice as the Lie-Nielsen except for one thing.

      "text": "Excellent tool for the money. If you're stepping up from big box chisels, these are good chisels before throwing serious change at high dollar English and Japanese chisels. I've been chopping compound dovetails in quarter-sawn oak (1 full inch thick) with excellent results. They're not too hard (or brittle) to sharpen regularly or too soft to hold their edge. Also, I happen to use a soft-face dead-blow hammer with these. Do not use steel faced hammers with these handles.",

These stay sharp longer than my Irwin chisels, but no where near as long as my Veritas chisels, but the price was right for the set. Once flattened and honed, they are a pleasure to use. These chisels are well balanced easy to hold with just the fingers.I can't compare them to L.N. since I don't own any. Great chisels for a serious hobbyist.",

    "title": "STANLEY Sweetheart Chisels Set, 4-Piece (16-791)",
    "description": "Size:4-PieceIntroducing the Sweet Heart 750 Series of socket chisels. Once again, Stanley has reached backwards to move forward and reconnect with woodworkers! Tool steel blades forged in the U.K. with genuine hornbeam handles. Delicate looking, well balanced and every bit genuine hardworking chisels! Individually boxed. Handle require setting prior to use. Set includes 1/4a\u20ac\u009d, 1/2a\u20ac\u009d, 3/4a\u20ac\u009d and 1a\u20ac\u009d with a genuine leather tool roll.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Sweetheart line socket chisels are based on the classic 750 design, which is arguably the best Stanley chisel ever made. Machined from high carbon steel, the Sweetheart chisels sharpen easily and retain a razor-sharp edge over long periods of use. Their side bevels are extra narrow for working in tight corners. This helps the user to avoid inadvertent marring of the work when precise cuts are critical. Designed for striking and paring, the hornbeam handle provides a comfortable feel that transfers energy effectively when struck by a mallet. It also provides a wide butt end, or large sweet spot, for striking accuracy. Manufactured in Sheffield, England. Set includes the following sizes: 1/4\", 1/2\", 3/4\", and 1\", chisels and a leather pouch.",
