The chair is one of those big comfy ones so I bought the loveseat size. This looked great, was easier to clean than vacuuming the chair and trying to get fur out of crevices. I would just toss it in the dryer on no heat for a few minutes and then clean the lint trap. Also made prepping for guests much easier. The foam/elastic bands hold it in place even with rowdy puppies jumping on and off, but don't hold up to being eaten. Which is completely acceptable....",
