The brown leather band is high quality. There are many holes close together for the buckle so should be easy for anyone to fit to wrist. It was easy to reset time to correct local time. I doubt that I'll use the chronograph feature but it works. Overall it is a great watch for daily use.",

My only complaint is that there is basically one set of instructions from Fossil for all of their watch varieties. You have to find your model in the online booklet. The instructions are really not very clear or thorough, but the watch and chronograph operations are simple enough to figure out on your own. I feel this watch is a good value for the money, though, and I am very pleased with my purchase.",

It arrived in a very unique box for this style of watch ( tin box with colorful swirls almost like from the 70s) nice box just weird choice of design. Fast forward I give it to my dad and he absolutely loved it. He has had multiple comments on it and always seems to hold his head a little higher when hes wearing it. I always catch his rolling up his sleeves almost as if to show it off. Whether this is because it was a gift from his son or he just really liked the watch that's my review after purchasing this item :) hope it helped.",
