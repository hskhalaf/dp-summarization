Use better zippers!) and can tend to split if you don't zip slowly and carefully. Overall, a good product, although you'd have to be pretty strong to use the backpack as intended.",

The padding is awesome, but it makes a little bulky to carry around before and after the flight. With that said, it fits in the undercarriage of our stroller, so we've been able to make it work!

      "text": "This bag made it so much easier for me to carry around my daughter's car seat. I have a Graco Extend 2 Fit and it fit perfectly and there was even some extra space inside. The straps are adjustable and has a little window pocket to include your personal information. I like that the bag completely zips shut unlike other car seat bags that just have a draw string. I used it for two flights and when I returned home there was some damage to the material but it wasn't torn. Overall this makes traveling a lot easier especially if you are on your own!",

I was impressed by the quality of the material, the zipper, and the padding. Ticket agent was impressed by it as well and remarked at how silly it is not to cover a checked car seat. I would recommend this to a friend. Update: have used it several times with the nuna pipa and now with our cosco scenera convertible seat we use for travel. This bag is comfortable and keeps the contents secure. I\u2019m glad I made the investment.",

The shoulder straps became detached the first time it was checked at the airport. The second time the strap came off completely. We have a small child and need our hands, so the ergonomic design, and desire for hands free drew us to the product. We are her dissatisfied, and more-so because I believe we are past the return window.",

Don\u2019t waste your money buying another bag just to have to throw away after one trip. We have gone on atleast 8 flights with these and still look new. Highly recommend!",
