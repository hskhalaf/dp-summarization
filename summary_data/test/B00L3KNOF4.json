It will be in for service for at least two weeks being repaired. I was very disappointed with Samsung's level of service. I purposely bought a branded product and from Amazon because I expected better customer care.",

I've set the source to be manual, but it continues to search for input when I turn off my computer. When it does this, the screen flashes and the input source it's scanning is shown on the screen. It seems to know it's \"sleeping\" since the power button blinks, but it still turns the screen off and on. The only way to stop this is to turn it off. Otherwise, I love this monitor! Crisp display with a good resolution. It's not 4K, but I didn't need that. So, if Samsung is listening... can you fix the sleep mode? Thanks.",

The picture quality is awesome and the sheer size and resolution took some getting used to, because I have to physically turn my head to see what popped up in the corner of the screen. Plenty of real estate for Visual Studio and the latest Doom game looks great. One minor complaint is the whites are a bit too bright. To compensate I set as many apps as I can to dark mode.",

Color was really close right out of the box without using the Eco display mode - the calibration produced a barely noticeable change in color.

Tilt, swivel, height adjustments and it rotates to profile mode. No dead pixels that I can detect. Also works well for gaming - Witcher 3, Fallout 4.

This monitor also has a much higher resolution, while I can't fully utilize it yet with my crappy vcard and original Xbox one. Having the higher resolution does make it look much more clear however. This was definitely worth it. When making the transition, I did need to get an HDMI audio extractor and use some speaker with it since I came from a TV.",

They don't mention it, but the stand is easily adjustable vertically, which helps me because I'm using the monitor on a standing-desk contraption and it would be too high if the stand weren't adjustable. It also rotates to portrait if you need that. All very well built and high quality. (What a relief!)",
