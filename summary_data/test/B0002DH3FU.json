Contents could readily slide around causing further damage. These are fragile sprays of millet seed, they were all smashed and a bunch of seeds had crumbled off the sprays. My birds were really wanting some so I didn't send it back but they actually didn't eat all the seeds off the spray. They looked dried out. There was very little difference from a eaten spray and a non eaten spray. Big waste of money.",

My last order was Kaytee brand and there was no problem like this. Also this plastic bag has two air holes and the seeds came out of the air holes and got all other everying else inside the box",
