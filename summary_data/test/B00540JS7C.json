They are a bit heavy and cumbersome but what would you expect with a 16\" straight cut capacity saw. Fork out the $ and get the rolling stand you'll be glad you did. This saw does not have the laser,but any carpenter worth his sawdust doesn't need a laser to cut accurately. Save a couple hundred $ and buy this saw the \"779\" not the 780. Use the extra money to buy the rolling stand. Now get back to work!",

I compared mine to the 780 on display at home depot and theirs has a metal housing with no elevated piece. Also had DeWalt send me a replacement part and it's identical to the one I already have. So I plan on just using the depth stop for now and maybe modifying the housing myself in the future.",

The extension arms for the sides do not line up. Could not install them. And the molded plastic handle/trigger do not align right and poke your palm with a sharp corner every time you use it.

The odd size fitting does not have a vaccuum adapter that will fit it and when I did finally tape my shop vac it caused the rubber flanges to collapse making it useless. DeWalt cut corners on this aspect and the saw produces a lot of saw dust....",

      "text": "Literally broke after about 2 weeks and maybe only a handful of uses. Motor sounds ridiculously loud and the blade won't break after I shut it off now. Won't even cut through wood without stopping either. Also the tool for removing the blade would not fit the screws for some reason, no matter how hard I tried. They were quick to replace it with the same model which is working fine thus far. Also the tool now fits to remove the blade.",

What would I change? 1 - make the dust tube on the back some standard size for dust collectors. NONE of my standard adapters fit snugly. 2- Add a laser guide. I added this cheap aftermarket guide. It works fine, but the saw has to be spinning to see it -  Other than that, it's a fantastic saw. I would buy it again.",
