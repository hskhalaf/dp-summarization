The ankle strap on the shoe gives me extra ankle support and the inside is very cushy. Overall four out of five star shoe. The only flaw of these Filas is that they're not the ones I ordered and there happens to be a smudge of black ink on the white detail of the shoe. It's really small but if I was to step in the light someone might see it.",

A true inspiration combining function and fashion.\n\nFila began in 1911, in the small alpine town of Biella, Italy, a place renowned for manufacturing the world's finest textiles, and weaving fabrics with impeccable quality, true innovation and extraordinary beauty. Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inexorably derived from Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury and elegance. This is our birthright, it's in our soul, and it defines our future. We continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for our existence. We create what is desired, not what is necessary. Not just enough, but more than you need. This is Fila.",
