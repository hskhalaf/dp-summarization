The weight of the lens takes some getting used to, but its worth the adjustment for the quality of images.",

The metal is sturdy and the glass is excellent quality! There is some distortion but that's expected from a fisheye. It's great for capturing a lot in the frame without having to back up or zoom out. In the attached picture of the Millennium Falcon at Disneyland, I was right up on it and still was able to capture the entire thing. Highly recommend this lens",

I saw that Moment has 3 more lenses available ( Macro, Telephoto and Wide Lens), i will be buying all of them in the near future. Another amazing lens in the works is the Anamorphic lens that is being sold on Kickstarter, i will definitely buy it once it is out on their website. Thanks again for making excellent products, this is what we need, Innovation !!!. Two thumbs up.",

An engineer at Moment explained to me that the optical image stabilization on the phone moves the camera module around which makes it difficult to achieve the perfect alignment. I'm keeping the lens as I still like it overall (I'll just have to zoom in a little), but it's something to consider if you are planning to use it with a Pixel 2.",
