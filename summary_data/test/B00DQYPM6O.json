The wind proof came in handy as there were 30 mph winds with gusts up to 70 mph. I brought 3 rain jackets with me and this one was my favorite since it's wind and water proof she dried very quickly. The red is also a flattering and bright color. For reference I am 5'3 145 pounds and used a small. In my attached images I was able to wear a fleece jacket underneath for warmth.",

Waterproof is worth every penny, just make sure you're also warm underneath--which may mean a bigger size since your perfect size won't fit comfortably over a bulky sweater.",

Maybe not if you are six foot, as my niece tried it on, but for someone over 5' 8\" the arms are long enough and have range of motion for broad shoulders. It's synthetic, so there is a little rustling, but it's so comfortable and flattering that I got more than one color.",

I live in AZ, so I didn't need a waterproof rain jacket, per se, I just needed a light windbreaker. This would have worked well for that purpose, but I could *not* get over how loud the crinkliness of this jacket was! It was like crumpling up wax paper any time I moved. I sent it back for that reason. However, if that doesn't bother you, then I'd HIGHLY recommend this jacket!",

But the Columbia is really nice for around town and to pack for shorter hikes when it threatens to rain. I don't like how the hood fits. It's loose and difficult to adjust so when I turn my head either right or left the hood is hiding my view. This doesn't happen with more serious jackets, but I can put up with it because I didn't buy it to face difficult rain conditions for a long time. Perfect jacket for around town and definitely worth having at the price I paid.",

As an added plus, it kept me warm during chilly mornings. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear so it was a little large on me, but I wanted it to be loose. This is the best rain/wind jacket I've ever owned.",

The large is just right. I even tried it on with a hoodie underneath and it was a bit snug in the hip area but not uncomfortably so. Plus, If it's chilly outside, I would just wear my lined jacket.

This one is a bit shorter, does not have a nice inside pocket, and the zipper only opens in one direction. The other jacket is better for me in these three ways. The only thing I actually dislike about this jacket is the Velcro (instead of snaps over the zipper.) The velcro drives me crazy... it constantly wants to fasten together when one is trying to zip or unzip the jacket. If you don't plan to zip up that much, however, the velcro will certainly make it fast to put on.",

It creates a slim looking silhouette due to the color blocking on the outside and the inside lining feels soft against bare skin. It's comfortable without a jacket underneath, a hoodie could fit (probably a bit snug) under the jacket as well. I will be in Oregon this weekend, so I will check the waterproofing abilities then.

I like that the inside is mesh lined because it gets so hot and muggy here, but this jacket is pretty lightweight. Therefore it gets 5 stars for meeting all of my expectations of a functional rain jacket.",

The hips were a perfect fit with a bit of looseness around the chest, but the key is making sure it can zipper and it does! Very happy and would definitely recommend this for all the plus size ladies out there :)",

Overall I am satisfied with the quality and appearance of the coat, but a little disappointed that the inner liner is mesh like and that it isn't a little more breathable.",
