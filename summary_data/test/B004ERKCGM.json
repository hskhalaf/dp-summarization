I\u2019m very pleased with the purchase, though I do think it is slightly overpriced. I paid $25, and I think $18-20 would be more appropriate, given the number of other similar totes on amazon at that price point. I needed a green one, though, so I got this. The color is as shown, and the bag stands up well even with nothing inside the main compartment, and with the tools in the side pockets.",

      "text": "Not an avid gardener but an avid reader, I use this bag as my bedside book tote, and I love it! It works great as a book tote: it is sturday enough to stand on its own, the sage color looks very pleasant, and the outside pockets are very useful in storing eyeglasses, pens, bookmarks, and my CD player. After putting everything inside this tote, my bedside table looks a lot \"organized\". Although the outside pockets are a little too deep for pens etc.and I do need to dig in to retrieve them, cannot complain! cuz it is designed for carrying the gardening tools, anyway :-)",
