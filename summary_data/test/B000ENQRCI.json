I hate to this day having flats, so this is the way I go, unless it's tubeless for one bike. I will continue to buy them when needed. Hopefully each set will last years as they always do. One of the 2 tubes I ordered had a bad valve core. it would not open to install air pressure. This is the second time in 3 years this has happened. I have lots of spare parts, so replacing the core was a 2 minute thing for me anyway. the factory may need some inspection instruction....",

No. The inner tubes are excessively rigid, which makes them difficult to get on the wheel in the first place.

My second one had apparently managed to goo up its own valve and couldn't be inflated at all. Thumbs down. Both thumbs. Possibly, both big toes, too.",

Yes a bit heavier then normal tubes but adds to the work out plus overall safety because the side walls are stronger giving stiffer turns at higher speeds. More importantly this product is never carried in local bike ships so this is a great alternative using Amazon.",

Compared with regular mountain bike slime tires, which flatted often, these are the best solution for the Colorado single tracks that I ride. They do add extra weight to your bike and they are too large to carry as a spare in your Camelbak. They are too heavy for use in competitive racing scenarios, however, they will not leave you stranded in a remote area.",
