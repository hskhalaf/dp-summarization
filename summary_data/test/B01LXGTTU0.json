After 30 strokes, you might be temped to place your thumb there to get more force pushing the two halves together. You will loose air that way as soon as you touch the release valve. I works well enough that I will keep the item, knowing that I won't be using it everyday. I have used it on both shraeder and presta and it works well enough if you have strong fingers to twist the end piece.",

Also, all you PSI crazy MTBers, it doesn\u2019t even register readings below 30 psi and at that low PSI it is isn\u2019t enough pressure to use the bleed valve for fine tuning.",

      "text": "The pump is fantastic! I love it and use it very often. I love how it has the gauge integrated with it which helps me measure the air while I am pumping the tire. The max limit for my bike tire is 90 and I found that it took me around 3-5 minutes to pump the air. Its quite fast too!",
