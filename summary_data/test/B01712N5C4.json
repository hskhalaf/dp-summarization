The tempurature control is also superb and extremely helpful. However, I have to dock a star because of two major issues: Some units have a light or hiss that indicates use and this has neither. The biggest problem, however, is that the unit will not stay plugged firmly into the wall outlet. Any slight touch will displace the plug, thus my previous complaint. Thus, I typically have to stay next to the outlet in order to use this device. But overall, I'm more than satisfied.",

The loose plastic part had threads, but in trying to tighten I could again detect the wires inside twisting. Felt like the wires inside would break if I turned it too much. Ended up epoxying the loose part. OK now, but poor QC. One other joke - the packaging says it's grounded, but it only has a two-prong plug.",

The included solder, tweezers, solder pump etc are all useful additions, but the one item missing in this kit is a good tip-cleaning brass wire sponge.

I never used a soldering iron before but after watching some YouTube videos and practicing I was able to do some work. Very easy to use and comes with all the tools as shown in the description. I would highly recommend getting this. Hope this helps a bit.",

A somewhat dim red LED shows that it is on, but does not tell you when the iron is up to heat - but as I said already, it heats quickly. Swapping tips out is super easy since it uses a tightening ring instead of the common screw type fastener, and the cord is nice and pliable. Overall pretty happy with the purchase, though I've not had great luck with the solder remover on the small contacts I'm working with.",
