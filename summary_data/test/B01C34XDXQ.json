I hunt with my brother almost every time we go out, so having a bag to carry both of our shells, licenses, gloves etc. is why the deluxe bag is perfect. Strong straps!! Other blind bags have weak straps, break every time. Really like the waterproof clear pocket on top...perfect for phone, hunting regs, lighters. Would definitely recommend this blind bag to any avid waterfowler!",
