      "text": "After a number of years using a different pair I was hesitant to replace them until it was necessary. Spent a long time searching for a good for the price pair until I found these. Well worth it. Great clear audio for party chat on PlayStation and gives great all round audio for gaming. The mic being muted when it's raised is a great feature. The pads are also really soft, spent many hours raiding with them on and still comfy. Also useful that they plug directly into the controller as it gives freedom to move about and stay part of the chat whilst not losing signal like wireless headphones.",

Absolutely useless, I'm shocked at how bad they are given the brand, think I'll go back to the cheaper chinese models as these are just really really bad and not even worth a quarter of the price.",

Decently heavy (but sturdy with it) they feel like they will last a long time. Sound is good, the cushioned pads work well and it's comfortable enough to wear over a decent gaming session. Comes with a splitter cable if you need it too. Can't comment on mic quality yet, but I like the way the Mike rotates up and turns off when doing so. Would buy again of needed.",

I particularly like the fact that the ear pads can be changed from leather to fabric so it doesnt matter what your preference is, its in the box! The microphone can be detached for when I am just listening to music or playing offine and there is a small cover piece to protect the connecter port in the headphones when you are not using the microphone. Having used some other Big Branded gaming headsets, I would buy this set everytime now. The quality is fantastic and they are incredibly comfortable.",

      "text": "Background: I've been using headsets for over 10years for playing PC games, listening to music & media consumption. Initially I used a TurtleBeach Wired set, then Corsair Wired, then Corsair Wireless. Review: This headset easily defeats those mentioned above. All had their plastic ear-hinge crack & shatter after extended use, hence the move to these metal-cup elastic style. Surprisingly these also have a much better seal around my ears than them, resulting in much less sound-bleed & a better overall experience. Cable is unnecessarily long, so I just left it tied up as it came.",

However I took a chance on these and they're surprisingly good! Solid build, nice clean and sleek design, comfortable to wear and mic has a satisfying click and easy to adjust. The sound is great and mic clarity is good. Only downside is a volume slider instead of a wheel, hence only 4 stars. I would recommend these for gamers and more general use. More discerning audiophiles might want something higher tier but at this price point it does the job perfectly.",

The volume/mic control does NOT work with the PS4 unfortunately, so you'll have to adjust the volume and mute yourself through the PS4's UI. With the PS4, you can either plug it into the controller with the jack cable, or into the PS4 through USB with the volume control thingy.",

I'm very happy with my choice, they are great for long gaming sessions.. i've worn them for hours and hours without feeling any sort of strain on my ears or head, which is pretty rare. My only gripe is that the connection from the jack cable to the usb soundcard is quite a loose fit.. and if you have the dongle floating in the air off your desk then you probably will have the jack come out just enough to lose audio once or twice. I suggest just clipping the dongle to the bottom of your shirt.",

Great audio quality and I love the versatility of them with the removable mic and audio card depending one what you use them for. I have them predominately in my PC, but have also used them with my PS4, Phone, Tablet and Switch. I've never really liked over-ear headphones, especially as I have a few piercings which can get a bit sore or irritated, but they are usually best for gaming. These have completely changed that feeling. I adore them and have raved about them to all my friends :)",

Another great feature is how well they block out other sounds (you can't hear anyone talking near you). I also find them comfortable to wear for several hours at least",

Not a complete nightmare for people who are careful and/or own a soldering iron but I no longer do and have killed headsets before in the above manner. So in summary, it is a really excellent headset. Just don't be clumsy, you naughty little sausage.",

Quality also feels really bad, especially on the cables, and it is not comfortable to wear at all.

This extends the cable even more. Comfort is excellent, even after several hours. Easy volume slider on headphone itself to adjust sound. Microphone can be switched off by moving upwards. Packaging and delivery where excellent!",

Also found the headset to not fit very well as it seemed a bit loose and would slip down from time to time and would rather have a headset which didn't need to be adjusted every time it would slip.",

I would rate this 10/10 but the \"one size fits all\" knocks it down a point or two. If you are thinking of buying, I would recommend to try find one in a gaming shop where you can physically fit it on. If you are going to be spending this amount of money I would need to know if it fits right first",
