DEET-based products are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for effective, long-lasting mosquito protection. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, DEET-based products pose no health concerns as long as they are used according to label directions. \n\nCutter wipes can even be used on kids, as the 7.15% DEET formula meets the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for use on children ages 2 months and older. \n\nAPPLICATION RECOMMENDATIONS\nUse just enough repellent to cover all exposed skin, but apply sparingly to your face, avoiding your eyes and mouth. Avoid cuts, wounds, or irritated skin. Skin reactions to using DEET-based products are rare. When applying to children, do not use Cutter All Family Mosquito Wipes on their hands. Wash your own hands after application, as DEET-based products may damage some synthetic fabrics and materials.\n\nThis formula will repel mosquitoes and other biting insects for up to two hours, but coverage length can vary if you get wet or if you're sweating excessively. Reapply if you are noticing mosquito activity around you again. You can use Cutter All Family Mosquito Wipes and sunscreen at the same time. Apply the sunscreen first, and then apply the insect repellent.",
