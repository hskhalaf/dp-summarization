Pros - the humidistat feature is great, I like that you can set it to be a specific humidity - it\u2019s easy to fill, unlike some humidifiers that are rounded on top and you can\u2019t set them down - the nightlight gives off a nice blue glow, not too bright, great for a kids room - it\u2019s very quiet Cons - I wish the nightlight could be turned on separately from the humidifier. My 5 year old woke me up at 4am because the humidifier had run out of water and turned off, so the nightlight turned off as well. Overall I\u2019m very happy with it.",

A single large dial is all that is needed to operate the humidifier, turns it on and controls the amount of mist required. A rotating nozzle allows you to direct the mist in a desired direction. The reservoir holds an ample supply of water for at least two nights use at the setting I used.The humidifier shuts down automatically when the water supply is depleted. That safety feature worked when I deliberately forced the issue. Equally important is warranty service in event you need it.

      "text": "I could not be more impressed with this humidifier. It holds a large capacity of water, easy to clean, and easy to use. A tank of water lasts about 3 nights, and it automatically shut off when the tank is empty. It comes with a cleaning brush, which is very handy for cleaning. I have allergies year round, and my symptoms get much better after I have the humidifier in my bedroom! I also like the feature that it displays the humidity. I use purified water from refrigerator's dispenser, so I don't need to buy distilled water separately.",

Controlling the RH with a \"budget\" humi was not doing it, was promised 30-50% RH and was barely able to pull more than 25%. Switched to TaoTonics due to the controller and boy oh boy!! Things worked for the best! This is the simplest and yet best working humi I've operated for a 3x3 tent. I will actually be ordering a 2nd unit for my harvest tent Happy Growing",

Haven't figured out how to use all of the various features, but only because I haven't needed to (e.g. Haven't used sleep mode because I don't find the small lights bothersome). It's helpful that it has a hygrometer which tells you the humidity level in the room. If you're going to use the humidifier on one of the higher settings, be sure that it's at least 2 feet off the floor (and I wouldn't rest it on anything wooden). On the higher settings, I found that things around it did get damp. All in all, I'm satisfied and would recommend this product.",
