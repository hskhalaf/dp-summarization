Designed for right and left handed players and comes with a handy cloth-like zip bag. I luv it!",

It's lightweight and fits perfectly in the Ogio Ozone stand bag. A larger putting mirror might be unwieldy in a crowded practice putting green. Cons: - The alignment lines show you straight-back-straight-through and inside-square-inside putter paths. What it lacks is the inside-down-the-line putter path which is the stroke I prefer. This is the most disappointing issue with this product. - It scratches easily, so I'm concerned about the durability of the product.",
