Spent so much money on ink that dries out soooo quickly if you don't use it, and once one is gone every single function stops working until you replace it yet again after, in my case, one use a few months prior (talking about printing 1 page and cleaning a nozzle twice). This poc is worthless and I'm throwing it away with full xl black ink, and the other 2 basically new cartridges, because it stopped seeing my red one....I've had enough",

I haven't even printed 1,000 pages - probably fewer than 700. A plastic gear in the duplexer unit snapped off, and would cost $40 to replace.

Scanning and copying are excellent and the replacement cartridges are so inexpensive, it's cheaper to run than my laser.",

But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure it in different ways? Now you can. Much like \u201cMPG\u201d ratings on new cars, there\u2019s now an industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \u201capples-to-apples\u201d comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry-approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for inkjet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \u201cout of the box\u201d (default) print speeds using \u201creal world\u201d printing scenarios, so you can be sure you\u2019re getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n * Do more \u2014 automatic 2-sided printing plus a 30-page, duplex Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of 1- or 2-sided original\n * 2x the durability \u2014 robust product design\n * Built-in wireless and Ethernet networking \u2014 easily connect to the network and share your all-in-one with others; includes Wi-Fi Direct\n * High-speed faxing in black and color \u2014 as fast as 3 sec per page; speed dial storage up to 100 numbers; fax memory up to 180 pages\n * Individual ink cartridges \u2014 replace only the color you need\n * Sharp documents \u2014 laser quality black text delivers crisp, high-quality proposals and brochures\n * Print more \u2014 Extra High-capacity inks available\n * Convenient \u2014 the included OCR software allows you to scan and save documents as text-searchable, editable PDFs.\n * PC-free printing \u2014 built-in card slots\n * PC-Fax \u2014 fax documents directly to/from your computer\n * Save paper \u2014 save up to 50% of your paper supply with automatic, 2-sided printing/copying\n * Save energy \u2014 uses up to 70% less power than laser printers\n * Product protection you can count on \u2014 phone support, without charge, for the life of the product; plus, get free templates and \u201chow to\u201d tutorials\n * Packaging Specifications (W x D x H) \u2014 Dimensions: Printing 17.7\" x 22.2\" x 12.1\", Storage 17.7\" x 16.8\" x 12.1\" and Weight 24 lb.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * WorkForce WF-3540 All-in-One\n * Instruction manual\n * CD-ROM with drivers & bonus software\n * Free sample paper pack\n * Power cord\n * Telephone cord\n * DURABrite Ultra Cartridges: Four 126-series: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow\n\nEPSON INK SUPPLIES\n * 127 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge, Extra High-capacity (T127120)\n * 127 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (Dual Pack) Extra High-capacity (T127120-D2)\n * 127 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge, Extra High-capacity (T127220)\n * 127 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge Extra High-capacity (T127320)\n * 127 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge, Extra High-capacity (T127420)\n * 127 DURABrite Ultra Color MultiPack, Extra High-capacity (T127520)\n\nEPSON PAPER SUPPLIES\n * Premium Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041257)\n * Bright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586)\n * Presentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062)\n * Premium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331)\n * Premium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727)\n\n\n\n\nECO FEATURES\n * Recyclable product\n * Save up to 50% of your paper supply with automatic 2-sided printing/copying\n * Uses up to 70% less power than laser printers\n * ENERGY STAR qualified\n * Epson America, Inc. is a SmartWay Transport partner",
