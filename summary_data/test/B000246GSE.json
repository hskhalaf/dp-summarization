      "text": "WARNING: Great concept and has worked well until today. The locking latch broke after about only 1 month. Now I have to try to get a replacement through Zojirushi. I certainly would find it unreasonable if i have to pay to replace the part. What a hassle. I wish this was not the case. Update: I called Zojirushi's customer service and as noted by other reviewers there is not a warranty for the locking mechanism only the thermal aspect of the container. Absurd. I should have noted this before purchasing. The plastic tab on the latch should be metal to avoid breaking so easily or designed to be replaced, if needed. Functionally flawed in that aspect. Money out the window.",

The bad is that when I use the bottom container for soup, it almost always winds up all over the place. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the gasket, but even when my son doesn't eat the soup, there's always a good amount of it that winds up in the bottom of the outer jar. To add to this, it's pretty annoying to have to dismantle the lower container after each lunch. the middle valve is not so bad, but I find myself having to jam something (a chop stick works well) into the container to dig out the gasket.",

      "text": "So I am very disappointed with my Bento Box. I love it, BUT, it already broke. I've had it for about two weeks now and the snap part on the lid to close the whole box broke so now only one side clicks in. It is also very small, so if it is something you plan on putting meals in for the whole day I would pack proteins/grains. I am just very sad it already broke ... I hate giving it three stars.",

I would advise (as per instructions) that you need to make sure that the soup bowl contains hot liquid at all time in order to create the heat retention. I've used it a few time since and there as been no leakage, packing my lunch at 6:30am and by 12:30 it wasn't piping hot but comfortably hot/warm to heat. This beats lining-up for the microwave and heating up your lunch. Reducing waiting time on a short lunch time and limiting the time you eat zapped food. And you get to eat home made healthy food and rightly portioned.",

My only complaint with it is that the \"main bowl\" is not airtight so storing something like pasta or chili which are a bit liquidy, might spill out. However when it did spill out there wasn't that much and it was easy to clean anyway.",

It's often helpful to use vinegar and baking soda when cleaning out some of the containers to get rid of lingering food odors. A month in, it's still in excellent condition.",

    "title": "Zojirushi Mr. Bento Stainless Steel Lunch Jar, Silver",
    "description": "Color:Silver\n\nZOJIRUSHI MR. BENTO STAINLESS LUNCH JAR\nLUNCH ON THE GO\nWhether in the office or on the go, you can take a healthier, tastier, more interesting lunch with you thanks to Zojirushi's Mr. Bento Stainless Lunch Jar. One of the most versatile lunch boxes you'll ever come across, the Mr. Bento lunch jar comes with four different containers that allow you to pack a multi-course lunch of both hot and cold items easily and securely. The jar itself is made of stainless steel, is vacuum-insulated and houses four plastic containers with lids. The large soup bowl comes with gasket-sealed lid to prevent messy spills and is specially insulated to keep soup hot. All pieces should be washed by hand with non-abrasive cleaning pads. Inner bowls are microwave-safe. A spork with its own protective cover attaches to the Mr. Bento lunch jar, and the jar itself has its own lid with lock and comes in a zippered carry bag with a strap for easy transport. \n\nMR. BENTO FEATURES\n * Vacuum insulation keeps foods hot or cold for hours\n * Durable stainless steel construction with excellent heat retention\n * 4 microwaveable inner bowls\n * Washable nonstick coated outer container\n\nGREAT FOR HOT OR COLD FOODS\nSIDE BOWLS \nThe Mr. Bento comes with two side bowls, one large 10.1-ounce and one small 6.8-ounce, that sit inside the lid. They are ideal for foods that should be kept room temperature, such as chips, nuts or snacks. The side bowls are not insulated.\n\nMAIN BOWL\nThe 15.2-ounce main bowl is designed to hold the main course. The outer container's vacuum insulation and the insulated lid of the main bowl help keep foods hot or cold for hours without reheating or refrigeration.\n\nSOUP BOWL\nThe 9-1/2-ounce soup bowl has a unique lid that minimizes leaks and is ideal for holding soups, dips, or fruit cocktail. It sits at the bottom of the outer container, where vacuum insulation keeps the foods hot or cold for hours.\n\nVACUUM INSULATION\nHow does it keep food hot or cold? With Zojirushi's renowned vacuum insulation technology, air between the two thin layers of stainless steel on the outer container is removed, creating a vacuum. Because there is no air, the temperature on the outside does not transfer into the container; keeping foods hot or cold for hours.\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nZippered carrying bag with strap; outer container with lock and lid; 6.8-ounce small side bowl with lid; 10.1-ounce large side bowl with lid; 15.2-ounce main bowl with lid; 9-1/2-ounce soup bowl with gasket, valve, and lid; forked spoon with cover and holder. \n\nFun colors to choose from",
