      "text": "The helicopter was a real (good) challenge for my grandson (age 7). It took him 6 hours, and he even skipped one of his favorite meals, to complete the assembly, asking for assistance once only on a technical point. He wanted to understand the physics of how the crank in the tail moves the blades and how the power can be transmitted to the two propellers. A real lesson with hand-on experience. One assembled, he quickly disassembled it top use some of the parts in other creations of his, reflecting his whimsy and creativity. Definitely a fabulous set for a young one.",

In addition collectible items with shipping labels attached to them will damage the box when removed.
