It is initially easy to dismiss its shortcomings like no bluetooth connectivity in the car, difficult wifi connections in hotels, screen not visible in daylight, camera not easily focusing, and the phone shutting down or crashing periodically, but eventually you will feel that enough is enough. I'm at that point, and I'm going to try the Moto X4, which is now about the same price.",
