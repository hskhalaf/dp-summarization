The pictures are one month post surgery with and without the product. It covers very well and is barely noticeable.",

The makeup soaks into the sponge more than applied to my face. But the concealer itself is pretty great. The makeup stays on a long time and conceals as it should, I just wish it was more of a lip gloss applicator.

I use 'light' color, I have no tan on my skin. Sponge tip is easy to use and blends nicely. I hope they don't discontinue, but they always do eventually. I'm on my 2nd tube, each lasted me about 2 months. Back to order more - I'm stockpiling this stuff!",

I'd heard from many sources that the Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles \"really works.\" I've used it for about a week now. I will say that this is the best under eye eraser I've ever found. Sadly, it doesn't completely erase them which is why I gave four stars instead of five. It's not really realistic to think anything will erase your eye circles. But that's what make up is all about: hope and promises. The price is good. I'd recommend giving this product a try.",

It goes on very light and smooth. I just use my ring finger to tap it until it is evenly distributed. I have also used it for a few age spots and actually, sort of all over my face. It's so light and doesn't feel heavy like foundation does. I will definitely buy more when I run out.",
