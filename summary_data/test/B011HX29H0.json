I've used it twice, the 1st time the grass was very wet and the battery lasted about 15 minutes, the second time the grass was dry and it ran 20 minutes. It is powerful enough to take down large weeds with a few passes and zips across the grass with no issues. It is easy to operate and very light weight. I would highly recommend this and if 20 minutes isn't long enough run time buy a second battery!",

Regret buying this item and would not buy again. Auto line feed is a poor design for this product and does not work most of the time.",

Lithium ion batteries are built to handle \"over-charging\" infinitely better than nickel cadmium batteries, but I still plan on charging it and then removing it. It's a little heavy but nothing crazy and it has enough power to do grass wacking along edging, minor weed control, etc. Go for something better if you have big jobs in store but, for someone just looking for basic use, this is perfect for your $.",

The show stopper was the units failure to feed trimmer line. Guess I'm gonna have to spring for a Stihl.",
