      "verdict": "The Razor Ice+ is designed by Saucony to tackle icy or wintry conditions. There is no doubt that the traction is absolutely insane, it just does not replace spikes or crampons. But, for trail running, wet and icy conditions are there for the taking. The shoe has quite a responsive ride with the presence of the Everun while a water-resistant upper should be a huge asset when running in the conditions this shoe is made for.",
      "pros": [
        "The fleece-lined upper of the Razor Ice+ keeps the foot warm and comfortable during winter",
        "The reviewers were unanimous in praising the traction of this shoe",
        "A built-in gaiter makes winter running more convenient as it keeps water and snow out",
        "A handful noted that it is quite light for a winter-specific shoe",
        "The shoe works fine when hiking, according to a small number of runners",
        "It felt responsive all throughout the runs of several runners",
        "The Runshield upper provides water-resistant protection",
        "It handles speed and distance with equal ease, according to a couple of expert reviewers",
        "The cushioning is excellent in the Razor Ice+, based on more than a few observations from reviewers",
        "The outsole lugs do not prevent runners from using the shoe on icy city streets or pavements",
        "Some runners highly-appreciated the unique aesthetic attraction of this shoe"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Saucony\u2019s claim of making ice irrelevant is not fully justified, according to several runners",
        "The price is expensive",
        "More than a few users had trouble getting their foot inside as the fit is quite tight",
        "The neoprene upper is very thin and suffered abrasions, even after a few miles, based on the comments of a few runners"

The shoes look cool, very light. Definitely water repellent because I washed/rinsed them under running water. They fit my narrow feet nicely with no pressure points. The only thing I wish they are is warm/er . My toes get cold when I go out and use them. But oh well, I live in the Midwest, we've had single digit temperatures lately.",
