For bench pressing I like the added hangars so I've got it set for benching and then can easily move for squats without any alterations.

During bench press, when you want to return the bar to the original position, the bar will clip the overlap of the two layers, causing inconvenience. Overall a good product for the price.

Getting a bench to bench press on soon and im sure itll work out jus great. Better investment I've made so far for a home gym.",

I just leave the safety bar resting on the diagonal support and i have failed a rep once and they saved me.",
