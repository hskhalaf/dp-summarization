Most of the makers I have had were Cuisinart brands, but 2 were Keurig (one was the newest model) I love this machine and have not found any issues in the few weeks I've had it. I generally make a pot of coffee in the morning and use the single serve in the afternoon or evening. I have used several types of coffees and each one tastes great. It is easy to use and clean. Very happy with this purchase.",

The brewing mesh works perfect and saves you from buying filters as well as the kcup side for single serve loose coffe. Just clean the mesh filter and you're good to go! :-)",

The coffee does not stream out nicely into the cup. Instead it makes a mess spraying the machine, getting on the counter top , etc. horrible. Thought our first was defective so called amazon and they sent a replacement. Nope. This one is the same. Will be returning!!! The grinds on the top make a mess as well. Poor design!",

Amazon replaced the first malfunctioning pot easily and quickly. My faith has been restored in Cuisinart. Original entry: Former happy owner of DCC-1100 Cuisinart Coffeemaker which lasted 6 years with daily use. Loved it's reliability! Have used SS-15 for one week and it is leaking water from the bottom, plus Clean light is showing already (which seems way too early). Amazon makes the exchange easy, but I'm daunted by the inconvenience and loss of faith in Cuisinart.",

This is the third one we tried and they are all the same, one was even worst. Great idea to combine carafe with K-cup, just bad implementation. Don't purchase. Customer service said just to return it. After 3, I was not trying a fourth. If all three had the dispense problem, then quality control was inaffective",
