      "text": "I bought this camera for my husband and I to use when we go ice fishing. When the water is deep and we can\u2019t see the bottom, this works great to scout out the fish for us. We use it at well-below freezing temps and it works like a dream. The video we took doesn\u2019t do it justice. The picture is far clearer than we expected, especially for being underwater. The bright light also seems to attract fish, which is an added bonus. You can see a small school of fish swimming near the end of the video. Right after we finished recording, a large trout approached the camera, then bit our bait! We\u2019re glad we purchased this camera.",

Well, i was VERY pleasantly surprised when it surpassed all of my expectations. It is easy and intuitive to use and provides a great picture. And the lighting is fantastic. i was expecting it to not be very bright, but those LED lights bring light to everything you are looking at. Would buy it again in a heartbeat.",
