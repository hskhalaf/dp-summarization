I did some research and found out about a few types of restoration toolkits. Looking into reviews and ratings, decided to give this one a chance. Was a little bit sceptical but went ahead and ordered. Followed instructions precisely (I find it a little bit too detailed and confusing to a degree) but results were surprisingly good. Well, better to see it once (Pictures attached) If I would do thing again, I would not hesitate to use 3M product; highly recommend this product.",

This is more expensive than most but VERY effective at restoring the lens to excellent clarity. It also saves your arms from aching for the next 2 days. Good instructions and excellent results. Once you get the technique down, the process goes pretty smoothly. Seems to be needed about every 1.5-2 years on our cars here in Colorado. I no longer waste time, money, or arm torture on the other systems.",

Terrifying. Now though, not only have I used this restoration kit but I also bought the ultra bright lights so that I can see EVERYTHING. Even how my headlight line is completely uneven *sobs*",

I did buy one kit for each headlight as another reviewer suggested. If I had not done that I would not have had enough material to do the job. Had never attempted polishing the headlights before but kit was easy to use, good instructions, and it worked. I would also suggest an electric drill NOT a battery drill, the battery drill will not be able to keep up with the demand. Highly recommended!",

I only used two of the gold (500 grit) pads and they are still usable. When using the gray (3000 grit) refining pad, make sure you mist with water frequently. I used a wet cotton towel to wipe the lenses frequently, so I could see the progress. Do not forget to put some lens sealer on, to preserve all that work.",
