I can't stand headphones that crush my ears. These are not indestructible, unfortunately I've been through two pairs of these already and may need to order a 3rd one. The plastic that connects the headset part to the speakers is either very flimsy or my head is too big and has broken on me twice (after a good year or two of daily use). Right now mine is being held together with crazy glue but I've already had to reapply.",

They are not a small unit. They appear solid in the frame and you simply will not want to take them off. Cord is convertible to plug into your computer. My studio setup is finally complete with these. I hear thing I do not hear on my monitors. I went up to the 900 based on several trusted reviewers comments that the upgrade was significant in sound.

Did not need an equalizer. Could not find a better pair in this price range. A wonderful listening experience while plugged into my Echo Dot and mp3 player. I prefer Beats EP over more expensive Beats, but they cost almost three times these JVC. My old Sony MDR-V600 did not have enough bass, and the new Sony have too much. I definitely prefer this model over their HA-RX700. Wish they came with a coiled cord. Oh, well.",

The sound quality is as good as I've ever heard being a cheap headphone enthusiast, they provide moderate isolation. There was a very rare buzzing plastic sound but it seems to have gone away. The ear cup padding and material is certainly budget and does not breath. After about 60 hours of use they are still holding up and comfortable enough for extended use. Given the choice again I would try a different set, maybe the Sony MDRV6 (~$80), but for now the JVC's are good.",

There are some major drawbacks, like the lack of a removable cord. But i've replaced the jack on my pair twice in 4 years (I used to be pretty hard on them, but now these headphones are my babies), and even still these are incredible phones. There is a burn in time, I recommend just skipping the whole blaring hip-hop in them and just letting the burn in happen naturally. There will come a point when you notice that these phones are provide you about as beautiful sound as you could expect for the price.",

Up until then, Sound quality was clear, and the headphones were incredibly comfortable. Also, the cord was incredibly long, which was a bonus. It is also worth mentioning that while these headphones are over-ear, they let out so much sound that they may as well be used as speakers.",

Can't do more than 4 or 5 consecutive hours with these. Essentially functions as noise cancelling though because of the density and the over the ear foam that insulates your ears. Has a great low end response but need to use an EQ frequently to bring it the level I want it. You definitely need to break them in though, at first there was almost no bass response when I took them out of the packaging.",

Pros: Sound quality for music/movies is much better than all my previous gaming headsets Price is amazing. Build quality is higher than expected, but not incredible. Comfy even after 5-8 hours use. Cons: Sound/direction awareness is noticeably lower, but still exists. Kind of large.. Conclusion: 9.5/10 would buy again.",
