My only complaint is if you're looking for actual practice exams, you're going to need another book - this one has practice questions throughout and then access to just 1 full length text online.",

Will help to find your weak spots so you can work on them. Other books we have been using over the years has more than one test in them. I find this is not a stand alone test prep but great to use in addition with other books. Overall can't hurt and why not invest a bit in order to help boost that score since so much rides on it these days.",

This book is a good resource at a good price. Highly recommended.",

The SAT book I got has 3 practice tests,so she can get a feel of live testing. Overall, not a bad book, especially if you catch it on a sale price",

After he finished the book copy he liked being able to access the online test. This book has current skills and I recommend this book.",
