They feel nice on the foot, rather soft in texture but with a light compression that leaves my feet feeling energized and peppy. Since there isn't a heavy band at the ankle there isn't anything to cut off circulation or get tight around my calf or ankle the way some sporty socks can. These socks are fun to wear daily or at the gym, although they aren't really padded like you often see with gym or trail socks. They're fun and totally wearable depending on what you need a sock to do though.",

This is the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars. It's not hard to ensure your ad images are accurate.",
