Not much of a rise on the stamp head. I haven't tried them on thick metal so they may work for that. Holding them perfectly vertical is a challenge, so I am considering making a thick plexiglass holder for their use.",

My husband bought this set for me as a Christmas gift. It is a great set for beginners like me. It includes all the letters as well as numbers 0-9. The box that they come in is very nice. I have not tried them on anything harder than small jewelry pieces, but so far they are working as expected. Highly recommend!",

Oh well. Me- ..... Conclusion- They look awesome. The storage box is legit. Just that we never actually tried them out because she wanted to use them as a stamp for cake decorations.",

I wrapped each with masking tape - marked what it was and put an arrow down on the top side. This may seem easy enough to figure out but when your doing 800 keys with different codes this greatly made it easier and quicker with no mistakes or upside down marks!",
