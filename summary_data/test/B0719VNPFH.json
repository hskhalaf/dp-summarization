However, the sleeves were plenty long - I did see short sleeves as one review. They would NOT have been a problem, had it fit! It also seemed like a nicely-made jacket.",

I brought both sizes, 8 and 10 because I was unsure. 8 felt a little snug so I went with the 10. I am almost 5'10'', 140 lbs. Felt the 10 was a little longer. Did not ride up.
