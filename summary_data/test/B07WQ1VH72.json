They wanted an iPad or a Galaxy Tab, but didn't have the money or were too cheap to get one and for upset when they realized what they'd bought. If you understand what the Fire is, an Amazon digital content delivery device with some tablet capabilities, you'll be thrilled with what it can do. If you're trying to find a cheap version of a Samsung or Apple tablet, keep looking because that is not what this is and you'll just be disappointed.",

I had a concern about the sound quality before receiving it but the sound quality is very good. The charge time is fast and the battery holds charge for a long time.

I downloaded the Chrome app so occasionally I'll go to webmail and FB since I prefer a larger screen than my phone. My daughter-in-law also bought one and we both agree: it is not as user friendly as my Samsung was or her iPad was.",

New Fire HD is bit lighter but for some reason, it feels like it weighs more than HDX, probably because it is smaller but thicker so it is more difficult to hold with one hand. With HDX versions out of Amazon's plans, I will be looking for a book reader of better quality from other brands.",
