Most other cutters have a small gap at the bottom edge of the cutter ... so small wires get into the gap ... and don't get cut. It was frustrating, because you have to take the time to line up the wire to avoid the gap. But with these Irwins, you just slide the wire in ... and snip! Saves alot of time!",
