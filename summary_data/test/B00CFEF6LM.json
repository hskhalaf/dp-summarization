      "text": "Unfortunately, I am not able to return this because it was inadvertently left behind at our Company outing (translation: it was dumped in a garbage pail). After spending time getting the net etc set up in the sand, we discovered the ball was damaged and would not inflate. Since we were at a clambake at the ocean, at night, there wasn't time to ride to a brick and mortar store to purchase another ball. So our annual beach volleyball game--which is always lots of fun--wasn't held. I wish I could return this item, but on principal--the next best thing is to write a review about the complete lack of quality. It is not worth the time or effort or money.",

The stakes at the bottom of the net were not sturdy and snapped in half from the wind (there was no storm or large gusts) the yellow disks did nothing to anchor it down. The smaller stakes attached to the strings were also useless. We had 4 intelligent adults attempting this and tried many different tweaks, including borrowing a sand drill from the umbrella man, to no avail. This was a birthday gift that left the recipient frustrated and disappointed. Possibly the worst item I have ever received from amazon.",

    "description": "Test your skills around the net with the Triumph Beach Volleyball Set, sure to provide hours of fun at the beach, camping, or any outdoor event! The set includes all you need to set up a volleyball game in the sand. The 32 ft. x 32 in. net features a scorer and mounts onto two 1.5\" diameter three section powder coated steel poles with two pole caps and pole anchors to dig deep in the sand. Four sand anchor plates and four ground stakes with rope are also included to ensure the net stays upright during play: bury the anchor plates about a foot deep into the sand - the weight of the sand will hold them down and keep your net stable; use the ground stakes to adjust the net so it stands straight. Once the net is up, inflate the official size and weight volleyball using the included inflating pump with needle, and let the game begin! When the fun is done, all parts fit neatly into the included carrying bag with handles for easy transportation and storage.",
