I would have given these at least 4 stars, in fact I was ready to order another color but I wore them in wet grass 4 times and my feet were wet. The first time only my left foot was wet, the next 3 times both feet were wet. I don\u2019t know if I just got a bad pair, maybe, so I wouldn\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t try them, especially with Amazons great return policy, which is what I did, return them.",
