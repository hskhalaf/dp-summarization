      "text": "I bought these for playing airsoft, the range you have with adjusting for different sized guns is perfect! My current pistols are not replica models and so are somewhat short and bulky, but it fits that gun just as easily as it fits a real steel .45. It does take some work to get the fit just right, but if you have patience you will love the results. Can't beat it for the price! The only, admittedly nit-picky, downside is the mag pouch is not as adjustable as everything else and on a bulkier pistol can get pretty tight. Considering that is the only bad thing I can say, definitely worth the buy!",
