The microphone was completely useless when behind my head. I've found this to be the case for the JayBird series as well, but with those I can move the wire to the front of my face, but with these the memory-wire prevents that completely.

JLab's warranty requires consumer to pay S&H and wait for approval of coupon and then re-delivery of new item (totally a week or more in back and forth). Unacceptable, since I can just return these and order another (different) pair in 2 days. When these were working, the sound was fine, if a bit tinny, even by earbud standards. Paired easily with S6 edge and laptop. Charge time was a bit long, but okay.",

Sound quality is a D and Bluetooth range is an F. I\u2019m not even able to have my phone in my pocket without interference. The only way these work is it I hold my phone in my hand while walking. Very disappointed. I want to like these but my experience has been terrible. DONT BUY.",

The audio quality and comfort are a solid step down compared to Jaybirds, but the the battery life makes it a much better set of earphones for me. I no longer have to take my earphones off and charge them during the day. The burn-in period was roughly 2 days of full charges. They sounded awful initially, far worse than the stock earbuds Apple packages with iPhones, but the sound warmed up considerably since then and is adequate for outdoor or noisy office use (my intended purposes). I really cannot ask for more considering the price is right.",

    "description": "Style Name:Wired| Colour Name:Blue/GrayEPIC, Earbuds Reimagined. Revolutionary Fit. Radical Sound. 8 Years. 1 EPIC pair of earbuds. That's right. The EPIC is the result of eight years of engineering, research and design. They're the new bad boy of sound - and they were created directly from customer feedback, reviews and industry know-how. 1,000 ways to rock. Comfortably. We straight ran out of ways to make old technology comfortable. So, we got innovative. Introducing Cush Fins, the revolutionary earbud system that guarantees a perfect fit and ear-lapping comfort. Coupled with seven gel tips, Cush Fins give you 1,000-plus formulas to fine-tune your listening setup. Whoa, this is big. Sound not forgotten. Just because they're comfortable doesn't mean they won't rattle your globe. The EPIC uses C3 technology to deliver clean, crisp sound no matter your flavor of music. Drench your ears in vibrant highs and song-defining mids - all delivered through JLab's high-performance 13-mm drivers, the largest driver we've ever packed into an earbud. Perhaps. But how epic would these earbuds be if they weren't built to last? Featuring a universal mic and simple track control, the flat, tangle-free cable offers additional strength when things get messy. Seriously, we tested these during a death match with a cobra, puma and liger. OK, no, we didn't. But they're pretty dang strong.",
