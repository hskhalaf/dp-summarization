Inside, there are large bits of dried fruit that I cut down to size. Large pieces of dried fruit cause problems with a gliders diet and increase fighting between gliders and I am surprised the company doesn't know better. In addition to the dry food, I also need to give her a vitamin supplement or she starts loosing her hair. I have had my glider for 6 years.",
