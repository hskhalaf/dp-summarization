I used to perform waxes professionally and I can tell you that these are not professional quality products. If you know anyone that has a license have him buy you a pot from a beauty supply store I would say go ahead and do that. Unfortunately out of convenience I just ordered from Amazon Prime so I didn't feel like going to the store.",

The wax did nicely remove all hair I am just not happy with the workability and texture of it.",

I have very thick facial hair, it's been almost 2 weeks since I used the Slow Grow lotion and the few hairs that have come in are very small and thin, almost invisible! I'm in total awe and will definitely be buying more of the lotions! <3",
