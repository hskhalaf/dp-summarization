For small batches, taking 250ml can mean you're not going to get enough headspace if you don't return it. If you DO return it, you introduce the possibility of contamination or aeration. The hydrometer has PLENTY of room in the flask. I think having a more narrow flask would be a good improvement.",

Used to measure OG (beer - pre-fermentation) first time yesterday and it made the process SO much easier than putting old hydrometer directly in fermentation bucket. I use a spigoted bucket, so took samples as water added until OG was at target. Also appreciated the helpful temperature adjustment cheat sheet. If I screw up and happen to break this well made set, I would buy it again! Only reason for a 4 on \"Easy to read\" is due to my eyesight, not the product itself as represented.",
