Before, people just saw me as a vaguely geeky Star Wars nerd... just another face in the crowd. Now I'm master of the galaxy! (The quality was also much better than expected... good use of Republic Credits.) The only downside of it is I know have the awkward job of somehow breaking the news to these women that I lied and am not, in fact, the real Darth Vader. Or just maintaining the charade forever. Either way I'm in a tough spot.",

This is a two piece helmet and they simply placed the top part of the helmet too far backward making the brow ridge look ridiculous. I got this for my son for Halloween and while it was a little hard to see through the eye pieces (not as clear as sunglasses even) and heated up a bit, it completely looked the part and his costume was awesome. Flat out. For the price THIS is the one to get.",

There was a bit of unfinished plastic that scratched me above my eye when put the mask on and took it off, but maybe that added to the authenticity given Anakin's scar?",

I was skeptical upon ordering because the picture made it look a little goofy, however, it looks more true to the movies in person. If you have the time for modification, this could potentially be a great mask!!",

Once you get used to the way it fits its fine. The only reason I didn't give all 5 stars is the inside of the mask, the eyes, fog up a little obscuring my vision.",
