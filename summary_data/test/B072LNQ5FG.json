      "text": "This beach blanket is fantastic!! Love the soft feel. It's not the usual microfiber you'd expect, because I usually don't like the feel of most microfiber towels. This one is like butter. It's also thin enough to go in my beach bag along with a similar towel with plenty of room for anything else I need. It has pockets so you can put things in it to weight it down - we used our flip flops. I've talked about this blanket for 3 days now and everyone is tired of hearing how wonderful it is!! I could do a commercial on it - that's how much I love it! Oh and the colors are so vibrant!",
