It sounds punchy and clear. It also gets really loud even under 50% volume. Battery life is pretty good. And the lights are what make it really cool in my opinion. It has 4 preset light effects and you can make your own effect via the JBL connect app. The only negative I found is that it\u2019s a bit of a fingerprint magnet. Overall, I highly recommend this speaker to anyone who wants great sound quality as well as a light show to go with their music.",

Going to have to return and buying an older model of the pulse so I can pair it with my JBL boom box, which I only got last year. Just save your time and money if you have any of the connect or the connect+ models don\u2019t buy the newer JBLs",
