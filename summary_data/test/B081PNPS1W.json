Can switch the rotation direction, can adjust speed. It removes most of the callus and later I can use the callus filer to get rid of the rest.",

You have to use it for like 7-10 minutes per nail just to get through it and you can't hold it on your nail for long periods of time or it gets super hot and burns your nail bed. Overall it is what you could expect for how cheap it is. Just a cheap product overall.... not very high quality.",
