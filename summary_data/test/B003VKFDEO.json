Clean up was easy. I do wish it came with an extra jar so that you could use one to store extra paint and one to run water through the sprayer.",

Only caution is that you need to beware of overspray, make sure you tape and drape stuff very well otherwise you will have some extra clean up.",

Always dilute your product to avoid blockage and splattering. 3. Regulate the flow to avoid overspray. 4. Play with the nozzles and try different nozzles with different products. 5.

      "text": "This sprayer is great! Having never used a sprayer before, I was hesitant...but after one use I am planning several paint projects. I stained my outdoor fencing--over 220 feet of 6' tall wood fenced-in under 3 hours. The cleanup was easy too-- actually, easier than cleaning brushes. The ONLY downside is the frequent refilling of the paint cup, but that is completely outweighed by the ease and speed of using this sprayer...plus, I avoided the strain of using a brush or roller. I am very pleased with this purchase!",

A couple of years ago I purchased a Wagner HVLP paint sprayer and was quite pleased with it. However the HomeRight C800971 HVLP paint sprayer will spray thicker paint and it's much easier to clean. I would recommend getting 150ml Measuring Syringe, greatly reduces waist when transferring paint into the sprayer. I would also recommend getting the Homeright C900097.M Super Finish Max Container and Lid, White and Blue. Just read a few reviews and you'll see why.",

This causes large amounts of overspray and finish problems. 2) As some others have stated,it's difficult to clean. Finish/paint in the suction tube can be difficult to remove. The provided tube brush isn't long enough to clean the whole tube. 3) The design with the motor on to makes it difficult to get into tight spaces such as the inside of cabinets.",

I was more concerned about the motor going out, but it didn't. I finished the house up and cleaned it out really good. I definitely got my money out of it. However, I think I'm just going to keep it for stains and thinner liquids.",
