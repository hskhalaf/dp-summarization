It was hard to find signals so I had to place it in weird spots. So after much stubborness of having to buy a new one I finally broke down and did just that. Well I can get signals in the most closed spaces so that tells me it has a strong antenna to capture signals. It's cute and I love the lights on it. It's worth the buy and much cheaper than buying it from the clear retailers.",
