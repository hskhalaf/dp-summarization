It's a very bright picture and very colorful and clear, not as clear as a 4k tv, but it's a 12 foot screen.. I also wanted to comment about gaming. I don't experience any picture lag or jitters or anything undesirable except my next sentence: The projector is LOUD. The fan is always screaming. Yes, I've cleaned the filter. I would buy it again if I had to buy another projector because I'm happy with its performance and reliability. It's just so loud..",

We have it ceiling mounted and use it to project web based content which means the source device needs to be connected to the internet with wifi, thus making it necessary to connect to the projector with HDMI rather than the wifi that the projector emits.",

We're running it on about a 10ft wide screen that we made ourselves from \"Carl's\" screen materials which you can google if you're interested. For $80, we now have a perfect screen and saved a ton of money. With the lights off, this really looks great, it's not movie theater bright, but it's very good.",

Not that expensive either. Love that I can just turn it off and unplug it immediately without needing to wait for a cool down cycle like older projectors. Convenient size and simple operation. This projector does everything I want and I'm a pretty demanding projector user having used dozens of others over the past decade. This is the best portable projector I've used so far.;",

I got it cause I needed HD and I wasnt able to locate any other brands compatible to this. However, I believe Epson has discontinued production on this model and Im not aware of any HD replacements theyve made as yet.",
