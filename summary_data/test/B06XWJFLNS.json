      "text": "Excellent large tv for tight budget. Color accuracy is spot on out of the box when using standard mode. Colors are vibrant and contrast is very good for the price. Wish the TV was a little bit brighter but that is a minor con. Also, I see a very slight hint of motion blur when watching football but that is also a slight con for this price. Overall picture quality is exceptional. I'm coming from a history of only using Samsung and Sony TVs and projectors. This TV is definitely better than any previous Samsung TV I've owned. Would definitely recommend this TV for watching movies and tv shows. Sharp, vibrant colors and high native contrast picture.",

Otherwise by the symptoms you\u2019ve explained you need to have the tv repaired. I would recommed taking the tv to a local tv repair shop.\u201d When I told them they dont stand behind their products for an obvious defect, they replied, \u201cVizio stands behind their product with a 1 year manufacture warranty.\u201d I think a tv that is over $1000 should last longer than 2 years.",

Randomly drops the startup page and just hangs on a black screen, then requires you to load an app and then exit it in order to get to the actual home page. This is pretty much the only way to get to the home screen now upon start up. Rediculous. I know it's a cheap tv, but this thing shouldn't even be on the shelves. Total p.o.s.",
