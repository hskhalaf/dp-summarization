I'm very satisfied with the purchase & if there was an option for 10 stars I would've given it . It came on time in pristine condition. The watch is perfect & looks very sharp on my wrist I was a bit skeptical about the size 42mm but I was proven wrong . In the past I always wore a 48mm to 50mm but in sport(DIGITAL) watches . My next watch will be a Tag Heuer or Edox & Amazon has the best prices.",

This one is Quartz so the time keeping is excellent, but what's great about this watch is that it keeps the date concurrent to the month you are in, even with leap years, so you only need to adjust daylight savings. The strap quality is so so, but the detailing and feel of the watch itself is excellent.",

With a perpetual calendar and an elegant flair, this watch to me is top of its class. The watch itself and the experience you get by reading the novel-like add on (which explains the history of Tissot) gives you not only a great first-watch experience but also an appreciation of what you're getting. I have no complaints to give so far and hold Tissot in high regard thanks to this purchase.",
