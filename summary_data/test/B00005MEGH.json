Some like thinner blades, some like sharper, some like duller, etc. I don't really like this knife. It's a well respected brand, but I don't like how it feels in my hand. I should have tried it in store more. And I don't like the thicker blade. I like the thinner blade on the Victorinox paring knife. It didn't come super sharp, but it hasn't really dulled much from when I bought it.",

After receiving this knife I didn't realize my other knives are as dull as they are, I had to order a knife sharpener to get them as sharp as the new pairing knife. The knives are great, I couldn't be happier with them.",

I have number of calaphalon 4.5 inch paring and 8 inch chef and even tried 3.5 inch paring knife of calaphalon. Calaphons were good but these are excellent. I am now a huge fan of forged knives by wusthof. All my future knives are going to be Wustof. It went through cucumber and even a bit ripe tomato like butter. The blades are super sharp. Combine that with maneuvering on a 3.5 inch. This is the best one I have ever used. I have tried calaphalon forged and henkels (sheet ones) and so on in the past, there is no comparison.",

This knife has become my most used kitchen tool next to my 8-inch chef knife, and it was a true struggle to prep meals without my trusted paring knife. We eat a lot of vegetarian meals and so a good knife is essential in cooking for me with fresh veggies and herbs. You will not be disappointed in your purchase...unless someone throws it out with the potato peelings...keep an eye on it. Truly a GREAT knife!",

I slice my vegetables, summer sausage, cheeses, and of course fruit using this knife. After 5 months of daily use it's still sharp (without ever sharpening it). I cannot recommend a paring knife other than this one. In addition to great performance, the knife has a great feel in the hand. If you're considering this knife, go for it and be happy like me.",

It is light weight, the weight is all in the handle so it gives you great control of the blade. It slices through nectarines and cherries like butter, and lemons like it's.. well.. also butter.
