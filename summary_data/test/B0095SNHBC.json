My first unit is about 5+ years old with no problems, second one is brand new. What I don\u2019t like about the product is the same as the Insinkerator, you can\u2019t get repair parts, so what should be a $3 set of \u201cO\u201d rings necessitates buying an entire new unit, WTF.

The new one is working so far, but I think the appliance without moving parts should last more than 3.5 years, especially if you charge that much for the unit that costs under $35 to manufacture. At least offer longer warranties, like some other companies.",

However, the most frustrating thing was that the parts supplied to connect the faucet to the tank did not match the tank. After several frustrating hours of trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, I finally realized that the connections for the faucet and tank would not match. I returned it, purchased a different brand at Lowes and had it installed in 45 minutes.",

I am absolutely thrilled to NOT hear the ISE constant noise and sputtering! This brand is quiet and does not sputter. Go for it, bet you'll be as pleased as I am!",

There aren't any female x female fittings available at Home Depot or Lowes. I was able to find a 12\" Dishwasher Hose that had the correct fittings on each end. I is a little awkward installing a length of hose to another length of hose, but it did the trick. If you need some extra length, you can get longer lengths.",
