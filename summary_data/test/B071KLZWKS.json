      "text": "I fell in love with the look/style of this table... It was the perfect thing for our home. After saving up and discussing it, my husband and I decided to finally buy it. It's extremely heavy/sturdy. However, we discovered that the top is not actual finished wood, it's a cheap plastic-like coating which has started to CHIP OFF after only having it a few days. We have not been overly rough with the table. An expensive table like this one should be able to hold up to a lifetime of simple family dinners. I wish we would have known prior to purchasing and putting hard earned money into a poorly made product.",

It looks absolutely horrible. The quality is terrible! Durability is zero!!! Definitely do not purchase this set if you want it to last more than a few weeks!",

I'm trying to get the appropriate parts to replace it and am having difficulty contacting anyone. I did buy the protection plan for the furniture, and my claim was automatically denied. I'm trying to get information on why and will update the post if I get more information. Given the inconsistency of the parts Ashley uses, I don't think I'd buy from them again, but I certainly wouldn't buy if the warranty won't even cover as much as a table leg.",
