This kit comes with a dry erase workbook, instructions for leveling each activity and enough hands on items. The instructional does a great job of breaking down each learning or experience level for the materials and the dry erase workbook was a treat. This kit is best for 3-5 but my 2 yo can do some of the Level 1 stuff. This kit will last a while",

The color dice game is still a favorite of my kiddo's two year after purchase, and she still regularly plays with the little people, buttons, and letters.",

One thing I was worried about is in the other reviews it was mentioned that the shoelace string could not fit through the letters but my son and I have no problems with this so maybe it was just a defect because we have no issues with this at all.",
