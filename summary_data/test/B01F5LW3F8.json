Ability to plug into a tv to get the words on the screen (with CDG), fun lights, 2 microphone capability, and auto voice control. Feels a little cheap, microphones can overdrive a bit, and the volume is not super loud, but All in all it was a good deal if it continues to work for a long time as it does out of the box. See my video for a more complete review. I will apologize in advance for the amateur nature of the video, and my lousy singing. :) NOTE: My video won't upload. I think it's too big?? Will try again at some point. Sorry...",

If one person puts their mouth on the mic while singing and the other puts an ear right up to the speaker, you can faintly hear that something is coming from the mic. What a piece of junk.

We used it and it worked fine it said on the Shelf for about a year and out of nowhere it no longer reads CDs and does not work. I went online and there is no product support to address this issue. I'm very disappointed that I cannot even exchange it or get my money back",

I would highly recommend a second microphone, since your child will want to sing with siblings or friends.",

      "text": "I RARELY give negative reviews but this company produces really defective machines and does not stand behind them (their warranty is only 90 days). This machine did not even last a year. Initially, I thought it was just that we had a defective one, but then we saw friends who also had it and theirs had similarly broken very quickly. I called customer support and spoke with Jackie, who was completely unhelpful - just suggesting we purchase additional products to try to trouble-shoot it. I am extremely disappointed in this company, it is disappointing for our children and is just putting more cheap, plastic junk into the planet, so I want to let other customers know to BEWARE. Thank you",

The door to the disc drive doesn't click to close or latch, it just sets down. The player would play one song and then I'd get the error. Called the 800 number and they said it's defective and to send it back. Just annoying.",

Plus you have to pay for each song you want to download. We found it much easier to just hookup our ipad and play songs for free off of youtube. We also had to buy a new microphone because this one did not work. It kept fading in and out.",

Had to open the whole box to see what was in there. But for the most part, I feel it was a great deal and my grandson loved it so that\u2019s all that matters.",

The website that you sign up on has many songs but it will only play 40 seconds of the song. This will be very expensive if you want a nice collection of Karaoke songs. I can't get the TV to stream the song from the phone when hooked up to the Karaoke machine. Otherwise you could just play song from you tube that have lyrics, on your phone. But then you have to look at the phone not the TV.",

There's nothing worse than having a disappointed child on their birthday. Returning for a refund and will purchase somewhere else.",
