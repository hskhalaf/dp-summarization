The excellent durable sole and cushioning. Durable leather upper - Warm and protects from the elements unlike all of this fashionable primeknit and flynit shoes. Allows one to be on their feet all day, unlike the other trainers previously mentioned. Subtle branding keeps the trainer lowkey and smart, therefore allowing one to wear the trainer in various settings with various outfits. So nice I would buy them twice. So I rotate pairs on alternate days to prolong the life of the trainer.",

They are so very comfortable. I haven't worn this pair yet as the weather is still dry. The pair I am wearing now are beginning to leak and let in water. I wear these shoes all the time. They are tough, and will get me through winter, and then I will wear my old ones out in the spring on dry days. I am still using a 6 year old pair for D I Y and gardening! I will order a new pair in about 1 years time!",
