As you can see in the second picture the bottles will be projected outside the cabinet a lot which I dont like.",

This will take a time to assemble, as there are alot of parts and steps. I have assembled many different kinds of furniture including bookshelves, desks, tables, shelving, exercise equipment and storage units; and this assembly to longer than anything else I have ever assembled.

Oh, and one of the knobs was broken and just dangles there, and there is no number for new parts, I will probably have to go buy new drawer knobs.

The storage underneath is perfect for extra coffee supplies and the wine rack holds our favorite wines. Every visitor loves my coffee bar and wants to create them one, so happy I found it....",
