Cleaning the chain and inner parts is easy, putting it back together and tightening the chain easy also. I trimmed all our trees about 20 with no problems. Was liberating to not have to call a professional and spend big bucks. I like the fact it came in a case for storage.",

This tool is balanced fairly well and is incredible sharp out of the box. I've read complaints that say the oil leaks when stored.... the instructions say to drain the oil before storing, which I will do. Overall, I've very happy... within a few hours I tamed my overgrown garden.",

As I was using my pole saw today for the third time, the saw end pole disconnected from the rest of the pole. I found that the rivet that is supposed to hold the screw piece that interconnects the pole sections together had failed and the rivet had fallen out allowing the saw end to fall off the pole.

I think this has been a much better than having to pay someone to come trim them every time. It does ok with thicker branches but I'm not sure if I would take it to trunk of the tree. I like that it is versatile as far as length goes. It is a little heavy when it is all put together but manageable. It does seem to go through oil quickly so just keep an eye on it. I've gotten so much use out of it without issue so far!",
