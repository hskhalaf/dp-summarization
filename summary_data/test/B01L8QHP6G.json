There was not any instructions, any product key code, nothing. When I inserted the flash drive into my computer it had\"Windows 10\" on it with an installation file and a couple of other files on it. Nothing to indicate there was a FinalDraft program on the drive. I have applied for a refund and will never purchase anything from TNG Computers again.",

All things considered, it's pretty easy to learn because they include fully developed scripts, outlines, notes, etc. that give you a quick idea of how to use the program.) Once you master this stuff, you just tab and enter away, with only a few intermittent commands. You'll love it, but only if you really learn it.",
