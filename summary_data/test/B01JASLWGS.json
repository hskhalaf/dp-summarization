A couple of extraordinarily small Holy Basil seedlings emerged out of about 100 seed plantings, but they did not survive more than a few days. The rest of the basil varieties have been hardy.",

I received plenty of seeds to try different methods at a awesome price. First try was peat pods in a plastic terrarium. Not one of my Tulsi babies popped up. On to method number two: Potting soil, compost, and peat moss mix in the plastic terrarium. I love a challenge!",

      "Basil is seen as one of the most popular culinary herbs. The plants vary in height, from 6 inches to 24 inches tall and can be easily grown indoors or directly outdoors as well.",
      "Basil herbs are categorized as annual flowering herbs. The plants will establish quickly from seed, producing edible leaves through the warm months of summer. The plants will then wilt soon after the harsh winter frost arrives.",
      "All Basil seeds sold by Seed Needs are Non-GMO based seed products and are intended for the current & the following growing season. All seeds are produced from open pollinated plants, stored in a temperature controlled facility and constantly moved out due to popularity."
