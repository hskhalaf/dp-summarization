      "text": "This product is exactly what I was looking for. The dry brush clean sponge works wonderfully and helps make my morning makeup routine fast and more environmentally friendly (not using tissues and such to wipe makeup brushes while putting makeup on). The heart-shaped scrubber is not only cute, but effective. It can slide over your fingers to hold and then scrub the brush with the other hand. The three textures on the scrubber are also very helpful, as they allow use of the product on a variety of brushes. I use a spray brush cleaner containing rose water, and it works wonderfully with the scrubber. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wear makeup.",

I was hoping that it had some sort of cleaner embedded in it, but no such luck. It works well enough to switch from light colors, but definitely doesn't clean your brush enough to go from a dark color to a light color (these were also clean brushes).",
