It randomly crashes (freezes) at least once a week while I'm in the middle of a project, the express keys stop working at least once a day and I have to go into task manager to restart the Wacom driver services to get the keys working again, and at least a few times a week it cannot connect to WiFi after booting up - forcing me to reset both my modem and router before it'll pick up the signal again. If it weren't for these issues, I would easily give the Mobile Studio Pro at least 4.5 - 5 stars. It's great when everything is working properly.",

So if you have a project you created and want to show it to family or friends via casting... wont work. I think if you purchase another app something along the lines of cost 300$... you can cast to TVs. It's a shame they are down right greedy. I would have given them more stars.

      "text": "The tablet is nice overall, but my pet peeve is having to touch computational devices that get warm or hot. They should have moved the CPU or whatever is generating all of that heat to the top or the left of the tablet. The hot spot is in the absolute worst place it can be: right under your right hand while it's resting on the right corner while drawing. If you're left handed you lucked out. I have to flip this thing over where the buttons are under my right hand and set it on top of a platform so it doesn't touch my lap so I can use it somewhat comfortably. Extremely disappointed in this.",

I contacted customer support and they sent out a replacement with one-day shipping speed which is nice, but now I have to wait again and hope that I receive an actual working product. Not a first good impression right off the bat with this Pro. I'm more than skeptical now to say the least of this replacement one working without issues...",
