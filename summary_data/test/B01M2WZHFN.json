      "text": "I bought this for my cousins 21st birthday. Its pretty light weight and looks cool. I have 3 critiques tho... the pong ball holder on the underneath is made out of like pool noodle foam. Wicked flimsy. Also the joints where the sections of table unfold do not have a locking mechanism making it difficult to get upright by yourself. Last but not least the flag print that covered the table has printing errors, color mismatch and ink droplets, that im sure regular people wouldnt notice but i do that for a living so it bothers me. Its neat but cheaply made for the price. I added led lights underneath myself.",

You could make do with the plane 8 foot table but this makes it more fun. I also didn\u2019t feel bad about buying it because if you\u2019re not gonna use it for a party game it is also the perfect size to set up to serve food.",
