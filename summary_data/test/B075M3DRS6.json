I was going to make a YouTube video about it, well I\u2019m still making it only I am changing the title to companies you should not buy wigs from on amazon.",

Takes heat well and the curls stays. I think it\u2019s been more than six months. Since I bought it. I just washed it since I took it out. And it\u2019s back to life. Flowy, wavy, bouncy, and shiny. I use off name brand shampoo and conditioner. Nothing special. I do in planning to reinstalling my hair soon but as a u part wig. I didn\u2019t buy the closure so idk about them. But the bundles are great.",

I did a lot of searching and based on the reviews I decided to get this one. I must express how disappointed I am. This hair is VERY thin, it doesn\u2019t hold a curl, it\u2019s not true to its description. The hair is soft without smell, but outside of wearing it in a ponytail, I can\u2019t do anything else with it. I will NOT purchase again and I don\u2019t recommend",

There was a lot of lint in the hair. The wig was poorly made. There is a patch of fly aways at the top that continuously stick up no matter what you used to slick it down. Waste of money. Although it felt like a good quality of hair, the wig was absolute trash. Will not buy again. I would give no stars if I could.",

I am honestly surprised at its quality for an Amazon product. I gave it a 3 star for presentation because the hair came really frizzy. The team is very responsive and showed great concern for my frizzy hair compliant and gave me a solution . They really care about their reputation and giving QUALITY hair, will definitely come back again!!!!",
