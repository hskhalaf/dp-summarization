      "text": "Purchased this item from Amazon in January. Used once. My Son and I set it up this past week to clean and air it out. Found three of the pole pockets where the support poles were literally pushing through the stitching. Spent well over 350 dollars for a tent that I\u2019ve used ONCE. emailed Eskimo with photos and have not yet received a response. Very disappointed in the stitching for the support pile pockets. Hope they stand behind their product. UPDATE: No questions asked...Artisam replaced the shelter immediately. Had a new shelter shipped to my house free of charge the same week. Hoping the new shelter holds up.",

The netting for storage inside is perfect for hats, mittens, scarves, and things you don't want to set on the ice. Also has air vents which we have actually used on warm days with lots of sun. Great product with easy setup and so easy to transport. Pops up quickly and folds down quickly as well.",
