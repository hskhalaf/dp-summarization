      "text": "The Feisty Pets may have started out as a funny gimmick, but they're hilariously adorable. They look like an absolutely adorable plush toy... but if you squeeze them in a certain spot, they bare fangs and snarl at you! Perhaps not the best gift for a very small or sensitive child, but kids with a sense of humor and a fondness for fierce things -- or adults with a silly side -- will get a kick out of them. And they're very soft and nice to cuddle as well... provided you don't mind your cuddly creatures having a bit of a bite to them...",

Super cute/creepy, I gave my 1 year old the bear and he is absolutely in LOVE with it! He will pick it up and like growl at you when he wants you to make the bear have a mean face and everyone thought I was crazy for giving it to a baby because \"it's scary, omg\" but my kid adores it so much, he will carry it around and go to sleep with it! Great quality, awesome and unique gifts! Thank you!",

When certain children cannot express their heightened level, this little guy is a great tool and fun for any child to express how they are feeling when words are not available to them, at that moment. He bears his teeth, just as pictured.....When you squeeze the back of his head. Easy for ant child or adult to do.",

I have seen them all over since then in kids departments, but am hoping that she hasn\u2019t seen this before so there will still be a surprise. I was slightly concerned that I would receive the version with a tongue instead of pointy teeth, but fortunately he arrived with teeth. The plush is decent quality for the price and seems like he would hold up to being carried around and used as a puppet regularly.",
