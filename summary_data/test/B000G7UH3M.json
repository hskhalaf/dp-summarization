      "text": "I knocked this down a star due to marketing. 1) They don't include a power cord and 2) they designed the rubber baffle to make it quieter even though this angers most customers. The rubber baffle is designed to not let the water drain from the sink very quickly. This makes a water layer that keeps the sound from emanating from below. The water builds up in the sink and you get dirt rings on the side of the sink. When you force food down the chute the thing flicks garbage back at you as the baffle pops back into its normal shape. I fixed that problem by pulling the rubber baffle completely out and reinstalling it upside down.",

      "text": "This garbage disposal is high priced and worth every penny. It is so quiet and you will only hear a mild hum and no sink vibration. The insinkerator is heavy duty and does take a lot of space under the sink so make sure you have enough room. I was replacing an old insinkerator so it only took me an hour to swap out. This disposal has a 5 year warranty which is the longest of all the models. Very happy with purchase and ease of having it delivered to my door by Amazon",

I had an InSinkErator Badger before, VERY loud, this new Evolution Excel you almost cannot hear running. Truly a difference worth mentioning!
