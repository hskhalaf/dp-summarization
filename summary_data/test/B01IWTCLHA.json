Absolutely essential for that, as well as for sump pumps or sewer drains that are prone to clog. This model has a very impressive decibel level, but you really want that for something sitting in your basement. Also includes some nice touches, such as batteries, suction cups and double-sided adhesive pads. Easy to install.",

I bypassed both and just used electrical tape to tape the sensor to the main unit. Also the base for the sensor elevates the sensor a bit too high.

      "text": "I too saw the positive reviews and was disappointed when one out of the devices I received failed to work at all. A second one worked but would emit a low pop sound. It wasn't the low battery as I tried multiple batteries (New ones) and the sound persisted. The 3rd unit seemed to work but by that time I wasn't willing to risk having future issues so I will be returning them and look for something else. The units are inexpensive but seem poorly designed. The tolerances for the battery compartment are very tight and circuit board doesn't seem to be attached adequately.",

The noise stops and soon and you remove the sensor from water, and pull it out of plastic clip that's holding it, which is a good thing because trying to remove the batter is a big hassle. The design should really be changed to allow opening the unit to remove/replace the battery easier. Outside that they are pretty good.",

I bought another brand product as a further backup but I prefer this model with its wired sensor and remote mounted alarm. The volume level of the alarm is acceptable but a bit faint for my insulated ground floor utility room...this volume seems higher than the norm. I plan on testing these units regularly but so far I'm pleased with the purchase and would recommend the product and seller.",

As for any reviewers who said they couldn't get the battery in, just put the connector end in first and then the battery should slip into place. I tried the trick with a bir of toilet paper folded and inserted in the channel where the sensor is placing the whole thing on a paper towel and it works great. Device now is much more sensitive to a larger area.",

Not sure how it would work on the floor, maybe a bit of kleenex in the sensor area to wick up the water / alarm sooner?",

Hopefully I'll never know how they work in real time but from my test they are sensitive enough to detect small amounts of water, and loud enough to be heard throughout the house.

I put one in a partition of my basement near a floor drain but wasn't sure if I could hear it up on my third floor so I extended the siren device with common speaker wire to the entry floor in the house so it could be heard from any floor in the house. Inexpensive and good insurance to give you a loud heads up when unwelcome water strikes so you can get to the clean up fast. Would be nice if there was a wire extension kit available to move the siren device to further away locations.",

    "description": "In the U.S., water damage is the 2nd most frequently filed insurance claim and has accounted for more than $5 billion of claims each year in recent years. Property damage and monetary loss aside, a water-damaged property could also pose great health risks to its inhabitants, a truly nightmare scenario for homeowners. Thanks to the Instapark IN07A automatic water leakage alarm, a simple, inexpensive yet effective device, you now have a solution to minimize the risk of water damage and avoid its unpleasant aftermath. \n\nPowered by a single 9V alkaline battery (included), the IN07A features a main alarm unit with a 130 dB siren connected together with a water detection sensor by a 44\u201d long wire. When properly placed on the floor or any flat surface area to the monitored, the sensor will automatically detect any presence of water and trigger the main unit alarm to go off at 130 dB to alert the occupant to take immediate actions. Suitable locations to place the sensor include under-the-sink cabinet in a kitchen or bathroom, near a water heater, a sump pump, a toilet, a washer, a humidifier, an AC unit, or ice-making refrigerator. For added convenience, a bottom plate is included to help secure the sensor in place and lower the sensitivity if so desired. The main alarm is easily mountable as high as 44\u201d above the floor, on a flat surface with either its built-in suction cup or included double-sided adhesive foam tape. \n\nSpecifications: \n\nPower source: 9V x 1 (included) \nWire length: 44 inches \nDimensions: 2 \u00be X 2 \u00bd X 1 \u00bc inches (main alarm unit) \nWeight: 2.4 oz (without battery) \nBattery life: 2 years minimum \nSiren sound level: 130 dB \nMinimum detectable water depth: 1/32 inches\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box: \n\nIN07A water alarm, 3 of each\nBottom plate\nDouble-side adhesive foam tape pad\nUser instruction\nWarranty registration",
