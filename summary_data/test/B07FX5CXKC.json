Very easy to use, very comfortable, accessories are a nice bonus, only worry is I might fall asleep in it (warning with product NOT to do so).",

      "text": "I have been suffering from horrible neck pain the last few years due to a combination of stress, looking down when texting, posture and sitting at a desk. I did not find any relief until I tried The Neck Hammock. The Neck Hammock only takes a couple minutes a day, is so easy to use and has become apart of my weekly routine. It has relieved the neck pain and tension in my neck significantly. I am so thankful for the invention of this product!",

I have a desk job and have a very tight neck and shoulder, the moment I rest on it, it felt relief. It has a lot of cushion/padding and very comfortable to rest in.",
