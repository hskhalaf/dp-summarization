I followed all the directions, and ended up with so little color that you can barely tell I used it. I will have to apply it again ( it\u2019s been two days) and hope I get more color and it doesn\u2019t get weird like other self tanners if you reapply too soon. So for me, this was not worth the high price at ALL. I wish I had stuck with the lotion.",

      "title": "Really fantastic tanner!",
      "text": "Love this tanner! It produces a natural tan look with little to no tanner aroma (well, there's a little hint of tanner smell at first). This mousse is useful when applying so you can see where you\u2019ve possibly missed, and the mousse dries within less than a minute. Be careful not to wear light colored clothing until after you\u2019ve showered though. I usually wait 9-12 hours from application to showering, but after showering you have this natural, realistic tan that lasts 3-6 days. Obviously the areas like legs that you shave, the tan will not last as long. Side note- make sure you really exfoliate all areas you\u2019re going to apply tanner so you have the most even tan later.",

Pros: cleanest ingredients of any tanner I\u2019ve seen, no tanner smell as it develops (although it does smell like ACV when you apply it) easy to apply, even color and no streaks, color faded smoothly. Cons: while this is probably the my favorite final color tone of any tanner I\u2019ve tried, the color itself isn\u2019t as saturated as I\u2019d hoped, even when I applied two coats; plus, two coats was SUPER sticky, and stayed sticky the entire development time; color disappeared almost entirely after 2 days so longevity is lacking.",
