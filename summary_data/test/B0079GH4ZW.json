The pulse is safer and will still blast the coyotes or other game without as much danger of killing.

Accidently got zapped and got a welt and it was sore for about 20 minuets. I have a couple of miles of fence wire going through moderate to heavy weeds and digital tester indicates 8.7 kilovolts. That works for me.",

    "description": "Protect your animals with the Zareba 50 Mile AC Low Impedance Fence Charger. This powerful 2-joule energizer controls a variety of animals, including pigs, llamas, horses, cattle, and more. Besides keeping animals in, it will also help to keep wildlife out. This 50 Mile Charger will power through heavy weeds with its strong output, although a well-kept fence line is ideal. Extreme vegetation and poly products will reduce the overall power of the fence energizer. The more material along the fence line, the harder the energizer must work to pass voltage through the line. This UL-listed energizer will plug into any standard 2 prong electrical outlet and should be protected from the elements. Built in the USA, this energizer is tested with a full load at our manufacturing facility and comes with a 2-year warranty. This warranty includes damage from lightning and can be extended to 3 years by registering online.",
