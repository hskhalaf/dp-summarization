      "text": "my only issue was that I was sent the wrong color, but no complaints because my newborn loved it and thoroughly enjoyed his first beach day while being protected from the sun. more than enough room for him to nap, and me to lay inside and nurse him, with a small cooler and my purse inside, and my sister joining us as well (it was a bit cramped when she sat under with us, but we all still fit!!!) I was definitely surprised it was so spacious. Easy set up, closing it was a bit tricky (even with the instructions) but if you're patient and gentle it makes sense after a few tries.",

Really disappointed since summer isn't yet over and it broke on a non-windy day. Twist tents tend to break after a season, but from use 3 Times is a bit absurd. How do we get a refund or replacement?",

It was a bit windy and the pegs kept coming off the wet sand and the tent was moving around. Also it takes a long time and effort to fold it back.",
