It rained multiple times while on the trip and the rain fly kept everything dry. I did not care for the tree straps that come with it and replaced them with a different set and will be replacing the rain fly stakes due to personal preference but everything that comes with this set up is just fine.",

If you do still buy this, leave plenty of slack on your mesh line, it seems we are not the only folks who had this issue. Had we only bought it to laze around the yard, I would have kept it but we got for wilderness camping and unfortunately this just won't cut it. Lesson learned.",

Also, I had a question about one of the straps and they have been tremendously responsive and helpful. I'll update with more information after they get back from their trip, but based on first impressions, I highly recommend this. Lighter AND more affordable than the more expensive hammocks from other vendors.",

      "text": "I have used this hammock twice. So far it has held up and provided me with great sleep. The rain fly has also kept me dry and warm as it started pouring rain during one of my trips. The only suggestion I would make is I replaced the straps with ENO slap straps. This makes it a lot easier to adjust and set up. This is a great entry level hammock and I would suggest this hammock to a beginner camper or someone who wants to try hammock camping. Eventually you will want to upgrade to another hammock.",
