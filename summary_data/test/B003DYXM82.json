I have used several plastic tables and this one is by far the worst.",

      "text": "I recently moved to a larger apartment in a new city, so I was looking for a functional living room table to use for communal meals as well as a day-to-day work surface. I didnt need it to be too fancy, and not having a large furniture budget I was looking for something solid that was also portable in the event I decided to move homes again. For everyday use, I just have it bare. The surface is hard wearing and easy to clean. When I want to dress it up a little more, such as when I'm having company over, a simple $12-$14 round table cloth from TJ Maxx more than dresses the table up.",
