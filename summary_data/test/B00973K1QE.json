Also came with some pretty nifty \"sound barrier\" strips to avoid that \"rattling\" of the bowls when the dogs are eating. Haven't applied them yet but its a cool concept!",

The price is very fair for the quality. It is sturdy and light. I absolutely love the size of the bowls. They are huge! It's perfect for the amount of water she drinks daily.

Perhaps a milliliter of water. But the small depression area is helpful when placing the bowl down so overall 5-stars",

      "text": "This is great for our aging yellow lab, who needed a raised bowl. The cat loves to climb up there too, even though he has a bowl on the floor. I knocked off a star because while the unit is perfectly proportioned and easy to keep clean, the legs are slightly flexible, which means that if it gets knocked into or swiped with a tail it splashes some water out of the water bowl. It would never tip over, but it bounces around a bit if knocked into.",
