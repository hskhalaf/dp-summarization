Rather than spend the ridiculous amount of money at a dealership, we did it ourselves. It was relatively easy to do, someone with limited mechanical ability and some tools could probably do it with a YouTube tutorial. There was no real difference in the way that the brakes felt, but at least we know that we won't die now. The Camry required 2 bottles to flush the old fluid, but it would have been nice to have 3 on hand.",

I feel if your fluid is getting that hot, you are either over working your brakes, they are insufficient or becoming defective. I have seen where fluid has spewed from a weep hole in the reservoir, which actually served as a braking system indication of a problem. I suppose you could just up it to DOT 4, or see what's cooking.",
