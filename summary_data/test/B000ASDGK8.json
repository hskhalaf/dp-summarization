The first one blew up, but I liked the dryer so much that I took a chance on a 2nd one. The handle would always get hot, hotter than it should have. Today it just stopped working. Took it apart to see if it could be fixed, and found out why it got so hot. The wires were literally melted apart. So much heart, that it caused the blue coating to turn black, and the white coating turned brown. I cannot believe that this happened. This is a fire hazard, thank goodness nothing actually caught fire.",

The only problem I'm having with the one I just purchased is that it doesn't seem to have the same amount of heat (on hot) as it used to. I hope they didn't turn down the temperature as my thick, wavy hair needs to straighten! I'm thinking the one I got is defective so I might return and try a new one.",

Dries hair quickly, relatively quietly, and leaves your hair with less damage and noticeably shiny. The dryer stays cool to the touch and lasts far longer than the cheaper ones you'd buy at the drugstore or Target or Wal-Mart.

So if you are buying it for that reason don't get your hopes up. Also, the paint was chipped off all over the top of the drier and it did not look new.
