The only thing I don't like - which other reviewers have mentioned - is this is not skin friendly due to sharp edges and corners. I definitely feel the need to wear gloves while handling.",

      "text": "These are GREAT! The length combined with the arch, avoids dragging the mower deck on the ramps. The plate top, verses the ladder style, makes for a much smoother ride and therefore much safer. They are strong (1500 lb. load rating) yet light weight and easy to handle and store. One word of caution, wear gloves when handling them. Like any punched out holes in sheet metal, there are some sharp edges on the underside, not real bad but they are there.",

Titan\u2019s 7.5-foot aluminum ramps are both sturdy and versatile with their 1,500-pound capacity. Take your vehicles with you wherever you go with Titan\u2019s load ramps!",

They also make great lawn mower loading ramps.",
      "SAFETY STRAPS INCLUDED: No need to purchase safety straps separately! These truck tailgate ramps include heavy duty load straps to keep the ramp firmly attached to the tailgate. This ensures safe transfer onto a truck without collapsing or buckling. Use them again and again to keep your 4x4 ATV, mini 4 wheeler, or lawn mower safe during transfer.",

They fold for easy transportation and only weigh 33 lbs, making them easy to move and operate. Rubber tipped fingers provide extra security to your vehicle while also preventing damage to the tailgate.",
