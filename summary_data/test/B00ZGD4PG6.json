Nice and comfortable and appear to have the grip required for trail running. I got a slight wobble on a muddier path, but I don't know that I could expect a high level of grip from a non-studded shoe. Overall really pleased at this price point. I'll be sure to edit in a few months after a chunk of use.",

    "description": "The upper part of the Asics Gel FujiTrabuco 4 trail shoe features breathable mesh, allowing the foot to stay cool and dry as you pick up the pace. A MONO-SOCK construction provides a slipper-like feel, allowing for a secure and comfortable fit. The ComforDry Sockliner offers additional cushioning to the foot, and thanks to the antibacterial fabric, it also helps reduce bacteria causing odour, so the foot stays fresh. The Anti Gravel Tongue is an added feature of the Gel FujiTrabuco 4 and helps to prevent debris such as stones and grit from entering, meaning you won't need to stop to empty the shoe. A Lace Pocket allows you to tuck away laces to reduce distraction and prevent any annoying loose ends, whilst 3M reflective elements come in handy for running during low light conditions. MIDSOLE The Asics Gel FujiTrabuco 4 consists of a Solyte Midsole, This is Asics extremely lightweight midsole, featuring less weight than Asics traditional EVA and SpEVA. It also provides excellent cushioning, comfort and durability. The shoe also features rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning, to attenuate shock during impact and toe-off phases and allows movement in multiple planes. OUTSOLE The GEL FujiTrabuco features a durable and aggressive outsole which welcomes rough and challenging terrain. It consists of AHAR+, a lighter version of AHAR, which is a tough material placed in critical areas of the shoe to provide excellent grip without compromising durability. Lugs in the medial and lateral sides offer better traction on different surfaces, preventing slippage during wet and muddy conditions. The forefoot of the shoe also has a Rock Protection Plate to protect the foot against sharp objects such as rocks and branches.",
