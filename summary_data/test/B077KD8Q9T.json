      "title": "Bit of a thin sole, needs regular cleaning",
      "text": "What do I dislike, not much the sole is a bit thin but this is expected for such a shoe. Grip works well on most terrain giving you confidence to run faster in places you normally wouldn't. Upper is a mesh like compound, so great for breathability and any water that finds it's way in. Heel is soft, flexible and holds, so with some elastic laces it makes it very easy to slip these on. Downside is the colour, sure great to be seen just requires cleaning often, unless you prefer the rough look.",

    "description": "Inov8 Park Claw 275 Running Shoes Run with confidence on paths and trails with Inov8's new trail running shoes. The Parkclaw 275 is the perfect shoe for runners wanting to run on paths and trails, or those looking to make a transition from road running to trail running. Standard Fit Inov8's standard fit offers a close-fitting heel that locks the shoe in position, while a wider toe box allows the toes to splay when running naturally or lifting weights. Standard fit suits those with wider feet and athletes using the product for long sessions. Synthetic/Mesh Upper The Upper of the parkclaw 275 is constructed using mesh fabric that allows air to permeate, ensuring your feet stay cool and comfortable when the temperature starts to rise. Additionally, synthetic materials work in tandem with the laces to provide you with a nice midfoot lockdown fit, keeping you tight within the shoe preventing any unwanted slipping but not tight enough that it makes you feel uncomfortable. The upper features protective and durable materials that are better suited to handling trail debris and environments. The external heel counter wraps around the rear of the shoe and provides support in the heel delivering this extra hold aids foot stability and helps a fatigued runner maintain a better gait. The durable material is added to the front of the shoe where you are more prone to stub and hit debris preventing you from ending your run short. Powerflow+ Midsole Now you can run effortlessly over any road conditions with the new powerflow+ midsole technology. Powerflow+ delivers 10% better shock absorption and 25% better energy return than standard midsoles. The midsole unit absorbs shock and impact forces, then transfers the energy that it creates to the forefoot where it can propel you off into your next step. integrated into the midsole is Inov8's very own DFB Shank which is a rock plate that protects the underfoot from sharp rocks. The Shank aligns behind the metatarsals for great",
