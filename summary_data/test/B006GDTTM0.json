It would be going along fine and suddenly just go blank and the internet would disconnect. I'd have to power cycle it to get it going again, but then another problem came about that the power connection was appearing to be faulty. All and all this unit was not meant to last more than a few years.",

Then I plugged it in. Everything worked instantly. I even was in the same chat room where i'd been talking with a tech about the installation. A few processes had to re-align (like outlook settings) but everything else was handled automatically. I didn't even need to reboot. I haven't lost connection since the install, which means a stability problem I had that caused me to upgrade has successfully been corrected. I would recommend this modem, at least at this point.",

I would say once every 6+ months things get a little slow. When that happens I do a power reset and all the green lights come back. When you call and talk to Xfinity, just remember to provide them the MAC address and force them to keep at it from their side till it works. I have moved twice and both times service continued in the new place. Remember that when you call for support, their first response will be to blame it on your equipment. Just keep them honest and it will work.",

It should be remembered that because the difference isn't going to be that big, and especially since cable fluctuates as more people in your neighborhood use it, it's difficult to get a true benchmark comparison. However I use internet every day, I did notice a bit of speed, but to be honest if you're renting a modem from Comcast you're getting bent over each month, buy this and a year later it pays for itself. Highly recommended, installation was cake.",

With this NetGear box I instantly got 52+Mb/s ! I wish I discovered it earlier. The hardiest part of whole work was to get TimeWarner support switch MAC address in my account. I spend maybe 40 mins on phone. Also keep in mind that this model has no built-in WiFi output, so you need separate router with wifi (I already had, so it wasn't a problem for me).",
