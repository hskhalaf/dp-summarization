      "text": "I was very happy with these headphones for over three years. The sound was spectacular and I didn't have any issues with the fit. Unfortunately, they have stopped working. I might get sound in one ear or the other, never both, and sometimes neither. I have tried different headphone cords without success. I expected that a pair of headphones this pricey would last, but apparently I was mistaken. Shame on you Yamaha",

It is noise suppressing vs. noise canceling...which is a little safer, as you are aware what is happening around you. However I must again say how great the music sounds. I use them late at night, as not to disturb those around me, at the same time hearing my music they way it's supposed to be heard. (No artificial bass or treble.) It is an outstanding value!",

    "title": "Yamaha PRO 400 High-Fidelity Over-Ear Headphones (Ivory White)",
    "description": "Color:Ivory White| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nYAMAHA PRO 400 HIGH-FIDELITY OVER-EAR HEADPHONES\n \nIF YOU LOVE MUSIC, LISTEN TO THE PROS\n\n\n\n\nAs the world's largest musical instrument manufacturer and the leading choice of professionals for studio and concert gear, Yamaha knows better than anyone how to make your music sound its absolute best. Now you can enjoy the Studio Sound experience anywhere you go. PRO Series headphones go beyond just \"powerful bass\" to authentically reproduce any style of music. From Classic Rock to Hip-Hop, from Latin Jazz to Delta Blues, the PRO Series brings all your music to life. Your collection is waiting\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWERFUL, AUTHENTIC SOUND\nTight, precise, and well-balanced \u2013 the PRO 400 headphones create a rich, deep soundscape isolated from the outside world and tuned to perfection the way only Yamaha can. They incorporate a newly-developed Yamaha-proprietary driver design, sporting robust 50 mm drivers with neodymium magnets that provide maximum efficiency when used with mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and other portable music players. The over-ear cup shape offers excellent noise isolation, while premium ear cushion materials insure crisp, clear sound reproduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nULTRA-COMFORTABLE AND BUILT TO LAST\nBuilt to handle the rigors of everyday use without wearing you down, the PRO 400 features an adjustable, reinforced headband with ample padding textured for a pleasant feel. The band is shaped to apply just the right amount of pressure \u2013 snug enough to provide noise isolation, yet light enough for long listening sessions. Its ear cushions are extraordinarily soft and smooth, with a feel so natural you\u2019ll never want to take it off.\n\n\n\n\n\nFUEL-INJECTED DESIGN\nDrawing inspiration from the world's finest musical instruments and motorcycles, the PRO Series headphones get your heart racing before you even plug them in. Gorgeous geometry and ultra-clean design curves are matched with premium color and finish materials, and emblazoned boldly with Yamaha's iconic tuning-fork marque, conjuring the power and energy of our high-performance supersport bikes. The PRO 400 is available in Piano Black and Ivory White.\n\n\n\n\n\nVERSATILE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONNECTIVITY\nThe PRO 400 comes with two detachable, tangle-resistant flat cables: one in a 4 ft length with an in-line remote/mic, ideal for most mobile applications, and one in a 10 ft length for use in the home. Both cables are made from a material that is durable and designed to reduce \"touch noise\" transfer effects. The flat construction keeps the internal cores separated to minimize interference and terminates to a low-profile right-angle connector. A gold-plated \u00bc\" adapter is included in the box for connecting to professional-grade audio equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTROL AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\nThe 4 ft cable includes an in-line remote/microphone optimized for use with Apple iPod, iPhone and iPad devices. The \"+\" and \"-\" buttons control volume for both music and phone calls, while the center button allows you to play/pause music, skip to the next song, skip to the previous song, or answer/end phone calls. The controller buttons provide a tactile click-response, enabling intuitive operation without need for visual reference. For non-Apple devices, control behavior varies due to differences in applications and pin configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBRING IT WITH YOU\u2026EVERYWHERE\nEngineered to move you and keep you moving, the PRO 400 folds into a compact size for traveling. It also comes with a semi-rigid protective carrying case.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHICH YAMAHA PRO SERIES HEADPHONE IS RIGHT FOR YOU?\nYAMAHA PRO 300\nCheck out the Yamaha PRO 300 YAMAHA PRO 400\nCheck out the Yamaha PRO 400 YAMAHA PRO 500\nCheck out the Yamaha PRO 500 Design On-ear, closed back Over-ear, closed back Over-ear, closed back, rigid aluminum alloy earcup Driver Type Dynamic, neodymium magnet Dynamic, neodymium magnet Dynamic, neodymium magnet Driver Unit \u03a61-5/8\u201d (40 mm) \u03a62\u201d (50 mm) \u03a62\u201d (50 mm) Impedance 53 ohms @ 1kHz 23 ohms @ 1kHz 23 ohms @ 1kHz Maximum Power 300 mW 1,000 mW 1,000 mW Sound Pressure 107 dB \u00b13 dB (1 kHz, 1 mW) 106 dB \u00b13 dB (1 kHz, 1 mW) 106 dB \u00b13 dB (1 kHz, 1 mW) Frequency Response 20 Hz \u2013 20 kHz 20 Hz \u2013 20 kHz 20 Hz \u2013 20 kHz Weight 7 oz (200 g) with attached cable 10.2 oz (289 g) without cable 13 oz (369 g) without cable Ports -- 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) on left earcup Dual 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) input/output, one each on the left and right earcups Cable Length 4 ft (1.2 m) attached, tangle-resistant flat cable with remote/mic optimized for Apple devices CABLE A: 4 ft (1.2 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable with remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; CABLE B: 10 ft (3 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable CABLE A: 4 ft (1.2 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable with remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; CABLE B: 10 ft (3 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable Connectors Gold-plated 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) L-type mini stereo CABLE A: 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo with L-type on one side; CABLE B: 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo CABLE A: Gold-plated 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo with L-type on one end; CABLE B: 1/8\" (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo In the Box Soft carrying case; gold-plated 1/4\u201d adapter; cleaning cloth Semi-rigid carrying case; detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable (4 ft/1.2 m) with in-line remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; 10 ft (3 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable; gold-plated 1/4\u201d adapter; cleaning cloth Semi-rigid carrying case; detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable (4 ft/1.2 m) with in-line remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable (10 ft/3 m); gold-plated 1/4\u201d adapter; cleaning cloth",
