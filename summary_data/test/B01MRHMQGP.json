BTW my fingers are normal sized - but while walking your hands are down by your side, so more blood flow enters and if you have tight bands around your fingers, venous flow is interrupted, causing your fingers swell and is uncomfortable.",

This same kind I've had before which wears and tears easily causing sand to pour everywhere after any kind of daily use. 25 dollars is way overpriced for this garbage I'm returning it since it was meant to be a nice gift.

I find these gloves are uncomfortable to wear. The loops around the fingers are tight in spots. Because there is no material in the palm section of the glove I think it puts more strain on the finger loops and they move around a bit when punching. I use them for kickboxing.",

    "description": "Empower Weighted Gloves for Women provide a convenient way to add resistance to your exercise routines while keeping your hands free. Whether you are walking, running, kickboxing, Piloxing, MMA training, or doing Body Combat workouts, this 2-pound set of weighted fitness gloves will enhance your cardio, help you sculpt your arms, shoulders, and upper body, and improve your endurance over time. Unlike traditional dumbbells that you hold in your hands, these weighted gloves for women slip over your fingers and strap around your wrist. Their open-palm design lets your hands breathe and means you can talk on the phone, walk your dog, push your stroller, or hold your water bottle while still getting the benefits of added resistance. Designed for women, Empower weighted gloves are comfortable and versatile. The weight is evenly distributed on the back of your hand and stays put while you exercise. The sand-filled fitness gloves are made from soft, stretchy neoprene and feature reinforced double stitching. Each exercise glove weighs 1 pound and measures 6 by 4 inches (L x W).",
