The one problem is the neck strap that comes with them: it kept slipping off, and the binoculars could have been ruined by a hard fall, or lost into a canyon or hot spring. But this is easily fixed, which is why I went ahead and rated it a 5. One just needs to run the end of the strap through part of the buckle a third time.",

I compared them to Bausch and Lomb 9x22 binoculars and felt the images were on par with each other. The 10x power makes it hard to hold steady, so consider 8x binoculars if you don't want to deal with that. Considering the low price, I'm very satisfied.",

It is compact, light weight and the focus is great !I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for something economical. It is a little small, but I would choose small as opposed to big and bulky. This is my first pair of binoculars, and i'm sticking with Aurosports!",

So if you\u2019re just looking for a casual pair then this is a good value.

The right lense would not even turn which made the adjustment impossible. I am outside of my return window, otherwise I would return this product. If you buy, immediately ensure the products works rather than waiting until you plan to actually use them.",

The strap that comes with it is not ideal but it serves the purpose. If your able to spend hundreds of dollars then I would go with something like Steiners glasses but if ur just looking for something that works and has good quality then I don't think you will be disappointed. This is just my opinion.",
