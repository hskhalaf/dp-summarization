      "text": "My 17 year old daughter is a goalkeeper. She always refused to wear a concussion band until she got her 2nd concussion. She asked me to buy her one. We did some research, decided to start off light as there are bands out there that are very bulky. The day we received this in the mIl, my daughter used it at practice the same night. Not only did it keep her awake warm, she liked the feel and it looks like a headband. No one questioned her with what she was wearing because it resembles a thick headband. She wears it all the time now and will even forget she's wearing it.",

After her playing all soccer season with it on it stays where it needs to and also keeps her hair out of her face! But mainly it did what it wa suppose to do! She hardly felt any impact at all the few times she had to head bunt the ball! I think all the schools should be using these! A couple of the other kids on her team parents bought them as well! Very easy to clean also just soap and water and hand wash and dry by morning!",

At 11 yrs old he wants to look cool & this has given him extra confidence since others have complimented his \"headband\". He's scoring avg of 3.5 goals a game so is in the rough & tumble of everything, my mind is a little more at ease knowing he has more protection. Just wish there was a way to better protect his spinal cord but this is a great investment.",

    "description": "The Unequal Halo 3 has received high marks in 3rd party independent research at Virginia Tech. In fact, their data shows our complete line of protective headgear to be the best performing in the country. Halo 3 received Virginia Tech\u2019s \u201cRecommended\u201d 4-Star Rating. It\u2019s a very light, very thin design that looks just like a headband, which players love. But don\u2019t let it\u2019s looks deceive you! This Halo\u2019s advanced, military-grade materials reduce acceleration and absorb/disperse impact force. From newbies to veterans, the protection is noticeable and improves player confidence as they feel the difference. Halo is great for non-helmet sports, including soccer, basketball, volleyball, girls lacrosse, field hockey, cheerleading, figure skating as well as other life situations where good looking head protection is needed. For soccer, does not alter ball rebound speed or direction and is FIFA Law 4 compliant. Halo 3 was designed for a fashionable and comfortable look. 83% Polyester, 17% Spandex, black fabric with a silver logo on front. Comes in Size 1 (20.5\" or less) & Size 2 (21\" +). Fits your head as a closed loop with a snug, stretchy fit. To acquire your proper fit, use a measuring tape. Halo 3 has powerful, protective properties that may stiffen in cool/cold environments when not on your head. Simply knead the foam with your fingers for a few seconds or hold it close to your body heat and will quickly start to soften. Once warm, stretch slightly, and place on your head. Once you wear it for a few minutes, Halo 3 will soften even more and be so comfortable you\u2019ll forget it\u2019s on your head. Should be stored at room temperature.

      "SIZING: ONLY TWO SIZES (SIZE 1 & 2) MOST PLAYERS PREFER SIZE 2 (for 21\u201d+ heads & above) SIZE 1 IS A TIGHT FIT (for 20.5\u201d heads & below) - Younger kids don\u2019t necessarily have smaller heads. We find that over 85% of kids take size 2. It\u2019s always best to measure! Use our fit tips chart for best sizing accuracy."
