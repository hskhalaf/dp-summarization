It survived that, unfortunately, but recently it's been spitting out 3-4 blank labels for every one that I print, so I decided it's time for an upgrade. This Brother printer is so amazing in comparison. It's just WAY WAY WAY WAY better. Moral of the story- don't buy a POS Dymo. Buy this and trust me that it's a far better investment in your mental health/stress levels/general quality of life.",

    "description": "The Brother QL-1100 Wide Format Professional Thermal Label Printer addresses the increasing demand for highly reliable, cost-effective business label printers to consistently and quickly print high-quality up to 4-inch labels - perfect for shipping and postage. The Brother QL-1100 delivers 300 dpi resolution and prints up to 69 labels per minute(1) minimizing the time spent waiting for labels. Its built-in automatic heavy-duty cutter is ideal for handling large print jobs and provides a clean, professional edge when using continuous tapes.\n\nThe Brother QL-1100 includes a USB cable, label creation software and a starter supply of labels so it\u2019s ready to use right out of the box. The QL-1100 is compatible with Windows and Mac and integrates with Microsoft Word, Excel, and Outlook. It also offers a USB host interface for use with peripheral devices including scanners. The Plug & Play feature enables you to create and print labels without the need to install software on your Windows PC, making it simple to use. The easy-to-use, drop-in DK replacement tape rolls make it a breeze to change supplies; there\u2019s no ink or toner to replace \u2013 ever. The QL-1100 also detects the size of the tape in the machine and automatically adjusts the onscreen template.\n\nThe automatic crop function lets on-line sellers easily print product and other barcode labels from A4/Letter size label sheet templates (Windows only). You can print an entire sheet of labels or a section of labels with virtually no waste. Brother network management tools make it easy to integrate and manage the label printer on any network. The free Software Development Kit (SDK) is available for Windows, iOS and Android for custom application development. Brother provides email and phone support to developers and software integrators.
