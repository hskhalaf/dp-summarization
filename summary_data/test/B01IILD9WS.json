What I love must about this is not only does it do an excellent job on cancelling noise, but the APP that you can download from App Store, you can adjust the EQ settings. Vocal, Bass, Jazz, and even customize your own Equalization settings. You can adjust the High, Mid and the Low Range. Awesome! and it sounds perfect!",

I am very careful with all electronics I own, and these generally spring back to life once they air out for a bit after the gym. The performance outside of this has been good, it would be nice if they did not have this issue with sweat at the gym.",
