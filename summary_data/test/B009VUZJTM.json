One of the reasons I purchased NatureWise, instead of other brands sold on Amazon, is because it is formulated in the USA. NatureWise also provides outstanding customer support. I originally called customer support with questions about another one of their products. The company representative was very helpful, and took the time to help me decide which supplement was best for me. She was able to make suggestions based on my individual needs, and called to follow up. I feel this company stands behind their products and makes customer satisfaction a priority.",

I still gave the product three stars, because it seemed to help the first few days with my appetite, but that quickly fell off. It seems like great quality as well, with no odd effects. I really am not the best candidate for this, being only 10-20 pounds from my desired target weight as a 190 lb. male. I think it might work better (like on the ads and TV shows) for those who are much further from their goals, and carry excessive body fat.",
