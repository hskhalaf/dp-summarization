So that, for instance, a low keto food has more carbs, but they are still the carbs I use in keto, but I would probably only eat one serving a day, while high keto recipes can make up the bulk of my menu.

My IBS is gone since I changed to this lifestyle. My mom wasn't familiar with Keto but after reading the books she has a better understanding of this lifestyle. I love hearing the stories of Maria & her family too. She truly has changed my way of eating in a positive way! Thanks Maria, Craig, and family!!",
