It looks like dark brown in the picture but actually it\u2019s rather amber brown. And the sizing. I usually wear womens 5 in sneakers. I read the reviews and checked the side chart, and thought 6 would fit nicely for me. But i couldn\u2019t even stand in these boots because it was just too small and hurting. So I returned them and ordered again in 6.5. It fits better but still feels a bit tight and stiff. But I'm keeping them because i think it\u2019ll be fine once I break in them. Hope this helps!",

After reading a ton of reviews, I decided to order them in my normal size (8 women's) as many reviews said the shoes are narrow at first but quickly stretch out after a few wears. I will update my review after the \"break in\" period to see if this is the case or not, but they are definitely tighter across the top of my foot than a typical size 8 shoe would be. The length is good and I think getting the next size up would cause my heel to slide out. We'll see how this goes!",

      "text": "I've been looking for a low-profile shoe to wear with skinny jeans and these are perfect. As others have noted there is no arch support and the first time I wore these I had them on for more than 12 hours. I have fallen arches and other issues with my feet so, needless to say, my feet were sore the following day. That hasn't stopped me from wearing my Desert Boots though. I really like them.",

So I looked at other reviews that said to size up a half or whole size and I'm glad I took the gamble and got them a little cheaper! They are a little tight but not too bad. I'm sure once I break them in they'll feel comfy. I love the dark color! These are seriously so cute and I can't wait to wear them around!",

I have a wide foot and long toes and had to exchange my 7.5 for an 8 as I could feel my toes right against the front of the shoe. The size 8 is perfect!!! The crepe sole provides a lot of cushion where arch support is lacking, but then I have strong feet and don't mind less support. Definitely condition the leather.",
