I\u2019m still annoyed that I have to buy my own USB cable because the long cable provided only provides power. The long cable WILL NOT let you download videos. It takes very nice quality videos during day light. At night, it\u2019s hit or miss but very rarely do I ever see past my headlights. Also, the sound recorder does not pick up in car audio well. But that\u2019s an either hate it or love it feature (I personally turn mine off) For its price point, the camera provides very nice quality videos that I cannot complain about.",

Only issue I had with this product was it wasn't saving the date/time properly which in turn would cause the saved files to be out of order. Amazon customer service was unable to resolve the issue. It seems as when the camera was off, the date and time would stop as well or was a day/several hours behind the current date until it was turned back on. I used the feature where it turns on and off when the engine does as my vehicle has one of those plugs.",

(I still have a standard 1080P dash cam in my wife's car for comparison) The videos are not \"choppy\" and don't have macroblocks on the side. This indicates that algorithm used to save the videos is well thought out. I also like that it is NOT a dash cam with a superwide 170 degree field of view. The 155 degree field of view on this unit is just about right. Night time videos are good. The camera apparently does not need much light to give work well at night.",
