The rod holders aren\u2019t much good for holding rods you\u2019re actively fishing with (live bait, etc), but they are fine for holding them while you paddle around. The seat is outstanding! It\u2019s basically a lawn chair for your kayak. I\u2019ve gone for all-day trips and it was just as comfortable at the end as the beginning. It\u2019s a bit expensive but I haven\u2019t given it a second thought since it arrived. Money well spent.",

It is comfortable but the straps and buckles are very poor quality and break all of the time. You will get the factory to send you 1 new one. I had a friend of mine install cam buckles on mine to actually hold up long term. I love the lawn chair concept on the kayak but it just needs a better design. The kayak has lots of room and places for storage. I know it\u2019s not a 2k kayak and for the money it is a good deal but I just think they could have done so much more.",
