      "text": "My wife and I purchased this because the squirrels were emptying our old feeder. This feeder worked great for about a week or so attracting many colorful birds that we enjoyed watching. As we pulled into the driveway the other day we saw a squirrel hanging from the weather vane and hanger very much enjoying the deluxe bird seed that we purchased for the birds. It is a cute feeder, but the squirrels quickly learn how to defeat the trap door over the seed. We will keep the feeder, but be warned; it is not squirrel proof!",

Very disappointed, I did not reach out to seller because not sure if their fault or I have really clever squirrels. It is not a flimsy product.

The one issue I have is that the latch that keeps the roof in place isn't very tight, so the squirrels have been able to rotate the rooster (on top), open the latch, and knock off the roof of the feeder. But they didn't actually spill the birdseed on the ground, so I guess that's a plus. I now have two mini-bungee cords holding the roof in place, so even if the squirrels can open the latch, the roof should stay on and protect the seed.

Too many squirrels had discouraged them and we had not seen any birds for a couple of months. They are back now! Cardinals, chickadees, mockingbirds, etc. Very happy with this product.",

Problems: first, the wholes are too small for most seed mixtures. Second, its not rain proof so the seed gets stuck in the small opening and then starts to mildew and sprout. Third, the birds dont like it because its can only be accessed in one direction which makes them uneasy and very cautious. Fourth, its very heavy so after you fill it up, most branches will sag. But hey, it looks great hanging in the tree.",

Unfortunately, the second one was also destroyed and I will not ask to have it replaced since the culprit was a bear. Must have been a bear the first time ( I thought it wasn't possible since we live in a town) Can't expect it to stand up to a bear, so my feeding days are over.",
