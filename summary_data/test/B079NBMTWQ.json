I was wrong. When i turned the TV on about a 4th of the screen was in a colored pattern and there were lines running across the rest of the screen. So back it goes. I would say it was either banged up before or in the shipping process.",

Why are companies even putting 4K resolution out when they haven\u2019t even mastered 1080p resolution?! I knowI know the demand is there so they have to supply. I mean, it\u2019s almost 2020! There should be no bad TVs anymore! Makes me wonder if theses companies make crappy TVs so you buy there $3,000 grand versions?! Idk but what ev haha",
