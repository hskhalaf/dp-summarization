That being said I am not sure how much I can trust the quality so I do not use it for applications where I will really be stressing these sockets. I have not broken any and they have not damaged any fasteners. I would definitely recommend this for light duty use. I probably would not use this with any sort of impact tool.",

Also, it comes with a very small price of foam to hold the tools in place and this will get easy lost/damaged or just desintigrate over time. Great tools just expect to put them in a tool box and not keep the provided case for long.",
