I mostly use it for my head. I also purchased a replacement head for this and as someone suggested, I think the original head that comes with this is not as good as the replacement one so I may try to replace the head but by the time you add up the cost of this shaver plus purchasing a replacement head just to get a normal shave .. not such a great deal.",
