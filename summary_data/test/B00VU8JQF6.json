This one is replacing a case of similar price and design. The edge of the case rises slightly above the screen. This means when the phone drops face down, the edge of the case will hit and not the glass. This is an important part of the design, which I try to explain to my wife. If the case is flat to the screen, it isn't going to protect it when you drop it. An inexpensive case that is designed better than many of my wife's expensive cases.",

The new case was easy to install but secure enough as to remain solidly in place. The case wraps around the face of the phone providing a raised lip that protects the phone face and its silicone composition gives ample cushion to protect from drops. All in all, it provides just what I needed in a phone case.",

I'll stick to the spigen ones for now, even tho those are not perfect either. Or I'll have to keep looking. So the corners keep rolling off the round iphone 6 corners, and makes for a useless and dangerous case that will NOT protect your iphone 6 from drops. Returning for refund.",

The buttons work properly and the case does not cover the edges of the display like in some other cases so it's really nice to the touch on the screen. The transparency is also pretty nice and stylish I dig it. I'd given this case 5 starts if it was a little tighter and not kinda loose. And I think since it's a soft case it could be a couple dollars cheaper as well.",
