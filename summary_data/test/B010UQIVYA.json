However, we are very tired of having to remove the tiny, tiny little cotter pins to remove the body shell, in order to get to the inner frame, in order to open up the battery compartment, in order to turn off the power. Perhaps they could re-think ways to access the switch. My kids can't seem to be able to get the little pins out without pliers and there were no extra pins included. I'm sure we'll end up losing some and will have to fabricate something to replace them. Battery goes down pretty fast, so you're constantly opening up the frame to switch them out.",

It'll go great on grass, as long as it's not too long. Dirt and gravel are no problem either.",

A little hard to get to topspeed for my son because you need precise speed control or it looses traction which makes it great for novice and a good challenge for dad.Had a problem with it at first, it wanted to drive forward slow by itself but after 2 minutes the control balanced itself out, No issues to date.",

And changing to tiamya battery connectors so you can use a real hobby charger. The gearbox went and I emailed the company and with very little trouble they sent new gearbox and motor. Email responses were always within a day due to time differences. I would be happy to buy any Hosim product.",

The car's battery is its only drawback.I recommend you to buy another battery for the car so you can play longer. The fun never stops as you can go extremely fast and is very responsive to the controls. Also is you come across any problems , the warranty comes really handy and they take the matter into their own hands and make sure you are happy.",
