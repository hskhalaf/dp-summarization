I used the Pet Lovers lint roller for the first time this morning and I have to say, it's a winner over Evercare as well as Scotch Bright. PetLovers sheets are extra sticky and sheets do not fight you when rolling back and forth. No unrolling if direction is reversed and what I personally appreciate is the ease of removing sheets. I actually used half the number of sheets compared to the other above mentioned product. Klynn",

I didn't have to continuously re-roll over areas, this roller is definitely the best I've tried.
