I was willing to sacrifice with a lower quality tool for that LSA. The box literally had \"Free batteries for life\" written on it, even though the tool did not come with a battery. Then when I registered everything the batteries had a limited warranty. That box lied!! I promptly returned all my rigid tools and replaced them with Dewalt. SO MUCH BETTER. The dewalt multi tool works great for smaller detail cuts, I used it on a subfloor replacement project. Just dont push hard, let the vibration do the work.",

I tried to cut through a weld joint on steel but the tool asked me to please use the angle grinder instead. I like this tool and am looking for other ways to use it now that I own it.

As part of the upgrade we have to cut out the existing particle board underlayment in order to access the subfloor. This is perfect to cutting up to the edge of the wall, cuts through nails and screws to pull up underlayment easily, and scraps off the old linoleum with ease. It's also does a great job cutting drywall, especially near the inside corners. And the sanding attachment is a time saver when you want to sand in tightest spots. Love this tool, it's saved me so much time and effort during our upgrade.",

This tool is not a must for the average home owner, but I did quite a bit of remodeling when I bought my home and this tool has been really handy. The bag it comes is nice and the hard case is good to hold all the misc pieces.",
