Both items were purchased the same day and arrived on the same day, however the packaging was very different. One set was brand labeled \"UYES\" while tge other had no labeling for the brand, only the materials and wash instructions. I don't like how one brand could be so inconsistent where even the neckline was a different pattern. I am no expert on design, but these two are very different. The quality seems to be poor stitch work, but the material is soft. Hopefully they keep us warm.",

I then took a paper towel and ran it down the length of the pants and the towel had black all over it, much like soot. There is a serious problem here. Returning and hope Amazon will check with the company.",
