I learned that there was more than one format the hard way the poduct works great , but just not for my phone the bad reviews her is due to people not understanding the technology realizing the charger does not work unless the you add the back cover design for you device or use the include device to plug into you device. So becareful and make sure you order the right format for you device",

      "text": "I returned this item, post haste. It would not charge even one device without using their $30 Powercube. It even shows a DS Lite being effortlessly charged by just dropping it on. It wouldn't even do that! It also would not charge my Nokia phone or Sansa Mp3 player. I know the technology is relatively new and maybe they will get better but for now, I'm still stuck with cords.",

YOU CANNOT CHARGE A PHONE WITHOUT A WIRE! YOU MUST PURCHASE AN ACCESSORY THAT LETS YOU CHARGE YOUR PHONE NOT USING THE WIRE THEY PROVIDE WITH THE UNIT. THAT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT. YOU MAY AS WELL JUST USE THE CHARGING DEVICE THAT CAME WITH THE PHONE!",

    "description": "The Powermat Portable Mat wirelessly charges up to 3 devices at once. Simply Drop & Charge your favorite devices (receivers for devices sold seperatley).\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Powermat Home and Office mat is a slim, sleek charging mat for home or office. What's a charging mat, you ask? Good question. Powermat's Wireless Charging System offers a clean, simple way to keep all those personal electronic devices charged, without a mess of cables. With the Powermat system, you choose a mat and then choose the receivers to match the devices you want to charge. Each mat includes a Universal Powercube receiver that allows you to charge hundreds of devices. You can also purchase receivers custom designed to fit on your devices, so you never need to remove them to use your device.\n\nThe Powermat Wireless Charging System provides a simple, fast and efficient way to keep all of your favorite personal electronic devices charged. Click to enlarge. \n\n\n\nTHE POWERMAT WIRELESS CHARGING SYSTEM\nWireless Charging\nConnect your devices to Powermat Receivers, and simply drop them on the Powermat to charge wirelessly, as fast or faster than the stock power adaptor. A unique sound lets you know a solid connection has been made (an additional sound is heard when you remove your device--both are adjustable and can be turned off), and an indicator light--also adjustable--is displayed while a device is charging. \n\nUse Only What You Need\nCommunication between the Powermat and Receivers allows the mat to give exactly enough power for exactly the right time. When a device is fully charged, power is shut off to that device, so no energy is wasted. If a device is used while on the mat, the system knows it--charging starts up again until you've got a full charge. \n\nWired USB Connection\nFor legacy USB devices, or a quick charge while all your Receivers are in use, Powermats also feature a wired USB connection. It may not be wireless, but it's better than finding another free power outlet. \n\nA slim, sleek, charging mat for your home or office. Click to enlarge. \n\nPowercube Universal Receiver included. Click to enlarge. \n\nEight tips to work with hundreds of devices. Click to enlarge. \n\nGet a custom fit receiver for certain devices. View all Powermat products. \n\nSlick Design\nIndustrial design is key for personal electronics, and the Powermat appropriately follows suit. The Home and Office Mat features a minimal curved design that will work in most any environment, while the fold-up Portable Mat looks sharp and stows away simply for travel. \n\nPowermat custom Receivers are like a second skin for the device they charge, enabling access to all controls and keeping the design clean and simple. Receivers are available for iPods and iPhones, Nintendo DS, various Blackberry models, and more. \n\nSo How Does It Work?\nPowermat utilizes principles of magnetic induction combined with Powermat proprietary patent-pending technology to safely and effectively provide power to electronic devices. Powermat transforms surfaces including walls, tables, floors and desktops into safe, simple, and efficient conductors of energy. It replaces the need to access multiple electrical sockets for real-time powering and charging of electronic devices. Neat, huh? \n\n\n\nPOWERMAT HOME & OFFICE MAT\nSlim, Sleek, Charging Mat for Home or Office\nThis mat wirelessly charges up to 3 Powermat-enabled devices simultaneously (and one more via the wired USB power port). It works with all Powermat receivers, and looks great in most any setting. \n\nPowermat Specifications\n\n\n * Charging Positions: 4 (3 wireless, 1 USB port) \n * Dimensions: .625\" x 12.25\" x 4.5625\" (HxWxD) \n * Input Voltage: 100-240V AC, 50-60Hz Universal \n * Output Voltage: 18VDC \n * Output Current: 0.83A \n * Standby Current: 0.011A \n * Adapter Power: 15 Watts \n\nUniversal Powercube\nIncluded with the Home & Office Mat is the Powercube Universal Receiver.
