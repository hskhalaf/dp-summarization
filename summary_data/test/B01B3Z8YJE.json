This boot is very lightweight and has a truly satisfying fit. It\u2019s also much-praised for its amazing traction.The shoe, however, isn\u2019t completely waterproof, due largely to the gusseted tongue\u2019s suspicious design.

I wouldn't risk taking these on a serious hiking trip, if you do please take a back up pair of shoes. Also these will make your feet sweat, a lot. I would not buy these again unless Danner goes back to it's roots and makes quality boots again. Comfortable, flashy, but not well made at all. Amazon did take care of me and are overnight shipping a replacement pair, but I'm sure this will happen again. Don't buy.",

The 13 D was their recommendation to me and they were spot on. The boots themselves are superb! Super light, comfortable, waterproof and stayed dry hiking in snow and wet mud all weekend long, and the grip excellent. I love them.",

See my pictures for comparison. Keep in mind this is immediately after I applied the Danner Boot Dressing so it is shiny any wet looking. 3. The leather is soft as is the sole. There is no break in needed. They are wearable all day on the first day without worrying about blisters.",

As other reviewers have said, this proprietary membrane does not breath very well. First boots I\u2019ve ever owned that I find tops of my socks wet from moisture trying to escape. I live in southern Colorado so it\u2019s not too bad. But in more humid climates you might think twice if you\u2019re a large sweaty mammal like myself. I might spend more for Danners with Gore Tex next time.",

      "text": "I walked in these about 10 miles before hiking to break them in a little bit. My previous hiking footwear was a trail shoe and before that, a solomon x ultra 3. This tops those by comfort by far. Lighter than the full boot and much more comfortable/confident on the trail than the trail shoe. The moderate ankle support does the job. I don't travel with really heavy loads 30lbs or so for day hikes. But these performed fantastic up mount washington and mt moosilaukee. These will be a must in my hiking footware from now on. I love these things.",

It probably is not a great boot for carrying a heavy pack or for extended hiking in deep snow, but it is fantastic for almost everything else.",

I have yet to wear them on the trail so I can't speak of their performance there. So far just wearing them around town I can say the Vibram sole seems to grip very well is wet conditions, and the quality of craftsmanship appears to live up to the Danner reputation.

My line of thought was that usually you buy hiking shoes a half size bigger to accommodate feet swelling, etc. However, they were way bigger than even that, in his opinion. I exchanged for a 9.5 (again, he is a 10) and they were a perfect fit with plenty of room in the toe box. Highly recommend these boots! Just note the size!",
