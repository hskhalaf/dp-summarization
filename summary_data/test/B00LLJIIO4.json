I've never used vitamin C+E before so I can't compare it with similar products, BUT I can say that I love this particular product and have noticed a more even skin tone since I've started using it. I hardly ever splurge on skin care products, but this was well worth it. It feels amazing when it goes on. My skin looks brighter and more evenly toned. I haven't had a single breakout since I started using it. Highly recommend! And the price on Amazon is great.",
