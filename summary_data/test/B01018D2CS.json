I also own a pair of knipex mini bolt cutters and can honestly say these are of comparable quality. Time will tell how well they hold up, but I feel confident in saying these should hold up to many years of use. Also for the musky fisherman, these would be a great addition to your release tools if you don't have a pair of good hook cutters. I plan to purchase another pair for backups in the boat.",

It takes more grip effort to use but it cuts well and has a much longer lifespan that other cutting plier. A spring assist to open would really speed up one handed use but it's not a deal breaker. For the price and lifespan i would highly recommend these pliers.",

You can clearly see the paint chip and the deformation of the jaws that now let light through when firmly squeezed closed. Not sure if I have a defective pair or not.
