      "text": "Excellent hen mallard duck call. Easy to blow, loud, excellent tone, and very good at the hail, feeding, quack, and come back calls. Perfect for the beginner or intermediate waterfowler! Not sure if it will freeze up in cold weather yet, but this duck call is a value for the sound quality it produces. It is also easy to clean and goes back together to the exact same tone as before. It needs a groove for the lanyard though. I would recommend this call over all duck calls under $40, and it is comparable to the Double Nasty duck call (which is less expensive, but good too).",

Own a 1972 and Uncle Si single reed. Both stick after a continuous 20 mins of calling especially in wet and cold weather conditions. You have to open them and dry them every 10 mins. Very annoying for a good hunting day where the birds fly around. So this one saves your hunt. Kept using it in wet weather and ice cold weather and it never sticks.",

      "text": "I've owned lots of duck calls during my 40+ years of duck hunting. Most of them I only used once or twice and stopped because they either were hard to blow, didn't sound like a duck, or just didn't feel right. Some were too big to hang around your neck for hours on end. They would actually get in the way when the guns came up. Nothing like smacking yourself in the face with a call when your about to blow a nice fat mallard out of the sky! This one is just fine. It's small, waterproof, and sounds like a duck right outta the box. Can't ask for more than that.",

So easy to blow that my 2 year old can call them in and very simple to adjust tone and volume for different activities or species. Feed calls and attractor calling roll out easy with a little practice, check YouTube for Duck Commander and they will show you how. Best thing I like about this, besides the price, is it is super simple to disassemble, clean and put back together. Blows great wet or dry and will be on my lanyard for quite a few more seasons.",
