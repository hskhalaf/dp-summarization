Nothing I can't remedy with some support beams, but if it weren't for the impeller/motor working this would be an immediate return & never ordering from the company again.",

I just straightened it out and every thing was fine. But the vacuum it's self is great. The bag can be a little cumbersome to put back on.

This vacuum is also not very loud, although I still suggest the use of hearing protection. Very impressed with the unit. One flaw is that the wheels do not seem to want to pivot making maneuverability very difficult. I will likely buy better wheels and replace. All in all this was a great buy.",

      "text": "This was a vast improvement over a shop vac hose and duct tape I was using. Some reviews talked about noise, some talked about suction. There may be better and more powerful systems but for me being a beginner and moving up to this it works great. I do find it pleasing to put on noise protection anyway when running my grizzly table saw and the vac at the same time. An excellent vacuum in my opinion.",

I plugged it into a wall outlet and it begrudginly started. Hopefully I won't be having more trouble with that. Looking forward to getting to use it. Chiz in Indiana",
