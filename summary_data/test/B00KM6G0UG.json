I also seen someone complain about the smell of paint thinner. It's the smell of styrofoam. It'll air out within a day. There's legit nothing wrong with this crib",

The two of us conquered this project in about an hour. It was easier than I thought it would be. I let my 6 year old get in to test it out. It held up just fine and we feel good about putting our new baby in it.",

It says to not use power tools, but we happened to have a matching bit and used an electric screwdriver on very low setting to start all of the screws in and then used the Allen wrench to tighten the rest of the way down. It took us about 40 minutes to assemble the first cribs snow only about 25 for the second. Yay for twins!! I did not notice the odor that some people talked about in some reviews. Can\u2019t wait for the babies to arrive and use them!",
