But after only a week of play, it was falling apart just from normal daily play. Not made well. We find ourselves reassembling it all the time. Otherwise it would be a great toy.",

The directions are OK but you have to be careful you are turning it the right way to match the illustrations, and also to push the connecting pieces in place completely. We also bought the set of little characters so she could have more to play with. I do wish it came with removable furniture pieces and with a Toodles character!",

If it does make it into the car, the Mickey will tip over and get stuck in the garage when opened. This became very frustrating to my toddler. He enjoys the car separate from the play set.

    "description": "Style:SingleWelcome to Disney Junior's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse! Mickey Mouse is ready for a wild ride as he begins his journey in his hot air balloon! Raise the zip line and Mickey \"flies\" down in his balloon, landing on the lookout tower. Then Mickey takes a magical ride down the spiral slide, which swirls around the Clubhouse and ends in his boot-shaped garage where he lands right in his red car. Press the button inside the Clubhouse and Mickey's car launches out of the garage. Mickey can make a stop inside the Clubhouse and visit Toodles, hang out with the rest of the gang (sold separately), or go over the bridge and back to the balloon stand and start all over again! Zip, Slide And Zoom Clubhouse comes with a 3-inch (7.62cm) poseable Mickey figure and his classic red car. Other figures and accessories sold separately and subject to availability.",
