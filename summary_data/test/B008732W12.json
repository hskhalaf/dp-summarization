Amazon packs these in thick bubble wrap (I've never received a broken one!). They are heavy weight and the long wick is protected when you open it you toss a black plastic piece holding long wick in place and trim your wick. You will NOT BE disappointed in any of these ... I'm going to start ordering them for gifts and send via Prime to friends for bdays! These would make a lovely gift! They do burn down a bit fast, but that's because there is so much scent and oil.",
