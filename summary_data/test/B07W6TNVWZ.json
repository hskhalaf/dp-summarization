Sides are very heavily padded and the sole itself is nice amd soft while adding good outside protection. Not used for skateboarding. Just general shoes so can't comment on the wear and tear from the deck on the shoe. Nice colour, and easy to clean with a cloth",

He did get a blister but that's because he took no breaking in precautions before wearing them for a 3 mile round trip. All settled now and they're beautiful just like the image.",

I ordered these shoes in a size UK 11, however I was delivered a size US 11 (Which is a UK 10) So too small and basically making the product useless to me. Really rather annoying now having to go through the process of making a return and ordering another pair because of such a basic error. I just hope I receive the correct size this time and can leave a more positive review.",
