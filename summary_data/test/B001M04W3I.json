I found out i prefer a brace with a hole in the front. I had my meniscus cleaned out about 1 1/2 yrs. Ago and still experience knee pain and swelling. I also have a bakers cyst that will fill up with fluid depending on how much I aggravate my knee. Other sleeves seem to have helped keep my knee compressed, which has immensely helped with the pain.",

It has taken the place of my hard brace for the time being until i get knee replacement surgery. It is good for travel and does not set off alarms like the hard brace. I will be interested to see how it wears over the course of a year or so. will the Velcro start to give out, is this product washable? These are questions I have not dealt with so far. I think that is also slightly over priced.",

I would think this product would help many people better adjust to their personal situation.",

Because my left knee was compromised I felt it would be smart to also support the right knee for added support so as to not favor one over the other. You can ware this brace over or under your cloths. There is no scratching, chaffing, slipping or bunching. I have a new bounce to my step, no fear of injury, long walks are a pleasure. Thanks",

If it's going to fit a 22\" circumference, then the length should BE 22 inches, not including the velcro since the velcro needs to overlap the opposite end.

      "text": "Both of my knees are \"bone on bone.\" In addition, both knees suffer from severe ostecoarthritis, degenerative-type tearing of the medial meniscus, etc. In simple English, my knees are in bad shape! The Neo G braces have significantly reduced the pain I experience from standing, getting up from a chair, walking, etc. I love them! I wear the braces during the day and take them off at night. The braces can't fix my knees but they have improved the quality of my life, by allowing me to do things now that I could not do before without experiencing severe pain.",

      "text": "Love this knee brace as it hugs and supports my weak leg allowing me to walk farther than I otherwise would be able to. It's fairly flexible, but I sometimes loosen the top Velcro if I sit with the brace attached. The brace does heat up the the leg, but that serves to relax the muscles. It is easy to wear and wrap around your knee. If there is a downside, it would be that the area of the brace the Velcro attaches to wears out eventually, but that's they way any Velcro attachment works. This is a great brace and it doesn't aggravate my kneecap.",
