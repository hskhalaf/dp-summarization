Th magnets are very strong, and it doesn't budge from the front of the refrigerator when a bottle is opened. It is solid as a rock. We got the basic mahogany color to match our cabinets. My husband, who rarely gets excited about gifts, has told me several times how much he likes it. It is kind of expensive for something with such a basic use, but it is well made and works great for my husband who brews his own beer at home. Good purchase!",

I got my NasonWorks Beer Bottle opener for my basement bar and mounted it on the wall. Works as advertised. A bottle cap hasn't hit the floor once... not even close. I've surprised friends and relatives and now they're doing the same. My son had me buy him some IBC bottled root beer so he could get in on the fun. lol",

I have another magnetic bottle opener (from a different manufacturer) that doesn't budge at all during use, so I expected that this one would be the same way, but not so. It would have also been nice if this model had some pads on the back to prevent scratching of the fridge. Will be returning.",

      "text": "Very nice looking bottle opener, it functions pretty well. My only complaint is compared to some similar versions of this product sometimes the magnets aren't quite strong enough to stop the entire thing from moving up on the fridge when opening a bottle. It's not a terribly common occurrence and its not that much of an inconvenience, thus only 1 star. Also the stronger magnets ones usually don't have as nice of a design.",
