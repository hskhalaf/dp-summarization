However, I haven't had this problem yet. I think they sound great as well. I also love the control talk. I haven't had any problems with it yet, but on an old pair of Tours, they did go out eventually, but hopefully that's not going to happen anytime soon with these. All in all, these look nice, feel nice, and sound nice.",

All in all great sounding earphones, as long as you dont mind having to constantlt push them back in after they have fallen out.",

The flat cord is great cause it really is tangle-free.",

And finally, the most important, sound quality. The sound quality on the \"Diddybeats\" are great: punchy bass as well as drums and you'll find yourself hearing background beats you never heard before. For the price I paid; well worth it.
