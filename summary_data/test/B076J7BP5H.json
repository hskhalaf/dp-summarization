I set them to the middle temperature (color green light on the gloves), and was quite comfortable for the next several hours riding them motorcycle. I wish I had them on a previous ride two weeks ago, when it was as cold, and my hands were numb from the cold. I would recommend these to anyone who rides a motorcycle. Thanks.",

Im Rating this Product not the Seller. I've been working in Construction OUTDOORS for over 20yrs. What I've finally come to realize is that NOBODY...SELLS...MAKES....MANUFACTURES.... HEATED FIIIIINGER Gloves. I ONLY care about keeping my FINGERS warm. My hands can usually maintain in colder weather but once my FINGERS get frozen, I'm Livid and Can Not Function. So again, These gloves are Great for PALMS ONLY!!!! They WILL NOT keep your FINGERS warm. ONLY HANDS. NOT DIGITS!!!",

I was really impressed with how easy they are to operate and my friends love them too! They aren't touch screen capable though so you have to remove them every time you need to use your phone. And they don't have grippers on them (but most gloves don't) and they can be a little slippery at times.",
