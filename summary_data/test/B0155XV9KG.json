This leash has flexibility yet not enough for the dog to get too far ahead and facilitates walking two dogs very easily. This is a great leash and the sellers action was appreciated very much.

      "text": "After 9 months this is still going. It jammed once but with some work, was able to get retract the lease again. It doesn't lock easily as others but I rarely use this feature. With a strong 45# Aussie who pulls, was worried the collar attachment would snap but not yet. The handle is only sign of wear in that it peels off in layers. No wear on the nylon. It's been caught in rain and retracted so developed a smell. After soaking in bleach and dried, it still looks good. Never lost the bag carrier so pleased other than handle peeling off.",

You can tell immediately that it is well made. The leash mechanism is smooth and noiseless. The nylon tape leash seems stronger than what I have normally experienced. The stopping mechanism is quick and sure. The whole feel is right. I like that the leash can be used with dogs up to 100 lb. My dog weighs less than half that but who knows what a future dog will weigh in at and I expect to have this leash for years.",

The button is very awkward to use. The other item is if you're a man the hole that your fingers go into is too small.

      "text": "We've went through multiple retractable leashes in the last few months with our 75lb puppy and the mechanism always breaks. This leash seems to be more durable than the previous ones we've had. The handle could have a little bigger opening; it's fine for now because I have small hands, but I anticipate wearing gloves in winter with this leash may be a challenge and those with larger hands than mine might struggle. Overall great for the price though! Love the bag carrier, it is more secure on the handle than leashes we've had in the past also.",

Two, the handle is just not big enough. I admit I have large hands but this particular leash hurts my hand after walking my dogs for a while. They tend to pull a little when they see other animals and because this handle is so tight on my hand, it actually hurts them. Never had this experience with any other retractable leash.",
