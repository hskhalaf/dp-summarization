I have made Peanut Butter with the powder, it is not as good as the real thing but pretty close if you are trying to watch your fat and calorie intake. Thank you...also quick shipping was nice.",

PB2 reduces fat through a chemical-free process. Like all Bell Plantation products, PB2 and Chocolate PB2 are all natural, preservative free, and contain no artificial sweeteners. And that makes them a sweet alternative for active lifestyles, dieters, and moms who want healthy snacks for their kids.",
      "ALL NATURAL - Made from freshly roasted peanuts, PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter is mixed with water to create a traditional peanut butter mixture. It also works and tastes wonderfully in recipes that call for the use of peanut butter. Check our free bonus recipes card for great ideas on how to use your PB2.",
      "LESS FAT - 85% less fat calories than traditional peanut butter! Superior quality peanuts are first slow roasted then pressed to remove the fat and oil. The result is an exquisitely natural roasted peanut butter flavor that's deliciously rich in taste, easy to enjoy and wonderfully healthy, with twice the healthy proteins per gram than its traditional counterpart.",
      "FREE BONUS GIFTS \u2013 Each two-pack of PB2 comes with a reusable scoop, perfectly sized to equal one serving of PB2 powdered Peanut Butter, and a double-sided, reusable recipe card with our hand-picked favorite powdered peanut butter recipes you\u2019re sure to enjoy.
