Is a very good quality which exceeded my expectation honestly, for the price I wasn't hoping for such a good keyboard. Update: May 2018 - the keyboard died from natural causes - one key (T) stopped working long ago but the rest was still good, until is started to repeat keys and numbers messing up passwords and everything. is in the trash now.",

It's a little cumbersome to type on compared to my mechanical but I only use it when my child is asleep and then it rolls up perfectly into my desk drawer. It would be better with a black cord instead of a white cord for my personal set up.",
