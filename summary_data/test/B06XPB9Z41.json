So we put her bed inside this portable playpen beside the bed and zipped it closed. She can see us and hear us and sleeps there all night till the morning. There is plenty of room for this 9 LB poodle to stand, turn, walk and of course, sleep. Very happy with this purchase.",

It came with yard stakes, so I gave it 2 stars, because if it were staked in a yard, it MIGHT be ok. However, I have very little faith the zipper would hold if my puppy dug at it, so safety is an issue as well. I initiated the return within 5 minutes of opening it. Very disappointed.",
