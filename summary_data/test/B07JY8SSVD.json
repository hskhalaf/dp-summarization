I use my earphones for more than music. I also play video games and watch YouTube videos. I tried a range of different types of sound but the Panasonic earphones sounded better in every case. I did make sure to choose the right buds to fit my ears, and while that did help a little bit, it didn't solve my problem. I've yet to do more testing with these earphones, but my first impressions are not great.",

The other thing I really like about these is that they don't fall out. Almost all other earphones I've used are constantly slipping out. The carry case is useful but maybe slightly big.",

A few quibbles; they're still not comfy when lying on your side. Though some advertising claims that as they fit inside your ear and therefore solve the age old in-ear problem, they're better than many but still not amazing. Also, they're possibly a little pricey based on some competition. Namely the Soundmagic which are about half the pricey and honestly there's not much to choose between them. Overall though, these headphones feel like a quality product and I'm glad I got them.",

I own some Beyerdynamic Amiron headphones and they are superb so had no reason to doubt the brand. I was so dissapointed with the tinny sound and comfort which drove me to purchase some INAIRS foam tips (inexpensive). The improvements are outstanding - now the headphones feel much more comfortable and the sound is great. Good headphones but buy different tips. Beyerdynamic need to supply foam tips as standard as they are doing these great headphones a misjustice, but don't let this put you off as I am really pleased with them now",
