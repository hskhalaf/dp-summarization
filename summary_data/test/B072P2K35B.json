Solid construction except the main part has flimsy removable pocket dividers (read: they do not separate areas at the bottom) that are functional enough but not as desired. As with most rolling briefcases if you fill it to capacity with laptop etc, it will easily tip forward- why can't anyone seem to build something more balanced? Pure physics and annoying if using it for more than a few folders, pens, and a featherweight laptop... since the laptop area is further forward than center of the wheels. My Chromebook is too much forward weight even with a full back compartment.",

However, I changed my mind after the second trip - it is getting easier. I anticipate using this rolling briefcase for about 1 year after which I will have to buy a new one - that particular zipper will most likely not hold up to my heavy use of the case.",

However, the bag looks great, has several file-like separators, and is excellent for carrying office/school materials. I used it as a carry-on twice and it was totally fine, but because of all the dividers, I felt like I was more limited. Notice that you can unsnap the file dividors, so it's still a good option for office and travel. It's a very nice looking bag. Recommended.",
