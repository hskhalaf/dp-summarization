I am anticipating getting pretty large so I'm hoping this will work as that happens. The band right now is soft and not tight, but fits and its stretchy so I can guess it'll expand just fine. The band goes above my belly button. The jeans are real jeans material (not the jeggings material) but they are very stretchy and comfortable. I took some photos. I've tried a few other pairs I didnt like but I like these a lot.",

The material is high quality and the belly band is very soft, and does not dig or rub my skin harshly at the top as other do. Also very form fitting, aka no saggy butt! ;)",

The main reason I bought this particular pair was the straight cut of the leg - seems like everything for sale is either skinny leg or bootcut. They are exactly what I wanted; not too tight, not too much of a flare at the ankle.",

Calf is perfect shape, narrow but not tight like skinnies so less of a struggle to get on, and more my style. The dark wash is a nice color though not the darkest, more of a medium-dark.",

The belly band is high on my ribs and comfortable. Unlike the older version, the band on these does sort of fray. Every time I wash them I have to cut strings off. I bought another pair of Motherhood Maternity pants in the store itself and they do the same thing, so it's a brand quality change. The pants I have from a previous pregnancy don't fray. Despite this, I would buy them again because of the look and fit.",
