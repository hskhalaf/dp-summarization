The only downfall is that this is the only pasta they make the carba-nada in - I would like to see pasta shells or spaghetti in addition to the fettuccine. But all in all, a great pasta and a great addition to the healthier lifestyle I'm trying to maintain.",

They are a bit too al dente for my taste, but I suppose I can get used to it. I like these way better than chickpea noodles, taste better too. My blood sugar 2 hours after eating these fettuccine is only slightly higher - would have been much higher if I ate regular noodles instead.",

They are a little pricey and do take longer to cook than the 3 mins listed on the PKG but the taste is pretty spot-on and worked well with scratch Alfredo sauce and beef stroganoff, so thumbs up for versatility. And for the reviews that refer to the 17g carbs per serving, regular fettuccine has 42g of carbs in a 2oz serving so it's actually 2.5 times fewer carbs than 'regular' pasta. I'm pleased that I gave them a try.",

If you are using a tasty sauce with them there's no difference then reg pasta and you have succeeded in cutting your carb intake by half. The high fiber count is a plus for carb watchers. Only downside was I didn't care for however they reheated, gummy texture. I definitely will continue to buy these pricey bags of pasta!",
