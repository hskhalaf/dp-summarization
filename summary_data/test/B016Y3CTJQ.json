The other is for my external storage harddrive. The 3 USB slots on the dock are used for the VR, Bluetooth Headset and final one is for this controller charger. For someone with 3 controllers this was a must for me since I charge 2 around the same time and 3rd is being used. Plus it looks nice when the controllers are docked in.",

I've matriculated the controller unto the charger for the night only to return in the morning to find it wasn't charging because it was improperly seated. I got used to it after a while and now it's second nature.",

The charging station works well and lasts since I've had mine for 2 years now.",

However, I took a star off because the blue LED lights are always on and are freakishly bright! I'll probably add a resistor to dim them down, but for now, I unplug the charger at night so that I can sleep.",

One thing to keep in mind is this station is on a shared circuit so if you charge two at once they only get half the current. I only charge mine one at a time but this could potentially annoy some people. It also lights up green when it\u2019s fully charged. Great Product!",
