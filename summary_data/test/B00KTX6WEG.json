The surface is too hard you need a towel or two, so if you want to bench press or shoulder press it will not be very convenient. This is literally a step for other type of workouts that do not involve some heavy weights. If you are into aerobic exercises then it\u2019s ok, but if you want some quick workouts that involve some heavier weights it\u2019s not really optimal. Please do some research before you buy since paying 170 is pretty expensive while you can get a good weight lifting bed for way cheaper.",

It feels roughly the same as a typical bench at the gym -- there aren't any hot spots or pokey sections. I'd give it a comfort rating of 4/5. Definitely worth the price, especially if you live in a small apartment as it is very compact.",

And I've managed to snap my fingers shut when opening the step, but that is probably user error. It's also not the most comfortable on my back.
