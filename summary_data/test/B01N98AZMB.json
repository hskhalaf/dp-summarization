      "text": "Just a warning for those looking for a curved soprano sax stand....THIS IS AN ALTO SAX STAND... it does not fit a soprano. The bottom rail can not be adjusted to fit, and the top \"hook\" is far to wide to hold the soprano. Another review here has the soprano sitting on the floor leaning against the stand, which is not how a sax stand works. As an Alto stand, its a great value, but this is NOT a stand you can use for a curved soprano.",

We\u2019ve bought stands like it for violins and violas and guitars and they keep the instruments from being on the floor and they display the instruments nicely. This stand, however, doesn\u2019t do any of that. The sax is still sitting on the floor and it lays back so far we might as well have let our kid keep laying the instrument on the floor when he was done. Not worth having, really. It is a nicely built stand for the money. Very cushy etc. I just wish it was upright more and kept the instrument off the ground.",

My 10 year old sat and stared at it with a puzzled look and said he hoped he had his sax sitting in it correctly and hoped he would get more comfortable with it, after using it .. a bit nerve racking at first, I guess. His sax was thousand$ while the stand was $15. Hope we made the right choice :D",
