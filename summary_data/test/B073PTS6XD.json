The recommendation is to wear the product 15-30 minutes a day but I have wearing mine for 2 hours daily. The only downside that I can comment on is if you attempt to wear the product under your shirt so it's not noticeable while at work, it will uncomfortably rub into your skin so my suggestion is to wear it over a shirt (with sleeves).",

      "text": "Works good. I wore it a lot at the begining. I wore it to work to help me adjust my chair. After a few weeks, I stop using it regularly because I became more conscious of my posture. Occasionally I still put it on to reinforce that feeling. It's did what I wanted. I bet there are cheaper product that will do the same. Once your body is used to the good posture then the usage of the product goes down. But I would recommend this product. It has changed my life for the better.",

Other products have a tendency to ride up, but this stays on placed. The positioning is easy and comfortable. My favorite part has to be the adjustable straps - it's so convenient that they pull up and velcro. It makes it easy for me to wear it by myself. I'm happy to be using this daily to train my posture, and can see a difference!",

Pushing on your spine twice a week isn\u2019t going to fix knotted up muscles in your back and even if it could it would take more than 2 adjustments a week to restructure your whole body over time. Putting this on instantly made me feel better. It instantly helped me to stand back into place which in turn made me feel better. Thank you!",
