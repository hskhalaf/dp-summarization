I have tried many different brands of gloves and not one of them stayed dry inside , not one! I live in MT so temps can easily drop well below zero, if gloves get wet inside your hands will be frozen within minutes. These gloves have stayed 100% dry inside , even after cleaning out a livestock watering trough. Best gloves I have ever had.",

By the end of the second day of use, I noticed the stitching on each side of my right glove started coming undone. I am not sure why. I didnt do anything with them out of the norm. So, I am a little disappointed. If the glove didn't come undone, then I would have given these a 5 star rating!! They look good and were warm.",
