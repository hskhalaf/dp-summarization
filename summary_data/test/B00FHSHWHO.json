This helmet, the HJC Solid Mens CL-17 Full Face Motorcycle helmet is a great value and good quality helmet. It has great ventilation and inner liners are very comfortable. I couldn't be happier about my purchase of this motorcycle helmet. Note: Don't buy the replacement lens HJC HJ-09 Shield Silver with the mirror finish, it's a piece of crap! See my review of the face shield for more details. Helmet GOOD, replacement face shield BAD!",

Cons: - The pads are much thicker than the CL16 of the same size (large) so my face felt like it was going to pop for a few weeks.
