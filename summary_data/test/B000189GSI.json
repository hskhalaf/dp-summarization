These new ones aren't quite the finish and they have a peened solid rivet holding the two halves instead of a threaded bolt and nut, but otherwise they are as solid and have the same feel and grip as the old pair. I know they have probably cut corners to keep prices competitive, but if these last as long as the old pair they are well worth twice the price.",
