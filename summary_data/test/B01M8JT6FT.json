The front clip is excellent for the early stages of training, helps the dog learn that pulling is unacceptable. I also love how it has the top clip on the back as well, it's great for dogs transitioning out of the puppy age. It's relfective as well which is great for those early morning walks/late night walks. The straps are customizable so it also ensures a great fit for each dog. I really cannot recommend this harness enough!",

As he gets to full size there should still be plenty of room to make the harness bigger. I like the handle on the top which makes catching him easier. Putting it on and off is simply with just two buckles. We don't have much issue with it pinching his hair. There are two metal attachment points for a leash. One on the back near the handle and another one on the chest. The chest point makes it more awkward for him to pull on the leash when we walk which is really nice.",

But...when left on or within reach of a precocious pup (which they warn against), our dog chewed through them. So, I figured this Rabbitgoo would work and he wouldn't be able to chew through it. I was right...he didn't chew through it BUT...I almost pulled my arm out walking him because it does NOT subdue him the way the Easy Walker harness does. I had no choice but to order another 3 in 1 Easy Walker Deluxe harness. I'm glad Rabbitgoo worked for others but it just didn't work for us. I found it to be a complete waste of $$.",

I also bought a larger size for my 8 month old rescue puppy and it was as if she had always worn a harness.
