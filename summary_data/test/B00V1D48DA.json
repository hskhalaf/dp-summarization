We needed an art table for my kids, so despite being smaller than I pictured, it works for us. I think you may want something bigger if you're looking for a table for adults. My husband and kids and I all fit at it, but there's little room left.",

I love the compactness of this set. Folded, this table fit easily in the the trunk of my 2013 Volkswagen Passat. We were able to eat dinner on the table each night. The bench easily held the weight of my boyfriend (250 lbs). One night we ate dinner at the table with 2 adults on each bench (bench easily held the weight of 2 adults, roughly 400lbs). I\u2019d purchase this set again. Looking forward to using it on my next camping trip.",

Perfect for the beach to have another surface to keep things away from the sand and for the kids to have lunch. Adults can certainly sit on the benches if necessary.
