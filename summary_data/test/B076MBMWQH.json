When I slide the tray back, my mouse keeps falling out from the back. In fact, after a day of usage, my mouse actually broke because it fell down so many times. 2) The tray really should be made using a material that is slightly sturdier than the plastic that it's using right now. I don't think it needs to be metal -- may be just a thicker piece of plastic will be enough.",

It can be hard to lower your desk, so this makes up for that by lowering the position of the keyboard and mouse. It works well, but the tray itself is quite wobbly, possibly due to the casters.

I like that it\u2019s long enough to fit both my keyboard & mousepad.",

This lets me pull out my computer keyboard when I need it, and put it away when I don't. Also, I'm still trying to figure out how I'm going to arrange my computer and other equipment in the studio. So the clamps will let me easily change my mind later without drilling holes into the table.",

It fell apart last night so I will be purchasing a different model from another company. Something that's a little sturdier.
