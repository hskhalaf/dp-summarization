I bought this as a replacement and can definitely say you get what you pay for. I'm constantly wasting capsules because the load mechanism has to be aligned just precisely right or it jams. The water tank has to be filled like every third coffee. It leaks. I don't know from where. It makes coffee but barely. Wouldn't recommend this purchase at all. I plan to invest in something better quality for sure in the near future.",

For those willing to spend on average of 70 cents per shot, this is the only way to go. Yes a super-automatic would do as well \u2014 but probably not better \u2014 at 5 times the cost of the machine. And for those of the Barista temperament, an expensive manual machine is the way to go. Those not wanting to bother to tamper or grind, pre-infuse, and pray to the coffee God's that your shot turns out like you planned, need look no further.",

The frother is a $99.00 value and I would probably for go that option and put that cost towards a better frother. I am very disappointed in that.",

I probably have every coffee making system and it is top three in my opinion. For speed, ease, quality and cleanup...so good.",
