The travel case is perfect for storage and portability. The perimeter line can be tricky to store. I found it helpful to make sure that the perimeter tape is rolled carefully from short corner to short corner and held together w/ rubber bands. After the two bundles are banded, proceed carefully long ways in the same manner then band that together w/ rubber bands as well. A bit tedious, I know, but trust me, worthwhile!",

So we still get a lot of use out of it, but unfortunately can't use it for co-ed or men's games. But it is good quality and I like that the boundary lines are flat straps instead of the standard rope. The ball that comes with it is crap, but it works as a warmup ball.",

Apparently Amazon doesn't do any kind of cleaning or refurbishing on returned items. If the set had been new, I'm sure I would've like it. All of the components were good quality, they were just abused in my case.",

Well if you're not careful like a hoodie draw string if you pull too much on one end well guess what ? It's going to go in and it's a pain to get it back out. So make sure to put a big knot at the end of the string to avoid getting one end in. I unfortunately had to make a slit and maneuvered it through. My fingers were cramping when done.

      "text": "We are very pleased with this set! The set-up didn't take too long, and we have spent many hours this summer playing family volleyball. We would recommend not leaving it set up outside for more than a few days at a time as we did experience sun damage to the guy wires and the boundary lines, but Baden customer service was so great and helped us out. Play ball!",
