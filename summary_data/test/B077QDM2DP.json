Keep in mind this PC is configured in a basic way, with several USB ports (which should be adequate for most needs), but only 1 HDMI output. It will take some settings configuration to achieve audio out from HDMI simultaneously with line out (as per my needs). I do not use this for gaming so I cannot comment on quality of gameplay specs - I primarily use this for internet, streaming, and audio applications and so far so good.",

If i run it on lower settings i can get a stupid amoubt of frames but i can raid, dungeon, and pvo, go into highky populated areas, and be smooth as butter.",

The computer does not have WiFi capabilities but does come with a USB device adapter from tp-link that allows you to connect your computer to WiFi. During the initial set up, the monitor as difficult to hook up to the computer and took a bit of trouble shooting (this may have been due to the monitor however). My husband has been very happy with this computer so far and would highly recommend it.",
