      "text": "Love Amazon prime video. Mostly bought it for the grand tour. Slightly disappointed with the selection of videos. There's very little if any at all of Disney films. There must be some law whereby they can't have them. Lots of old films and a few new films. The repository will get better I assume with time. Lots of stuff for the kids and lots of TV shows if you have time to watch them all. Also great option is you can download and view the shows or films offline so as to not use data. Watch them when commuting or something.",

      "text": "Whilst this app is laid out nicely and is relatively easy to use, the streaming quality leaves much to be desired. The sound is just fine, considering it's being listened to via a tablet but the film quality which should be SD (like a dvd, not a blu-ray) is very patchy and blurry. I've seen 1940's black and white films look superior in quality in comparison! This is likely due to the shockingly slow frame rate. I would not recommend this for any Samsung Android tablet which is what I have, but my Husband assures me that it looks far better on his Apple iPad. I have deleted this app which a real shame.",

However, I'd got into watching Grey's Anatomy and loved it, so I paid for membership after my trial finished, only for Grey's Anatomy to be removed less than a month after I took the membership. I like Prime delivery, but not enough to pay \u00a380 for it.",
