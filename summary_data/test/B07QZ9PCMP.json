I wanted something that she would feel safe in yet was softer/nicer than the little carrier.

We have another cat that likes to \"hide\" when she sleeps and she also loves this house/bed.",

But it only took him 30 minutes to get on the cozy bed and sleep in there. The materials are super soft and I believe that is the main reason my cat likes it. The size is perfect as it is not too big or too small for any cats and small pups I guess. I have not yet clean it but it seems relatively easy to clean. This is one of the best purchase I have made recently.",

They actually suckle on this pillow as they would if they were nursing on their mom so it all pilled up from the wetness and there\u2019s litter, food etc stuck in it. I have no way to properly clean it. I hoped to use this for many years to come but it\u2019s a real shame that they did not make the pillow cover removable.",

Kittens love it so if you have a smaller cat this will be perfect for you. The cushion it comes with is machine washable and the rest you can spot wash so the bottom (mesh type material) doesn't ruin. It's collapsible as well and you simply pop it up, put the pillow inside and it's good to go.",

I will update if he starts to use it. Beyond that, the cushion is super plush and the sides don't seem cheap at all.",
