Thanks to the HyperChiller, I have now found a solution!!! The HyperChilller worked like a CHARM today!!! I was able to create my own iced coffee directly from my coffee maker in the comfort of my own home. I guarantee this item will be used frequently! Great job!",

I cannot stand watered down iced coffee, and cold brew never seems to taste strong enough. I use a French press and the HyperChiller every morning, perfect cup of iced coffee!!!",

It is also a huge mess trying to get your liquid into the tiny whole on the top. Between the small hole and the ice forcing the top up and distorting it, this is a big waste of time mess.",
