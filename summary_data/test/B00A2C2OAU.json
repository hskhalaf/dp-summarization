You really cant beat it for the price. Assembly was easy, I had it on the wall in 25 minutes. Downfall is the wire shelves, you cannot hold a lot of small toiletries and the shelves have a piece of wire in the middle so you cannot have something balance on it. I would recommend this for condos/apartments- maybe not something you'd want to display forever.",

But , I like it, Easy to put together, easy to attach to the wall with simple tools everybody have at home. The only conser is that it might work for big bathrooms items as : large size shampoo, conditioner...etc....otherwise the small items would be \" unstable \" on the shelves. So, what I did, I cut a small pieces of wood that I found in my place, and put it on the top of each shelf. Now I have room for big and small items without worrying they might fell.",

They are the flimsiest ones I've ever seen....super thin plastic and bend easily when pushing them into the hole.
