I paid \u00a3100 5 years ago for some cheapy 24\" IPS panel and it never gave me this problem at all, so why does ASUS think it's okay to charge over \u00a3400 and not even get their blooming quality control in check? What is this garbage! Returning this piece of cr*p. ASUS need to do better in order to justify charging so much. Don't give a monkeys about high refresh rates and all other rubbish if you can't even get something so basic right!",

The downside was that it came with 2 power cables, the UK and European plugs respectively, however the cable with the UK plug was not compatible with the connection port on the back of the screen (ain't it crazy huh?!). So I had to order an extra adapter for the European plug cable to fit the UK socket.",

Darker colours you might as well forget about entirely, the monitor has about 5 shades of black that sit next to eachother like massive pixellated blobs. Really horrible.

The games look fantastic on it, the 144hz makes everything look smooth and silky haha. So I'm glad I spent the extra \u00a350/\u00a360 on this monitor than a standard one. Can't go wrong with it.
