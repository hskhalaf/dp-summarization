    "title": "GuruNanda Oil Pulling Oil, Natural Mouthwash, Ayurvedic Blend of Coconut, Sesame, Sunflower, & Peppermint Oils. A Refreshing Oral Rinse - Helps Bad Breath, Healthy Gums + Whitens Teeth. (8.45 fl. oz).",
    "description": "Size:8.45 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)HOW TO USE\nShortly after waking and before eating or brushing your teeth, this extraordinary oil can be swished around in the mouth and spit out to \"\"\"\"pull\u201d bacteria and other toxins from the body.\n\n\ufe0fTo use, simply place approximately 1 tablespoon of GuruNanda Pulling Oil in your mouth and gently swish, pushing the oil between your teeth and around your mouth for 2 to 3 minutes. For better results you may gradually increase the time period up to 15 minutes as long as it is comfortable.\n\n\ufe0fWhen the oil begins to feel watery or if you start having jaw or neck fatigue, spit it out. Wash your mouth thoroughly with fresh clean water and then brush your teeth with a toothbrush and toothpaste.\n\n\ufe0fWhile you are pulling, mucous may build in the back of your throat. You may even have to expel the oil and clear the mucous from your throat before reaching your desired duration of pulling. If this occurs, use more GuruNanda Pulling Oil and continue pulling until you have hit your total pulling time. With frequent use, gradually increase your pulling time up to 15 minutes. You must brush your teeth after you pull oil as oil forms a biofilm on top of teeth. As a result, microorganisms can get trapped between the biofilm and teeth, which can create dental issues.\n\n\ufe0fMost importantly, the pulling oil should not be swallowed as it contains the very toxins and bacteria you are trying to eliminate from your body.\n\n\ufe0fOil pulling is best performed in the morning before consuming any fluids or food. Results may vary depending on the frequency of use. Although relief is very different with individual people, users may see substantial results in as little as 6 weeks.",
