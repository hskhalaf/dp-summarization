It\u2019s a little heavy but that is not a real complaint. It\u2019s a lovely unit and I am so thankful for it!!",

TIP: If you have an oscillating fan, especially up and down and side to side, place it in front of the AC. Heat rises, so the fan helps to circulate the cold air and force out the hot air. My room was 32 degrees. In 1 hour 20 minutes, the temperature went down to 24.5 degrees. Considering what the unit is doing, it is pretty quiet too. I find the noise it makes rather soothing and I have no trouble hearing the TV. Best of both worlds.",

On a hot day it would drop the temp by like 1-2 degrees which lets face it for 400 pounds its pretty poor, i have 20 pound fans doing better job and they nowhere near as noisy or power hungry....

We have had a hole drilled through the bedroom wall and this nicely fits into the connection (instead of opening a window). We will put the aircon away when not needed. It has been a much needed relief and has been on non stop during this heatwave. Very reliable and really cooling the bedroom down for sleeping.",

Noise wise is ok, hard to sleep with, around 52db, it is like having a big freezer in the room(for the noise), the sleeping mode is a joke I do not see/feel any difference. good for the price, at the end of the day is really hot a couple of weeks a year, did not want to spend too much.",
