Feels like the overblown reviews on them are just that (or HTC updated them); either way, buttons and HTC Sense work perfectly fine :-) - Software has no lag whatsoever - The build quality, beside beautiful, is TREMENDOUS and tough - I have rocked this (and dropped) without a case, and still no scratches If you can shell out for this phone, do it. No regrets on my end. :-)",

I've had it less than a week and getting more accustomed to the whole HTC Edge Sense and how it reacts. Once I'm used to Sense and the digital buttons, maybe I'll give it 5 stars. The phone is lightning fast compared to my old phone, charges faster, battery lasts longer, takes fantastic pictures, etc. I've been using HTC phones since the EVO and hope they keep making phones as I'm not a fan of Samsung.",

Which I then took the refund and sent the phone to HTC to get repaired and then used the refund to pay the repairs. So except a long wait and a lot of hassle they did sort of make it right. I now have the phone back and it works great....so far",

If it were not for the texting part, more crucial than calling these days, I would have kept the phone. I returned it because I could not get texts.",

The sound quality is also 10 to 20 percent better than the HTC U11, which is already pretty good. Highly recommended - ck HTC Website for specs and more.",
