Pros: 1) Good quality memory foam. 2) Water resistant, not waterproof. 3) Comfortable. 4) Nice looking. 5) Good price. 6) Zippered cover. 7) Memory foam is dense. Cons: 1) Short dog fur can get caught in the microfiber topping. 2) The foam can be ripped apart by strong dogs (this is my 2nd Brindle bed). Summary: If the bed is maintained properly (outer cover washed and inner mattress wiped down), it will last quite a while and stay in good condition. I\u2019ve had the previous bed for 3 years.",

It's super cozy, and does not lose its shape which I was concerned about. This is perfect. It is super easy to run through the wash which was very impressive. It went on perfectly after washing as well. Overall a great bed. Although I noticed that the seam is coming apart near the zipper and would love to have the cover replaced because of it. That is why I gave a 4 star review.",

      "text": "This bed IS memory foam. It gets harder with colder air and softer with warmer air. My dog sleeps like a baby on it. She is 13 and full of arthritis. She also has night accidents. I read the reviews about the mattress undercover not really being waterproof. So I came up with a solution! If you put a crib waterproof mattress pad between the mattress cover and the top cover it works like a gem! If there is an accident all you need to do is wash the pad and top cover together. Amazon sells the crib waterproof pad too. Well worth the investment!",

Our dog is mid sized but the foam foundation layer supports the weight and doesn't press down to the floor like some beds. We keep the kennel door open and our dog is able to come and go throughout the day and night; the bed is the preferred sleeping spot.",
