      "text": "I love how the crib wedge elevates my baby's head. It's just enough to prevent spit ups and improve her breathing as she sleeps at night. Would definitely recommend for that matter. I do wish it was a little softer or thinner right at the edge (part that ends up on her mid back). Although, our little one didn't seem to mind and I was pleased that she slept through the night and had no spit ups or heavy breathing. Safety first! Overall, such great product, would buy again for sure :)",

I wish there was some way I hold him on the pillow through the night. I think this will only work for 0-3 month babies who stay in one place, normally they are still in their bassinets at that age.
