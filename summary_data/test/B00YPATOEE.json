It is simple to hook up and the sound is very good too. I have an Amazon Echo Dot connected which provides the streaming music services, and I have also paired my smartphone so I can stream radio from iHeart radio, Sirius XM, Pandora and Spotify. If you are looking for a Bluetooth device to upgrade your home stereo system, this thing is just the ticket. It only costs $20.00 and has more than met my expectations.",

The other thing that was pleasing was the great range that the TP Link has. I can roam far from this device (which is upstairs) without jeopardizing the signal--even outside. Highly recommended for an older receiver. I was thankful for the recommendation as there are many of these devices to choose from and this made the choice simple.",

      "text": "Great Bluetooth audio device. Range is good and I think the sound is louder/fuller then when connected to headphone jack. All necessary cables included. I especially like the fact that it uses USB for power which makes it easy to acquire power from your audio device or the included power adapter. If using in a 12V environment (Car, RV, Boat, etc.) I recommend the 12/24V to 5V USB adapter,",

(Bose port was good) It connects to the iPhone easily - is always visible to select. The only thing that would be better is if it didn't need to be plugged in - if it were battery or chargeable. However, it's really small, light and works extremely well. Bose was going to charge $100 for their bluetooth product. I took a chance on TP Link - glad I did. I love it!",

      "text": "I have tried a few knock-off bluetooth receivers before trying a nicer one. This one is exactly what I should have gotten to start with. It installs very easily, my phone connects very quickly every time my car starts. It is hidden in my center console, but has no issues with sound quality. I added a ground loop noise isolator, and that got rid of the high frequency whine that matched my engine RPM. It saved my hundreds from buying a new receiver since my car has bluetooth phone pairing but not bluetooth audio.",
