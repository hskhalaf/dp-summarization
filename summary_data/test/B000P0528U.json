Good bass sound without being overwhelming. The small size is great too. The only thing lacking is a remote control. The volume control and other adjustments are on its backside and since the speaker is up against a wall my settings have to be right because I don't want to get up and fiddle with the controls. My receiver has to be the control option.",

If you turn it up too high to compensate the speaker will clip at louder volumes so setting the gain in the middle is recommended for general listening.

I needed something small for a bedroom placement, and this fits the bill. In this setup, the PSW111 really adds a needed bass punch without being overbearing or muddy. The SM45s actually have a decent bass response, but adding this sub makes a night and day difference in the sound quality! Best advice I have is don't go nuts on the sub volume, moderate is more than enough - no need to make it sound like the overdone subwoofers on cars where it's so overbearing that you can hear every car panel and loose part vibrate!",

I would not recommend as the basis of a serious HT, but it can serve a purpose similar to mine.

It was never turned up very loud and wasn't abused, it was connected to a Denon AVR 1909. I own several other Polk speakers and they have been great, I am not sure I would buy a sub from Polk again based on the other negative reviews.",

    "description": "Style:SingleThe PSW111 packs all the power of Polk Audio technology into just a little over a square foot. Experience the strongest bass in one of the smallest subwoofers you\u2019ll ever find. Its 8\" Dynamic Balance composite cone driver, special circuitry inside the amp and a solid MDF cabinet with internal bracings ensure clean, detailed lows, while limiting distortion. Features a powerful motor structure and a downward firing port that allows the sub to produce louder, deeper, punchier bass for an enhanced home theater experience. Connects easily to any system with pro-grade, unfiltered LFE, line and speaker inputs. Unique design keeps the PSW111 stable, steady and power efficient, even at extreme volume levels.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nBest matched for RM and SurroundBar series or compact speakers from other manufacturers, the Polk Audio PSW111 compact powered subwoofer features an 8-inch composite woofer that packs a punch larger than its size would suggest--delivering powerful, accurate and musical bass at an affordable price. It measures 12-1/8 x 11 x 13 inches (HxWxD) and it has a continuous power rating of 150 watts (with 300W dynamic power rating). \n\nPolk Audio PSW111 powered subwoofer in black. PSW SERIES KEY FEATURES\nFLOOR COUPLED PORT\nAll woofers (except for PSW10) feature a floor coupled downward firing port. This configuration brings you maximum bass impact while keeping the front of the cabinet as low profile as possible.\n\nKLIPPEL OPTIMIZED WOOFER\nBy using a state-of-the-art Klippel Distortion Analyzer, Polk engineers were able to optimize the woofer's motor structure, voice coil alignment and suspension bringing you the best possible performance even at extreme listening levels.\n\nDYNAMIC BALANCE\nA Polk perfected method of analyzing a speaker's microscopic behavior with laser Interferometry. Polk engineers can tune out unwanted resonance and distortion with the right combination of materials, geometry and construction techniques. This brings you pure, distortion free sound.\n\nMULTIPLE HOOK UP OPTIONS\nLFE, line and speaker level inputs, and speaker level inputs allow easy connection to any system. \n\nINTELLIGENT AMPLIFIER\nPSW Series subwoofers use intelligent amplifiers. This means, not only can they put gobs of power to your woofer, they'll use very little power at low volumes or standby mode.",
