These poles are a bit short, but we can cast really well with them. They quickly collapse and we throw them in the back of the SUV. Really nice, fully recommend them.",

It arrived auper fast and was packaged great for protection. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a dependable yet affordable retractable rod.

      "text": "Ya sure it's cheap but even if it cost $5 that's still a waste of $5. First the top inserts fell out for like no reason. Super annoying but by bending the ring I was sort of able to keep it in place for maybe 20 minutes at a time. Then the shaft itself snapped about 2/3 way up the rod. I was using 4# line! Still got the perch ....but wat? How does that even happen. Save yourself the hassle and don't get this.",
