It's under warranty but working with Lenovo warranty to get it repaired is not easy, and I'll be without it for at least 2 weeks. I'd recommend trying something different - online searches show I'm not the only one having power issues.",

However, I've seen the price jump to 200 dollars and more afterward and I wouldn't recommend it for that. Really good just not worth that.
