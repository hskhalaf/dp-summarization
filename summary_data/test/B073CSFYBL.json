I am going to keep it as it will look good in another room I have with a black bedroom set. This does not go well with an espresso colored bedroom set. Again, great quality but colors are not what they appear in the picture.",

It's breathable, unlike poly quilts that make me and my hot natured husband sweat. We have bought two now, under $100 each. I wash them with cold water and dry with low temp to avoid any shrinkage. Another brand quilt shrunk badly and no longer fit after washing and drying on warm temp.",
