These are my favorite type of pens because they're known for smooth writing and dark ink. I'm confident I got a bad batch because some of the pens started drying out even when there was so much ink left. It's terrible! The writing looks ink-deprived and it's not smooth at all to write. I have to apply a lot of pressure to get this result. Here is a picture attached. Sigh, pretty sad haha. Hopefully, the remaining pens are better than the first few I've tried.",

I gave 2 stars for the \"giftable\" category only because its a good cheap pen, but rather not something you'd give to someone as a gift.",
