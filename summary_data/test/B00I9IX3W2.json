      "text": "Color is great. Brightness cannot compare as it is only 700 lumens. Heavier unit if you travel with other stuff in our brief case?, very slow remote and manual entry. Hope that is an update on the software? Can anyone tell me if and where can I update the unit software? It has great features: wifi, usb, full HDMI input, speaker, It is not as user friendly great bulb life in the 20,000 hr. range!, Love the tripod mount which I used it with a camera tripod so it can be place anywhere in a crowded hall or room. I read that it does not project MP4 video?",

But fan noise reduces, once it is playing a source. I don't know the reason behind this. It is slightly bulky when compared to my other LED projectors I had in the past. Media player didn't play mp4 format.",

Even when its near the wall, we can see the larger projection. Few of the projectors does not have this feature. Since its LED, the life of the light bulbs are longer hence greater life time. Cons: 700 Lumen is bit less compared to other projectors in market. But its a personal choice.",

      "text": "Great picture quality and brightness however the fan is extremely noisy. I have a surround 5.1 channel home theater and even with the volume turned up half way the fan in the projector is makes enough noise to be heard. Not only is the fan loud but it varies in speed so you can't get used to the buzz it makes. I've only used it for gaming, so I'm not sure if this only applies to games, but since that is almost the only thing I use it for I'm rating it based on this experience.",
