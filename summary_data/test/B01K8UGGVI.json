Learned a few things while using this kind of paint for the first time with how it blends and layers. I do suggest if you are using a brush to apply as I did... that when you want a nice even finish in the end, that you dab with your finger some fresh paint over the strokes that a brush makes. dabbing with your finger really helps smooth and blend into other areas.",

I DID notice it said that it was for face painting as well, but I wouldn't want to put it near my face...it smells like a weird fishy odor...very similar to how \"Fix-a-flat\" smells, or...well I'll just stop here.",

It didn\u2019t sweat off as I was concerned but did come right off when actively scrubbing with water. I wore a white tank top that got paint on it and it was bright white after coming out of the washing machine (I was prepared for it to stain in case- going to splatter paint it next).",

As with most body paint, this does have a tendency to crack if you apply too much. I hope this helps! :)",

Next time I will use tablecloths and supervise the spillage and mess. Paint is somewhat difficult to wash off of the deck and tables (didn't really come completely off). I bought two of these kits and was just right for about 20 kids.",

It was the fumes of the paint, I didn't get any in my eye. It was tolerable and went away once the paint dried.",
