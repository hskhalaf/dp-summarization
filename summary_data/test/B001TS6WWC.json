It's fairly large but not overkill in my opinion. I would recommend it!",

Their pup push the through the screen that I had left open for breathing and oxygen flow. They brought this tent for me to replace the one that was destroyed.

If the outside space was enclosed with a bottom that is connected to the main tent bottom I might have kept it. I instructed my husband to leave it for the bears the last time we camped in it.",

There was no sleeping in the tent that night. Thankfully I was only camping an hour drive away from home and we went home for the night. So much for camping. This tent does not hold up in rain.

The problem I have is fabric feels extremely cheap and not as good of quality as my other Coleman tent. We had one stitched area pop (sorry no photo) which causes concern, especially once we get this out to the camp grounds. The tab on the bag that you hold to zip the bag ripped on first use, though not a functional issue it is still a concern. Not your typical Coleman product in my opinion. Almost like it's a knock off. Still haven't used for a camping trip. This review is based on the initial set up to familiarize myself with the product.",

It fits a queen and twin air mattress pretty well, to get the full \"6\" capacity I would only venture to guess everyone would have to be in sleeping bags and stuffed in there like chickens.

I also stitched in a ripstop tarp as flooring for the screened porch area which keeps all the little critters out that otherwise have access to your gear that's not in the sleeping area. Not sure why this wasn't the design, but i guess its cheaper. Otherwise it's a great tent.",

However it's well worth it especially if you're having a family outing. My only con about this tent is that the bags the poles and stakes come in are kind of cheap and tore immediately.

Haven\u2019t tried it in the rain, but it was fairly windy and we had no issues, although I already had some upgraded aluminum stakes from a previous tent. Based on its design, I think this tent will fare much better in rain than my previous one.",

I taped together a few emergency blankets (those ones that kinda look like foil) and put them under the rain flap with duct tape. This fixed the problem with rain and holding heat. The tent was especially ineffective during wind with rain combo. It would come right up under the rain flap...",
