This addition to the global roster of Topo Athletic running shoes was hailed as a reliable companion for the trails. The durability of the components, the steadiness of the midsole and the well-ventilated upper became the elements that caused people to appreciate the whole package. On the other hand, a handful of people claimed that there was some tightness when the foot rested in the interior chamber.The Topo Athletic Ultraventure is a trail shoe that\u2019s meant for both neutral pronators and fans of stability running footwear.",

The insole is holding its cushion. I run on rocky trails and no issues with no rock plate. No problems with stream crossing - dry out quickly. Very happy",

I read a review on the Topo Athletic Ultraventure Trail Running Shoe and decided to try the shoe. I love it. While not zero drop it is minimal. The shoe is comfortable and the material used on the body of the shoe is very supportive. Now of course this is my opinion. As with any shoe what feels good on my foot may not be right for you. But if you have a local store that stocks the shoe I would recommend trying on a pair to see if you like them.",

The Topo Ultraventure gives you the roomy toebox of the Altra but it has more cushioning than the Altras and Less cushioning than the Hoka Speedgoats but overall i find it more comfortable and more responsive. I'm 60 years old so my feet appreciate the padding but I still like to feel connected to the trail. these are the Goldilocks selection of the trail running shoes as they are \"just right\" for me",

This gives a horrible unstable feeling on even minor climbing. If I go half size lower, its not as loose but then toe hits the end of shoe (i.e., short on length).
