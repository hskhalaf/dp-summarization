Unfortunately this one isn\u2019t better , the zipper won\u2019t zip while attached to the seat , the tablet holder leans forward instead of holding back tight , you can\u2019t put much in the pocket beneath or it would fall out . The cup holders seem to be the only thing that truly holds tight For the price I\u2019m very disappointed . Honestly I wouldn\u2019t waste the money they cost",

      "text": "I'm really impressed at this car seat organizer. Hubby has been on my case for awhile, so this is helping keep the minivan under control! Two big sippy cups fit in the drink holders, and they won't sweat all over the floor due to neoprene insulation. The whole thing is nice and stiff, not saggy like some all fabric ones I've seen. There's a big plastic back piece, so I expect it'll stay stiff and strong for a long time. Lots of pockets for markers, pens, activity books, etc. We don't have car tablets, but the clear pocket is nice for other stuff, too. My toddler tells me about the moose every time she gets in the car now!",

Even in a fairly large truck, he can easily pull out books and put them back while secured in his car seat. He can also have a drink, snack or toy handy. We mainly wanted this for summer road trips and so far, it fits the bill. The organizer seems to be well made with durable fabric and neoprene. The pockets are a good size to fit even wide books. We have not tried movies yet, but it seems like that would work well. Very pleased overall!",
