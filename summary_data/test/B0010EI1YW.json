Replaced with same product from Infinity Instruments. This time the hour hand just dangled to the number six -- again not attached. Poor or terrible manufacturing and quality control. And again Amazon was excellent with immediate support on how to return. Am sending today and will buy a different clock.",

I've never bought anything that didn't come with at least a cheap off brand battery. I bought it for the clock so i'm keeping it, if I had bought from a store I would probably exchange it for one with a working thermometer and hygrometer.",
