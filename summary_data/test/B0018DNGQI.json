It loosens the curl just a little, never over-processes (i.e., never leaves me with random straight pieces of hair), leaves my hair soft and conditioned, and even though it's expensive, I find one box is enough for 4 applications. I've tried other texturizers you can get at the drugstore, and found them nowhere near the quality and consistency of this one. Highly recommend!",
