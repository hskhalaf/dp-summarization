The main advantage over a comparable Canon model is the Lithium battery (although you have to take it out of the camera to charge it). Don't let the size fool you - this camera is quite light. This camera does not have an Electronic View Finder (EVF), which I don't really find too useful and never used in my old digital camera. The LCD screen is sufficient under most lighting conditions. I haven't gotten around to playing with most of its features, but for normal point and shoot operation -- this camera is pretty good.",

Some reviewers did not like the \"hard\" lens cap, but to me it is one of the best features because it really protects the lens. The only thing that I do not like is that you either get a strong light with the flash, or very little light if the flash is not used. Some photos taken inside during the day are either washed out or too dark. But I probably need to make an adjustment to fix this, but have not been able to figure out how.",

I used to have a dscw10 and it took WAY BETTER pictures.., and my 200 dlls cheaper kodak camera did too.., go figure. Ps.- if someone knows how to solve that issue please let me know!",

      "text": "I purchased the H3 online, based on the reviews in a major consumer magazine. I should have tried it out first. It functioned ok when I tried it shooting stills inside, but then I took it outside. It was a moderately sunny day. The lack of a viewfinder made it next to impossible to use this camera outside. The LCD screen was totally washed out by the sunlight. I could not compose the subject let alone view the many icons on the screen. If you are considering buying this camera I highly suggest you take it outside and see if you can live with this problem.",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H3 8.1 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom with Super SteadyShot Image Stabilization",
    "description": "Sony Dsc-H3 Black Digital Camera\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nLonger zoom, smaller size. Sony puts 10x optical zoom in the palm of your hand. With compact body design, 8.1-megapixel resolution, and a top-quality Carl Zeiss lens, the Cyber-shot DSC-H3 packs more photo opportunities in a small size. Advanced Sports Mode (up to 1/2000 second) catches fast action. And Face Detection detects up to eight faces in a picture, so everyone will look their best. HD Output provides spectacular photo viewing on your Sony Bravia and other compatible HDTV screens, and the Sony Double Anti-Blur Solution combines Super SteadyShot optical image stabilization with High Sensitivity (ISO 3200) for crisp imaging in low light. \n\n 10x Zoom in a Sleek Compact Body\nSony radically redesigned the positioning of key camera components to fit a powerful 10x optical zoom capability into a compact design that's easy to carry anywhere. The grip fits firmly into your hand, the lens ring adds a high-performance feel--and the top-mounted Wheel Dial lets you adjust shooting modes faster. \n\n High-Power Carl Zeiss 10x Optical Zoom\nA superb lens for bringing long-distance subjects up close, the pro-quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens design of the DSC-H3 provides 10x optical zoom design--with 20x digital zoom to enlarge the center portion of the picture so you see even more detail. \n\n 8.1-Megapixel Super HAD CCD\nMore megapixels give you more detail and definition for editing, cropping, and making large digital prints. Sony's advanced Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. \n\n Advanced Sports Mode\nTo capture fast-moving subjects in split-second detail, the DSC-H3 combines high shutter speed (up to 1/2000 second) with Continuous AF and predictive focus control that tracks moving subjects and forecasts their position during the interval between shutter release and image capture--a great way to catch the perfect moment in sports, children's games, pet tricks, and more. \n\n Face Detection\nBecause the face makes the photo, Sony has created Face Detection technology that recognizes up to eight faces in a photo and automatically controls focus, exposure, color, and flash to bring out the best in everyone. Unlike some competitive systems, Sony Face Detection makes skin tones look more natural and reduces red-eye with pre-strobe flash. \n\n HD Output\nWith direct HD output to spectacular Sony Bravia and other compatible HDTV screens, you can view DSC-H3 still photos in high definition clarity and detail. Optional HD solutions include a Cyber-shot cradle/charger with component cable output and high-speed Photo Printers that make 4-by-6-inch prints in about 45 seconds. (Cradle/charger and printer sold separately) \n\n Powerful, Versatile Flash\nWith a flash powerful enough to illuminate subjects up to 23 feet away, the DSC-H3 opens up new opportunities for flash photography--including dimly lit interiors and outdoor shots at twilight. Auto Daylight Synchro provides effective fill-in flash illumination for backlit subjects--and Macro Flash lets you take ultra-close-up shots with optimal exposure and minimal \"whiteout\" effect. \n\n Super SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization\nOther image stabilization systems crop in to compensate for \"camera shake\"--but with the Super SteadyShot system, optical sensors detect camera movement and send correcting signals to a stabilization lens that allows even ultra-long-distance digital photos to capture more detail with less camera-shake distortion. \n\n High Sensitivity Mode\nWith Super SteadyShot image stabilization to minimize blur, High Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200) lets the DSC-H3 shoot effectively in low light without flash to preserve the mood--and Sony's original Clear RAW NR (Noise Reduction) image processing technology helps suppress the color noise that can accompany high-sensitivity shooting. \n\n HD Slide Show with Music\nIt's the high-definition viewing experience that makes photos come alive on compatible HDTV screens, accompanied by your choice of visual effects and any of four preset musical selections stored in memory or your favorite MP3 tunes downloaded from PC to your camera for use as background music. \n\n 9-Point Autofocus\nBecause an off-center subject can make your shot more interesting, the DSC-H3 can measure autofocus precision at 9 points on your screen--giving you greater creative freedom to compose your image. \n\n D-Range Optimization\nPowered by the exclusive Sony Bionz high-speed processing engine, D-Range Optimization preserves image data in bright highlights and reveals more detail in shadows or backlit areas--for great results even in difficult lighting conditions. \n\n In-Camera Retouching\nThe DSC-H3 lets you add creative effects to photos after you shoot--including soft edge filter to soften backgrounds, cross filter to place starry \"dazzles\" at highlight points, partial color filter to mute surrounding colors, even fish-eye filter to create interesting fish-eye lens effects. \n\n In-Camera Red-Eye Reduction\nIrritating \"glowing eyes\" can ruin even the most creative photos--so the DSC-H3 gives you in-camera correction at the touch of a button to reduce lingering red-eye effect that other systems might miss. \n\n 2.5-Inch LCD Screen, Simple Controls\nThe DSC-H3 provides a large, bright LCD screen--plus simple camera menus, a Home button for quick access to necessary functions, and a simple Function Guide that displays menu information to make it easier for beginners to learn camera features. \n\n Wheel Dial for Manual Exposure Modes\nFor more creative freedom, a simple wheel-dial control lets you quickly change camera settings in manual modes (shutter speed priority, aperture priority, manual exposure) and also control ISO sensitivity, focus area, and exposure value. In play mode, the wheel dial provides a quick way to view your next or previous shot. \n\n 31 MB Internal Memory\nThe DSC-H3 allows you to capture a limited number of shots in-camera for later transfer to PC or Memory Stick Duo media--so even if you forget your flash memory card, you can always get the shot. \n\n Up to 51x Smart Zoom Feature\nSony's Smart Zoom feature lets you crop in close on the central portion of interest in your photo while avoiding the image degradation of other digital zooms--with 17x HD Smart Zoom function at 1,920 x 1,080 resolution for 16:9 widescreen display, 51x Smart Zoom function at VGA resolution. \n\n MPEG Movie VX Fine Mode\nThe DSC-H3 can capture VGA (640 x 480) audio-video clips at high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second). \n\n Stamina Battery Power\nThe DSC-H3 provides up to 330 shots with a fully charged NP-BG1 Lithium Ion battery--enough shooting capacity to cover a long weekend or a whole vacation. \n\n What's in the Box:\nSony DSC-H3 digital camera, NP-BG1 rechargeable battery, BC-CSG battery charger, USB and AV multi-connector cable, power cord, shoulder strap, lens cap, lens cap, strap, lens hood, lens adaptor ring, CD-ROM software. Note: No Memory Stick DUO media or adaptors are included.",
