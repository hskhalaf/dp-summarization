Every bit of the sticky surface was covered by flies. I will always keep one of these going in warmer months.",

We tried using fly tape, didn't really work. It took a few days to notice an difference. We tried different locations in the kitchen and on day 3-4 or so it started to really catch the flies. The only negative is that it comes with only 2 sticky papers. Both got filled up in about 4-6 weeks. I would recommend the product as it has worked really well for us.",

I have left it on day and night for a few weeks and caught less than 10 fruit flies (we have lots of them in our kitchen right now). With house flies it is a different story. Any house fly that gets in during the day is always caught by morning.",
