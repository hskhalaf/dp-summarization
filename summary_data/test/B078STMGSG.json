Update: after using this for some months now it has made a noticeable difference.

It's hard to find such good quality for such a good price. Thank you again!",

The box arrived just fine, so someone mailed it already broken. ALSO, when I tried to place the top roller back on (with very little pressure) it popped out of the holder. That was the last straw for me, too heavy and created with poor (weak) construction. What a waste of time. : (",

The rollers themselves are nice and smooth and look good, and are carefully drilled to rotate smoothly (no wobble). Really a decent product. The brackets holding the rollers don't look very strong, but the rollers are worth the cost by themselves, and I will see if the brackets hold up.",
