The gloves that came with it are also really good gloves and adding in the brush and hive tool were a nice bonus.",

My boots had taken cared of the trouser length, so that did not need any adjustments.

      "text": "I'm 6 foot, 195 lbs. The large size fits about perfect. Although when I crouch down it does get tight around the front of my neck. But, if I leave the zipper an inch or 2 from the top (still within the bail zipper) this problem is alleviated. Great product, definitely recommend.
