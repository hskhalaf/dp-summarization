I\u2019m almost 50 years old and did not want my shopping affected by cold wet feet. There were many snow piles I had to step on to cross the streets! At one point a water line broke, and I had to step in a water ice mixture! Not once did my get get wet, or even cold (I was wearing smart wool socks- which I equally recommend with the purchase of this shoe- they are a great paring!). These shoes made for a better than expected trip during a horrible snow storm!",

I read about this problem in other reviews but decided to order them anyway. All of my shoes, boots, winter boots and even steel toe boots are Keen's, because historically they had what I needed: wide/tall toe box, narrow supportive heel, and really good arch support. This has been harder to find in recent years. I'll be sad to return these shoes.",

Even with heavier socks, the shoe still fits comfortably. Haven't tried them out in winter weather yet. My only concern is that they do not \"squeak\" . Had that issue with another pair of Keens (different style) - so hoping that this pairdoesn't develop that annoying little noise - especially since these are an expensive pair of shoes!

Winters in Chicago are no fun, and I've been searching for something in between my Birks and Uggs to wear that goes well with jeans, and can hold up to the elements as well.

The top of the shoe was the slightest bit narrow when I first tried them on, but they felt extremely comfortable by the second wear. Highly recommend these!",
