Contains the smell without being too pricey for refills. I use disposable diapers part time, and cloth diapers part time, and the refill lasted me about 2 months before replacing (with a 2 to almost 4-month-old). My guess is you'd replace these about monthly if you're using disposable diapers full-time.",

These refills are ingenious and make it so simple to change the bag that even my darling HUSBAND can do it. Honestly, he's the guy that doesn't even empty the bathroom trash on trash day - if it's not sitting next to the kitchen trash, it's not going out. So for him to empty the Diaper Dekor and haul the dirty diapers to the laundry room - the system MUST be easy! We've used the same system for 2 years and do not have an odor problem, either.",

However, this also means that the dirty diapers sit in there longer and get really ripe, gross! I've found that the seal on these pails do not hold in the smell as well as the Diaper Genies. The plastic for the refills is a good thickness, they just don't hold in the odor as well. Perhaps it isn't the bags so much as it is the pail design itself. I also wish these refills would last longer. I feel like it runs out after only 4 full \"bags\". Overall, like I said, they're ok.",

    "description": "Size:2 CountDiaper Dekor Plus Refill - 2 packCheck out Diaper Dekor Plus Refills for your Diaper Dekor diaper disposal system. These refill liners are powder scented, strong, and easy to use, plus their ingenious design means less emptying. These refills are designed as a single, long continuous liner, which means you can change as frequently or as infrequently as you want - you're in total control of how much refill you use each time you empty your Diaper Dekor pail. Empty after one really smelly change or wait until your pail is totally stuffed. These refills are ultra-tough on odors, but remember that emptying more often will help keep odors in your nursery under control. These refills are made of 20% recycled materials, so even though you're using disposable diapers, your refill will be easier on landfills and the environment. If you want to be extra conscious, Diaper Dekor also makes biodegradable refills, which break down faster than the regular refills. Because these refills hold a whopping 1160 diapers - that's a ton more diapers than the leading competitor - they'll save you money. Considering you'll make over 5000 diaper changes over the course of your baby's life, you should choose the most economical refill available. How do Diaper Dekor Plus Refills stack up against the competition? These refills hold almost twice as many diapers per refill than the Diaper Genie II Elite pail. That's a lot of diapers! So, what size refill should you choose? First, know which size Dekor pail you own, Classic, Plus, or XL, then check the information on the inside of your pail's front service door. The size of your liner should match the size of the pail on the inside of your service door. Here's a handy tip - plus-size refills are compatible with all of the plus-size pails in the Dekor line.Packaging May Vary Please note: Diaper Dekor has recently changed their packaging so the product you receive may not be as pictured. The products themselves will remain the same. It is made of strong material that helps in keeping the nursery clean and free from unpleasant odors. Each refill pack can hold up to 670 diapers and is extremely easy to use. It can help in keeping your baby's nursery free from unwanted smells and trash. Changing the Diaper Dekor refill is quick and easy. Just pull out the refill cartridge, slip a refill over, and replace the cartridge in the pail. Pull down the refill, tie a knot, and you're done! Recommended Age: For use with the Diaper Dekor Plus PailFeatures:Huge capacity makes them extremely economical Each refill/bag liner holds up to 670 diapers 2 Pack. D\u00e9kor diaper pails use a reusable cartridge system and thereby eliminating extra plastic that would go into our landfills.",
