I can only suspect that someone purchased a batch of \"Defects\" and is now selling them through Amazon. Do not buy this reel on the internet!!",

The Fierce is a good reel, but for about an extra $20 the BG adds so many more features such as a larger main gear, larger spool, and 3 more bearings that are higher quality as well. Although the one thing I do miss about the Penn reel is the louder drag clicker and bail arm, but that's just my preference.",

    "description": "The Daiwa BG Spinning Reel sports high-quality components and industry-leading ingenuity, making this one lean, mean, fish-fighting machine. The BG is equipped with a \"Hard Bodyz\" machined aluminum body and side cover for strength and internal part stability. To increase the strength in the form of corrosion and scratch resistance, Daiwa has Black Anodized the body and body cover.\n\nAir Rotor weighs 15% less than ordinary rotors, because its unique shape cuts out the fat while distributing stress more evenly for maximum strength in a lightweight design. The ABS spool's maximized core diameter and reversed taper means no dead line buried deep in the core, and it causes less casting friction for longer and easier casting. It's also braid-ready. Daiwa's machined aluminum Screw-in-Handle design provides zero movement or play between the main gear and handle arm, offering the angler both confidence and control when rotating the handle.\n\nInside, the BG features a seven-bearing drive system that consists of six ball bearings and a single roller bearing. Infinite Anti-Reverse can be found in 4000 model reels or smaller, while Infinite Dual Anti-Reverse is in 4500 models and larger. The Carbon ATD (Automatic Tournament Drag) is waterproof and allows for super-smooth performance. The oversized Digigear System increases gear-tooth contact points and provides smoother, extended gear life and more power with increased torque. 4500 models are larger also feature a manual return bail.\n\nBG2000 Reel\n\u2022 Gear ratio: 5.6:1; LPT: 29.5\"; reel weight: 8.5 oz.; max drag: 4.4 lbs.\n\nBG2500 Reel\n\u2022 Gear ratio: 5.6:1; LPT: 33.2\"; reel weight: 9.3 oz.; max drag: 13.2 lbs.\n\nBG3000 Reel\n\u2022 Gear ratio: 5.6:1; LPT: 37.4\"; reel weight: 10.8 oz.; max drag: 15.4 lbs.\n\nBG3500 Reel\n\u2022 Gear ratio: 5.7:1; LPT: 38.5\"; reel weight: 14.1 oz.; max drag: 17.6",
