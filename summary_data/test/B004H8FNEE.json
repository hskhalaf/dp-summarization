So thank you for keeping it functional and re-selling it. I appreciate it. I like the fact I can get my photos straight into my computer -- bingo! Anyway -- this baby gets BEAUTIFUL pictures (and I am a VERY good photographer so no more need be said)!",

I like the zeiss lense. The thing is @ 16.1 mp its trying really hard to be a dslr, but its not, and I get many of the same features and almost the picture quality with my phone, so it becomes something else I have to carry. It is great for dedicated photography for when you are taking hundreds of shots of things, but its easily replaced by my phone.",

I used it today to take outdoor concert photos and they turned out beautifully. I searched for over a year to find a new camera that I liked, had the features I was looking for, and had a decent price. I love the Intelligent Auto Mode, it takes the guesswork out of which mode to use for photos, it automatically senses what you are taking a photo of and adjusts for it. Wonderful, wonderful camera and I am so glad I made this purchase.",

I would take pictures and immediately view them but when I got home the pictures were not there. Not every time but some times. This one works great after 2 years of constant use.",

Inspection pictures may be very challenging to make them tell a story and this camera makes the task very easy to accomplish!!!",

I use Auto mode most of the time which is great feature for novice users. The bad part that I am not happy about is, it takes bit longer to process between taking pictures. E.g U click one pic then it takes few seconds to refresh to be ready for another pic. So some real natural moments could be missed like blowing off birthday candles etc. It seems like it works slow at night/dark. Daytime it take great pictures and comes alive but as it gets darker it kinda slows down!!",

On the other hand, the video is pretty good and the audio is pretty good at not distorting with loud noises. It's only at 64kbps though, so dont expect great audio. But if you want to make videos at a rock concert, you will be really pleased with the sound remaining clear. Video Example: [...]",

Secondly when I press the play button the screen shows a small distortion to that side, what worries me because it can damage. However, the camera takes very good pictures even in low light. The panoramic option is very good but the resolution of the picture is low. And finally the camera is a bit slow to display images. I recommend best buy in a store where you can test the product and all its functions.",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H70 16.1 MP Digital Still Camera with 10x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom G Lens and 3.0-inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n Sony DSC-H70 \n\n\n\nShoot life at its fullest with the Sony DSC-H70. Get closer to your subjects with 10x optical zoom. Capture landscapes with one touch Sweep Panorama, take 720p HD videos, get perfect portraits with Smile Shutter or get everyone in the picture with the 25mm wide angle lens. \nSony DSC-H70 Feature Highlights \n3.0-inch LCD \n3.0-inch LCD to preview and review your photos.\n\nCompact camera with 10x zoom \nThe Sony 10x optical zoom G lens brings distant subjects super close for great outdoors, sports, and travel photos. The compact size makes it easy to take with you in a pocket, purse, or backpack.\n\nSweep Panorama Mode\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama Mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and ultra-wide options, the camera can take panoramic shots of up to 260 degrees. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.\n720p MP4 HD Movie Mode5 \nIn 720p MP4 movie mode the camera shoots 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps, which is the format when working with a PC5. Users will create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac. Once transferred to a computer you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube. (Compatible computer with internet capability required)\n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\nActive Mode \nStabilize hand held HD movies with active mode. For recording on the go this feature was designed to minimize motion capturing the video without all of the movement.\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\n\nIntelligent Auto Mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode does the thinking, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground, landscape shots, a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode.\nSoft Skin Mode \nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. \nNatural Flash \nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\nIn camera guide \nTake all the guesswork out of photography with the in camera guide. It\u2019s convenient step-by-step instructions lead to a perfect shot.\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. Also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\nFace Detection technology\nSony\u2019s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\nAnti-blink Function\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \nTransferJet technology \nTransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows transfer of up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing6.\n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 125, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to the shooting conditions.\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode.\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions.\nSelf-Portrait Timer \nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture.\nPHOTOMUSIC4\nPHOTOMUSIC4 combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish). Select from pre-loaded tracks on the camera or transfer your own from your compatible computer (sold separately).\nCompatible with PC and MAC Systems \nThe Full HD video captured with the DSC-H70 can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view video and still images on a compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites7.\nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software2 \nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable 5.5 (Mac vers. 1.3) software2 the DSC-H70 makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites7 without the need for any additional software or install. \n 1. PMB requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7 environments not supported. Not supported by Mac OS. \n 2. Uploading directly to the web requires PMB Portable software and USB cable (included), and PC with internet connectivity. Windows XP SP3 64-bit and Starter Edition and Windows Vista Starter Edition environments not supported. \n 3. Compatible BRAVIA HDTV, and component cable required for PhotoTV HD viewing. Specifications for BRAVIA HDTV shown vary according to market region.\n 4. Four preset music tracks stored in internal memory. Imported music tracks can be up to five minutes long. When using Music Transfer to download music, tracks longer than five minutes will be reduced to five minutes when uploading to the Cyber-shot camera.\n 5. Movie recording is limited to 29 minute segments.\n 6. TransferJet enabled media (sold separately) and TransferJet technology required in both devices. Interoperability and compatibility among TransferJet enabled devices may vary.\n 7. Requires compatible wireless access point(s). Some features may rely on Internet services.",
