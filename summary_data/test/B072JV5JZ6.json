It was very lumpy, over 4 inches short in length for a cal king. Width was right. Still looked Pringled after 4 days. We tried heating it to help, didn\u2019t help. We tried pulling it to help stretch it out. Didn\u2019t help. We bought the 14 inch hybrid. It got close to 12 inches thick in some areas. Closer to 10.5 in others. No place near 14. Maybe, just maybe if it hadn\u2019t sat for 15 months rolled up tight, maybe it would have been better???",

Ours took just about 4-6 hours to expand to the full size, but we didn't sleep on it for 24 hours just in case. Some reviews notice a smell, we did not. I would purchase this mattress over and over, our sleep quality is great and the mattress is just the right balance of firm and comfortable. Love it!",

Removed the box, laid the rolled up mattress onto the box spring, and slowly unrolled it. Once unrolled, it began to decompress and we slept on it that very night. It was great! Very good quality and comfort for highly affordable price. Only thing I didn\u2019t like was the initial smell of the factory sealed foam but it\u2019s already dissipated after a couple days.

      "text": "I have had it about one week. The smell is amazing, think damp cave with mushrooms. No fan or open window helps. Now the smell is about 50%, I take the sheets off everyday as Zinus suggests in other comments. Zinus says the smell isn\u2019t unhealthy, maybe true but living downwind from a pig farm isn\u2019t unhealthy either. I\u2019m over 200 lbs and this is the most comfortable mattress I have had. Shame, I\u2019m going to give it another week then decide. I wonder why some report no smell at all, did I get an old one or something?",

I\u2019ve gotten good quality sleep on it and even woke up with less back and neck pain almost immediately. It came rolled up with not much packaging and became the the normal size within a day.
