      "text": "I purchased this NAS to double as a Plex Media Server (PMS). However the unit was not powerful enough to act as a proper PMS. I ended up also purchasing an Nvidia Shield to use as the actual PMS, and simply used the DS218+ as a standard linked NAS. With that configuration it works great. If I had it to do again, however, I would've purchased a less expensive Synology NAS and otherwise kept the configuration with the Nvidia Shield PMS.",
