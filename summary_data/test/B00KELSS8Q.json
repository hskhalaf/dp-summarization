The whole thing is collapsible and assembles with velcro, with a removable pad inside so I think the whole thing will be easily cleaned!

      "text": "After ordering another cube-shaped bed that ended up being too small for our 13 lb cat, I decided to spend the few extra dollars to get this adorable house-bed. I was hesitant based on a couple of negative reviews, but I'm glad I went ahead and made the purchase through Amazon Prime! Our cat immediately abandoned her other older bed and took right to her new house! It really is adorable and I live that I can take out the pillow if I ever want to wash it. The top of the house velcroes on to the \"frame\" which is also convenient. The house stands straight and doesn't sag at all! Overall I'm very impressed and highly recommend this bed!",

It looks bigger than what it is, and not as nice in person as pictured. If you have a small dog like a Yorkie then this purchase wouldn't be a complete waste. It's not a bad purchase, just not as nice as I expected it to be and too small for my Westie dogs. I'm not one to leave reviews usually but I wanted to hopefully save someone that has a small/medium dog from buying this!! ONLY REALLY SMALL DOGS!",

The picture doesn't do it justice. My dog loves it. She wont come out of it. I have a Shi Tzu mixed. She fits perfectly in it. The only downside to the bed is the cushion that comes with it is pretty cheaply made. Not a deal breaker or even a problem. She buries herself underneath it. Love this bed!",
