      "text": "I am satisfied with this travel friendly guitar. After having tried Yamaha Guitalele and FG Jr. Guitars while traveling, business and personal, I was surprised to find this product which provides a full-size neck and decent tone through your mobile device. I connect my Traveler through an IPod, or IPhone, with Amplitube and sometimes GarageBand. Amplitube provides a range of virtual amps for more choices to shape your sound, I usually use my Traveler for either practice (Yousician) and songwriting. I've not yet tried recording with it, anyway highly recommend this instrument for guitarists requiring a highly portable full size acoustic-electric, this fits easily within most luggage too.",

Not sure who was at fault here Amazon or Traveler. I sent it back and got the correct replacement guitar. After using it a few times the output jack failed. Removed the rear cover and noticed one of the wires had broken at the soldering point. Not really worth spending the shipping cost or time for warranty repair so I\u2019ll attempt to resolder it myself. Other than these issues I really like the guitar.",

      "text": "Amazingly high quality overall, mine came with near-perfect intonation right through the 21st fret. It was practically still in tune when I pulled it out of the FedEx box, which says a lot about how well it will travel! The construction quality of a performance-grade instrument, the feel and playability of the neck are very similar to my Baby Taylor, which is in the same price range. The neck will never come loose because the whole thing is one piece of wood. It has an actual adjustable truss rod. The tuners work beautifully, and are inherently well-protected so they won't get whacked. This is a REAL INSTRUMENT, not a toy, and a brilliant design.",

This is small and rugged so I don't have to worry about damaging my full-size acoustic. Since it does not have a hollow body, it is very quiet which is perfect for hotels or staying with family. I have a small amp to use if i want to generate full sound. The action is nice and it's generally fun to play. I would recommend this to anyone who travels and wants to keep practicing.",

Saw a few YouTube reviews of it and figured why not...so glad I purchased it (on Amazon). Bought it August 2018 and play it almost every day....ideal for when you don't want to wake family late at night! Way superior than most of the travel-size guitars I have tried.",

I changed the strings to electric model. the only down sides so far (got it 1 week ago) is the G string does not stay in tune. Otherwise, I'm very happy I bought this guitar.",

It rattles a little bit when you play. I'd also be surprised if it stays in tune very well. Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend. There are better travel guitars out there that are probably much better than this one. I've already gotten rid of it.",
