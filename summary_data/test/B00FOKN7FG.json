A couple of people have mentioned the speed. The actual device speed is great, but as with all network drives, it depends on your network speed, ie wireless devices could take a little while to copy large files to and from it. where as things connected with a cable, could be up to 10 times faster, so in most cases its actually down to the speed of their network (other network storage devices get the same comments, some people do not understand the physical limitations of network/wireless speeds etc).",

No idea why, but using option (2) to upload files was much quicker and therefore definitely recommend using that if you have many files to upload. Also, very simple to stream stored videos directly to smart TVs (at least in my case). I have a Samsung Smart TV and it detected My Cloud automatically, and after that it was just a straightforward click and play.",

      "title": "Good alternative network drive for Mac Time Machine backups",
      "text": "Mainly used as a network attached time machine drive for an iMac, doubt I'll ever use it as a personal cloud drive as I have a server for this. It is possible to set these up so that multiple macs can backup up to them with some fiddling about. You will have to mount this drive for any other macs after the first one to backup to this drive. So far, so good though, although not blisteringly fast over a small network but that's to be expected.",

I wanted a plug and play device that was simple to use and this is nothing like that. I like WD but I don't like this yet!",

It just works, it's a little slow transferring large data across my wifi (100mb virginmedia) but once it's done takes about 25 mins for about 2gb. I did a lot of research before I chose this, all on offer around the same price get similar reviews. Overall I'm glad I chose the wdMycloud, I would still buy it.",

The desktop app to access it remotely is pretty poor. It crashes whenever you want to upload any large files and is just generally very clunky. 2. The amount of noise the product makes when accessing it is much more that I expected, can sometimes hear it in the room next to where it is situated.
