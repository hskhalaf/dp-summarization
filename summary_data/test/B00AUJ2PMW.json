Now, it\u2019s 5 months later & it still fits when she wears this for dress up. It\u2019s true the top little hair piece is not the best but it\u2019s easy to customize, figure out how to keep it up & add some pizzazz to it. My daughter loved it & everyone commented on how beautiful she looked. Not really too peacock looking but still pretty darn adorable.",

The headpiece is not made of the best quality either, but I can make it work somehow. The costume looks pretty much like the picture and the colors are the same too.
