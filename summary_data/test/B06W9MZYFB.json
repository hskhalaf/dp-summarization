If I'm careful and go slow, starting with the coarse side, I can comb it out from its messiest post-sleep condition without pulling any hairs out. The only thing that's not perfect is that it's not 100% static free. Not bad enough to take a star off, but in a dry environment the static can get a little annoying.",

It also has a funky, chemically smell to it which makes it seem like it's manufactured from some type of artifical materials.",
