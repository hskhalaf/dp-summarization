So, if you don't need a really loud speaker i would recommend the flare mini over the flare2. And they are both ip67 water proof which is a bonus.",

I ordered x2 and the sound is very loud when paired and bass is turned on Although, there is lag in voices vs movie/tv show when paired together but it's just fine to listen from the one speaker . If they get to loud they can become tinny when listening to vocal music. Although any dance track is amazing out of these. Overall great product and the pros easily outweigh the cons, considering buying a third!",

It's not even a cost issue it's a lack of thought and planning issue which does not fill me with confidence as to the quality and lifespan of the product.",

Fortunately, my tip for all the purchasers of these speakers is to go to the Soundcore website which has the same instructions posted with words and sentences to explain how to do this. Why the website's instructions are not included with the product itself is beyond me, but it really should. Just some constructive criticism for Anker, which is a great company",
