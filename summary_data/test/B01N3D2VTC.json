Of course after I purchased it, Amazon had a lower price for Cyber Monday and Amazon made good on the price. It was well packaged and easy to set up.",

It has great detail and is a true Lionel train, the weight of the train alone proves the unmatched build quality. At full speed I was worried the train might crash but it surprisingly stayed on the track without issue. This may seem expensive but for a being a true Lionel train it is worth every penny. Don\u2019t hesitate and just go for it on this one you won\u2019t be disappointed!",

Of course, the train ran perfectly when I set it up today to test it. I plan on purchasing additional track to make a more exciting layout that will still fit under our Christmas Tree.

I called and left a message, and I sent them an email through their website. I never got any response from Lionel. I never got any reply at all, so it looks like I'll have to pay to have the repair done out of my own pocket, which is going to cost around $75 minimum, even though it never worked at all and is still under warranty. If the train doesn't work, there is ZERO warranty support.",
