Looks good, bright colors, large features. The only weird part is the tie string - it is made out of very cheap material, not really a strong solid cord, but rather some soft mesh string - so the kids managed to unravel it in just a minute. Sort of disappointing to parents but kids seem to be fine about it, not too upset.",

The material for the clothing could be better quality... it feels cheap and I'm sure within time will fall apart but George himself seems like a great quality. The velcro pocket is tricky to undo for my toddler, even for myself, but it might wear out and become easy within time. 5 stars bc over all... this is a great find!!",
