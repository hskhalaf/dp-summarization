Other reviewers are correct that the band is a VERY subtle pink, closer to beige. This is exactly what I wanted but others may be seeking a straighter pink. It is a matte finish and will absorb other dyes. In my case, it was stained by a black leather bracelet. Not the watch's fault but I am pointing it out to save others from the heartbreak.",

Overall I like the size, style, color and price! This color looks like a very light peach/cream and could be worn for an everyday watch or for dressier outfits. This is a nice, simple and elegant watch and I would definitely recommend it for a \u2018petite\u2019 wrist - it would look lost on a larger one.",
