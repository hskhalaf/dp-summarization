Many people suggested to size down on these, so I ordered a 7, even though I'm a size 8 in every other shoe. The size 7 fit perfectly. They are soft, lightweight, comfortable and they look very nice. The material is very breathable, and the white rubber is easy to clean (especially with some peroxide). I'm definitely buying a second pair of these shoes.",

They would also be great for casual shoes if you like a sporty aesthetic and plan to be on your feet a while. The reason they lost a star for me is because they are marketed as running shoes and they are DEFINITELY NOT for running... They are heavier and foam-ier than I like for running and they get too hot and uncomfortable if you do any more than a 10 minute warm up run.",
