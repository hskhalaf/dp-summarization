It's hard to notice unless they're right next to each other, so this hasn't been a big issue for me. I also had a couple tiny chips that were loose in the box, but I can't tell which coaster they came from and I haven't seen any other parts flake off since I've been using them. I really appreciate how the entire bottom is covered with a cork composite, rather than little separate bumpers like other options I've looked at. It makes the coasters way more stable",
