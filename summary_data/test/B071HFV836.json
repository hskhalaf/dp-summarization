I don't want to be woken up for tornado watches, but I do want to be woken up when it's the more serious warning which means take cover. For those who aren't in tornado territory, watches can be frequent (several times a day for weeks) but don't usually become tornadoes. A warning means there is actual rotation and a tornado is pretty likely or an actual tornado has been sited in the area.",

Has a Volume control (A feature NOT included on the MIDLAND WR-120). Also has a built-in alarm clock and AM/FM radio making this unit seem perfect for the bedroom/bedside, however the light level of the display is WAY TO BRIGHT for any bedroom. The unit does feature display dimming feature with a single button controlling two levels: Bright and Dim. Even dimmed this unit produces too much light for a bedroom. (We solved the light problem with a small swatch of Dark Blue RoscoLux theater gel but not many people would have that around the house).",

It wasn't complicated, but there were a few times you were referred to the NOAA website for codes. I was able to silence codes like flash flood warning, etc. that don't apply since I live on top of a hill. Also, you have the option to silence \"watches\" so you don't get unnecessary alarms in the middle of the night. Plus the alarm volume is adjustable. The weather radio always gives us an alert well in advance of the local news station. This is worth the investment!",

      "text": "I like the fact you can set it so that when an alert goes out, it doesn't just continuously sound the alert sound, but switches to the broadcast message. I don't like that you can't adjust how long it continues to sound that broadcast (5 minutes). My previous weather radio would continuously sound the alert tones until you pushed a button to silence them, which meant that I often missed part of the message. I also like that you can program it to ignore certain alert types.",

I bought the clock because it was highly recommended for its features so I decided to keep it and moved it into the den. To me it's weird to have to stand up to look at a clock.",

    "description": "Style:WR400 - Deluxe NOAA Weather RadioThe WR400 is Midland\u2019s most advanced emergency weather alert radio. This NOAA Weather Alert Radio can help you be prepared for all types of emergency threats including tornadoes, floods, severe thunderstorms, civil danger warnings and more. When a severe weather watch or warning is issued by the National Weather Service, the WR400 automatically alerts you, giving you the seconds you need to seek shelter. The WR400 is capable of receiving 7 National Oceanic & Atmospheric Association (NOAA) channels. It is also programmed with over 80 alerts like hurricanes and flash flooding. The SAME localized reception allows users to program the radio to sound an alert only when weather and other emergencies threaten a selected county or counties. The technology eliminates all alerts from other areas, so users won't have to perk up their ears each time the alert sounds only to find the emergency is actually 100 miles up the highway. It stores up to 10 different previously received all hazards and weather alerts. The WR400 also features: color-coded alert level indicators, 85 dB siren, USB output to charge devices, AM/FM radio, 4 preset radio buttons, and a continuous backlighting option that keeps the LCD on.
