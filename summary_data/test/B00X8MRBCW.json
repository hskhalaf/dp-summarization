Do not be misled by price factor. Cheap in price does not mean cheap quality. It is reverse. Cheap price and outstanding performance. Oh! I am searching Amazon whether Canon has some more products like this. Photo hobbyists! Just buy it. An outstanding addition in my Canon camera and lens treasure. Thanks Canon & Amazon.",

Works great in low light due to the f/1.8. I've been able to get great background blur while taking portraits and amazing nighttime landscape photos when tripos mounted and using the 2s or 10s delay on my Canon M50. This is a lens everyone must own. Incredibly priced for what you are getting. It a great lens to use while you save up for more expensive lens like the 85mm 1.8. Buy it! Enjoy It!",

      "text": "Hi All. This is a great lens for those whose camera came with the standard 18-55mm Canon lens and are looking for an affordable good first lens. My wife and I purchased this lens to take portrait pictures of our 2 year old and family members. It is perfect for that. With an f-stop as low as 1.8 it really brings people into the foreground. I highly recommend this lens for those ametuer photographers on a budget. You will not regret it. Note: you cannot zoom on this lens so your subject(s) will need to be (I'd say) 8 to 15 feet away to get all of what you'd like in the shot.",

The auto focus is sometimes a bit laggy, the motor noise level is noticeable, especially if you record a video (there is no image stabilizer also). The manual focus ring feels quite easy to adjust. The photos are sharp, and the bokeh is nice as well. I\u2019d say best bang for the buck. I recommended to a buddy of mine and he fell in love with photography.",

    "title": "Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens",
    "description": "Style:50 mm LensThe wide f/1.8 aperture lets in more than 8x the amount of light compared to the standard zoom lens that is provided with your EOS*. This results in sharper images with less motion blur and reduced need to use flash in dimly lit conditions so you can easily capture the atmosphere of a low light environment. The 50mm focal length allows you to fill the frame with your subject from a comfortable distance making it a great lens for portraits. A similar perspective to the human eye and its compact size make the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM a great everyday lens to always carry with your EOS camera. The near-silent STM (Stepping Motor) technology focuses extremely quickly when shooting photos, so you can react suddenly to capture fleeting moments. Creating high quality movies is easier with STM as it delivers steady and quiet continuous focusing, so your movies are smooth, and soundtracks only capture the surrounding sounds and not the noise of a focusing motor. The EF 50mm f/1.8 STM replaces the popular EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens which was affectionately known for giving outstanding picture quality at an affordable price. This latest version gives the same stunning photo quality but with a fast, near-silent focus motor and a more robust build that belies its price.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nEF 50MM F/1.8 STM\nCompact and lightweight\u2014an outstanding walk-around lens Canon's EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is a great entry into the world of EOS prime lenses. With an 80mm effective focal-length on APS-C cameras, 50mm on full-frame cameras, it's an excellent prime lens for portraits, action, even nighttime photography. Its bright maximum aperture of f/1.8 helps it not only to excel in low light, but also to capture gorgeous, sharp images and movies with beautiful background blur thanks to its circular 7-blade design. An updated lens arrangement with new lens coatings helps render images with excellent color balance, plus minimized ghosting and flare. Performance is brilliant, with a stepping motor (gear-type STM) to deliver near silent, continuous Movie Servo AF for movies plus speedy, smooth AF for stills. A redesigned exterior with improved focus ring placement makes manual focus adjustments a breeze. Canon's most compact 50mm lens, the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM has a rugged metal mount, plus an improved minimum focusing distance of 1.15 ft. (0.35m) and a maximum magnification of 0.21x. Offering sharp performance for the best in movies and stills, it's a fixed focal length gem\u2014the perfect lens for photographers and moviemakers to expand the creative possibilities with their EOS cameras.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n * Focal Length & Maximum Aperture: 50mm f/1.8\n * Lens Construction: 6 elements in 5 groups\n * Diagonal Angle of View: 46\u00b0\n * Focus Adjustment: AF with full-time manual\n * Closest Focusing Distance: 1.15 ft. / 0.35m\n * Filter Size: 49mm \n * Max.
