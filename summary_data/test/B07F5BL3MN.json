      "text": "You\u2019re most likely asking yourself why this vs the Haakaa. They are actually pretty different. The bumble bee is significantly smaller than the Haakaa. So it\u2019s easier to wear when nursing on the other side. Doesn\u2019t drag your boob down more than it needs to. Perfect if your let down is <2oz. But if your letdown is like 4oz or something, Haakaa is probably better. The only reason for the 4 star is I have knocked this over a few times. I wish it had the bottom suction thing like the way the Haakaa has.",

Even though it doesnt have a suction bottom like the haaka, this comes with a lid and stopper, which most haakas dont i believe. My second one hasn't been as great though, it's like the silicone is stiffer than the first one, even after multiple uses and washes, and it often won't stay folded over while trying to put it on, which has been frustrating, have almost spilled milk many times. Would have given 5 stars if my second one was as great as my first one.",
