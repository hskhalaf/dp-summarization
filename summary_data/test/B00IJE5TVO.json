They are so light and comfortable you barely feel them on your face. They are fairly dark as well which is nice in sand and snow. I have also tried the electric technician glasses which are also very comfortable but much heavier. Sunglasses are so variable based on preferences/styles and the shape of one's face, but for me these are great. Highly recommended.",
