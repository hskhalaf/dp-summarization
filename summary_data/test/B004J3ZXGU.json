      "text": "I originally received this as a Birthday present in 2013. I am writing a product review now after having time to use it on trips. The camera functioned well up until 1.5 years when the lens started malfunctioning and I couldn't zoom without the lens getting jammed and shutting the camera off. There was no fix for this so I had to toss the camera. I did research on this camera and found that a lot of people had this issue and they couldn't fix their cameras as well. The camera is cute and very convenient to carry around but not very hardy. Dust that gets trapped in the lens over time will end up ruining the camera.",

For the price you really can't beat it. The little mic in the camera picks up great too for video on u-tube. Glad I found it and would highly recommend to another.

Unlike my camera phone, the Elph is not too simple as it gives me plenty of easy to use options to experiment with and produces a great photo. And unlike my SX60, my Elph isn't so sophisticated that I spend ton of time and energy dealing with focus, aperture, exposure and all those other things \"professional\" photographers love. When people gasp \"what camera did you use to take THAT photo\"? My answer is always my Canon Elph.",

Great in low light conditions, which I love, because picture quality is usually so much better without the flash needing to go off! Easy to carry around, so small and light. Just a tip about taking video - if you zoom in during filming, and sound quality is very important to you (like my sister's violin recital!) when you playback the video you will hear little clicking sounds given off by the little zoom motor. Most of the time I have no need to zoom during filming, however. So I'm keeping it at 5 stars!",

The performance in low light is very good and by far the best improvement I had over my last camera.

The screen is easy to see in sunlight, and indoors, I can take many pictures without a flash, which gives them a more natural look. I also love the small size.

The black buttons are OK on the Canon, and everything functions just fine, the Nikon just looks sleeker. So far the picture quality is just as good, if not better than the Nikon.

      "text": "Got this for the wife, we've had 2 previous Canon PowerShots SD300 and SD450, and they still work great! But we wanted to upgrade to this for the wide angle view, and this camera does it! Super wide angle to catch everything. At its widest, I see a slight fisheye effect that can be a bit annoying when taking photos of people, but landscape shooting, its awesome! We really wanted to get the S100, but it was too pricey so this one fits the build just fine.",

I love the gritty texture of the body of the camera and the marco setting. The screen is a decent size, could be a bit bigger but it lets you zoom in on the photos so that is nice. It does not come with a memory card or adapter so make sure to purchase one otherwise you cannot save your photos.",

You should go check out SnapSort (.com) and do a side-by-side comparison of this camera and the newer version, the 310HS. You should stick with this camera for the price, considering the newer model is actually lacking features. Go check out what the experts have to say. You won't be disappointed!",

A bonus for me is that I am able to continue using my old camera's battery charger as Canon has thankfully not changed its specs.

I only use the top high end professional digital SLRs with professional lenses but I have to admit that this little camera does a great job and was sturdy... I have a tendency to consider that some items are better when refurbished because manufacturers must go through must stricter quality controls before they re-sell their items.

      "text": "I don't expect spectacular performance from a point-and-shoot. Image quality seems as expected. Depth of field on any point-and-shoot digital tends to be too big, partly because the sensor is relatively small. The size of this camera makes it easy to carry around, leading you to take more pictures. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much longer point and shoots are going to be able to compete with smartphone cameras -- their areas of ideal photographic use overlap a lot, and obviously smartphones do many other things.",

    "description": "Color:Red| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Canon 5097B001 PowerShot ELPH 300 HS Red 12MP Digital Camera with 5x Zoom and 2.7 In. LCD Display has a slim profile that will not only make you stand out from the crowd, but it will also deliver incredibly brilliant still images and amazing 1080p HD videos. Once you turn on the camera, be prepared to be amazed at how much is packed into one of the slimmest point-and-shoot digital cameras on the market. So let your imagination run free and let the HS SYSTEM, 24mm 5x Optical Zoom and 12.1 Megapixels help you achieve great images everywhere.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nDon't let the PowerShot ELPH 300 HS digital camera's slim profile and good looks fool you. This slick little device may stand out from the crowd, but it'll also deliver brilliant still images, ultra-detailed 1080p Full HD video, serious functionality, and a wealth of effects and automatic settings. You'll be surprised how much is packed into such a slim point-and-shoot. Let your imagination run wild, and let Canon's HS SYSTEM, a 24mm lens, 5x Optical Zoom, and 12.1 Megapixels help you snap great photos everywhere.\n\nThe ELPH 300 HS is less than an inch deep and weighs less than 5 ounces. Ultra wide-angle 24mm lens and 5x optical zoom on board. Canon's HS SYSTEM improves shooting in low-light situations without the need for a flash, and lowers noise levels at higher ISO settings. INCREDIBLY THIN. INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.\nTHIN IS IN\nAt less than an inch deep and weighing just under five ounces, the PowerShot 300 HS will fit right in your pocket, but it packs plenty of power into its sleek point-and-shoot body. A 24mm ultra wide-angle lens with a powerful 5x optical zoom gives you the versatility to shoot in any number of situations, and the optical image stabilizer keeps things from getting too shaky when you're zoomed in tight. Whether you're out partying or just walking around town, you don't need to sacrifice style for power--the PowerShot ELPH 300 HS has got you covered for capturing great photos effortlessly.\n\nNO MORE DARK PHOTOS\nCanon's HS SYSTEM improves shooting in low-light situations without the need for a flash, and lowers noise levels at higher ISO settings.\n\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, and freeing you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low-light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds, and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.\n\nThe system is the result of two technologies brought together in this compact PowerShot. The first is the 12.1 Megapixel CMOS Sensor, which positions the light-receiving surface for optimal light reception. More light means clearer, blur-free images with plenty of detail and nuance, even in dark areas. Working together with the CMOS sensor to deliver the HS SYSTEM is Canon's advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise and delivers high speed image processing.\n\nCanon\u2019s HS System provides dramatically greater sensitivity than your average camera with identical or greater megapixel counts. \nClick here for a larger image THE HS MEGAPIXEL ADVANTAGE\nThere's more to megapixels. Canon's HS System provides dramatically greater sensitivity than your average camera with identical or greater megapixel counts. That means you don't need excessive megapixels to achieve spectacular images with minimal noise, and you get equally impressive results out of the 12.1 megapixel ELPH 300 HS.\n\nMEMORABLE MOMENTS IN FULL HD\nExperiencing the brilliance of HD video in a Canon PowerShot ELPH digital camera has never been easier. With the convenient dedicated movie button, you'll be able to instantly record everyday moments in high-definition detail at the push of a button. Record in Full 1080p HD with stereo sound, and pick up the optional HTC-100 HDMI cable for viewing your footage directly on your HDTV. \n\nYou can also use the optical zoom while shooting video, so you can get in nice and close--plus, no need to worry about shaky footage thanks to dynamic image stabilization to keep your videos steady!\n\nCapture video in Full 1080p HD resolution, and add an optional HDMI cable for enjoying directly on your HDTV. A POWERSHOT THAT KEEPS UP WITH THE ACTION\nSometimes, the action just won't stop for you. The PowerShot ELPH 300 HS comes equipped with a High-Speed Burst Mode that can capture eight frames per second. Just hold down the shutter button and catch rapid-fire action sequences--perfect for sporting events! \n\nYou can also add a fun slow motion effect to your videos, using Super Slow Motion Movie. Super Slow Motion Movie will record your clips at a high speed, so that when you watch your videos, they'll play back in slow motion--a great feature for analyzing sports play-by-play, or just for creating fun visual effects.\n\nADVANCED SMART AUTO FOR STILLS AND VIDEOS THAT SHINE\nThe PowerShot ELPH 300 HS digital camera takes the quality of your still images and videos to a whole new level--automatically.
