The only kind of bad thing I have to say would be is that there is about a quarter inch too much space in the toe box. If you're new to these types of dress shoes, you should usually have some play towards the toe because they narrow and no play means uncomfortable toes. So with these shoes there is the normal toe box space but with a little extra. Enough to notice the space but not enough to make the shoe feel loose. Hope this helps.",

You might not notice it if you are walking, but if you are standing still for a couple minutes, or if you use a standing desk, your heels will start to hurt. The insoles are glued down, so I had to rip them out to replace them with some Sof Sole brand insoles, effectively adding $20 to the price of these shoes to make them comfortable.",

After visiting all of my local stores searching for a pair of shoes to wear to my wedding and being disappointed by over priced uncomfortable shoes I blindly bought these based on reviews.

The comfort and support exceeded my expectations and was a pleasant suprise.",
