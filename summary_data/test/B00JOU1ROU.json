I got three pairs, one of each color and they fit my kids (ages 5, 7, and 9) perfectly. UPDATE: We have a pool and my kids have been usually these daily and for the past 2 months straight and they are still in perfect condition. They've even left them outside in the sun for a day or two and in the chlorine water overnight(s). My 9 year-old daughter used these exclusively for her competitive swim team (practice 5 days a week plus weekly meets) and they never failed her.",

If you're looking for durable kids' goggles that will last a while, I'd recommend you reconsider these.
