      "verdict": "Although it's a disappointment Sony hasn't increased the screen resolution along with its size, and the camera's quirks are rather odd, the Xperia Z3 Compact's improved design, vast amounts of power, decent battery life and waterproof body help it maintain its position as one of the best mini flagships around.",
      "pros": [
        "The Sony Xperia Z3 Compact packs a larger screen than its predecessor in the same size body, it has tonnes of power, it's completely waterproof allowing for underwater photography and it has a good camera"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The screen size has increased, but not the resolution, resulting in a less sharp image overall than its predecessor and many of its rivals",
        "Although the camera takes good shots, its resolution is throttled in automatic mode and the white balance isn't perfect"

I had a case on mine and dropped it and the back still shattered. My husband slightly dropped it and the screen shattered. We bought the glass and my husband fixed it, but now it is no longer water proof/resistant. It has good processing power. It's very fast and beautiful to look at. It's just too damn easy to break it. That is why I went with 3 instead of 4 stars. If it had better casing I would give it 4.5/5.",

The OS have some added Sony fluff that can be disabled right away but it doesn't take away from the android experience. Although I wished that it had a bigger internal memory, it's not a big issue since it does support microSD. Played with the camera a bit impressed with the image quality but weak at low light settings. Flash is not as powerful as other phones I had.",

The dedicated camera button. Bad: The camera app has an error that pops up when you start the app. Slight lag when starting the camera app. The volume button being right next to the power button. Phone vibrates when playing audio loudly. Recommended? If you are fighting the trend of bigger phones then this is the phone for you! I highly recommend it.",
