And you don\u2019t have to be a veteran roofer to go fast. It\u2019s so easy to just go fast every person on the job can go fast. Makes felting a dream easier. I don\u2019t really see it being good for handbanging roofing nails though. The magnet is smooth (no waffle) so its likely to slip off nail. Also I can see having a nail on the end of the hatchet without knowing and you go to set another nail! OUCH! Good for felting, nothing else really.",

Anything made by AJC Tools is made good and durable i have their jacks (best on market) two different size magnetic sweepers. A former roofer has to be designing their tools.",
