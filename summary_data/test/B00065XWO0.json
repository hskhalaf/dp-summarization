This thing just slides right through it. In full disclosure, I got the idea from youtube. Thank you youtube.",

It was awkward to hold and use, as my thumb wanted to go to the top of the unit while holding, which is exactly where the blade eject button is! I had been using a Black & Decker electric knife that my husband purchased for me, fifteen years ago, cutting through squash and other items without a problem. It finally gave out, and I should've stuck with that brand. I am returning this item and reordering the Black & Decker model.",

The handle is very smooth and slick and my hand tends to travel forward making pressing the \"ON\" button difficult. I have to occasionally move my hand back on the handle. If they had made it a little less smooth and given it some texture, it would be easier to hang onto.",

Another dubious feature is that the blades are very thin & flexible, which makes it hard to cut a consistent slice. I would not recommend this knife.",

The tip cutting is not good when I compare it to electric knives I owned in the past, so positioning for the cut takes a little pre-thought that I was not expecting. The part that was really disappointing was the safety switch/trigger configuration. Between the shape of the actual button, and the direction you need to press to operate the knife, you find you hand position to be awkward, and counter intuitive which makes it an odd feel in the hand as you use it. Also, the button became uncomfortable to hold down when doing longer cutting sessions.",

Also used it on a Bobby Flay prime rib recipe I cooked for the first time and it came out so beautifully. Totally worth it even if you use it a few times a year. Other nearby family will definitely want to borrow. I just store it with the roaster and thermometer I use for cooking big meat dishes.",

The blades deflect upward at the handle when the downward pressure to achieve cutting is applied. On a positive note, the fork seems exceptionally well-made.

However, I was disappointed with it on the very first cut I made. I could not believe my eyes because it shredded my turkey roast as it made the cut and left large striations on both sides of the meat. Furthermore, it was impossible to make slices with any precision. It's going back in the box for a return immediately. I would not give it even one Star.",
