Then my husband showed me to unscrew the head of the flashlight and remove the protective plastic that keeps the battery from running down in shipment. It is similar to removing the strip from the ink from a computer printer. The only improvement I would make is to write instructions for this in the directions. There is o case, but I have the old one from the hurry cane I never used anyway. Excellent-",

The flashlight device broke the first time the cane was accidentally knocked over. The parts all flew in many directions, and after searching down on hands and knees (my hubby) all parts were found except for the light lens. Sadly, its the lens that keep the batteries and light intact inside the flashlight section, so now that part of the cane is useless and complicates using the cane as it now is. I ended up buying another cane. Lesson learned.",

      "text": "Cane was very easy to assemble. Problem - the light did not work. Upon advice from manufacture, I unscrewed the cap to remove a plastic there. I did not see any plastic cap. I finally went to a neighbor, and he knew - it was a piece of plastic film. Once he peeled it off, the light came on. I use the cane to help stabilize me when I walk around. The base works very well in giving me extra firm hold on the ground. I feel more confident going out now. I gave 4 stars because of the frustration in getting the light to work",

Surprisingly enough, he especially likes the built in flashlight because it helps him find his way to the restroom safely in the middle of the night. It does not stand on its own very well on carpet but does great on hard floors.",
