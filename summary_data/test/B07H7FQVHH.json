The Dpad and joysticks felt a little loose for my taste. The abyx buttons have a good feel to them. The triggers are decent. The Gyro work's ok but I did not use it much. Overall it's a good controller for the price.",

I play 1-2hrs every two days so moderate use. The longest play time was 14 hrs over two days before having to recharge (breath of the wild). DO NOT lose the instructios on how to pair. Once paired you only need to hold the button down for 2 seconds and it will load up. Now if you use the joy cons in between uses then you need to re pair it. You go into controllers then the grip order.",

So I wouldn't say I'm hard on the controller. I opened it up to make sure it was just dirty, and I found that the rubber pad has worn out. I'm really disappointed that this controller couldn't even last year with light to moderate use.",

Its battery life lasts all day (even up for weeks) depending on the usage but never you would be let down by it: you can forget about battery life as it never seems to end. The only downside is that it can feel cheap and doesn't have Ammiibo support. If you press the back triggers hard and fast enough they will squeak (as I noticed on many cheap controllers). But all-in-all, you can use this to add more players cheaply, play with non-time-based games or just have something enjoyable for an affordable price.",

Sturdy and well-made, it has heft but not enough to tire your hand. The buttons take some getting used to, but they're far more responsive than an analog controller. Set your Deadzone to 0 on FPS games because the sticks go right back to center, no drift (so far). I use this wired so I have not tried the Bluetooth connection yet. My only gripe is the X/Y and A/B buttons are backwards. It looks almost identical to an Xbox controller so that takes some getting used to.",
