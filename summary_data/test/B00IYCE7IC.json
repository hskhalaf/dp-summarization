Yesterday one of my kids forgot about something he put in the toaster oven and luckily I happened to walk in the room as it burst into flames. Our fire extinguisher didn\u2019t work, I remembered the fire blanket and grabbed that. It was easy to open and use. I threw it on the flames, unplugged the toaster oven, and readjusted the blanket to cover the fire more fully. It put the fire out before it spread fairly quickly. I only wish that the blanket was a little bigger and that it wasn\u2019t one time use. I ordered another one.",
