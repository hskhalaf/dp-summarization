Plus, it doesn't cook the hot dogs properly. Most of the time, it overcooks the outside while the inside remains cold. The only way we've gotten around this is to cook the hot dogs twice on the lowest setting. Not great. I got this for my dad in December, and since then, he's only used it a handful of times.",

I might just pick this instead of grill way more often from now on. It doesn't require set up and I get to have a nice toasted bun with it. Mmmm weenies.",

      "text": "Got this for my 7 yr old son for his birthday since he loves hot dogs. It's a great idea for cooking hot dogs. I just wish the quality was a little better. The lever you push down to toast the hotdogs is very flimsy and you have to push it right in the middle or it feels like it's going to break. The hot dog holder insert also gets caught when it pops up. I toast the hot dogs 2-3 times and flip it each time. If the quality were better I would have given 5 stars.",

The taste of the hot dog is so much better than cooking it in the microwave (which in my opinion is disgusting!) It's light weight and can easily be stored in a cupboard when not in use. You can't beat the price on Amazon either! Definitely worth it for kids that love hot dogs (or adults!)",
