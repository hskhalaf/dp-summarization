I was shocked as I thought they were solid and not merely cast. I did not expect them to bust in half. Of course I missed the return window so that is just hard earned money down the drain and I still have no horse shoes for my athletes to practice with.",

The only two shortcomings for this are the stakes could be a little longer to anchor them in the ground better and after the shoes start hitting the sand, the colors will eventually look the same so you have to refer to the A and B label. Or you could paint them if you like. The travel case is nice though if you want to put it in a camper for mobility. I installed mine more permanently in the backyard. I may end up getting some longer pieces of rebar from the hardware store for the stakes but otherwise, it works well.",
