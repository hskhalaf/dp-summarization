Product made of nice smelling, bug resistant, lightweight cedar. We also bought the insulation kit which popped in and installed in 3 minutes. The cabin took 15 minutes to piece together!",

Finally, the dark trim pieces provide some protection to those pieces of wood, but the rest of the wood in the walls and floor are bare wood. The marketing materials state they're sealed with a weather resistant coating, but I was skeptical of this claim. Fortunately, I had some leftover stain & sealer from a recent fence gate project, so I applied this extra layer of protection.",

Over all I\u2019m satisfied with it but the quality of the bottom where your pet will lay could be better. Will be doing some mods to reinforce it tho.

The only thing i thought that would of made this dog house perfect was if it was sturdier on the bottom, the wood seem to bend when any weight was on it. Finger crossed that it last a while..",

It arrived with several pieces already broken, and once we put it together, my 75 pound dog caused the bottoms to collapse the second he stepped inside. But the worst part is the instructions. This thing came with TWO sets of instructions, and each one is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. Is this a joke? Each set of instructions has a maximum of 5 steps. FIVE STEPS and this is the best you can do??? Two different instruction packets that are each blatantly, entirely different and completely contradictory? Luckily the setup is pretty self-explanatory, but the stupidity behind the whole thing was enough to make me think the company is a joke.",
