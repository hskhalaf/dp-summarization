With normal usage of 3-4 hours the battery icon starts blinking red and makes me nervously look for a charger . Other than that the unit is a great smartphone . 4 stars for weak battery",

The battery life isnt the best but with a few tinkering it can be easily boosted. Root wasnt hard at all either, and simce this is a fairly popular phone there are several custom roms put there. Even a cyanogenmod10 port, which runs great.",
