I could wax poetic about how much better my hair looks after using this, or rave about how it leaves my hair tangle free... But I won't. I purchased this to keep in my purse & my only requirements for this purchase was that it 1) be a hair brush 2) be bright in color so I could find it easily in my hand bag and 3) be small enough to fit in my purse. This fit all three requirements. :)",
