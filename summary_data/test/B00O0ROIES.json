      "text": "A good right angle drill at a great price. No one buys into a cordless system based on the right angle drill but if your into the Hitachi cordless system (which is getting to be on the extreme side of awesome lately) then this is a nice tool to have in your arsenal. It has a led light, it has a battery indicator, it comes with a handle and it drills at a right angle. Mine works as advertised. It's not a hole-hog for drilling 2\" holes through 2x4's. Nor should it be used for mixing up batches of tile grout. But it's great for working in cabinets. NOTE: the new 3 and 6 Ah compact batteries are great!",
