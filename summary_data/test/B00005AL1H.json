It was absolutely too heavy for me to lift when it was empty so I knew if I tried to use it, I would be unable to handle it when it had contents. Other reviewers said it was heavy but I had no idea just how heavy. I think most women would be unable to use these pans, but for a male chef they would be wonderful. I also loved that it was made in the USA. I am so tired of everything made in China. I also resent many manufacturers saying USA when something was made in another country but assembled or packaged here.",

Very expensive cookware, but if you do a lot of cooking, it's worth the price. Cooks evenly and cleans up easily. We had Calphalon previously, which we were happy with, but we're amazed at how much better this cookware is. Regarding this pan specifically, it's a good intermediate size. Our set came with 1.5 qt and 4 qt pans, which are often a little small and a little large for cooking for two people.",

It is a little heavier, but cooks so well! The lid DOES get hot when cooking so you will need to use a pot holder to take off as it is metal. The handle however does not from my experience so far.

    "title": "All-Clad 6203 SS Copper Core 5-Ply Bonded Dishwasher Safe Saucepan with Lid / Cookware, 3-Quart, Silver",
    "description": "Size:3-QuartBecause of its shape, this All-Clad COPPER CORE 6203 SS 3-Quart sauce pan pan is ideal for making sauces, heating liquids, cooking food in liquids and reheating. With high, straight sides and a smaller surface area, the sauce pan holds heat well and limits evaporation. The classic sauce pan is a versatile essential found in a variety of sizes in every well- equipped kitchen, and it can be used with or without its lid to control evaporation. Designed for professional use, COPPER CORE features 5-ply construction with a copper center, which transfers heat and spreads it quickly, evenly, and precisely throughout the cookware, all the way to the rim. The super-responsive cookware works well for recipes that require precise temperature control, such as delicate sauces. COPPER CORE's 18/10 stainless-steel interior offers a highly polished cooking surface with a starburst finish for superior stick resistance, easy maintenance, and non-reactivity with food to preserve true flavor. Permanently attached with stainless-steel rivets, the cookware\u2019s stainless-steel handles offer a heat choke to reduce heat transfer, a bolster for added control, and a comfortable contour that caters to a chef\u2019s underhand grip. Made in the USA, All-Clad COPPER CORE cookware offers induction compatibility, flared edges for drip-free pouring, engraved capacity markings, and upscale aesthetics with a copper skive cut away for long-lasting beauty in any kitchen.",
