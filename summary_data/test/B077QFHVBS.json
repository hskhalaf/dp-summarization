She says that it helps but I was amazed that after I used it, I slept for ten hours straight. This is straightforward to use, and easy to assemble. It gets nice and hot. The experience of using the sauna is very close to the experience of going to the spa, but it is more convenient to use.",

      "text": "Just received the portable sauna. It's too soon to give a detailed review since I have only used it twice but my initial feeling is that I really like it. It is light weight but seems to be well made (I will see how it holds up to regular use). It is simple to setup. I couldn't find the instructions when I took it out of the box but was able to assemble without them. I later found the instructions within the plastic wrapping. I will update my review after I have had a chance to use it for a month or two. For now, I am very pleased with this purchase.",

It\u2019s not the most comfortable chair to sit on especially if you plan on doing longer sessions in this sauna but for the price it gets the job done and you can be creative on how to deal with the uncomfortable seating. Definitely heats up and seems to stay heated at the temperature you select. I\u2019m happy with the purchase, so far so good!",

      "text": "This sauna works very well. Heat levels is easily adjusted and the foot pad can be turned on or off while still using the sauna. It's important to not sauna for too long as you can overly deplete your minerals. It's also super important to stay hydrated during and after, while also taking in electrolytes. I do have concerns that regular use of infrared saunas may be too depleting while also activating pathogens in our systems and possibly negatively affect bone density (just a theory). Still a very cost effective way to sweat.",

Yes, this sauna reached a heat level suitable for a proper all-over sweat. It was relaxing, sweaty, and effective. After a cold shower I felt clean and detoxed as only a sauna can provide.
