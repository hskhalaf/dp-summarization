I can scan documents, business cards, receipts, and much more. The software is easy to use, save various configurations to quickly select BW Single Sided, Color Single Sided, Color Double Sided, receipts, business cards, etc. If you have a small business or just want to get rid of the mountain of paper that comes with personal or business records management then get the Epson ES-500W and you will see how it performs as I did.",

It also saves the documents in random places - I am specifying where to save it in the preferences and I search and find the scanned documents elsewhere. I am not an IT tech but I am computer savvy enough to know that this is junk and not user error! I am going to contact Epson support and update my review.

Its speed and auto-duplexing surpass the professional Fujitsu SCSI scanner it replaced, at 1/8 of what the Fujitsu scanner cost.This scanner continues to impress me.",

What we found is that everyone in the office is begging to have their scanners replaced with this one. It's fast and gets the job done.

Everyday I have to mess with it by either unplugging, restarting it or opening it up to make it work. I\u2019ve had it for about 6 months and it still is a headache to deal with sometimes. Unfortunately I missed the return policy when I first bought it (14 days) the main problem with this scanner is when I try to scan multiple pages at once it gives an error message and I either have to restart or scan about 3-5 times until it takes it. Other than that this scanner is amazing in clarity and speed! Too bad I can\u2019t exchange it.",

Going through the documents is a little time consuming; but, good to have the information as a reference for my small business. Importing receipts into QuickBooks and coding to the proper accounts takes more time than entering them directly.",

If you are a document scanning dude who wants to convert your filing cabinet into a digital one- THIS IS IT! Not recommended for photos (it\u2019s too fast to be that accurate- get a flatbed scanner for that). If you want to scan multiple pages at a time (I\u2019ve scanned a 100 page document flawlessly). This is a workhorse! Love it!",
