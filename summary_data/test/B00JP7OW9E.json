      "text": "After much research, I ordered the Vizio M552i-B2, and it has exceeded my extreme expectations. This set has ramped up my addiction to Blu-rays with its phenomenal display. I stressed it out with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and the set perfectly handled the deep black space, tiny pinpoints of stars and the floating small figure of an astronaut. I am disappointed with the remote, which is not ergonomically-designed or illuminated, forcing me to put colored dots of paint on it to help me navigate in a dark room. Because all the reviews said the Smart-TV functions are not-quite-ready-for-primtetime, I have not tried them out - yet. Speakers are only adequate; I recommend the sound stage as well-worth the supplemental expense.",

Highly adjustable for various accessories. Nice small sturdy stand. I use this with Chromecast and a Sony sound bar with HDMI ARC; turning on the Chromecast or the Blu ray player also turns on the sound bar, and the Blu ray remote (Sony) is easily programmed to turn off (or on) the tv and adjust sound volume (code 04). I use the Vizio remote only to control direct streaming of Amazon movies.",

Many controls for the picture...some are worthwhile, some not. The smart TV feature is OK, but I've had some issues here and there with lock-ups on updating, and the like. The Rhapsody app stopped working, and then disappeared from the smart TV. It's way cheaper than say a Samsung, but not as elegant, and lacks a lot of the whistles and bells. Overall, though, a decent TV.",

I used some of the settings I found referenced in other reviews and tweaked them to my liking. I was able to set it up by myself in about 15 minutes from unpacking to watching TV. Of course that was using the stand and not mounting it to the wall. My previous TV was also a Vizio - a 37\" Razor E series that I've had for a number of years. It never gave me a problem and will continue to be used in another room. Great quality and great value.",

      "text": "great picture for shows and movies. equal to the samsung 55\" that my parents have. but for football games my 7 yr old sharp aquos looked better. i messed with the settings for a while on the vizio, with out much success. the negative was the the tv did not turn on the first time. i had to unplug the hdmi cord and then put it back in.then it turned on. it happened again 4 days later. unfortunately i am sending it back to amazon. getting i am replacing it with a new sharp aquos that is almost $150 cheaper on amazon (sharp lc-le643u).in my opinion sharp makes the best led tv's.",

My 4 year old LG LED that this Vizio was going to replace had a better quality picture. Black levels were horrible. I guess you get what you pay for. I will never buy another Vizio product again. Also, calling this a Smart TV is far from the truth. The Vizio App Store lacks options. Going with Samsung.",
