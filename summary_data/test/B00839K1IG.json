It is easy to get out and set up, but be aware that it is large and needs a closet or someplace large to store it when it is folded up and not in use. Once the mattress pad relaxes and is fluffier it is very hard to get the bed to fold back up and get the hook to keep it in place. I anticipate the hook breaking and needing to use a bungee cord to keep it together.",

I started to use it out in my 3 season room when the nights are cool ( I use to camp a lot in my younger days). Waking up to mother nature is better then an alarm clock. That is how comfortable it is and I am 61 years of age.",

It was because of other people's ratings that I even chose this bed! VERY GOOD DEAL and shipped FAST!!!! Perfect for what i needed. Also it's not huge so it can fold up and slide under a bed if necessary for storage ! Great for guests or travel. Over Christmas I just brought the pad with us. Worked great!",

I laid on it and it feels quite comfortable...much better than a sofa bed or an air mattress. The best thing is that it is so compact to store. I have a sleigh bed, very low, but this extra bed easily slides under it and out of the way. I liked it so much, I ordered a second one.",

I would like to see a locking mechanism that keeps the mid section from folding up so easily. This also happens when trying to put the Mattress back on the underside to fold away. Otherwise it is nice and sturdy and a great idea.",

For heavier weights, I would add some additional cushion (i.e. egg crate foam pad or something similar). For kids its perfect; the mattress pad reminds me of the pads used in play pens.",
