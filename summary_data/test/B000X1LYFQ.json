We use it to cook our quince for making quince spread and have found the thick heavy bottom to ensure even heat that prevents burning when the temperature is carefully controlled on our induction cooktop burner, even over extended cooking times. As our production goes up, we will definitely consider purchasing a second pot. Oh, by the way, it also made a fabulous turkey soup, easily holding the bones from a 28 pound turkey!",

Its clad base really adds weight to it, and the pot is not some thin piece of junk!!

The directions said not to use salt as it stains the interior but if you boil the water first and then add the salt there is no problem. I am crazy about this beautiful pot, so happy I bought it!",

The pot is heavy, so while it takes a bit to get the heat started, it heats evenly and stays warm (which is perfect for my needs). Some cheese require the temp to maintain 100 degrees for an extended period of time (90 minutes). One down side, which does not at all detract from the 5 star rating, is that this pot is heavy. So be careful when moving it when it is full.",

They look great and are wonderful to cook in! I ordered the 12-quart pan first but it was WAY too big for what I needed so I returned it and got the 8-quart. Wonderful and durable pan but never use chlorine bleach on stainless steel.",
