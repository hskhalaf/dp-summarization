      "text": "This rack was easy to install, but the hook is so hooked, it's really tough to slide your bike onto it. It requires a lot of spinning to properly orient the bicycle, probably because the red padding slides down passed the tip of the hook. After using it a few months, the red padding is becoming shredded and it's increasingly difficult to use. All this maneuvering around the hook has also resulted in lots of scuffing on my wall. I purchased another model last month for a second bike with a straighter hook and it's way easier and more efficient- plus no wall scuffing. Now we fight over the new hook because this one is so annoying to use.",

Also, self-adhesive will likely to more damage to wall finish on removal; suggest using short screws -- there's not a lot of stress on the part.",

      "text": "I use these for a track bike with a fixed gear. This is a very lightweight bike, and so there's not a lot involved with getting it into and out of the front wheel 'hook.' I can see if I had a heavier bike with a wider tire, this could be a problem... but in my case it isn't. Using a cordless drill for the hardware necessitates adjusting the clutch so you don't over tighten the screws... especially on the plastic lower wheel plate. Other than that and the wall placement, no issues.",

Saves spaces and keeps my (relatively) expensive road bike safe. Money well spent.",
