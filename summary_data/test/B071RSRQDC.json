It feels thicker than 1.8 mm, but that could just be me. I have the 2.5mm gloves and booties as well and it feels about that thick. The layering is kind of irritating. I used to wear wetsuits to surf and I like the one piece style a little more than the pants and top style this suit uses. The camo pattern is perfect though. It blends right in with the bottom in the Florida Keys.",
