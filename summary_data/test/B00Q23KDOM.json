The color is very natural and subtle but looks really good and lasts. I will put one layer on and wait about 5 minutes to do another layer. Be careful to not leave streaks though because they will last for at least a few days. The product is very easy to apply (I bought tanning gloves). This is a great product!!!!!",

I WOULD ONLY USE with a self tanning mitt to apply it. I purchased through Amazon the bronze velvet self tanning mitt for $6. The Mitt is the key to application! Worth every penny.

I can always count on my mom and sister\u2019s honest opinion and they were impressed with the color and coverage that I was able to achieve with only one application.

Color was perfect for me, not too dark (I was my usual pasty winter white before applying) but not too light. Went on evenly, but I was very careful about this. Overall very satisfied. Will definitely be purchasing more as I try to limit my exposure so direct sun (family history of skin cancer and I have melasma-dark spots caused by sun)",

      "text": "I do not like to sweat out in the sun so tanning is just a no for me. But I hate being pale, this product will now forever be in my cabinet! I loved the glow it gave me. I suggest definitely wear gloves I just use basic disposable ones. Also make sure you are hair free and exfoliated it helps with application. It does dry pretty fast so The first time using don\u2019t go overboard because with time it gets darker. The directions do say if you want a deeper tan to reapply the next day! FOLLOW THOSE INSTRUCTIONS so you don\u2019t over do it.",

I have 0 complaints. For the price of this you can't beat it. I have never wanted to spend over 20 and this is under 10! This will now be my go to tanner. Do not hesitate. It is so nice.",

It's not a bad scent, just the usual scent. I have found this product to take about an hour to really soak in and start giving a natural, tanned look. I highly recommend this product.",

But, it comes out with a simple wash. The scent is tropical, but it starts to smell in the morning - when I reach hour 8 or 9.
