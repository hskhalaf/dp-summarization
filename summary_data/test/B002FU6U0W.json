Ironically the patent number was a Maui Jim for Lenses. Also the Maui Jim on the lens was sprayed on and not etched. If you have a magnifying glass, it's easy to see. It's too bad. I would have bought 5-10 pair a year. Love Maui Jims. I give them as gifts to our Vacation Renters in Scottsdale.",

These frames are ideal for a person with a larger face..or wider face. They fit comfortably..and look as they should. Most people with larger heads try and wear smaller sunglasses and they just don't look right. These are super comfortable and not too heavy..so you can wear them for long periods of time without fatigue.",

The acid test will be out in the sun, while driving, or at the beach. Am very happy right now and I love the packaging.",
