With the mats, the poles are stable even when stretched out. We are lucky to have a nice large playroom to put these in...but this set up could work in a garage as well.",

I also ordered them before I went to my dog's National Specialty, so I didn't receive them until I returned October 7. So by the time I assessed them, it was too late to return them. Cool Runner also makes one with a steel frame, and I would like to try that one instead. Unfortunately they are not sold on Amazon...so I am stuck.",

I tried supergluing them back to the base/screw, and that didn't work. So if you buy these, be very careful when removing the poles from the base cups for storage. Hold the base cup to stabilize it before twisting the pole out. Better yet, buy a sturdier set to begin with.",

      "text": "I ordered these for Christmas because good friends who do agility both have them and I liked using theirs. My dog is up to 12 poles and not at an angle but I can see a new dog these would be great for teaching 2x2 method. They are light weight and I can set them up quickly in the back yard. Keep in mind that I have a golden retriever and she is not real fast in the weaves. Might not be as great for a really fast moving active boarder collie but for most dogs learning or just practicing they are great.",

One of the cups that the pole sits in detatched from the base and the screw won't stay tight, but a little superglue fixed it right up, so no complaints! I love that I can use it indoors or outdoors! Being able to channel them is great too for teaching the dogs how to reallllly bend and use their back legs correctly!!!",
