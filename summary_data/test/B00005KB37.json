The FrDaddy burned multiple batches of food due to FryDaddy factory heat setting being 50 degrees F, too high. Called Presto to see what factory oil temperature heat setting was supposed to be when shipped from the factory. Presto said that that all FryDaddy's (this model) oil warming sensor were supposed to be set to approximately 375 degrees F at factory. Returned FryDaddy to Amazon and requested replacement.",

I was careful to use less oil appx 3 cups for my first use. The handle is extremely sturdy take notice of the side bolts, which may lessen over time. This made transfer of the HOT Fry Daddy to a more secure place in the kitchen very safe! I actually covered the lid with aluminum foil to preserve and perfect it. Taking all things into account, I would recommend this item for purchase. If fact, I may purchase another as a gift!",

      "text": "I am very disappointed in the quality of the Fry Daddy! It survived only THREE USES before it would no longer heat up (regardless of where it was plugged in). I have owned it for less than a month. This is unacceptable! I chose this product because I had successfully used a borrowed one to make yeast doughnuts with my students (biology, fermentation lab) last year. Complete lesson FAIL! Nothing is more upsetting than seeing the disappointed faces of teenagers promised doughnuts, standing around a tub of cold oil. DO NOT BUY THIS FRYER!",

There is no thermostat, and while trying to fry at 300 degrees, it kept creeping up to 400 degrees, and burning the food. I have to use my laser thermometer and intermittently unplug it to keep it \"cool\" !",
