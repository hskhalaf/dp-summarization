This heater makes it comfortable to work without a jacket. I usually turn it on about 30 minutes before starting to work. The heater takes the temp. from the low 40's to about 70 degrees in about an hour and holds it there with the thermostat control knob set at 3, which is about half scale. I do live in a mild climate so others may have a different opinion. Bottom line \"it works for me\"",
