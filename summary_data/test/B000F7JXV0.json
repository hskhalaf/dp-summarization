      "text": "Slicer arrived with a broken wire, no return label, and no information about refunds or exchanges. It did have 2 spare wires taped to the bottom of the marble slab, however. (I didn't notice them at first.) Assembly is very simple, with loose tolerances. It was easy to figure out how to replace the broken wire. I've used the slicer several times a week for a few months now. It works well & there haven't been any more broken wires. All things considered, not bad for the price.",
