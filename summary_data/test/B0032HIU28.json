      "text": "The case is pretty nice, and exactly as advertised. I must say though, that I was a little disappointed with the choices available for Scope cases. someone moulded the inside of this case for a particular scope (not mine, that's for sure), but it's marketed as if it's universal. It is, if the only criteria for satisfaction are that the length and width are sufficient for closure. The padding works against this aim instead of for it. Something a little more customizable would have been much better. All in all though, I'm satisfied. I knew what I was was getting.",

At first I thought it was too large for this case but after overnight the foam has molded itself to the contours of the foam. The tripod straps are not real useful for carrying a tripod but they fit perfectly on the grab rails of my motorcycle. That might not help a lot of folks but it does make it easy to secure in a trunk or boat?? Great quality and strong zippers. This is a deal and a great safe way to store and transport your 80mm scope.",

It does not fit. :( You can cram the scope in this case but the eye piece will push (hard) against the zipper and be prone to banging against stuff. You would not want to carry your scope this way not to mention it is a pain to get it in there even that much. Looks like a decent product otherwise. Nothing to ooh and ahh about but if there were more competitors it could easily be considered over-priced",
