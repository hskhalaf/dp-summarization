      "text": "Bought these for a trip to Alaska in December. Consider them an extreme cold weather version of the combat GTX. They offer the same roller blade like support but combined with merino wool socks my feet never felt like they were outside, even down to -38C. Nor did my feet feel hot when inside. They are expensive, but are not designed for casual outdoorsy activities. If however you're planning on going somewhere where inferior gear may cost you your toes... Get these.",

They breath so fantasticly. I have two friends that have older models for about 5 years.... awesome boots no chance I'll risk buying any other brand... love the. Also note the height was off putting at first... but again very well designed to ensure you are save on uneven ground or rushing through a stream. Also cool as hell looking.",

      "text": "These boots I ordered in June were my 3rd pair of Lowa boots. I work outside a lot in all kinds of conditions. My first two pairs of Lowa boots held up very well and lasted about 2 years each. On this pair of boots I just got two months ago, the rubber rand has started to separate from the leather in two places and there are deep cracks in the leather. I contact Lowa for return information and I was told that the warranty is voided because I bought the boots from an \u201cunauthorized dealer\u201d. Buyer Beware! Quality is down and warranty is garbage!!! Never again!",

So excited to put them to the test. The only thing I can say is. If you have a wide foot. I would say to order a wide. My foot is regular. And they fit snug. I am a size 11, with a little room in the toe box area. These are true to size. Hopefully my comments help you with your purchase.",

Had them in Alaska on a couple of mountain goat hunts, a Dahl sheep hunt, a caribou hunt and some moose hunts. Then hunted with them for elk and mule deer in Wyoming. Sadly I was transferred to Oklahoma where a self respecting wildland hunter doesn\u2019t bother to sit in a stand over corn so they went ignored for a couple of years. Here I am back in Wyoming so I pulled them out, put new Obenaufs laces and wax on them and they feel great! When I wear these out I\u2019ll be buying more.",
