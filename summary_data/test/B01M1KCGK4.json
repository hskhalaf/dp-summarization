      "text": "Out of the box the drivetrain comes completely assembled and adjusted. You have to install the pedals, handlebar, and front wheel. Then adjust the brakes. I put a quarter-turn on two spokes to take a slight imperfection out of the front wheel. It certainly would have qualified as \"in-spec\"before, but I like perfect. Really nice bike for the money. The color is more of a cream/pastel orange like a creamsicle than the white/blaze orange in the pictures.",

The color of the frame is not snow-white but with a tint of beige. It looks nice to me. My 11-yr old 57\" tall loves it, but we had to adjust the seat to the maximum height, so there is no any margin for the future, just keep in in mind when you buy it. Both of the wheel rims are slightly bent. They move a bit from side to side as they spin. When riding, it doesn't seem to disturb.",

However, it arrived with no instructions on assembly, just some generic manual about Raleigh bicycles with safety instructions. The Raleigh website implies that there is a small tool set included (Allen wrench, etc) along with instructions to aid in assembly. Not in mine. The box was sealed and had no holes through which these could have fallen. It's irritating.",
