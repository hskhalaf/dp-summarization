However, if you're looking for a rugged ball that provide fun night-time play on a variety of surfaces (including asphalt and concrete), this is exactly what you want. The ball is sturdy and doesn't scuff or scratch easily. It lights up and provides enough illumination for kicking the ball around in the dark. It inflates round and retains it shape even after hard play. The lights have taken a beating and are still going strong. It adds a fun new option for soccer and it's a hit with kids that might be a little hard to entice to play.",

It is basically a fun toy and my kids enjoy playing with it in the dark; good indoors or outside. I question the why they didn't go with white/red to make it easier to see. Mine also arrived without the required key to replace batteries. Not sure what to do when then die. BTW a quick search for \"LED soccer ball\" will show you cheaper options available that appear to be the exact same ball under different branding.",

For backyard fun with a young aspiring soccer player it is great and the my granddaughter\u2019s laughter rings in my ears for days. For both my granddaughter and myself, chasing the blinking lights after dark is a lot of fun. I rate the Electro Soccer Ball high.",

My daughter, who plays team soccer, said she couldn't practice for real with it, but she does enjoy kicking it around the house and yard. She noticed it has a bit of a \"squeak\" when she kicks it, and this annoys her.",

The lights don't really show up that well during the day but at night the lights are very bright. It comes with a key to lock and unlock the ball. The ball is regulation size and you can tell when holding it that it's definitely not a cheap quality ball. Definitely recommend for soccer fans of any age.",

The electronics don't throw the ball out of balance---there's no noticeable wobble when it rolls. A tool is provided for popping up the rubber caps for battery replacement. Lots of fun and well made.",

The only problem is that if you kick it off somewhere, the ball will turn off after 30 seconds and you might not be able to see it. So you'll have to pull out the flashlight or wait til the next day to find it. Otherwise, AWESOME. I can't believe how well it lights up!",
