I had it up for less than a month. The first wind we had- gusts of up to 25mph- the velcro wrap-around pieces tore away from the sides. I duct taped those and fortified the structure with tie-downs and stakes. Then we got 5 inches of snow. When I walked outside in the morning, the structure was crumpled on top of my son's car. The metal beams crushed and bent like an aluminum can. This product is crap. I now have $250 worth of garbage.",
