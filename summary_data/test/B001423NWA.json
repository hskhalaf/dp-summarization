It took it like a champ. It got warm, but never super hot. The size is incredible, too. It's out in the garage, so I don't have a measurement, but it can't be more than 5\" long and 1.5\" wide. It's truly tiny. The exhaust comes out toward the tip, which does work to keep the area clean, as others have commented.",

If I get three or more years out of it I'll change the rating. Too bad there isn't some type of guard for protection.",

I don't like using it in a corner though because then the metal chips just blow back at me. Has enough power for its size. No trigger safety so it can take off if not careful.",
