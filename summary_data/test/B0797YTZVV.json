Used it in stores and on New England stoned lined streets, no problems. I put a blanket inside to make her feel more secure. The drink holder works well and the basket on the bottom is great for leashes and poop bags. Would recommend. Dog is 15 pound silky terrier. Great for the older dog who tires easily on trips with lots of walking. Got lots of looks and everyone asked where I purchased it, I told them Amazon!",

Perfect for pushing him, while my other dog walks. Able to maneuver pretty easily. He does tip it backward if I don't watch it and he rushes towards me while I am picking up my other dog's poop. Still great for the cost though. I got the pink so their light colored dog hair would not be so obvious. I would buy again.",

Cons: - Poor/cheap parts, like a kid\u2019s toy so this won\u2019t be around next year - A lot of jostling so if your dog needs stability (e.g., back injury), you\u2019ll need to add it. - Hard to maneuver in small spaces like elevators (for all of you who live in apartments/condos) - Hand bumper thing still smells after months so much so that you\u2019ll need to wash your hands after each use or people will smell it :/ TL;DR buy if you need a budget fix for a short period. Definitely not an investment piece. :)",

I used it a total of less than 10 times in less than two months (purchased on Sept 5) and the front wheel broke. The plastic piece that holds the wheel on broke. I contacted the seller for a replacement wheel who said I was past the warranty period. What kind of $50 product is warrantied for 30 days? Now I can't even use it because the wheel just rolls right off. REALLY DISAPPOINTED!! If you want to waste $50 for 10 walking trips with your dog then buy this product. Otherwise, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",

Thank goodness I didn't buy it and instead bought this one. PROS: The stroller is really easy to assemble. Light, durable, material does not appear cheap, and fashionable. CONS: Not really a con but more like a room to improve is that it should somehow be made to fold for easier managing in the car. Because of that one feat the stroller gets 3 out of 5 stars otherwise for the price it would easily be a 5-star winner.",

The wheels kind of wobble but it has a lock so they don't spin around which helped. I do recommend this stroller",
