They boast that it will work with any cabinet/drawer, but in reality, if there is any sort of overhang it is difficult to impossible to unlatch it.

I can just barely make it work if I use something long and thin to hit the latch, but who wants to do that every time?? Basically if your cabinet/drawer has no obstructions at all around the opening, this product will probably be OK. But for everything else, this is worthless",

Other than that I love them. It took two seconds to install them and customer service was great when i has a question.",

Therefore, there is not enough space for an adult to introduce the finger to open the door. That can be solved by doing a longer hook to allow the door to open a little more. I wasted my money since all the cabinet doors I wanted to protect are flush in my house",

If you have newer cabinets where the doors are a little bigger than the actual opening behind them like ours do, you don't even have to use the 2nd piece, the overhang on the opening is enough to catch the latch. They have held up great so far for the last few months to our son constantly trying to open the cupboards. I love that I didn't have to put any permanent markings on our cabinets and you can't tell that there's anything on them when there closed. The black latch blends nicely into our espresso cabinets so even when they're open you don't notice them.",

The lever arms are rather short, so be sure to gauge your cabinet box design. One or two areas in our home can't use these latches because the arm doesn't extrude far enough to depress it and release the catch.
