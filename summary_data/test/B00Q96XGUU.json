      "text": "This clay will make a great addiction to your skin care routine. What's extremely important to note is that this clay is very alkaline as it has a pH about 8. The skin on your face is very acidic (around 5) so you need to take care to avoid raising the pH of your skin as it will result in redness/irritation and possible breakouts. Therefore you MUST add an acid and the recommend acid is natural apple cider vinegar (I use Bragg's). Using water skin is NOT recommended. Mix the clay and ACV in a 1:1 ratio. If you have very sensitive skin then play around with the ratio by diluting your ACV with distilled water.",

The key is to not leave it on for longer than recommended coz it's no easy task to remove it then. Tip: Mix 1 tsp rose water and apple cider vinegar with it to mask it's smell. Use aloe vera gel as well, even better. Trust me it works! Try a clay bath too. It's super refreshing :)",

      "text": "I bought this product a little over a month ago. I tried it as a mask within the first week, but my water to product mix was way off. I did some web research about bentonite clay and found an alternate way to prepare the product effectively. Use a ratio of about 1 part product to 4/5 parts water and let it sit relatively untouched for about 24 hours. The product is essentially mud at that point and I'm not worried about it going bad. Then, I started using the mixture as a mask and as an overnight blemish reducer. After a week of this I can see that the clay is healing my skin.",
