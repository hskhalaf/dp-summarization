It adds some color, and it does help lips from drying out. I enjoy using it. *Interesting tip: If you usually suffer from chapped nose during severe colds, use the B.B. plain chapstick (no added color) around your nostrils after blowing your nose. It will keep them from cracking and blistering. This has been very helpful for me in the past.",

I found the cotton gloves most useful, to do like a mask overnight. The hand cream is more like a balm and it\u2019s not very convenient to get it out of the tub.

It seems to be very deeply moisturizing & feels luxurious when I put it on. The repair cream smells too strongly of rosemary\u2014 it\u2019s almost unbearable. The gloves run small. My hands are thin, but with long fingers ( I\u2019m 5\u20199) and I could barely get them on. They don\u2019t really stretch. I have not tried the cuticle cream yet.",
