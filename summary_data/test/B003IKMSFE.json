No warping at all, only minimal scratches on some pots, probably due to my own negligence. The sizes are great, I have used all of them multiple times. There are no duds in this set. The lids for the pots also fit the pans! Great design. I am very impressed with the quality of these, especially for the price. Highly recommend, I have had no issues with these. I would definitely buy them again.",

After going into SAMS club and seeing a 3 piece set for $125 I think I'm more than content with this. I see people writing reviews expecting this to be master chef quality but to me as a simple software engineer I'm sure it will do me well",

They'll eventually just snap. I promise you. It doesn't matter how well you take care of them. If you use them, they will snap eventually.

      "text": "I've never bought a proper set of cookery before. I always used hand me down stuff from the family. Now for the first time ever, I can fry an egg without breaking the yoke or burning it. I love these pots and pans! The price was about 1/2 of what they sell for in the local PX (and the PX has pretty good prices).",

So the lid doesn't sit properly on that pot at all. So if you need a starter set, try this one if you don't need lasting power in your cookware.",

Unfortunately the largest pot cover does not fit on the 10 inch frying pan correctly as the pan was slightly bent during shipping.

It works MUCH better than my more expensive previous set. I am going to retire that one and buy another one of these. Highly recommended. Will put in an update in a few months to let you guys know if it retains its qualities. Update 3/7/2013 - More than year and half later, this set is still going strong. There has been some expected wear and tear as I do still use them everyday, but the non-stick surface is still great. I would still highly recommend this product.",
