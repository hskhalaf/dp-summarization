That in and of itself makes it a winner. Plus I love that it dries clear, but starts out colored because I have others that are just clear and its hard to tell where I've put it on. I try to use it about three times a week and I definitely feel clean afterwards. So glad I found this. Great price too.",

It burns my face a little so i dont use it as often as i should, although the times i have used it i noticed a small difference in my face clearing up some pores. Like i said i dont use it very often so it may work better for someone who uses it by the recommended use. Easy to apply, its pretty thick and you can actually see it sink into your pores when you put it on. Rinsing it takes a minute though because its very clay like so maybe use a wash cloth instead of just your hands.",
