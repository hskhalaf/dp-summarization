After reading the reviews it seems you are rolling the dice on this if it works or not. Ours didnt. Once you got it to connect, which would take a while fidgeting it around it would show red for charging and then go straight to green on a dead controller. I ended up just charging them on my pc through an extra USB port. We recently got an Xbox One and I wont waste my hard earned money on these anymore. I hope this helps. Happy Shopping!",

Even better, I somehow thought this was going to take up more space than it does. This is actually a huge space saver. The controllers charge quickly, and it's overall worth the price so far.",

I don't find the lights too bright or distracting but mine is tucked away so I don't notice them. Great item and sure beats the heck out of charging my PS3 controllers with the USB cables.",

It's certainly easier than attaching the USB cables and leaving the PS3 to charge the controllers My only negatives are: The controllers don't always attach with ease (probably has more to do with the mini-usb connector that the charger) The $29.99 price tag is a tad steep for just a charger (I was fortunate to nab this on sale for $19)",
