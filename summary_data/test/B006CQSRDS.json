I purchased it to start bullet journaling, and so far it has fulfilled that purpose perfectly. The pages are great in that there is very minimal (if any) visibility of writing on front/back of pages. Pic: the back of the picture has writing all over it, though it hardly shows through the other side.",

There's little to no ghosting or bleedthrough with three of the inks I had in pens at the time (the attached pics are of my mini random testing for my own benefit.), with the exception of Apache Sunset in my flex nib. I wish the marker ribbon was a tad longer and the dots not quite as pronounced, but I have very few complaints about it! I'm looking forward to using it! No, it doesn't have some of the other things the Leuchterm1917 (which I also have and love) has, like a dedicated index or pre-numbered pages, but it's got LT1917 beat paper-wise, although not by much.",

Cons: - Front of the first lined page is impossible to write on comfortably. - The texture and feel of the cover though is off-putting (feels like a slab of thick cardboard, and is semi-slippery).

Cons: Not enough in the way of quality to justify this over a Leuchtturm 1917. It has about 100 less sheets of paper, the print of the dots are too dark for my taste (making it harder to distinguish from your pens ink), there\u2019s no given indexing or page numbers, and only one bookmark.

      "text": "The notebook is almost everything I was looking for. I say almost because there are a few caveats. First, I'm using this as a sketchbook for work doing UI design. I like to draw with a micron pen and the ink from that pen will bleed onto the next page, which is unfortunate. Using grayscale pens won't bleed too much but black micron will bleed. Second, I'd say starting about halfway through the book and alternating about every 10 pages, there are about 20-30 pages that do not have any dot grid on them and are completely blank. Which, isn't a huge deal but it's a lot more than I would have expected for such a highly rated product.",

I love watercoloring on the thin \"crispy\" paper for my everyday journaling. Like Tomoe River paper, this paper can take fountain pens, watercolor, acrylics, colored pencil and some markers. Alcohol markers do bleed through. Unlike the Tomoe River paper, this paper can handle my Winsor and Newton watercolor markers. But best of all, this is the only journal paper I've used that doesn't bleed through when I watercolor on top of ink. When I fill this journal, I will be purchasing another. I found my favorite!",

These have a ribbon marker and elastic band. They also have an expanding back pocket for small cards, notes, cash, and other objects. There is an extra black page at the front and back & the inside covers are black so you can write there with metallic gel pens or white. Pricy but the quality is well worth it.",

The paper is unparalleled in quality. At 90 GSM, it is heavy enough to prevent bleed, but this isn't the only (nor the most important) metric for paper quality. The paper is smooth, a quality which is hard to measure but unmistakable in the user's experience. I cannot recommend Rhodia notebooks enough!",
