They also sent pads and extra heel soles. I put the pads in the right one and it made the fit better. I also love how they have the expansive backing for a better fit. Can\u2019t wait to wear these at my wedding. The heel is also the perfect height and not tall so I feel I can keep them on a little longer than the ceremony.",

The rhinestones on the side or kind of stung together rather than individually sewn on, but you can't tell unless looking very closely. The heel was also the exact height I needed - not too tall to be uncomfortable or taller than my groom, but more sophisticated than a kitten heel.

They are comfortable (which is a lot coming from me because I rarely wear heels) and they come with pads and new pegs for the bottom of the heels if they get damaged. Highly recommend! They are a bit more pink than they are in the photo, but not overpowering.",
