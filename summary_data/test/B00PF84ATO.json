      "text": "Bought this to hold protein, pre and post workout supps. It's the perfect size to hold a scoop of protein, and has ample space for your pre's and posts. The lid stays on well and stays closed, so you can fill 2 or 3 and keep them in your bag and you don't have to stress over mess. Sometimes I fill a couple and put them in the suitcase when travelling, and they work just fine. Personally, I would prefer maybe 10% more volume, as a scoop of protein fits EXACTLY (ish) and it would be nice to have some room to play. Great for workout stuff; don't have babies so I cant attest to the volume for baby formula.",

It also turns out this is great for premeasuring formula for night feeds so I don't have to mess with measuring out partial scoops when I just want to get back to bed asap. The idea is great and it does work, but it could be improved. The hole in the lid where you pour out formula is not at the very edge of the lid, so it's hard to pour out the formula. You have to kind of tilt it different ways and tap it to get it all out.",

I only carry 1 scoop in each section but I think it's plenty big enough for several scoops. It cleans easily in the dishwasher, and also the divided section is removable so you could use it for snacks past the formula stage. Highly recommend!",

The container is bulky, however, I can over look that. It\u2019s the actual pouring of the powder into the bottle which sets it on the one-star path. There is no way to get all the formula out without shaking the container leading to water going in, powder getting on the floor, or the container flying out of my hand. As pictured, you can see the shelf/lip prevents formula from pouring. Ideally, I\u2019d like a one-hand container where I can open, flip, and pour. This just doesn\u2019t fit the bill.",

The oval shaped opening caused some issues with spillage as well. No matter now I poured the formula. This would probably work better for snacks.",
