      "text": "My primary use for this reel was surfcasting in New Jersey for inshore species, like bluefish and striped bass. I used it regularly for one season and it served me well: the drag was smooth and I landed many fish with it. I cleaned and maintained the reel as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Unfortunately, after one season the main gear failed a few months following the expiry of the warranty. This reel may suit your needs if you fish occasionally, but due to my experience I would not recommend this reel for regular use.",

I went to a live bait shop at Myrtle beach and this reel on the ugly stick is what the owner had in the store for sale and what the owner stated he uses on his charters. I have the 3000 and it is the perfect combo reel. I use this for mainly freshwater and trips to the beach. I highly recommend this reel.",

My older Penn reels are smooth and easy to reel, my Shims on reels are smooth and easy to reel. I am not sure what Penn is doing but unless they address this issue this will be the last Penn spinning reel I will buy.",

      "text": "Okay for some reason, Amazon sells these Battle IIs for a rather hefty discount of more than 20 bucks. I picked up a size 2500 and use it for small reds, speckled trout and flounder. It works remarkably well and it is a little heavy compared to my Stradic Ci4, but I don't care if my Battle gets banged up on the rocks I wade in since it's a lot more rugged (and cheaper!). Solid, solid reel for the price, especially Amazon's price. Just remember to clean and service it well if it gets dunked under saltwater.",

    "description": "Arm yourself for the most punishing saltwater battles with the Penn Battle II Spinning Fishing Reel. Crafted from durable materials and packed with fish fighting features, this saltwater reel is engineered to catch fish year after year. From the full metal body, sideplate, and rotor to the five sealed stainless steel ball bearings, each component is designed to help you land your catch. The reel's HT 100 Versa Drag carbon fiber drag system leverages both sides of each drag washer to provide maximum drag, and its instant anti reverse bearing eliminates pullback so you reel without interruption. Additionally, the drag washers are treated with a proprietary grease to ensure long lasting performance. Suitable for use with Berkley or Spiderwire Superline, the spool is fitted with a rubber gasket that prevents the Superline from slipping under pressure meaning anglers can use braided line without a monofilament backing. And thanks to its line capacity rings, the spool displays at a glance how much line is remaining.",
