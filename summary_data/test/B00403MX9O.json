The floor underneath the bed is way warmer than the part where my pet is supposed to be resting his poor arthritic bones. Thinking I need to return the bed and suck up the return shipping fees. Not to mention the packaging wasn't too great either as part of the bed is square and the other part is circular. Super bummed!!",

I tried putting my hand on it and left it there to see if there was any warmth at all, nothing. I waited and tried it again another day, same process, same results. The bed seems like it would be comfortable, but I bought it for the heat. Also, Amazon shoved it into a box that was narrower than the bed, so it is now oval, not round. After a few days to fill out, still hasn't. Disappointing all the way around.",

The heater is barely working and does not provide adequate heat for my older cat. This product fits the bill- 'you get what you paid for'.",

I\u2019m going to search for a Lectro-soft mat instead. What a waste.",

I got it because my senior cat always wants to sit/lay on my playstation to stay warm and i just wanted her to be more comfortable. Didn't take her long to figure out that it was warm and way more comfortable than the playstation. Only complaint is it have not indicator that its on and no temp control. Just plugs in and thats it. So far so good though.",

She chewed on the edge a little at first but then once she discovered the warmth she decided it was worthy of respect and ceased chewing. It's a very subtle warmth and you can barely feel it while the cat isn't in it, but I think it really gets magnified once they lay down.",

I bought this because it has been unusually cold. My cat started to sneeze and get watery eyes. Had never needed an electric blanket before. He goes to this heated regularly at night. Only 4 watts/hr., costing about 1 cent per day, so it is way way more efficient than an area heater (a small area heater is 1500 watts/hr).",
