Not the beauty of Allen Edmonds or Rossetti shoes, completely different style, but in the M+S conditions I mentioned it' s very hard to walk with shoes from the two top-brands I mentioned, even harder to wear them without damage. Last but not least: MADE in THE USA, with all this implies. I have seen, and once worn, shoes looking quite similar and costing less than half... well, you usually get what you pay, and as very often, who buys cheap, spends twice.",

After wearing the 875,875, and 8111 for so long it's hard to switch to a low profile boot. But if that's your thing these are a must!",
