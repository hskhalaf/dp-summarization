The metal pieces that prop up the laptop on the stand are shaped so that you can rest your wrists on them when typing. However, you cannot move them left or right, meaning that depending on how you type, they end up digging into your wrists uncomfortably. While they aren't sharp, they are thin enough that I could imagine my circulation getting cut off on long typing sessions. Otherwise, the construction is fine, but a supplementary product that hinders the use of the main product (aka the laptop) is a failure in my opinion.",

Also getting the keyboard just right so I can type without hitting the wrong key was a challenge, and I know how to type quite accurately! NO MORE. The stand is well made, sturdy and easy to adjust. Having the stand ventilated is a plus. Although there are pads under the stand I went ahead and put a cloth place mat under it to ensure there would be no scratching of my wood table. This makes it convenient to slide the whole thing out of the way if need be. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "Very solid, simple, inexpensive. But like many other reviewers, I've found that the tabs that hold the bottom front edge of the laptop poke up right at my wrists. I took some pliers and bent the tabs back, which helps a lot, but requires that I slide my laptop under the tabs to get it in and out of the stand, a minor nuisance, and they are still somewhat in the way. This manufacturer should offer a variety of tab heights, or just make them a quarter inch rather than a full inch high.",

In the back, amazon includes a grommet that is used to route cables to make your setup more neat. The only thing I changed/added was two soft pads (felt stickers would work too) to each side of the stand that the laptop makes contact with to prevent any scratches from metal on metal.

The only thing I agree upon that many have mentioned are that the two ROUNDED (good) stops that keep your laptop from slipping off do sometimes dig into the wrists and forearms if/when you rest upon them. It's a little inconvenience and could probably be 100% solved with a little pad stuck or glued on. That said the 'stops' have a dip for your arm to fit in if you place your arm 'correctly'! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this great little lap desk. Keeps my lap from getting hot, my laptop from overheating and my eyes and neck/spine neutral. A WINNER! :)",
