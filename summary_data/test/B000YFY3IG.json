I bought it because of the good reviews, but I can't justify the good ratings, ESPECIALLY not for $22! Perhaps the other colors camouflage the sheerness. If you are looking for a white crib skirt, don't buy this one! Spend the extra few dollars on a thicker, quality one. I ended up buying a soft chenille one from Target for $29.",
