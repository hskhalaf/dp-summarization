Like I said, I only used it once but if it works like this all the time I will be writing another review to let you know. I set the trimmer on #4 setting and had plenty of power.",

I contacted black and decker and they sent me new ones for free. I looked on amazon at prices to replace them, and it was gonna cost more than a new trimmer. Just the battery is $99. Black and decker replaced them 4 months after the purchase and covered the cost of shipping. Needless to say, both amazon and black and decker now have a loyal customer.",
