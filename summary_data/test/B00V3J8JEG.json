Almost as soon as I un-boxed it, I had it printing. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who knows nothing about 3D printing, but wants to get into the 3D printing world. I would have given this 5 stars, but the fact that you are locked into using XYZprinting's filament is what held me back. Every other aspect of this printer is wonderful.",

Her teacher found that she was so good with it, she recommended that we should get one for her at home. I was pleasantly surprised by the price. The computer program is pretty easy and there are a bunch of places to find downloadable files. My only complaint is that you are forced to only buy their filaments in their chipped cartridges. They are double and triple the price of generic filaments. That is really unfortunate. We will probably upgrade to one that doesn't require that in the next year.",

The Bad: You have to use the company filament the price is not too bad but at least you know you are using compatible PLA. The machine only prints in PLA. Sometimes the print does not stick. All i did was used a glue stick and it worked like magic. Another issue is that sometimes the print bed will rip. To fix this I went to Target and got yellow painters tape. In the end this is a great machine and would highly recommend it",

I have had some trouble with it here and there not feeding into the extruder properly, and one of the small pieces that the tube fits into had to be replaced. Their customer service is great, though. They walked me through different steps to diagnose and fix my problems, as well as sent a replacement part. It's not perfect, but it's good for the price and I am happy with it. It's a good thing to learn and practice with and maybe one day I will get a higher-end model.",

I have a hard time really complaining about that though, with how quick it is to fix the offset.",

The drawback is the filament is limited to PLA from the company, but it's a reasonable tradeoff.",
