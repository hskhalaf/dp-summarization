      "text": "Very easy to use and despite what others have said, the blade changes and interior cuts weren't a ridiculous inconvenience. I have zero experience with scroll saws but after some YouTube videos and a couple practice scraps I had it down. The blade makes all the difference, a thinner blade is better for small cuts but is harder to control on straight stretches. It came with a few small blades and I was able to make a 16\" bakery sign but I'd recommend getting a variety pack, I needed a thicker blade for this 4' name sign. I have zero complaints, this scroll saw is going to get a lot of use here!",

The solid aluminum base allows stable, an exactness and squareness of cut that cannot be achieved on a stamped metal base ( as found on the Central machine version). Over the last 6 months have been cutting everything from thin stock to 1.5 thick mesquite blocks ( which is a VERY hard wood!). Just finished a cutout in such a block, and the inside plug of wood fell right out! Absolute square cut I would expect from a metal cutting machine, not a jigsaw! Worth every penny and highest recommendation.",

Keep the tube thing, go to a local hardware store and find a plug that caps it off, put those spares and wrench into that tube stand, cap it off, and you have a storage place to find them later, when needed.",

The thin aluminum safety bar is flimsy at best and vibrates loose after turning the blade on. Other than those few things, it works okay.",

    "title": "WEN 3921 16-inch Two-Direction Variable Speed Scroll Saw",
    "description": "Style:With Flexible Worm LightRemember when your scroll saw could cut in two different directions? Take on the most intricate and artful cuts with the WEN 16-Inch Variable Speed Two-Direction Scroll Saw. The 9/16-inch stroke saws through hard woods up to two inches thick. Adjust the speed anywhere from 550 to 1600 strokes per minute with the simple turn of a knob. The cast iron base prevents vibration and walking during operation while the spacious 16-by-11-inch table bevels up to 45 degrees for angled cut. The adjustable air pump clears saw dust from your work area to give you a clear line of vision as you cut. This combined with the 1-1/2-inch dust port keep your work area clean so you can focus on your woodworking. The saw also includes a hold-down foot clamp for securing your project in place along with a flexible work light that bends and adjusts to whatever position your heart desires. This unique blade holder accepts both pinned and pinless blades while also allowing users to change the direction of their cut to accommodate their particular workpiece. For pinned blades, simply pop the pins out of the front holder and turn the blade 90 degrees. Now, your cuts are no longer confined by the 16-inch throat of the scroll saw. On top of that, our removable pinless blade holder design tightly grips blades to prevent them from coming loose during operation. Onboard blade and holder storage creates simple organization solutions between jobs. And because its a WEN product, your scroll saw comes backed by a two-year warranty, a nationwide network of skilled service technicians and a friendly customer help line, all to make sure you remember WEN.",
