My potty training two year old climbed up and was turning around to seat himself (while supervised) and the seat slipped off the toilet. He fell and hit his front teeth on the toilet and one of the front teeth has to be removed from the trauma. I would highly recommend finding a seat that won't slide around so much on the toilet.",

What I do not like about the seat for a little boy is that the guard pictured on the front of the seat is not at all as it appears. I have ordered 2 of these and neither guard is as pictured. Over all it is a good seat but unless your boy is able to keep his penis pointed down (good luck) I'd look for another seat or invest in Clorox cleaning wipes to keep handy for clean up.",

The seat lays on top of the toilet and doesn't secure down so it is easy to remove and it folds up if you needed it for a bathroom that is shared with adults. The only down size is cleaning it because it has a a seam on the seat part that things get stuck in so it needs to be cleaned really well after poops.

      "text": "I just ordered a second for our upstairs bathroom. We've tried the little potty, and the separate stepping stool/potty seat combination, but this is the one our toddler feels most confident using. She usually puts it on the toilet herself if it's off to the side. She can climb up and adjust her eight to be comfortable. We have oval shaped toilet seats and this fits great - very sturdy. We've had ours for 5 months and everything appears to be working and intact. I don't want to jinx anything, but I feel good saying that this has made potty training easier for us.",

But the stair is too thin and cannot be stablized. The cushion seat doesnt lock on the toilet that it kept moving around when my son sit on it. When my son sits on it, he kept moving up and down the handles/stairs. Quite annoy and such distraction when we try to potty train him. I ended up returning this.",

Then she would pretend to go pee pee in the potty while fully clothed. Not long after she asked to actually try like Mommy & Daddy, which was quickly followed by successful peeing in the potty. This helped her get over her fear of sitting on the big toilet out in public too. She loves holding onto the handles. Easily wiped clean and easily assembled (be sure you read the instructions and you should not have problems). Folds very slim for storage and easy to take with us for overnights away from home. Highly recommended product!",

He is confident with this product and now enjoys getting the kitchen step stool out to show that he can get into the refrigerator. Not sure if that's a good thing. It's a gateway product to a kitchen step stool and, who knows, step ladders next?",

The seat itself was very cushy and comfortable though, but I had to pick him up and stand next to him while he used it because it was so unsafe...which totally defeats the purpose of buying it. We went back to the regular potty seat without the ladder. I was really sad that this item didn't work well. If it had been better constructed it would have been amazing and given my son a lot of independence while potty training and using the potty.",

I feel like there should be some sort of splash guard that can be attached if need be. Pee gets everywhere and I've checked to see how this is happening--my son isn't sitting weird. It's just the gaps between this seat & the toilet seat and how everything will splash against the front. So, I wonder how many other parents of boys have had this issue. Overall, I would still recommend based on how much more my son prefers this to his smaller seat.",
