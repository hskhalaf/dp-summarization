Used on ice, slush, snow and wet dirt trails during the months of November and December along the Wasatch Front in Utah. Found no real benefit compared to regular shoes. I am comparing to a Altra lone peak. CONS Not waterproof at all Cold toes Snow grip is poor Ice grip not any better than regular shoes",

The added insulation around the ankle is amazing and doesn\u2019t add any pressure on soft tissue. Good breathability for the water resistance. The tread has excellent traction. Chevrons with multiple rubber conglomerates. Amazing shoe!",

The Saucony heel height makes my back muscles tighten up. Altras don't. Wish Altra would offer something with more water resistance and the Arctic Ice grip. These Sauconys might last me a long time because I will wear them only on special occasions when conditions make the cons tolerable. But they might save me from busting my butt on ice.",
