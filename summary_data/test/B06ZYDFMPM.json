As others have noted, the handle has some kind of cushioning that makes if move around a little, but I didn't notice after the first 5 minutes. Overall, a nice solid machine, a good value and a nice addition to my tool collection.",

Also it developed a fuel leak at the gas tank where the fuel line enters. I called the phone numbers listed as local repair shops for a warranty repair.

A couple minor complaints: the handle seems flimsy, hopefully it won\u2019t break prematurely. I think it\u2019s due to the feature that you can rotate the handle 90 degrees sideways. Also the product arrived in the box with the choke sticker installed backwards. I was able to figure it out and remove and reinstall the sticker myself in the proper orientation after looking at photos in the owner\u2019s manual. Other than those two minor annoyances, I am please with the hedge trimmer and recommend it!",

I also think the price was very reasonable plus free shipping and no tax. It was a no brainer for me. However I did buy the extended warranty just in case I had problems down the road.
