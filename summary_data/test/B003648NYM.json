There are no Stearns logos on the counterfeit, no distinguishing numbers like Model # or Coast Guard Approval #, its much smaller in size and artwork is clear poorly done. Most importantly this is a safety hazard and a child could drown. This listing is selling both fake and real puddle jumpers so do not buy from any vendor that is not Amazon. Amazon should not allow these vendors to sell these products! I called amazon and they had no way to just stop these vendors from selling here. Really disappointing.",

He deliberately dips his mouth in though to taste the water! I've used these before for kids 15 months to 8 years, but 8 months was a first. He cries in protest if we put him in the baby ring!

But we go to the local YMCA and now that she has this she can feel a little more independent from us in the big kid pool. The only downside of this is that the arm diameter is a little narrow for my child. I stretched it a bit by sticking some shaving cream cans in each hole and let it sit outside for a couple of hours to stretch. But they're pretty tight for the average kid. I guess that's better than being too loose though. Would definitely repurchase.",

Not a big deal, since they were several years old. We bought this product to replace the old ones, expecting them to have the same lifespan of several years. Within just a few uses, the stitching on one side began coming undone.

I tried another vest/jacket style one and it kept riding up to my sons face when he would jump in or be in deeper water. This one stays put and works really well. It enables him to float on his back or swim on his tummy. I also like that I can hold on to the back strap to drag him around in the water. It's cute and effective and has held up to many many trips to the pool. HIGHLY recommend!",

It was left outside for months and finally after over a year of use we had to buy a new one due to it tearing. That\u2019s why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because it won\u2019t last for years but I don\u2019t expect that from something like this.",

I wouldn't leave her alone in this of course, but it's a great float and made me more relaxed knowing that she wouldn't immediately sink if she stepped off the side into the pool.

Item received was authentic, I'm thinking the knock offs were possibly the color options that are listed suspicuously cheaper- like $7 not prime, but free shipping, versus $20 they normally go for and include free 2 day prime shipping.
