These seats are firm and the back is straight. Now my foot is straight over the trolling motor. I like the firmness but some people might not like it. I love the lock down position . No strap to tear after a few years of use. Seats feel heavy. Will be buying another when the price gets back down to around $75. Will not pay $100 to $150 for a boat seat.",

Overall the seat was comfortable and from what I could tell, should have been sturdy as well. Unfortunately, this was not so. They should have engineered the hinge area with either a higher grade plastic or possibly a non-corrosive metal. I DO NOT recommend this seat unless changes are made in the engineering of it.",

I had Stearns $50 variety seats which were very uncomfortable with no back support. These have rigid support, much better posture for your back.I have had several back surgeries, and fusions. For the last 3 yrs I have almost given up on fishing due to being in so much pain.I hope to once again start enjoying something I love to do,and these seats will definitely help me accomplish this.I used them for the first time today,and I am very happy I decided to spend a little extra for this great (USA made) product.I will be purchasing 2 more very soon.",
