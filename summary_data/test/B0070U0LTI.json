It heats up quickly and has a large, easy to read temperature gauge which is accurate enough to correctly indicate the outside temperature where I live in Florida, in the 70's and 80's. The instruction book is well written, and gives the necessary dimensions for the built in cut outs.",

The quality was good, but I ordered a natural gas BBQ. It came in propane. I am now waiting one more month for the replacement.",
