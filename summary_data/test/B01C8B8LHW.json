Since it's only $15 I'm going to buy another one and hope the next one also lasts for at least a year :) Second review: I use my second coffee maker (purple) to heat up water and get white plastic pellets in the filter, smaller bits of plastic below the filter, and my water is not clear. A concerning amount of plastic ends up in the filter every time I use this coffee maker. I don't know where it's coming from and am concerned about health effects from this.",

I feel I don't waste as much coffee and I can buy regular ground coffee instead of having to pay for K-Cups which I feel are expensive. Worth the cost!",
