I haven't exercised in years, but I enjoy the workout on this. If you do it correctly you get a good ab and leg workout. It is fun to use. I've had this on my wish list for quite a while. When they dropped the price I couldn't resist. Very pleased with my purchase.",

I am 5'4\" and set the seat to the medium height which worked fine. But when I set it to the highest height for my 6'2\" husband, I found that it was easier for me to work. So if it feels a bit too hard to move at the seat height you have set, try setting the seat higher. I felt my deep stomach muscles had gotten a good workout after several 5 minute sessions. I am 63 and had no trouble working the mechanism.",
