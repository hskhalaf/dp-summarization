Not only difficult to get on, which I could live with, but extremely tight around the top of the foot. I need to figure out how to stretch these or they're worthless to me. IF I get them to stretch, I'll upgrade the review, but for now, I have to go with comfort over style. I don't understand why when manufacturing boots, they don't stretch them, because everyone complains of the same thing, breaking them in! IF anyone has any helpful tips for stretching, much appreciated.",

I read reviews saying to order a size down from what your normally wear. I went to the local boot store and tried on a size down in the same boot. That seemed to fit better. So I returned to Amazon to order them in the full size down. I received the smaller pair and they're still big! They're comfortable but they feel odd and clumsy on my feet. It's hard to explain. I probably should've ordered one and a half sizes down.",

Also the color is darker than expected - more like a chocolate and blue.

I wear a size 8.5 and I had to fit into a size 7.5. A whole size difference. I even fit into a size 7.Wow! So, I knew that before I ordered online and they arrived as a perfect fit. I recommend you try them on at your local western store for the right fit. It's worth the effort as these boots are extremely comfortable and well made. I'm a Very happy customer!",

The ones in the store fit perfectly, if anything they were a bit snug but since boots stretch they were perfect. The ones I received (which were also 7 1/2 B) fit more like an 8 1/2. They were much too big for me. So maybe there is just an inconsistency in the boots from Justin or something, I am not sure. I will be returning these and getting a smaller pair.",

So I would recommend going at least 1/2 size down from your normal size. There're very comfortable just took a bit to work in, they definitely do stretch out once you break em in. Shipping was really fast I was quit impressed. overall I'm very happy with these boots and would recommend to anyone.",

You can't go wrong with these boots, just make sure you order a size smaller than what you wear (I wear a 10 and ordered a 9)",

This fantastic leather look features gorgeous stitching and finely tooled overlays for a look that\u2019s feminine and just a little bit rough and ready. Built with proprietary comfort technology with a tractioned technical western rubber sole, this fine boot is every bit as capable as it is good looking.\n\nThe story of Justin Boots began in 1879, when H.J. Justin moved to Spanish Fort, Texas to become a boot repairman. He was a quick study, with an eye and talent for boot making and launched his own company, Justin Boots. Every pair of Justin Boots is a salute to the spirit of independence, hard work and authenticity of the cowboy.",
