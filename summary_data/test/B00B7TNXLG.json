It's fast, responsive, it doesn't lag, downloads all the apps very fast and smoothly, WIFI connection is nice and steady. Graphics are crisp and beautiful, sound is really good, setting up my emails, FB and Twitter was a breeze. When fully charged it lasts all day which is perfect for my needs. I think it's an amazing little tablet, why spend so much more for a tablet that does the same thing? I am getting 3 more for my kids for Christmas. They LOVE it!",

First, it takes a long time to boot up and sometimes gets hung up and you have to hold the power button to restart. Next is the poor battery life. The longest we got was 2 hours. Which is really not satisfactory. Otherwise it has a good selection of apps, the display seems OK. I would say if you want a tablet on a budget this is fine. But remember to have your charger nearby. Also, the charger is not your phone charger. It uses another style of plug.",

Our laptops, desktops, television... nada bit of blue. The Korby... a slight blue cast. But... she likes it, it's fully loaded and does what a tablet is supposed to do, so I guess I won't be returning it for a replacement. There you have it.",

Believe me when I tell you that the Coby 7-Inch Android 4.0 8 GB Internet Tablet 16:9 Capacitive Multi-Touch is much better then the Nexus7 because it has basically the same software installed and it lets you install additional micro sd card for storage and/or use a usb stick but a converter cable from usb female to mini usb male is required. I had also ordered a keyboard/cover for it that came with said adapter cable so that saved me a little. Overall a fantastic deal and much fun for power users too :)",

The case feels plastic-y, a more rigid back would make it 5 stars for me. Will keep tabs, as long as it holds up will stay 4 stars.",

      "text": "The charging port on the Tablet is bad! You have to hold and manipulate the plug to get it to charge.If you are able to finally get it to charge the battery doesn't hold a charge long, even when the Tablet is not in use. Tis is not something I would recommend to anyone, but I would like to warn them. I will be trying to get a good replacement. I'll keep you posted",
