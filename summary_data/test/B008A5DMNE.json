Update: It did start to stick after awhile but I had to throw mine out because the coating was starting to chip and I'm not sure if it's aluminum under the coating. Better to be safe than sorry. Oh well back to searching for a non stick pot that will last and not be toxic.",

      "text": "I have been using this pan for over a year now and been meaning to write a review for a long time. This is a terrible pan. It chars so quickly, and works only if the food is cooked in super low flame with frequent stirring. Of course, it is non stick, so the charring comes off easily with more heat. The construction is sturdy but it is practically pointless if it burns easily, specially for day to day Indian cuisine.",

I bought this for a gift for my elderly mother. She was concerned at first about the weight until she used it. She has fallen in love with it and swears it is the best thing invented for the kitchen since plug-in refrigerators. 5 Stars is not enough for this product.",

It warms up very quickly, and you don't have to use heat higher than medium or medium high. Cleaning is a breeze!!! Food comes off so easy, I can't believe it! I also like how the white ceramic coating makes it easy to see the food. And the color and shape and size is great too. Handle has a nice cool grip. And the handle makes it easy to hold the pan (great grip!) even with wet hands. I will be buying the entire set!!!",

      "text": "I bought this pan in April 2016 and have used it for a year now. The first six months the pan performed as advertised. Even though it said metal utensils could be used I used nonmetal utensils when cooking and used metal fork or spoon to retrieve food after cooked. The pan is now starting to chip so I will have to throw it out as I am worried about pieces of coating in my food.",
