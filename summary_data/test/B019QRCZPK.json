The only con I've noticed about these boots is that the velcro tends to get dirty/muddy and it loses its effectiveness but not enough to have them slip out. Also, don't be alarmed if your dog has trouble walking in them at first. It'll take a couple of walks for them to get used to them.",

But not really worth the price tag after seeing many different brands and makes. Overall these are well made but just not suited for large breeds, even with the correct sizing.",

He also didn't want to go for a walk, and he'd raise his right back leg and go on three legs when he did walk! However, after only like 3 trials with some treats for reinforcement, he is now used to them and trots along fine. Make sure you velcro them on tight so they don't fall off. they protect his feet very well, and he doesn't seem to mind them now once he starts walking.",
