The two acrylic wine 'glasses' are adequate and the wine opener is sturdy enough and works. The carrier is lightly insulated so chilled wine stays somewhat chilled for a while. I would suggest carrying a different bottle stopper as the one provided would work and look nice if the bottle is left upright, but does not fit snuggly enough to prevent leakage if you do not consume all of the wine and the bottle is tipped on it's side.",

Overall a great case and I recommend it to everyone that would like a good travel wine case. You could also use it for a nice big beer.",
