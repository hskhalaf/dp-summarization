I'm not taking a risk with my hair although I'm not 100% sure it's not real.

My advice is to not spray this straight on your hair but to instead spray it onto your hands. Then run your hands through your hair to work the product through, I scrunched mine in. It seems to keep it from being too heavy if applied that way.",

      "text": "After my most recent salon visit where my colorist used this on my hair, I knew I had to buy it. I was a little skeptical about purchasing it on Amazon based on a few reviews claiming the product was fake, but I followed through anyway. I\u2019m glad I did, because this is the real deal. I used it tonight and my hair feels INCREDIBLE. It is super soft and silky. One thing to note: I towel dried my hair and sprayed this only on the middle and end portions of my hair.",
