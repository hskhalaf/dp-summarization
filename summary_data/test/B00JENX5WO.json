My only complaint is that yes, it WAS shipped in the manufacturers box with no outer packaging, so the surprise was ruined for my husband, but he loves it! Addendum: Well, I was proven wrong. After 6 months, the CD player stopped working. Had to send it back for repairs, which ended up being a full replacement at my cost because it was out of warranty. Bumped down my rating. CD spindle is delicate, be careful not to push in too hard or it could be damaged.",

The audio out plugs and switches are on the reverse so you have to turn it/Wrestle it around to sinc up a player or laptop. I dont like the large transformer plug, its unsightly. Should be inside the radio. And when you pull the audio plug out the back the cardboard rear wobbles with flimsy-ness. I would buy it again but its not a forever type item.",

The door you open to put the CD would probably break if this were used by a family with young children, but as long as we use it carefully it should do fine. I actually turned the radio on, but turned the sound off at Christmastime just so that the flashing lights would continue to work while we had guests. The sound is good. Overall, I'd buy it again even though it isn't super high quality construction.",

      "text": "Bought as a birthday gift for my wife and she loved it. The LEDs quit working after only 4 months with only 2 or 3 hours of daily use. No other problems with the unit but the LEDs were a really cool touch and added ambiance. There is a one year warranty with this item so I guess I'll go that route. If you purchase this product, be sure to save the receipt and the original box and be prepared to pay for all shipping. I will try and update later on how Crosley handles this. If the LEDs were still functioning, I would have gave this product 5 stars.",
