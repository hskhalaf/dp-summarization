It's comfortable although my toes do touch the front (in the morning) so I should have gone up a half size. Still, it's not so bad that I need to return them. I like the weight (a little heavier than the Grand Traverse) and the feel where the ties are. It's a terrific and the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fit. That may be I just have a flatter foot now.",

I normally wear a 7 1\\2 but with tennis shoes or boots i go for an 8 to allow for socks. These fit perfect. Length is great. Width is perfect. Toe box is wide. The bottom isn't very soft but I plan to use the Edensoles i recently bought. Overall I am thrilled and would definitely buy again. They are definitely worth the price!",
