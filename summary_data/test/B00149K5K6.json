      "text": "Authentic EMU boots have a removable sole (check the website). The bottom of the boot also says emu over and over again (even showed in the picture for this product on amazon) but mine does not. The stitching on authentic emu boots says emu on the top stitching, mine does not. The logo on the back of the boot also does not match. Also too small. I mean overall I guess it's a pretty good knockoff. Looks pretty similar to the real ones. But definitely not worth the price.",

Tight at first but after 2 wks have stretched and are perfect. Very warm but not too hot even for indoor wear. They did get wet wearing in snow so I allowed to dry, brushed them and applied Bickmore Gard-More. Wore in snow again and stayed clean and dry. Black dye does stain feet and socks heavily at first but that is lessening with time. If the soles, stitching, etc. prove durable I will be very happy with these boots!",

Ordered a 6 in this and found that they were far too big. A 5 would have been perfect. Unfortunately, I had purchased the boot on a mega \"one day only\" sale through Amazon and then found that Amazon won't allow you to exchange them for a different size. By the time the boots arrived, the sale was long over and I was unable to get them for the same price. VERY disappointed with Amazon over this policy. Makes absolutely no sense.

In the past I ordered a smaller size anticipating stretching, but the boots never were comfortable for extended wear. These boots are great to look at, easy to put on and take off and will be very nice to have this cold winter. They have the good lining and a removable foot bed. If the boots do stretch I will just add some thick winter socks and all will be well. They fit well now and do not ride up on the heels when walking. I recommend them.",

Don't forget to waterproof them, especially if they are light in color. After a day in heels, these are what I want to go out in.

I put them on and they fit. They are the dream made real, better than I have ever seen before: a definite 5 star +.",

      "text": "I bought a pair last November. They started out great, warm and comfy in bare feet. I do wear my boots hard and walk around in the snow, although do not wear daily. So sad that the soles are falling off the from the boot. Will not last until next season and I will soon toss. So got at good price but for overall value, you may want to rethink and spend more money.",

They are a must have for the winter, very warm and very very comfortable. Compared to the bronte I believe this has a much sleeker finish. I ordered the chestnut color and it has a very nice rich look. Like the other reviewers mentioned you are bteer off ordering 1 size down as the boot stretches to fit well.",
