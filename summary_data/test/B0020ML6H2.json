    "description": "Bit is made of high quality rotary carbide, for long drilling life with a tapered shank body; flute geometry removes metal shavings quickly with less vibration and weight. For use with most common rotary hammers in rotation mode.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Bosch 18-Volt Impactor Driver features a lightweight design for increased maneuverability in tight spaces and extended user comfort. Boasting a high-performance motor and all-metal gears, this versatile tool is rugged enough for professional jobs and user-friendly enough for the weekend worker. Bit changes are easy with the 1/4-inch hex drive, and a built-in LED provides extra light when needed. Electronic Cell Protection results in longer battery life and better performance. The driver comes with two batteries, belt clip, Phillips bit, and carrying bag. \n\n \n\n18V Lithium-Ion\nImpactor Driver\nAt a Glance:  * Compact driver fits into tight spaces and reduces fatigue\n   \n   \n * Robust motor and all-metal gears deliver 2,800 rpm or 3,200 bpm\n   \n   \n * 1,500 in./lbs. of torque with variable speed trigger to match speed to job\n   \n   \n * Electronic Cell Protection protects battery for longer life and better performance\n   \n   \n * One-year limited warranty\n\n\nUp to 27 percent faster than comparable cordless impact drivers and impact wrenches. View larger. \nCompact design fits into tight corners and is easy on the arm. View larger. Bosch Impactors: Faster Performance for Increased Productivity\nThis driver is part of Bosch's new line of Impactor drills and drivers. Powered by lithium-ion batteries, these tools are up to 27 percent faster than comparable cordless impact drivers and impact wrenches. In the demanding world of metal fastening and serial screw driving applications, the increase in speed means a significant boost to productivity.The Bosch impact driver is capable of driving a 3-inch all-purpose screw into a pressure-treated 4-by-4 in about one second, and can drive a 3- by 1/4-inch lag bolt into a pressure-treated 4-by-4 in less than four seconds.\n\nDynamic Torque with Variable Speed Trigger for Control\nThe driver's robust motor and all-metal gears deliver 2,800 rpm or 3,200 bpm for fast results. For driving force, its hammer and anvil system produces 1,500 in./lbs (125 ft./lbs.) of dynamic torque. Thanks to a variable speed trigger, it's easy to match the correct speed to the job.\n\nCompact, Lightweight Body for Easy Handling\nAll this power comes in a lightweight package that fits into tight corners, so it won't overtax arm or hand muscles. At 5-3/4 inches long and 3-1/3 pounds, this impact driver is one of the most compact on the market.\n\nUser-Friendly Features Save Time and Reduce Fatigue\nThis user-friendly tool is easy to handle, even for the novice user. In addition to its compact size, the driver features a spring-loaded impact mechanism to reduce user fatigue. A 1/4-inch hex drive makes for fast, easy bit changes, while externally accessible brushes makes replacements easy.\n\nTo help out in dark corners or other low-light areas, the driver provides a built-in LED light for instant illumination.\n\nAbout Bosch Lithium-Ion Batteries\nCapable of driving up to 150 3- by 1/4-inch lag bolts between charges, this tool is powered by an 18-volt battery from Bosch's line of lithium-ion batteries, all of which boast Electronic Cell Protection. This battery pack design protects both the battery and the tool by preventing the three main causes of battery failure--overheating, overloading, and deep discharging. The results are optimal battery life and performance, 35-percent more run time, and up to two times as many recharge cycles.\n\nWarranty Information\nThe Bosch 18-Volt Impactor Driver is backed by a manufacturer's one-year limited warranty.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nDriver, two batteries, charger, Phillips bit, belt clip, and carrying bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMost Compact Impactor Design - For increased maneuverability in tight spaces and extended comfort.\n\nSee more",
