Only ding is that two of the 43 pieces I installed were defective - female threads were mis-tapped on one and one of the handle 'standoff' studs was stripped on another.

I would suggest that perhaps the \"alignment issue\" may have been caused by one tightening one screw too tight or completely before attempting to tighten the other. This can lead to a cross threaded screw. Tighten each a little at a time so they pull in straight not cocked. Great product!",

Great way to update your kitchen for a modern clean look. Definitely worth it and very much recommended! Two thumbs up!",
