I love that it has additional slip free rubber on the legs. I also really like the fact that the time is thicker and not as easy to move when hit hard. Another feature I really like that I wasn't aware was a bonus is the fact that the rim on the pro set is yellow. This makes it stand out much more than the traditional black rim and is much easier to see during game play.",

But what I found was that unless you hit in the middle of the net AND with a good amount of force, the bounce is totally unpredictable. Not a family game with younger kids. We had a bunch of pretty athletic 10yo's play and it was a disaster. If you're within 6 inches of the rim, the bounce is very erratic. The pro balls were also pretty lopsided after pumping them up. Big disappointment. Should have just bought the cheap $50 version but guessing it would be lower quality.",
