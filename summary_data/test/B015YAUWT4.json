It will not keep out a determined thief but should delay the average teenagers conducting a B&E for obvious swag. In addition if you place it out of sight, it should work as desired.",

      "text": "Relatively easy to install when you have wall studs that are 16\" on center. I specifically chose this model because it has a keyed backup in case the electronics fail. The metal is very heavy duty. It isn't fire proof but it would be hard for a thief to break into. It has two heavy duty locking cylinders and hidden hinges for added security. You can set the combination with any numbers that you choose. You can also turn the keypad beep on or off. The AA batteries that come with it are private label brand. I would advise buying some Duracell or Energizer batteries. Highly recommended.",

No information in manual or anywhere on the internet that explains what the spring is from/for. Unable to use the safe as I'm not sure it will open while missing a spring. Do not buy.",

In order to avoid cutting the drywall, I decided to surface mount this unit with about 6 hefty lag bolts, and it\u2019s worked well in that application. I drilled holes in the back of the unit in order to do this. Despite the heavy weight of the metal, it was relatively easy to drill.",
