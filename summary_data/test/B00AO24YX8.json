It \"tocks\" like a clock which is extra noise and doesn't adjust where you want it to. You have to use a lot of force to turn the knob because you're winding a clock I guess. Not user friendly especially when you're in a rush The heating element is too large (one on the top and one on the bottom). Anything that falls or drips on it will start to smoke real quick. I'm sure it has smoked almost every time I use it. Pretty annoying....",

I chose this because of the lift-up door. On my old toaster oven, crumbs and bits of cheese were always dripping on the door . Drawbacks - the minute numbers are very lightly painted on around the dial. Even though I was very careful, some of the numbers have already disappeared - worn off by my fingers when I turned the dial, or perhaps wiped off when I cleaned it (gently). I have yet to figure out how to clean the inside of the door.",

Only minus is the the temperature dial labeling is non-existent, but we've learned to work with it.

      "text": "I had a much more expensive toaster oven that burnt everything I cooked or toasted. After comparing this oven with my older unit, I think the difference is the cooking surface on this toaster is a little further from the heating element. The roll top door is a very nice feature, making it easier to keep an eye on your what you are cooking and retrieve food. The one downside is the marking on the knobs. Glare from the counter top makes it a bit challenging to see the arrow on the bottom knob -- I may put a little enamel paint on it. Well worth the money",

Not only does it easily toast bread and bagels, but it warms pizza slices, chicken, sandwiches and all other sorts of items. Wish I had purchased this years ago.",

It saves on energy costs and really keeps your kitchen cooler.",

But it's approximate in its toasting/heating, a bit noisy, and to toast, you have to manipulate the dials each time you use it. The arced \"door\" is a bit loose and actually, heat leaks out. I am not getting compliments on my toast, but people find the design to be a curiosity.",
