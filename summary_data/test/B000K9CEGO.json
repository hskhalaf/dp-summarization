Noticeably firmer butt and less cellulite. Love this stuff. Also super hydrating so I use it all over my skin.",

My ankle healed very quickly and there has not been the long recovery time predicted by my doctor and others who have had similar bad sprains. \"Oh, this will take longer to heal than a break!\" Gee, thanks! But in four weeks, I feel I was completely healed. I attribute this to using the arnica oil and under the tongue homeopathic arnica. I used the arnica oil at least two times a day.",

If you are prone to bruising this will not only eliminate pain (not immediately but quickly) it will also help to lighten the discoloration of a bruise quickly. If you are bruise prone, as I am. this is a really nice feature. I've never noticed the smell so if you do not like strong smells this should not bother you",

I was having a hard time finding a good massage oil at the store that didn\u2019t have such a strong odor or thick consistency. The smells are great and he loves how it feels when rubbing it in. It absorbs well without drying up too fast during the longer massages. The muscle arnica oil really helps my achy legs and feet. We both noticed a difference in my skin from only a few weeks of use. I\u2019ll definitely keep purchasing.",

I would definitely not buy again.",
