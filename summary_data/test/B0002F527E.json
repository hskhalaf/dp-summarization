Is LP willing to replace them with a thicker smack surface for free? I've always was around the LP products since 1969, which in my opinion were crafted much better. Otherwise great starter set, among my other LP Instruments that I use.",

      "text": "Since there are no instructions, it is a little confusing to figure out how to set up if youre new to timbales like me. However, once it's set up (I asked someone at a local drum shop to show me how) it's amazing! They sound great and come with a pair of sticks as well as an attachable bell. I recommend adding a crash cymbal and claw as well as a block for the full experience. It may be expensive in the end but still worth it. They sound almost as good as the pro set we used in my college Afro Cuban ensemble. Strongly recommend for beginners or just for experienced players who just want to practice.",
