So you have to manually switch between cameras and you have to manually turn the sound on each time you switch. This makes it impossible to keep track of the cameras while sleeping. There are sound and motion alerts, but it comes as an alarm on your phone. Plus, it keeps going off until you hit ok. This really sucks to do at night. It will keep waking you for every small movement or noise. I sent these back. I had high hopes, but it just doesn\u2019t work for a dual baby monitor system.",

However, the temperature and humidity readings never show on the app anymore (it worked for the first few days and then stopped). I've even troubleshooted the issue based on iBaby's FAQ guide, but I've had no luck in getting that feature to work. For the price we paid, I really wish we had gone with something else.",
