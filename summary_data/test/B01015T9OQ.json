While the snug fitting seems to be an essential component for the slip-on design, the leather material could be uncomfortable and cause rubbing at the back heel. To remedy this, wearers may opt to wear no-show socks at break-in or choose a size higher to get that comfortable walking experience from this budget-friendly summer kick.",
      "pros": [
        "Majority of reviewers appreciated the slip-on design of the Sperry Seaside Perforated because it provided them with so much ease to wear making them as their on-the-go shoes",
        "Some travelers considered buying these shoes as they are perfect for walking during hot summer days by the beach and a cool sneaker to wear while exploring tropical countries",
        "Numerous users say these women\u2019s slip-on is fabulous footwear for activities that involve a lot of walking like running errands or outdoor activities like strolling by the beach or window shopping",
        "Several women find these low-top shoes trendy and fashionable that they go well with a lot of casual clothing during the spring and summer months",
        "A large number of women preferred buying these shoes because it provided them with a massive selection of colorways to choose to suit their mood, fashion taste, and wardrobe preference",
        "As it comes with perforations, some wearers considered buying them because of their breathability",
        "The low-top perforated sneakers have a very soft and cushioning memory foam footbed, some wearers disclosed",
        "While some say it has a snug fit, many wearers say it feels comfortable and molds to the feet after a few days of break-in because it stretches a bit to conform to the shape of the feet"

      "cons": [
        "Several complaints were focused on how narrow the shoes are that some people with wide feet had to upsize by half up to full",
        "Some users complained of getting blisters as the interior, and stiff material near the collar rubs through their ankles at first use because of the snug fitting",
        "The narrow opening posed as a problem to some users that while they liked the slip-on design, they would have appreciated a broader collar for an easier entry"
