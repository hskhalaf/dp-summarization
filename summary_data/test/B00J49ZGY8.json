      "text": "The laptop is beautiful,however, after a few times of opening and closing the laptop, the LCD is starting to detach from the aluminum body. There is no physical damage to the machine. This seems like poor workmanship that isn't acceptable for the price paid for this unit. I contacted support and they will inspect and repair the unit but it will take 2-3 weeks. All this for a unit that is less than a month old... UPDATE: Well they repaired the laptop fairly quickly (1 Week) and it just like new again. Hopefully the LCD screen stays in place this time.",

I love the fact that it's slim and lightweight- it will be much easier to travel with. It comes with some Samsung software which I have not explored yet. I had a huge problem with the way it was packaged. it was sent in a huge box with no protection around the laptop box. The box was large enough for 4 laptops! I left a separate feedback on that.",

It is possible to recover if you use the windows password, but if you choose a local pin, then don't forget it. Otherwise, you will need to restore everything from scratch. Bad news. So, I recommend sticking with your microsoft password to unlock the laptop.",

Wish I had bought this in the first place... it is more money but WOW the bigger screen and build quality is tremendous. Feels solid. Under 4 pounds ... and the battery is great for such a big screen. Also, the trackpad and keyboard are superior. Only thing I wish it had was if the AC adapter plugged straight into the wall.
