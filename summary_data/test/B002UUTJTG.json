Very disappointing to have spent this much and have a defective part. I keep the base on all the time as the lamp colors are very dark and it is unattractive unless lit. I can live with that, based on thus type of lamp, but not a defective base!",

It is described as real glass and certainly looks like it. Beautiful lamp-GREAT PRICE-buy it! We are so glad we did!!!",

The prongs are quite long, and I added at least ten washers on each. Luckily, I had these at hand. Expect a trip to the hardware store.",

Still like it, but it will have to go somewhere else and I'll have to find another lamp now and spend more money. As pretty as it is, I feel like it's false advertising and that it would have been an absolutely stunning lamp, as opposed to just a \"pretty\" lamp, if it were in the teal color as advertised.",
