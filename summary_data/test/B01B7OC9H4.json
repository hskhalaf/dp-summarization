I was able to put (2) 9\" x13\" aluminum pans in the bottom section - extended AND another pan of the same size in the top section. The hot pans were on the bottom and these containers remained hot - straight from the oven for the next 2 hours without warming the top dessert pan. I'm pleased with this purchase and look forward to using it frequently.",

I followed the common sense suggestion not to put a dish straight from the oven into the carrier without a towel or hot pad beneath it. The carrier kept the food hot in transit.
