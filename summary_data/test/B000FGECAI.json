BUT, this is an absolutely fabulous game, I fell in love with it in minutes, completing the puzzles (especially 3-d ones) give an immense pleasure, and the very top level puzzles are not easy at all! I cannot imagine anyone, from an infant to a senior, not being glad for having a Kanoodle! And my first impression is that it would definitely improve the mental skills of young children.",

For example, the puzzle can be just lacking 1-2 pieces. Or nearly the entire board needs to be completed. I bought it as a travel game and it works great. It is not ideal for playing in the car due to the pieces can fall if they are careful. But it is great to pack up into a bag of toys and play when you get to your destination. I would imagine that the puzzles could be done over and over because it seems unlikely you would remember how it went together in prior games.",

The colors in the puzzle booklet correspond to some extent with the color of the puzzle pieces, but it could be much better--this is the only thing the kids have a problem with. The writing in the booklet uses black letters on a dark blue background and black letters on a dark purple background, making it difficult to impossible to read. White letters would have been better. However, this doesn't seem to present a problem for the kids.",
