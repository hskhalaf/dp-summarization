Which means, if you are on the skinny side, you may find yourself swimming in this thing so keep that in mind. The synthetic microfiber is plush but not very absorbent so will not dry you off after a shower like a cotton robe will. All of that said, for less than $20, it would be hard to find a better robe for lightweight summer use. The retro woodlands camo pattern is novel.",
