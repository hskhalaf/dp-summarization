      "text": "As an illustrator, all I've wanted is a lag free machine that I could take with me on the road. I was using a Surface Pro 3 8gb i5 before and it was frustrating to use because of the pen lag. I took a chance and ordered the Vaio and I immediately listed the SP3 on Ebay after testing it for an hour. The thicker pen feels a lot better and there is NO lag at all. It's a bit heavier, the kickstand isn't as good as the Surface, but it's still very good and functional. Screen is brighter and the colors are truer. Build quality is very good. Cheaper than the Surface Pro 4, which still has pen lag.",

When I go to control panel, Canvas cannot find any networks even though more than ten are available. Other devices will connect at the same time that the Vaio Canvas Z will not. This is driving me crazy. Update March 2017. Canvas Z now is dead and useless. Power button is green but screen is completely black. The charger power light is on but when I plug into computer the orange light on the computer does not shine. The Vaio only has 12 month warranty. :(",

I got really into Vaio with my vaio tap 22 back when it was owned by Sony, I really liked that desktop so I decided to give it a try with with the Canvas Z. This hybrid has enormous power. Contrary to what people are saying, the battery lasts around 5 to 6 hours heavily using programs like Corel Draw, Pymol and OriginLab at the same time. The stylus could be more responsive but that is a minor thing and doesnt not bother me. I highly recommend.",

The detachable keyboard allows me to work with a mouse or stylus and type in commands with ease. It is fast, the screen is stunning and it was money well spent. The only negative is the weight is more than the SP ... but I have no problem with it. You will be pleased if you buy this tablet.",
