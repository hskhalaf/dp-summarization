      "text": "I found this remote easy to program and use. It allowed me to control my soundbar, DISH, and TV (DISH remote will not program to control soundbars...VERY ANNOYING). BUT my wife and son could not get the hang of it, so I bought a $10 Phillips remote at Walmart that works great. I had to run thru the trouble shooting prompts at least 100 times in 2 weeks b/c they either turned on a component without using the remote or bumped it on something or dropped it. I will keep it for my personal use in another room.",
