Traditional disposable razors were chewing up my legs (I guess after the age of 50 your skin changes). So my next best option is finding a great electric razor. The traditional women's electric razors fall flat. The old adage - 'you get what you pay for' - is so true! This is a little more expensive, but it works great! Highly recommend this electric razor for women!",

I said how come I never wrote a review about this. this is by far the best electric shaver. battery lasts a week. shave razor-like without any irritation. I use it wet or dry and either way works great. I remember changing the blades (but not the screens), just because it was recommended to be changed every 18 months. no need really. It's funny though I bought it for 95$ in 2013 and now I see the listed price is 110$. I guess nothing newer has come yet. anyways I recommend this shaver. and btw I think it's the only Japan made shaver on the market.",

Also, the blades wore out after about six months; supposed to last one year. Can't just order blades, need to order the foil too which is still good. My old Panasonic ES8103 is almost as good a razor for much less money but has fewer blades and less powerful motor. So this new model is somewhat better. But the unusually large head is a nuisance and the blades wear out too quickly. This is an updated review. I kept the total stars at three. Could be three and a half.",

However, with this razor, shaving on the neck is a close shave with daily bleeding from scrapes and nicks. Do want to give it a month as the cuts are not deep, and the skin is regenerative with pain lasting only a hour after shaving.

I had an old Braun that burnt out years ago and remembered how hard it was to clean, so it was important to get a shaver that could be charged and cleaned at the same time. This product fit the bill and I am very pleased with it.",
