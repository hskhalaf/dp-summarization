User interface far better then older Predators with a joy stick to toggle through the settings. The stand is solid and heavy. The 16X9 ratio means no black bars like those on ultra wides. This one is the real deal.Most if not all the past issues with large screen, fast refresh rate screens are gone. This one is a keeper!",

What I don't like: Bezels here are massive. The OSD is better than most but the buttons placement on the bottom is not ideal. Ghosting in some games is really bad, while others I don't notice any. Oddly enough the worst offender so far is Diablo 3 which has absolutely terrible ghosting. Would I buy it again: Definitely.",

The colors are incredible, the response time is incredible, overall a great monitor. I can only really think of 2 cons. First, the price. I got it on sale so it helped, at the time of writing this it is still on sale. The second is the resolution, 2560 x 1440. Most AAA games with good graphics, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Apex Legends, Battlefield, etc are going to require a good video card in order to fully utilize the ability of a 144hz monitor.",

Even at the overclocked 120hz faster movement causes everything to sort of just smear around. Up untill I started having issues with color I would of recommended this to anyone for professional work but since mine is defective after only a year and it will not be replaced by Acer I would not recommend this to anyone.",

Easily OC to 120 with no issues, no dead pixels, no real complaints at all. G sync is incredible, everything feels amazingly smooth. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking for an upgrade. 5/5, very pleased and truly impressed.",

As more support comes for 21:9 ultrawide my opinion may change. This monitor will overclock to 165hz but seems to lose some color accuracy, but really I can't tell a huge difference between 144 & 165 Tbh. I think 1440p is the best resolution for gaming right now and for me this monitor fit the bill.",
