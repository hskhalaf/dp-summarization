      "verdict": "Admirably sticky\u2014this is a rather fitting description for the Anasazi LV from Five Ten. Besides surface traction, however, the shoe also offers much in the areas of sensitivity and comfort. It is a force to be reckoned with in the edging department as well.That said, those who are inclined to get it must be willing to shell out a couple of bucks. Nonetheless, the Five Ten Anasazi LV has excellence written all over it, thanks to its set of climb-worthy characteristics.",

Apparently trying them on and standing up constituted as \u201cused\u201d and I only got a 50% refund after returning them for being too small. I neither climbed nor walked in them but they told me both shoes had dirt and scuff marks. Clearly I could not prove otherwise so it\u2019s my word against theirs and the \u201chouse\u201d always wins. So be sure of your shoe size before purchase.",

I was able to stick into tiny holds with confidence and did not notice any discomfort on the wall. Back on the ground, I did have to take them off between climbs, but that was well worth it!",

Pointy toe meant I can balance on tiny holds 3.) sticky rubber sole keeps me on the wall Cons: 1.) Small, even for a climbing shoe",
