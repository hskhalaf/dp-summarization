The sound quality is great, but they just break so easily. This pair didn't break but it is susceptible to static shocks in the ear. Whenever I wear fuzzy clothing with the earbuds in, or open a trash bag, it shocks my ear and it's a little painful. Also, it makes a electronic glitchy sound every 15 minutes or so, which is problematic especially when I'm trying to fall asleep. After going through about 5 Klipsch buds, I've had enough.",

Within three months, neither channel worked. The remote worked, but not the sound! Returns are impossibly hard once Amazon's window is closed. Though the warranty is for a year, Klipsch makes it impossible to return from their website. They direct you to the reseller. So, neither Klipsch or Amazon will help. Earbuds are so small that they are awkward to fit in the ear canal, and I've nearly lost a rubber bud in my ear canal. Can be painful to wear. They fall out easily.",

Recently, occasionally none of the buttons would worked, but I found if I take out, then replace the earphone jack, the buttons start working again...minor inconvenience.

First pair got shredded during a motorcycle trip, where i rode 4 hours in a torrential downpour through seattle, and when i got off the bike, I was so zonked that i tore them apart when yanking my helmet off. Second pair was lying underneath the bed when I Dyson'd 'em up. Neither the vacuum nor the earphones survived. The third pair I lost while out drinking.

Provided good sound and noise isolation (of course they are not noise cancelling) on a recent transatlantic flight, with my iPod as well as for the in-flight movies. Compared to my previous NuForce phones, they can play louder with less distortion. Good detail, good balance of bass, mid and high frequencies",

Also, the microphone placement made it so people only heard me when I held the microphone closer to my mouth, rather defeating the purpose. Perhaps I got a faulty model. I'm writing them next, and if they're willing to replace it, I'll change this review and note their quality customer service. EDIT: They replaced it for me, no questions asked. No hassle whatsoever. They even sent me a different model that had the microphone closer to the mouth so I'm changing the review from one star to four stars.",

First, the \"tangle-free\" cord adds a lot of noise whenever anything touches it. The cord is also really heavy which leads to the second problem. Second, the headphones never stay in my ear. I tried all the different attachments and nothing helped. Because the cord was heavy and the attachments much different than the older version, the headphones kept popping out. Third, the sound quality does not compare to the older version. The noise-isolation is near to non-existent possibly because of the second problem. Overall recommendation: don't buy it. If you want these headphones go for the older version.",

The sound on my old ones is better (to me atleast) and far more comfortable.",

Replacing them with the Comply TSX-100 Comfort PLUS tips made a major difference. The sound of the earphones won't knock your socks off and I don't think they're designed to. Their sound is clear, sharp, and balanced. I was able to hear instruments and notes in music that were not audible through the Apple earphones. Now available at less than half of comparable earphones, these are a great buy.",
