      "text": "These headphones really do shine. I compared them to Sennheiser 600, 598cs, and Shure 1540. The Sennheiser 600 has better sound but I wanted to completely eliminate ambient noise bleed, and they are open back [which is why they sound slightly better]. If I lived alone and had a quiet space I would choose the Senn600. The Shure 1540 was close but had a sharper sound where the Beyer was richer and punchier. I ran the sound thru a Fiio Mark 2 amp. 770s are comfy to wear for extended periods as well.",

You can find them anywhere on Amazon. I produce music and DJ, but use these to produce music & I'm happy with them. But if you're playing them loud, people can hear your music around you, just a note. The comfort is really good as well.",

In my opinion the 80ohm and 32 ohm model sound nothing like each other and I feel that those looking for mobile listening with the 3ft cable on the 32 ohm model are missing out on what could be amazing headphones. The lows aren\u2019t as prominent as the 80ohm model either which takes a lot of the excitement out of these headphones for me. The 80 ohms would be the perfect headset of that darn 10ft cable was detachable.",

BTW - Spotify has a dedicated playlist for putting cans through the test playlist \"the ultimate headphone test\"",

    "description": "Size:80 OHM| Color:GreyDT 770 STUDIO Headphones. The phrase Studio standard\" is thrown around far too often when describing recording gear. That phrase has never been more accurate than when describing the DT-770 by Beyerdynamic. Beyerdynamic invented the dynamic headphone 90 years ago, and the DT-770 has been a studio standard, closed-back headphone for over 30 of those years. The DT-770 is a tracking headphone. It has high isolation to keep what's playing in your headphone in your headphone and out of your microphones. The isolation is also to keep outside sounds out of your monitor mix. The huge bass and crispy highs are there to inspire your performance throughout every session. Since these are professional, handmade in Germany tools, every part including the headband, cable, and earpads can be replaced, ensuring a life-long investment. The only difference between the DT-770 STUDIO and the classic DT-770 is the name. This 80ohm, exclusive headphone is optimized for use in professional recording studios and hi-end recording gear. The word STUDIO has been added to drive the point home that this hi-impedance headphone belongs in the studio.",
