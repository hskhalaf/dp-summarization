If the programming pin springs out, you are stuck with the code it is on, not the one you wanted. It's really a 3 handed operation. I will be returning one. I like the way it looks and works with my luggage, but programming takes it down a notch from a 5 to 4.",

I suggest using a code which involves the more distinct numbers. 2. Setting the new combination is a two person operation (or was for us).",
