OK - I could live with an average product. BUT, then the zipper failed. I am sending it back. What a pain. It was not cheap either. You'd do much better buying a cheap Target, Walmart or Costco backpack.",

High quality, but the straps aren't anything special relative to the cool shaped straps like you find on modern backpacks. Buying this backpack is like buying a showroom new 1957 Chevy bel air. It looks spectacular and works just like cars did in the late 1950s - but not like the cars do now. If you are into retro cool, this is sooooo perfect for you. If you want a super awesome backpack thought out by crazy passionate engineers, buy an Ogio. For me, I bought both, and love both.",
