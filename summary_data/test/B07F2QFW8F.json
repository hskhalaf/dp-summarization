Tried other calming medications, including a prescription from my vet. Nothing worked. Further, she is very spoiled and won't eat just anything (not sure how she got that way ;) Anyway, got these calming treats with hemp oil and Pita is back to her confident self! They must taste pretty good, because she eats them with her regular food. Can't say enough good things about these treats. Thanks Steve and Gracie!",

So far I have not been disappointed, Stella is more calm and less prone to anxiety. Josie already has a lot of anxiety and these really helped her be able to chill out and not be so nervous all the time. I will be giving these to her daily with her food. Love the company and the mission! It feels good knowing everything I buy from pawsitive also goes to dogs in need. :)",
