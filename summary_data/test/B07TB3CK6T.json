Thankfully my husband had the tools(Allen wrenches that can turn in the space needed) to complete most of the assembly, what we are missing he will create from stuff around our home or buy at Wal-Mart (the chain repair and basket holder parts).",

Now everything is lighned up correctly. Is this a known issue. It took several hours to work the issue and make the fix. Can i get a spare chain for my efforts?",
