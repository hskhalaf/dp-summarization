Its very sturdy and supports the HP printer without any issue, weighing approx 4-5 pounds itself. The bottom has rubber feet that prevent sliding and scratching of the desk top. I purchased with the intent of only using the bottom half and honestly would love the option to buy without the top.",

However, It snaps together easily and serves its purpose well. I'm able to hold a redweld folder in each of the top sections without any bending, tipping, or other issues. The shelves on the bottom section hold a good amount of paperwork. It wobbles a little bit and doesn't sit entirely flat, but that's a hazard of a metal piece like this. It isn't a big enough problem for me to notice with regular use, though. Overall, it helps keep my desk significantly more organized. It's worth the price.",
