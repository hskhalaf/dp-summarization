The distinct mix of colors isn\u2019t something that\u2019s commonly seen in Puma\u2019s casual sneaker catalog which makes this a head turner. Its stretchy neoprene sleeve allows you to slip in and out of this shoe effortlessly, while your feet get cradled by a comfy sole. It comes right to size with a value that\u2019s a bang for the buck.",
