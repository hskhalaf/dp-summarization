Needed it for a bridal shower. It was 85 degrees and a light breeze. We made sure to use oil...actually added MORE oil after it decided to work for the first 2 minutes then it looked like a frozen over fountain you see in cold places....it just didn't work...and paying to return something that was 30$ just seems like more of a hassle than 20$ so it will be in my garage...in a box. Just look for another option.",

I used milk chocolate made for a fountain that I got at Walmart, see the picture above. The instructions say to use a 2 pound bag, but I ended up using a little more than that just so there was enough to make it flow nicely. As you can see in the picture, it turned out wonderful! Everyone loved it! It was hard not to make a mess though. But hey, it's fun! I will definitely be using it again! I would definitely suggest cleaning it while the chocolate is still melted, that was the hardest part!",

The base has a switch to keep the melted chocolate warm, it isn\u2019t strong enough to heat the bottom of the unit because the melted chocolate hardens in the base, causing it to be unable to funnel up and create the fountain effect. The melting chocolate I used is specifically for a chocolate fountain. The consistency is liquid enough to use in a fountain, however this is not a quality product and when I called customer service they were not helpful at all. Save your money!",

We had several hundred for the dance and as long as you have someone to keep filling this with melted chocolate, this thing will keep on trucking. We will likely order another one for next year, the little girls LOVED it! And the price is great!",

It worked pretty well for a few minutes, and then the chocolate started getting clumpy and the chocolate flow slowed. So, the heating element doesn't work. All in all--don't waste your money.

The top 1sr two tiers were covered but the larger bottoms ones took that amount of time to be covered. Not really an issue but more or a novice mistake.

Reading reviews everyone mentioned they used it for a particular size party but I didn\u2019t see any about how much chocolate to buy. I purchased 2 bags of chocolate through Amazon. That was not enough to make the chocolate stream down the fountain (like the picture). It more so dripped. I believe 3 bags would have done it.",

This is supposed to have a heater to keep chocolate or cheese warm so it will work. Heater did not work. Cheese got hard and clogged unit. Hard to try to scoop cheese out and place in small crock pot. Could not clean and had to throw entire fountain away. SAVE YOU MONEY AND TIME.... just buy a small crock pot and enjoy your day.",

After that, I crawled around the kitchen and checked under everything - no rotor. Very disappointed with this fountain, really hope that no one else has the same experience I did.",

I thought well I bought it for a birthday party it just has to work for one night. Too bad that it didn't make it. Two hours into the party, it just quit. I guess the motor overheated or blew up. It hasn't worked since.",

Also, machine looks cheap with letter already missing.",

We got chocolates from the hobby lobby and they melted up in the microwave really easily - the fountain did a great job keeping them liquidy. It was fantastic. Clean up was ok with some hot water and throwing the pieces in the dishwasher. I am very happy with this one and am considering buying one for home for fun on movie night. I was expecting a \"disposable\" product but was surprised by the quality. I didn't find it loud at all and it was simple to assemble.",

We've used it for parties that have around 30 people and have never had to refill it and always end up throwing some chocolate away.",
