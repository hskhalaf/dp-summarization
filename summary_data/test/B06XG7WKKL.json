Also, they stated that if we charge battery more then 3 hours, it wears down battery life faster. Keep in mind that wall holder for this vacuum automatically connects battery to charger on wall when stored so to avoid charging more then 3 hours we would have to store it off the storage unit. This is not very practical. A new battery is $129 so keep this in mind when buying an already pricey vacuum.",

Additionally, the stick wand is coming apart. I contacted Dyson and they are replacing it but its been a month so far and it still hasnt arrived...supposedly it will be here next week. So, in the meantime, my vacuum isnt very useable. Nothing they will do regarding the battery. I felt I needed to update my original review. For a $450 vacuum, it should last more than a year and half. Very disappointed. Cheaply made parts. July 2017 original review....Love this vacuum!! Amazing power for a cordless. Very convenient, easy to use.",

Just put new floors in and didn't realize for a while and have permanent scrapes. I've emailed back and forth and no resolution so far. VERY frustrating for a $450 vacuum that's 1 1/2 years old and gets used about once a week (low usage).",

      "text": "I heard great things only to be disappointed. I was told that this vacuum is great for people with pets. The first couple days it worked great. Now after having it for about 6 weeks, I\u2019m very disappointed. It seems to only work right when it\u2019s completely empty.. the tiniest bit of stuff in the compartment or any sort of resistance and the vacuum stops suctioning. We\u2019ve cleaned the filters, taken it all apart, cleaned the attachments. Nothing seems to work. I either got a defective vacuum or this vacuum isn\u2019t worth the money I spent. I\u2019ll be looking for a new vacuum this month",

Only way to vac anything up is to use it on max which kills battery life in 10-15 minutes (if you're lucky.) No hardwood floor attachments. The trap door design is garbage and when stored vertically, any debris you just vac'd up falls out. Attachments take time and precision to make up and is a bulky, unstreamlined design. I would never spend my money on Dyson again and am at the point where I actually hate this product. Happy to go back to corded for power and convenience of cleaning stuff up when I need to...not just when the battery is charged.",

Only reason it gets 4 stars is because you have to hold the button down the entire time your vacuuming. On the one hand this is nice because you can let go when you need to reposition or use a different attachment. On the other hand, it can cause your finger to cramp up.
