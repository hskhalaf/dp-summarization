I putt this together while he was sleeping, and he's had lots of fun playing with the firefighters and the truck. The design is really clever, and the set is beautifully detailed. My only complaint was a minor one, and at this price point, wasn't worth deducting a star, but the stickers are really tough to put on accurately. Printed bricks would be much easier, but I suspect that would make the set much more expensive.",
