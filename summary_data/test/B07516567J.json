That's when i found this cream. It really does its purpose to keep my beard in shape, keeps its moisturized so that I don't scratch my beard these days. And its made 100% organic, so its safe to use.

My beard feels softer, more tamable, the balm itself is very easy to apply, and actually smells rather good. Even as a 'beginner' in terms of keeping my beard well groomed and nice, this balm has made it significantly easier to work with. Absolutely recommend.",
