The kicker was that the procedure would cost well over $1500. I decided to try out this product because of the reviews and recommendation from our vet. THEY WORK! After almost a month of a single chew daily we are seeing a huge improvement in our dogs dental health. We are going to just include a single chew daily to prevent any further issues.

He doesn't know they are for oral hygiene. :-) However, there are virtually never the advertised number of chew sticks in a bag. There are never more. The vast majority of bags have fewer. This unacceptable. The bags might have the advertised weight. However, who gives their dog(s) chew sticks by weight? We give our dog, Sebastian, 3 chew sticks a day. That's why it's obvious to us that the claim of 30 sticks is false. Virbac needs to address this issue. Otherwise we'll look for suitable substitute.",
