      "text": "These boots fit perfectly on my 22lbs maltipoo, I ordered size two which I roughly guessed on. We had an incident where the recent cold weather/salt did not go well with his paws. I will no longer have to worry about his paws being torn up due to weather. The inside is very soft, its sort of furry. This is my pet's first pair of shoes EVER. He was of course walking funny at first but went on his first walk after which made him a pro. My only con is that you can see where glue was used which I don't really care as long as comfort is there.",

I would highly recommend these dog boots!!",

They fit great, super easy to get on and have 2 velcro straps at the top to fit the boot snug around the leg so it won't come off. We are from California transfered to Pennsylvania and I was worried about the large salt chunks they put everywhere cutting his paws and I wanted to continue the long walks without fear of damage to his feet or injury due to slipping. It took about 5 minutes for him to get comfortable at first use but after that he was running and playing like normal. Great product at a great price. I would recommend these boots to anyone.",

In order for the boots not to slide off they have to be cinched down quite a bit and I\u2019ve noticed after some hikes my dogs see claw pad is a little rubbed and tender. The other is that the Velcro\u2019s straps are a little longer than they really need to be which makes them much easier to unvelcro. Overall they\u2019ve held up well to snowshoe holes, groomed snow trail hikes, walks in rain and mud and many other walks we could think to challenge them to. They seem to actually be waterproof which is a huge plus",

      "text": "Updated after more experience: Purchased size 7 for large Labrador mix to protect bandage on foot in ice/snow outdoor conditions.. Tight fit, but should be OK once bandage is removed. Nice features are two Velcro securing straps and pleated expansion to ease putting on and off. Bottom grip on ice is good. Would like to have these extend higher up, perhaps another inch, with appropriate securing strap to better keep snow out. After removing bandage and more experience: inside material does take up moisture, needs to be dried out between uses. Without bump of bandage, slips off more easily while walking - so taller material with higher strap would be much better.",

She wore them in the forest on some rocky terrain and they held up great. They stayed on securely with no issues. Her paws were protected, and the boots didn't hinder her movement. She was able to run, leap, and even dig with her bootsies on. She managed to step on a prickly pear cactus at one point, I was so worried that her paws were injured, but the needles didn't go through the boots! So happy she was wearing them!

I do wish there was more velcour on the bottom strap. And the toe area where his nails are was more reinforced. He has worn a hole in the end of one of them. Perfect for a dog that just needs for daily walks. Expect to buy more if your dog has to use them to run in the yard. We are ordering our second pair 5 months later. I still give 4 stars for staying on.",

Not only does it keep him from burning his paws on the sidewalk in the hot summer, his paws look healthier since he started wearing them outside. They are much softer and smoother. I hardly have to use Shea butter on them at all anymore! Definitely worth purchasing!",

He had them on for 5 hours. I would highly recommend them. He is a terrier mix and weights 28 pounds. They are a great find for your dog!!",
