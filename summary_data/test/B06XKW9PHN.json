      "text": "These are great shoes. I been wearing Machomai for a while now but couldn't find my size so I grabbed these and I WILL NEVER GO BACK. These are great looking, light, comfortable and really anchor you to the floor. They'll improve your balance and you'll find power you never knew you had. They're really spectacular. The fit is a little tricky. I was a 10 in machomai so I ordered a ten in these and they were too big, mostly too long. I sent them back for a 9.5 and they're perfect without socks, which is my preference. The strap is long so you have to tweak it a little.",

I\u2019m going to order a pair of adidas to see if I have any better luck !",

But all things aside they fit good and look even better.",
