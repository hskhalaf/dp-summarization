So comfortable and even if it may be childish (hehe :P) I love the elephant lining! Something about the way these fit help keep those tiny socks in place, whereas in other shoes I'm constantly stopping to pull them up. I did waterproof spray these to help keep them looking nice longer, and fair warning: when you do that, it does darken the suede some. But I still love them!",

I also noticed the seam on one of the moccasins wasn't sewed properly when I took them out of the box but I didn't feel like returning them so I kept them. However, a couple of days ago I noticed the sole has started to come apart. I love UGGs for their comfort and so I thought quality. The quality on the shoes was disappointing. Not sure if it's because I got them Amazon but I would definitely be wary in the future.",
