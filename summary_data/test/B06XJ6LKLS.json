      "text": "Honestly, I have to rely on Consumer Reports for purchases like this. With SOOOOO many brands and models to choose from, it is super tough to make an educated choice just by shopping the local stores. And just spending more and getting the supposedly \"better\" model isn't always the way to go..........some super pricey models don't perform as nicely as the more reasonable models many times. LG is a great brand and has a very good history as a very reliable brand as well. All I can tell you is that this 65 inch TV leaves me almost speechless sometimes.............the UHD/4K picture blows me away!!!",

I've had fun trying out various settings. The apps (Amazon, Netflix, etc) seem to work great. I don't notice any of the motion blur which has bothered me with previous LED TV sets. It's still new, but so far I have zero complaints and all the comparable TV's at this quality level seem to cost at least $200-300 more.",
