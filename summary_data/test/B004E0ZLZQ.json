However, to connect them seamlessly, you should follow this order 1. keep speakers off 2. turn on bluetooth on sending device 3. turn on soundfreq 4. connect on sending device One time, out of the many times I have used it in several months, it did not want to connect to my phone. I turned it off many times and turned it back on to connect and it worked. The sound is incredible, but I do not know if it's worth the value if you are just needing a decent sounding device. It's not a high end one, but it is quality sounding and aesthetically appealing.",

Of the many speaker docks I have purchased this one has the best sound and options. From the i-dock to the remote door, ambient light, and fantastic sound output as well as the range of the Bluetooth...all around great value. Bought mine refurbed from amazon warehouse but looked brand new (and paid $84 shipped). If you are looking for a great home speaker, Bluetooth dock, give this a try!

We've synced via bluetooth and played music from two iPads, an iPhone, and a Mac Pro with no problems or difference in sound. The included remote is pretty cool, but the downloadable app that can do those same functions is way cooler. I'd say that the sound quality is just below that of the Bose system, and for the price, I'd buy it again if it were stolen or lost (no, you can't come steal it).",

It gets pretty darn loud without any kind of distortion. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to play music from their iPod/laptop.",
