      "text": "It\u2019s a lovely wooden rocker. Easily put it together in 30 minutes or so. The wood is solid and soft (no need for sanding), not at all cheap or flimsy feeling. Has a light scent of stain but not a bad one like some of the furniture I\u2019ve recently purchased for the nursery which took days to air out. It\u2019s quite comfortable even without a cushion. I\u2019m 5\u20192 and 9 months pregnant, my husband is 6\u20190 and 180 lbs, and we both found the chair comfortable and supportive. I\u2019m considering buying another one for the 2nd floor.",
