      "text": "I'm surprised by the variety of bad experiences some have had with this printer as it's worked like a charm for my family and me for almost 4 years now. I use the duplexer attachment, and refill the cartridges by syringe with bulk ink by Inktec or Stratitec, so it's almost printing for free. A half liter bottle for $25 will last nearly forever! The Fast Normal setting does great quality, so speed is not a problem. The paper never jams. The fax is so easy to use. It's wonderful to have a home photocopier, b/w or color. Maybe HP doesn't make them as good as this anymore, but in my opinion they hit a home run on this model.",

Only drawback I see is that the ink cartridges are freaking small, so I doubt they'll last very long. Seems to be a better printer than dad's G95 printer which I thought would be hard to beat. Also is cool you can feed it one envelope for addressing through a special slot for fast printing (have to remove paper for multiple envelopes)",

I didn't have a digital copier at all before so it's still nice to have. I have sent a fax, printed in color, scanned and copied from the document feeder. Also, you will have to buy a duplexer if you want it to copy on both sides and I think they are $80-100. That was an unpleasant surprise as well. Since it is cheap it is a pretty good deal but I really thought it was going to be sooo fast and it's just not.",

I'm no employee of HP, just a happy amateur photographer who is thrilled to have one unit doing both office and hobby work with no compromise in quality at an economical price.

      "text": "I bought one of these thinking the automatic feeder would save me loads of time. Now instead of minutes it takes hours. HP's tech support's only advise was to buy more equipment and to reboot my computer. I thought they realized we outgrew that trick 10 years ago. When I tell the machine to read from the feeder it reads from the flatbed and vise versa. Don't spend your money on this untested product. The only nice thing I can say about this product is that if you can keep it working for more than 1.4 minutes it can print four pages on one sheet of paper.",
