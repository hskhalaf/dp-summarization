      "text": "I was hesitant to purchase a grill cover on Amazon after the last one was basically a nylon tent, that covered my grill fine, but would tear very easily. This grill cover has a thick high quality material, Velcro closure, and I knew just from the handy storage bag it came with this was a well designed cover. Through windy storms it has stayed in tact and in place. Easy on and off by one person only (some are so fidgety you need two people like making king size bed) Very happy with this cover so far! Once it survives through the winter months I will give it 5 stars!!",

The extra weight also resists the wind blowing it off. Negatives: it's built slightly too long for the grill height so it drags the floor when moving the grill with the cover on, and the velcro straps are too close together so it doesn't cinch the bottom as well as it should. Still recommended though.",
