The grill, which is suspended from the mid-point of the tripod, can be raised or lowered with one hand to regulate temperature. Another nice thing about this is you can cook right on the grill or use the grill surface to hold a pot or pan. We also tried using it to hang a lantern - which was very effective. This is a clever product, inexpensive, lightweight and disassembles to be compact.",

Not a 5 star product cause I compared it to the homemade steel one my father had growing up. This is not that unit but a good product for the $$. Coghlan's makes decent camping equipment but don't expect ultimate durabiity with this unit.",

During the first use, the fire (which was kept low) melted the bungee at the top of two of the legs. Now it just falls apart if you try to move it.

The only thing I would advise about is that sometimes based on how the clips sit on the grill, your food can tip the entire grilling surface over and your food will land in the fire. I think they should make the clips stationary because once it's over the fire, the whole thing gets so hot that you can't touch it without burning yourself. The next time we camp, we are bringing oven mitts and a way to keep the clips from sliding around the grill.",

My wife made one from some fabric from the store. Seriously though, you can't beat cooking on one of these. Raise and lower to the exact heat you want, works on uneven terrain and you can spin it for a rotisserie effect. Anytime I cam with people and they see this they love it (except for the gas grilling people but they aren't real campers anyways). P.S. The poles snap together because of the bungee cords inside of them much like a tent pole.",

The poles are kept together via a bungie cord (similar to tent poles), which makes absolutely no sense for this product, considering it is using near a heat source, which will cause the bungie cords to \"melt\" and malfunction. Once this occurred, the poles would not stay together when moving the grill and would require the use of thick gloves to handle the hot metal and put back together. I do not recommend this grill and unfortunately, I am already past the return window, so I cannot return this product.
