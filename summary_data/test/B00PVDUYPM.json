      "text": "This water sensor worked exactly as advertised and by following the directions exactly (hard for a guy!) the setup process was straightforward and free of issues. Recommend initial setup and testing near your wi-fi router to ensure everything works before moving it to a more distant location. If you have issues once it's moved, you probably have gone beyond reliable wi-fi range and thus might need a signal booster. The audible alarm is rather anemic but since I located it in a crawl space, I wouldn't be able to hear it anyway. During testing, It took about a minute from the first detection of water for the email message to appear on my phone.",

I've returned it and will wait for the Roost device to come out. I'm beat.",
