Once done, the tapered edges of the peel let me slide the cooked pizza back on and carry it inside. It's nice thick wood so it's very sturdy, and it wiped clean easily. It's such a pretty piece of wood as is shown in the advertisement, I'm just looking for a place to hang it when not in use. In a drawer or cabinet would be such a waste.",

The most important thing for me is that the wood surface is too rough to be able to make a fresh pizza crust on and slide onto a stone, the poor sanding job leaves rough spots that grab and tear the fresh dough as you try to remove it especially in a tight oven. Maybe more flour would help but I don't want to end up with a pile of flour in my oven either.",

As a man with average size hands, I found that the grip/handle on it is just a little too wide, making it really uncomfortable to hold and difficult to maneuver. Unless i think of a better solution, I plan to sand down the grip area by 1/4-1/2 inch on each side.",

      "text": "The Heritage pizza peel was well packaged, probably by a wonderful team of white gloved people, and delivered to me in the timely manner I requested at order. I may be crazy but I think I saw a few unicorns flying in the sky over my home the day it was delivered. It is a very attractive piece of wood and we can't wait to use it for pizza when we make it tonight. Thank you for such a great product. EAB",

I'm glad I was using a ready made crust as opposed to fresh dough. That would've been a nightmare. I think I'm going to look for a metal peel to replace it.",

I was particularly interested to see whether or not the pizza dough would slide off the peel (with cornmeal sprinkled on it) and onto the heated stone in our oven. Voila! It slid off smoothly and completely. It was beautiful. I am delighted with this peel. It's a good size, not too heavy, beautifully grained, has nicely tapered edges, and most importantly - it does it's intended job very well. It has it all - excellent form and function. I heartily recommend this one.",
