I've not lost data now for 2 years and going strong. I also like the easy backup with the USB ports. You can hook in an external drive and setup automated, incremental backups. Easy and free that step of your mind. Will buy Synology for the rest of my life. Also Synology support is very good! They help you right away and are friendly.",

As the 5-bay model would only allow for 3 bays to be used, and I prefer RAID 6, well, testing confirmed I needed more bays - hence the DS1813+. Performance is great for the price point. Sure, for 100x the cost, I could get a 3Par and get 10x the performance (have one at work) - but, then I'd have to feed the 3Par all that power and tolerate all the noise and heat. Contrast, this box is nearly dead silent and eats very little power.",

If you are lucky someone will get back with you. I never got my issue resolved and I don\u2019t think Synology support team cared. They just send me an email how sorry they were.
