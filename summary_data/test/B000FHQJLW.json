The screws, for example, are a struggle to insert into holes in the \"wood\" pieces. And the toy drill gun didn't help either. My daughter used the toy hammer to bang on things around the house, but that was it. What we thought would be a fun birthday present ended up being a complete dud. We promptly returned.

You can still use the drill to screw the screws into the table itself so that they still get to feel like they are drilling.",

Great buy at a much cheaper price than many of the other brands names of construction sets.",

My only complaint is that the battery powered drill seems a bit inconsistent. It would spin fine at times, and then all of a sudden seem like it is out of power,....and then get powered up again. I'm not sure if this has to do with the wiring inside the drill, but it seems a bit cheap. Other than the drill, everything else is well made and fun for my son.",
