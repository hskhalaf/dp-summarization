But i didn't swim in it so.... Now the size...i would say it is true to size. Perhaps they changed the fit based upon some reviews. The fabric is comfy...and mine survived florida sun for several days without fading and i didnt burn so that covers some of it. Hmmm perhaps the fading everyone mentioned has something to do with swimming in it? To fill the pockets with water? But i digress....GREAT PRODUCT.",

Feels and looks great. It may be too hot for me to wear it on the beach in 95 degree Florida summer-heat, but the rest of the year, it will look great and protect my skin, too.",
