      "text": "I had one of these cameras for several years. Then it was water-damaged. Since it's a discontinued model, I bought an identical used camera from Amazon.com. These cameras are much better than any of the newer \"equivalent\" models. The current models brag nonsense such as, \"Bigger LCD Screen!\" Who cares? The new cameras don't have a viewfinder, which is essential if the sun is shining on the LCD screen. I find many products that are new aren't as good as what they've replaced. This is an example.",

After purchasing it at the price amazon was offering and using it I can say overall I am very satisfied with my choice. It produces really clear pictures, it's very easy to use, takes pictures fast, and it's size makes it easy to carry with you. Granted, I wasn't looking for a camera to turn out professional level shots, just casual ones, and it has met my expectations. Though I haven't had it for that long, so I can't attest to it's durability. Otherwise, I am very happy with this purchase.",

It took excellent shots indoors and outdoors in all kinds of conditions.

The previous powershot was also heavier, metal, and made in Japan. This model is lighter, plastic, and made in China. While I like the lighter feel to it, I hope it holds up over time. If not, it might be my last PowerShot. If it holds up and I figure out the blur problem, I will definitely continue to buy PowerShots.",

I am getting so many blurry photos, it's not worth keeping anymore. I have tried all the suggestions mentioned with no luck. Not sure what the problem is. Tonight was the final straw. I was at a school musical, took about 10 pictures, 8 were blurry. Took two shots with my video camera which was at a much lower resolution, and the pics were awesome!! I tried, I'm done!",

Features are great, and picture quality thus far seems excellent. A nice feature is the pre-programed settings for various situations (e.g. beach, kids with all their motion, night scenes, etc.). Our only complaint is that the rechargable battery life is not a good as our old Canon which took either rechargable or regular AA's. The solution is probably to get another battery, so we've always got a fully charged one on hand. Other than this one issue, I'd recommend this model highly.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD1200IS 10 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Dark Gray)",

Special scene modes Include foliage, snow, beach, sunset, fireworks, aquarium, kids and pets, indoor and more so you can choose the optimum setting for your shot. Face detection technology Isolates subjects in-frame and optimizes conditions for the best pictures of friends and family.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nWhen a camera puts a smile on your face the moment you hold it, imagine how great you\u2019ll feel when you see your first pictures! The PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH has everything going for it--exuberant color, the sculptured style of Canon\u2019s famed ELPH series--and the innovative know-how that takes you to a whole new level of picture-taking accomplishment. Fun, smart and a style that follows you everywhere. \n\nPowerShot SD1200 IS Highlights \n\n10.0-megapixel resolution makes it a breeze to print large size images\n\n\nWith the PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 10.0-megapixel camera lets you create impressive, large photos of family and friends you\u2019ll be proud display. The high-resolution images taken by the SD1200 IS Digital ELPH can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches. \n\nThe PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nLarge, crisp 2.5-inch PureColor LCD II and wide viewing angle\nThe PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 2.5-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light--a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 17 Shooting Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nThe DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2) The PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. 3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SD1200 IS Digital ELPH body \n * Lithium-ion battery pack (NB-6L) \n * Battery charger (CB-2LY) \n * Wrist strap (WS-DC7) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
