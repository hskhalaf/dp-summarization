I figured that more weight means more stainless steel and better quality. I am completely satisfied with this unit. I use less coffee beans now and get 1-1/2 times more to savor in the morning! The aroma reminds me of my grandmother's house from years ago. The Intenca makes the best coffee I've had, Period.",

The seal between the lower chamber and the upper pot could be better, as it requires a fair bit of force to snug things down such that they don't leak steam. Enough so that my wife will probably not be able to use it without me there to snug it down. Beyond that it works very well, and I'm pleased with the performance.",

After trying several different brands we got the bonVIVO device. So far I'm satisfied, the product looks and feels solid and reliable, performs as expected. Doesn't spill anything no matter how fast you pour. Can't say anything about the quality of the resulting coffee as it is quite the same as every other machine brew. I would recommend it for sure.",
