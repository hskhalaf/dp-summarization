Type in the model number, look at the owner's manual, You'll have to scroll way down to specifications. Check the ohms rating of your speakers. Are they 8 or 6? I use it mostly for music and it sounds great. Yeah, they advertise 185 watt for the wow factor and it grabs your attention.",

It might be that it just needs to be updated as I have not hooked it up to the internet and check for software/firmware updates. I will put in a better review after I've had a chance to play with it a bit more.",

I'm disappointed because I did not look for a pre amp out because I assumed denon would always incorporate this on any line of they're receivers. So because of this I cannot run another amp to get decent power to my speakers. I am running klipsch towers in front, center and 3 way surrounds. These are exceptionally good speakers for home theatre. I have to turn the receiver to almost 80% volume to hear them decently for a movie and this receiver still does not deliver the quality sound I need... Very unhappy",
