I'm sure it took a while to saw through two of them, but it sure didn't stop them.",

I picked it easily with a thing I had but I won't tell you what because the crooks will try to do the same. -2 stars, I hope the fix this lock issue and the new customers will get a well made 5 star item.

There is some hitch, not smoothly locking or releasing, with locking the newer one with the key. Unfortunately I can't return as I just missed the return window.

All 3 pistol grip keys (can't be duplicated at True Value) fit well and operate smoothly. I sprayed the lock and the sliding mechanism with silicone spray. It locks without a key by pressing in the brass lock cylinder. The weather cap (not shown) is just OK. I imagine it will soon break and need to be replaced with a rubber crutch tip.",

That said, if you have a locking lug or something like that, this can be a great theft deterrent for your camper, boat trailer, toy hauler, etc. The bright color makes this thing very obvious, even tucked under the trailer. Also, the locking mechanism is unusual, which makes it much more difficult to pick or force... Worth the money.",
