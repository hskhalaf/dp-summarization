This Founder has confidence in his product and appreciation for his customers. The funnel is fabulous eliminating the mess of filling the bags. Testing the first 15 bags with water, no leaks. The next 12 with a yogurt mix, no leaks. So what do I say now?? Frotabulous! I have no doubt I will order more before this summer is over! Thank you Abe!",

It's a way to also give your children a sweet treat that isn't full of dyes, syrups and other ingredients that aren't conducive to maintaining a healthy balance.

I suppose there may be user malfunction to an extant due to sticking the bag in the mouth instead of pushing the ice out and biting it off, but it still hurts. Using scissors to round the edges takes care of the problem and makes opening the bag easier as well. 5 stars if they change the design to rounded corners.",

I wish it was a little sturdier, like the store bought ice pops. It also helps if you cut the top off when you\u2019re ready to eat them. Even though there is a zipper top, this helps to keep it open. The zipper top tends to snap shut as you\u2019re trying to eat it if you don\u2019t cut this off.

I only have one suggestion / request for the manufacturer: have you exlored making these out of biodegradable material instead of plastic? I love these, so not complaining!

They are great when I come inside after being out the hot Texas heat.",

May work better with Sangria since there will be fruit juice to help them set. They were a big hit and I will be doing more flavors once it warms up again.
