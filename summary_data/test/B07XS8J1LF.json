Battery is just superb, did my first charge after over a week of extensive use. I even use it for my calls! I would highly recommend this watch over the android ones, the only downside is that this watch only works with apple otherwise all the android users would have been wearing this!",

This is a big selling point for the series 5 so to not have it working was a big let down. Tried installing again and updating but no luck. After jumping through hoops I was able to return the watch for a refund. Even if it had worked properly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive upgrade from the original Apple Watch and certainly not from series 4. Perhaps series 6 will have more to offer.
