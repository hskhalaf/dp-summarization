But in fact you will need tons of paper roll or cloth to clean it up. And you may have to trim most of the remaining hair on the body.

After putting on enough to leave the whole area white in cream & can see some of the hair sticking out, leaving on for 8 minutes & then removing before any burns occur, it never takes all the hair off still. I get left with the roots so passing my hand over it feels like I'm rubbing my chin one or 2 days after not shaving. Still better than getting razor bumps but can anyone tell me how much I should put on to remove all the hair, including the roots?",

Took anywhere from 5-7 mins to actually get my hair removed because whatever reason mine is pretty tough and didn\u2019t want to let go. Nonetheless, afterwards when I was done I took a shower to wash off the excess and my legs were completely clean! Even after growing back I never developed razor bumps or in grown hairs maybe one?

It did not work as intended. So I then decided to trim first, and then apply the product. Even then I had to apply the product two days in a row to get the results I wanted. This leads me to believe this product is intended to maintain a bald body, as opposed to getting there.",
