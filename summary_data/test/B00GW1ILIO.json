      "text": "Great deal! Instead of spending $30 for a replacement tire for my son's $100 balance bike, I just bought this brand new bike for $45. The tires are more of a strong foam than a rubber tire. That means less maintenance but probably less traction. Since my 3 & 4 year old kids can only go so fast this had never been an issue. It feels kind of cheap but even if it only lasts a few years that is all I really need it for. Overall it is a very good deal. I highly recommend it.",

Now he cruises the sidewalks in the neighborhood, going so fast I have to run to keep up. I wonder if he'll even need training wheels when we switch to a pedal bike...",

He throws it down a lot when hopping off and the handles have held up really well. I also thought the tires not being real tubes would be a problem, but it's been just the opposite. They have held up well too. He has ridden it now for about 6 months and is fully ready for a bike with peddles. He learned much quicker than our other children that used training wheels.",
