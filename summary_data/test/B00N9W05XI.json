I will have to try and super glue this as I do not have time to break in a new pair of boots before my trip. I am very disappointed in what I thought was a high quality pair of boots that have begun to fall apart after 3 weeks of light to medium use.",

Considering I bought these a few months back and have been in flip flops most of the summer, I was a bit ticked off when I pulled these out for camping this past weekend and noticed the issue. Now, the peeling is not terrible -yet- but we all know the downward spiral on shoes once a seam or stitch separates.",

The break-in period (in my experience) was pretty much out-of-the-box-and-on-the-trail; it really was that quick. They sort of remind me of Nam web boots in weight, but are as tough as leather boots with rubber Vibram soles. Very happy with these boots.",

I am now looking for other opportunities to wear them because they are really comfortable shoes. The lacing system allows practically infinite flexibility with regard to how tight you want to lace the ankles. I will buy another pair of Salomons when the time comes, but that might not be for a while - these are very light but industrial strength!",

Also, the upper is stiff compared to their other models; I've got about a hundred miles of hiking on these, and it still feels like my ankle is fighting for proper movement.

Excellent support, warm (it was under 40* and raining), and I ended the excursion with no blisters. I would have stopped much sooner if I'd started having problems but these boots never made it an issue. Fit was right. I'm usually a 10 in boots and these were perfect. Very well done... I hope they hold up to Alaska.",

      "text": "So far so good.. I've done a 3 or 4 day hikes with these. They have held up to rock, wet grass, muddy trails, and boggy stream bottoms. They didn't take too long to break in, and were pretty comfortable right out of the box. At first I had them laced up too tight which fatigued my feet, but after breaking in and loosening they fit perfectly. The shoe laces could be just a tad longer. I like how the rubber extends all the way over the toe, this should make them last much longer and keep rubber from separating like I have had happen on other hiking shoes.",

They run on the narrow side, the right foot fit perfect, and the left foot just could not get comfortable. I would have given them a five, if my foot was the problem, but it was the outer side seam in the shoe. Even with two pairs of socks it was still prominant, and quite irritating. I ended up purchasing a pair of Renegade Lowa boots; I am quite pleased with those, but if ths Solomons fit properly they would have been my first choice.",

They are still very new as of this writing, but it seems like they will break in and soften up where the foot naturally flexes, but even without being broken in they are extremely comfortable. Also much lighter than I would have guessed from their appearance. Easily can be worn all day and for extended periods. Great support inside with the specialized insole and molds very well to the foot, especially the heel area. There is no slipping and they feel very much like a glove. I highly recommend these!",
