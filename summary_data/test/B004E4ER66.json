When used according to directions, coals would not stay lit even with more lighter fuel than should be necessary. It is also unsafe, my husband singed the hair on his arm while using it according to the directions. I'm very unhappy with the item and would return it in a heartbeat except the window of return expired before we had the opportunity to try the product. I will write to the company to express my feelings as this is not typical for a Coleman product.",
