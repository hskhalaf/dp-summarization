On three other occasions it worked intermittently and provided inaccurate yardage. I have updated the software but results did not improve. I would like to have this unit replaced or my money refunded. The performance is unacceptable. W H Smith W H Smith",

      "text": "I live in Wisconsin so we don't get to golf year round. So this watch was used about 10 months total (in two years of owning it). The battery does not last more than 2 years. The battery starts degrading quickly. Toward the end of the second year of owning this watch it would run out of a charge before a 4 hour round was up (after being fully charged). Too expensive for such a short life. And after watching a video on \"How to replace the battery\" I decided that was not worth my time and money and moved onto a different brand (Bushnell). Will not buy Garmin brand again.",

When I compare the distances the S2 gives with my a smart phone app or someone elses GPS or the markers on the course, it's very accurate. Free lifetime updates is a big deal for me and Garmin provides that. It's easy to do.",

Two of my golfing partners have GPS.. first a Garmin hand held and the other a Golf Buddy hand held and distances are within feet of each other...only I don't have to put mine back on the cart or in the bag! Extremely handy and ready to use. Very easy to read and with the exception of distances to a particular hazard, it is very functional. Worked great right out of the box, but if you want the latest updates, you must have Visio or later Microsoft software on your pc. All in all a great buy..",
