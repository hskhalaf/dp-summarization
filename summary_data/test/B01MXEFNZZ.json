The shoe may not have the latest in Asics\u2019 technology, but it does not scrimp on comfort or durability. It is a sturdy daily trainer that has sufficient arch support, security, and midsole resilience that will allow the runner to tack on the miles.",

        "Several users claimed that they were able to stay up on their feet for long hours while wearing the 4th instalment of the Gel Flux",

        "The price is considered by many as well worth the shoe\u2019s performance",
        "The large, open mesh provides a very breathable coverage",
        "Asics uses a plush interior for a cozy feel with every run",

      "text": "I have had five pairs of gel-flux shoes, from the original through gel-flux four, with this being my second pair of gel-flux four. Except for this pair, all have fit perfectly according to size. These are a little tight in the fore foot area. I'm hoping they will stretch a little as they break in. The gel flux is the best shoe I've found to counteract the effect of under pronation. Also, as an aside, I've been getting a little over 700 miles on a pair of gel-flux. But the g-f 4s prior to this pair were worn out at 450 miles. The sole on the gf4 is radically different from the prior models.",

I have fairly average wide feet and i have to really tie these shoes down to keep my feet from sliding around. Also, I have logged about 25 miles on them so far, and they are impossible to break in. The sole has a toe arch support that just slides around and ultimately numbs your balls of your feet to a point you cant run anymore.",
