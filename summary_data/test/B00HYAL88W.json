From the lightweight camera body to fast, smaller lenses very well made out of metal I have never been more pleased with my natural looking images. Fuji has a way of determining color, and unlike the constant need in canon to rework my RAW images....these are natural and look so much nicer right out of the box.",

It is awesome to be able to quickly flip through shutter speeds, iso's, and aperatures (on the lens, not body), without having to go into 462 different submenus like on so many digital cameras these days. I have it paired with the fuji 35mm f/1.4, and I couldn't be happier with the combo",

The fuji XT-1 makes photography fun again, the first digital camera that bring back the passion of photography. Good in low light, very good easy to access manual controls. Fuji is always updating the firmware making a great camera even better. The 32,000 electronic shutter speed is very useful. This is a Cannon or Nikon DSLR killer. Fare lighting and smaller. has incredibly great out of camera JPG and RAW imagery. All the Fuji XF glass has awesome IQ, including the lense that comes with the camera, no junk lenses.",

The camera is not set up for sports with the electronic viewfinder but handles all other tasks with ease. The Xtran sensor puts out great jpg from the camera and the continued firmware upgrades absolutely sell the camera. The firmware (4th major upgrade) have completely changed the auto focus for the better and have added features. Canon and Nikon take note..... Not quite a replacement for a full frame DSLR in my book but REALLY close. Very have with the camera and lens!",

What a nifty little camera. Plcture quality outstanding. Great dynamic range and detail. Accurate color. Easy to adjust settings, even in auto mode. The 18-55mm kit lens is way more than any kit lens can expect to be. I upgraded firmware on both body and lens from Fujifilm site. Easy job. Purchased Rico Pfirstinger's book on the X-T1 and I'm off on a journey to learn how to get best results here. Highly recommended., A YUGE bargain on close-out now because of the new X-T2.",

A few strips of gaffers tape makes this camera nearly invisible, making it ideal for travel to unpredictable parts of the world.

I'm confident in the weather sealing, love the EVF and manual controls. After using an EVF versus an Optical viewfinder, I'm in love with what you can do (focus peaking, info, preview, over-bright, etc.). Excellent lens lineup (I own the 18-135mm WR, 56mm, 35mm WR) If I had to slight the package, I would only say that the Fuji XF lens lineup is missing two things: 56mm with weather sealing and a 70-200 f/2.8 (I'm aware of the 50-140, but would like the longer reach).",

I wanted a camera that was beautiful and rugged like the Pentax, but with a smaller form factor. The X-T1 fits that bill perfectly. It's hard to describe, but after using it for a few weeks (with the 35 1.4 lens), it just feels *right* in the hands. It's also quite the conversation piece with its retro stylings.

Feels right, works well, and is a joy to use. For the price, it has to be one of the best bargains out there for the serious photographer.

Now the aperture ring can be turned with a little resistance and it stays in place. Next time I buy a Fuji lens with an aperture ring, I will test it first.

All the control and all the quality in a scale the is much more usable. I'm very happy with the quality. If you are looking for a very high megapixel camera in the 20s, then you might want to reevaluate what makes an amazing picture.",

The pictures are great straight from the camera (better than D600 in many cases and never worse (ok, with very high ISO it is worse)). Only negative is the exposure compensation button that can too easily be changed accidentally. The \"kit\" lens is also very good!",

Unfortunately, the Zoom Playback dial (rear command wheel) worked for a week and then stopped working at all, so back it went. I didn't care about the light leak problems, but this defect made my camera nonfunctional since, in addition to zoom playback, this wheel also controls , among other things depending on how you have the dial configured in camera setup, intermediate shutter speeds. Anyway, I will probably reorder it, but I may wait awhile to see what comes out as the new X Pro2 first. Bummer.",
