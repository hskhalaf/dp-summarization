I was already pretty happy with the simple chair design, the awesome tray design, and the modern fabric pattern, but the fact that it was truly stain resistant made my day.

This is such a great alternative to a full size high chair, which I found to be large, awkward and hard to clean. The buckles to secure the baby are genius. No more trying to bend her arms to fit through the straps. At first I didn't like that it takes two hands to remove the tray but found it was not a problem as the straps keep her secure till I put the tray down and remove her. My chairs have a padded seat and I made a pad to put over that which I can put through the washer. Great product.",

Buckles in easy and the whole tray detaches which is nice if they\u2019re finished, but want to continue sitting with you. Only downfall is the tray doesn\u2019t have an inner tray that pops in and out like others so you have to take the whole tray portion to the sink to wash.",

I have been using it daily and have few complaints. My only issues with this is that it's not easy to clean. The tray just spreads food around and difficult to catch on your wet/dry towel. Secondly, we're feeding my kid a mix of lumpy to pureed foods and once it falls onto the straps, it's takes at least a couple of tries to get it clean/white again. Overall, I really like this high chair.",

      "text": "This is such a great highchair especially if you are limited on space in the kitchen. It was so easy to put together, maybe 5 minutes if that. It's really easy to clean too, and works for any dinning chair and table. My daughter is two and we are using it as a toddler booster seat. I love how high it can go up so she can be sitting at our height. When my son is ready to start eating I might have to get one for him. I forgot to mention it's so light weight and easy to travel with.",
