The LED indicator on the front of the unit informs me with how long the unit has charged my EV for (each light indicating an hour). My car (a 2016 Chevy Volt) has time and location based charging, so it automatically starts charging during off-peak hours as I've programmed it to. My 2016 Chevy Volt charges from a fully depleted battery to fully charged (approximately15-16kwh) in about 4 hours. Much better than waiting 13-14 hours on a standard 120v outlet.",

It is a quality piece of equipment.

Unit looks good, electrician had no problem installing -- less than two hours and he had to run 35 feet of 8 gauge romex through the ceiling of my garage. Install ran $200, and got the charger for $488, so I am very happy. Looking fwd to getting the skin.",

BTW, even though Amazon noted that Schneider Electric was out of stock, I STILL got my EVSE super quick! Admittedly, I am an electrical NOOB however, I still rate myself as more competent than most. The technical genius I spoke with when I called their tech support gave outstanding customer service! I am sorry I didn't catch his name, he certainly deserves credit.

It is important to hook it to the highest voltage that your electric car can handle to get the fastest charging times. In my case, that was 240V. So even though I had 208V 3-phase closer, I routed wires from the 240V single-phase panel. Once the wires were routed, took all of half an hour to actually mount it and wire it.",

The slower charge controlling unit that came with the car is slow, but is able to use a standard electrical outlet. This faster unit required an electrical installation of a 220V, three wire, 40 amp circuit.The wall unit has a clean design and is simple to use.
