I was looking for a coffee maker that required no more than 20 inches of clearance with the lid open, and this fit the bill perfectly. The secret is that the coffee filter slides out to the side instead of opening vertically. A separate lid on top opens up vertically in order to pour in the water, adding about 6 inches of height to the unit.",

The flip-up lid is nice for filling with water, and you can use the other access panel in back of the machine for filling, but ours is under cabinets, and we have to pull the machine to the edge of the counter, so we just use the lid fill point. It makes good coffee, and the delay timer is nice, as is the auto-off function after 2 hours.",
