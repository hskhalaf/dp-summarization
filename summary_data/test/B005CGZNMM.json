Got it and it works every day. Even have the ladies welding. Getting a alum gun was a bonus, bought the Hobart electronic helmet and Hobart gloves (softest and best fitting gloves ever) and now we have two new \"want to be welders\". Note, this crew never \"played with the lincoln that is still sitting in the corner. So far we are jam free and making sparks.",

This is the most power you can get in this form factor, so instead of crying about 2-3 amps less than an Ironman or Millermatic sit back and enjoy the extra shop space. As an aside, I don't know who makes the guts, but I know they're made in America. Furthermore, the drive roll is *very* well-made and you can feel the precision when adjusting the tension. I absolutely love this thing.... now to fab a custom bumper for my suburban tank.",

I like this thing like no other mig welder I have ever used, the duty cycle is low to weld hard, but for average home use, this thing is great. I cannot believe how this thing will weld. well worth $818. if you want an inexpensive home welder, this is it.",
