The Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 had the highest ratings on Consumer Reports, and this one was comparable in all categories except ease of installation. But seriously, what carseat is truly easy to install? This has seat anchor latches which makes it as easy as any would be, so no complaints there. Shipping was fast and it showed up a few days early which was a nice surprise for our little Spiderman lover. The quality was better than expected and we are very pleased. Definitely recommended for any super hero lover!",
