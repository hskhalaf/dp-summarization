No problem at first with the trout, but by the time we were halfway through the 3rd the handle was really hot. So we carried on manually until the trout were done. Drum and sheepshead are a little more of a challenge so we thought we'd try electronically again. Didn't know which blade to use as there's no instructions showing the best one for the fish species. After trying 4 blades and making a mess of the first drum we went back to manual.",

Used this one for the first time last week and cleaned up two limits of yellow perch in no time. Love the long narrow blade for slicing the filet's off the backbone and the variety of knives make it easy to pick the right one for the job. I would recommend this kit for anyone that catches and cleans a lot of fish. Let's hope this one holds out as long as my original.",

Makes short work of cutting catfish into filet and the variety of blades makes it great for many different cutting tasks such as Turkey, Ham, cutting large quantity meats into steaks or chops as well as bread and cheeses. I love that it comes with replacement blades. Only thing I would change would be the tacky bag they send with it to keep it in, even the less expensive knives usually come in an adequate storage case, the blades don't fit in the one that came with it but that is only a minor issue and in no way affects the performance of the knife",

So far I have used it to clean crappie, walleye, and saugeye. Can't wait to try this on some of those big boned salt water fish that were always so tough.",
