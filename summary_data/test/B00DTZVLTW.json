      "text": "PROS: Perfect height for elevating head without neck pain. Generous size. Washable cover. Great for reading in bed (when turned on side like in picture). CONS: Very firm, so an additional pillow is needed to cushion head, which adds to the height. * I'm still getting used to it. Bought it to elevate head (to reduce eye puffiness) and reduce wrinkles on side of face and chest area from sleeping on my side. I wish it were made of memory foam so it wasn't so hard on the back of my head.",

Finally, the length of the pillow that rests flat on the bed is too short to provide adequate back support.
