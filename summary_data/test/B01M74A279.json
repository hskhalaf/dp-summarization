It was heavy but not too heavy and the perfect size. I eagerly fried my pork chops which came out perfect. I washed the pot, dried it and left it on my counter. I came back almost 2hours later and my heart fell. The skillet was filled with rust. The bottom and inside rim was covered in rust. This was the first time I used it now I have to return it.....very disappointing",

It also however has the same flaw in that the cooking surface is somewhat pebbled.....just like a Lodge. It was easy to rectify. I stripped off the entire cooking surface until it was shiny new again. Then did a few deep seasonings with olive oil (my personal favorite). Now it has a deep brown surface, and is totally non stick. Eggs, starch...doesn't matter. Easy to clean, and re-season every time with a light coating...200 degrees...20 minutes...that's it. Nothing else comes close to cast iron.",

I will smooth it only slightly so that it will take a seasoning better than a slick smooth skillet but enough to get a more level seasoning. The skillet is thinner walled than the heavy Lodge ones but still good quality. I really do like this skillet.",
