They wiggle a lot but this hasn't impacted the use at all. For the price point the look and how they have performed so far I think this is a great purchase.",

I have used the other two bags at the airport since my initial review and both held up great and the carry one was good for Delta. I like the look of the bags but, unfortunately, only after one use there is a 3 inch tear at the seam near the top. I know airports are not always the most gentle but should get more than one use from your luggage.",
