Wish they were full RGB rather than shades of white. But they are bright. Now as an actual Alexa device(echo) there are some major drawbacks. .cannot be named anything other than Alexa .mics are not that good at hearing you .does not support near field recognition Overall if they would have kept up support or added the above, they would fit well in a smarthome ecosystem that has other echo units in the room. So you'd want them to be standalone",

Save yourself the hassle and get a cheaper light along with an Echo Dot and you'll be much happier.",

Love how simple it is to use the voice activation (dim the light, turn on music, ask about the weather, set alarm, etc). The light quality is perfect and I love how you can customize the intensity by small increments. Love this so much I\u2019m planning to by two more for each of my kids rooms!",
