I went ahead and we slept on them for several nights but now they are starting to \"pill\". The fabric is not high quality, they are not super soft and silky.I was hoping they would be like a set I purchased locally by ClaraClark which are just wonderful! However they are far from them. Returning them now.",

Cotton allows you to breathe and although these are soft and very thin, they are not cotton and sleep very hot. If you like microfiber, you will probably be very happy.

The problem was one set was in light gray, and appeared to possibly be a different brand. Labels and packaging were not the same, The light gray sheets, once unfolded looked like what I ordered, the Charcoal Gray, but not the same color. Couldn\u2019t tell by sheet tags if they were even the same brand. Very disappointed since these are for 2 beds in the same room with identical comforters, but now two different colors.\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude22",

There is a star rating for wrinkle-free, which is strange, but no, these do not really hold up to a wrinkle-free class in my opinion; after one sleep, no amount of smoothing would truly work.",

I recommend just be aware of how thick your mattress is!",
