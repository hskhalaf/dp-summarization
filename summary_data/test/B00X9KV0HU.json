Movies can be listened to at much lower volume and I can hear them. One summer I drove a noisy car cross country and on the interstate listened to music through teh headsets and it was quiet like a luxury car. I regularly use them at my desk while working.The office air conditioner fan noise is all but eliminated making it much easir to concentrate.",

They come with different size ear plugs but I do not find them as comfortable as I had hoped for four hours of listening.

Even with the drawbacks I still prefer these over a large bulky set.",

The only tip I have is be careful unpacking them - they have small, medium & large ear adapters and when I tried to remove the small ones from their packaging I accidentally tore the triangle-shaped part of it. I found that the medium size works perfectly anyway and never falls out, even when running with them.",

      "text": "I already owned a set of Bose noise canceling headphones that fit over the ears. They are great, but they are bulky and take up a lot of room in my small carry-on bag. I therefore decided to buy these, as they are much smaller. They aren't bad, but they do not keep out the noise of the airplane engines nearly as well as my other Bose headphones. My choice for each trip is which set to take, the ones that take up very little room but let noise in or the set that lets no noise in but is big and bulky",
