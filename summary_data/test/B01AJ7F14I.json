Also, it stopped working after 2 months of owning it - no way to check if it's the bulb because it doesn't come apart. Unfortunately the window of opportunity to return (1 month) has already passed or I would be sending it back. UPDATE: the company honored my request for a replacement and the new one worked much better - even bought another one for my niece who loves it. Thanks Aukey!",

We purchased this lamp for our 13 year old and he did like the lamp but we couldn't figure out why the breakers were constantly going off and shutting down our computers and appliances. Our house was built in 2012 and has modern wiring so this is not a case of poor electrical wiring in the house... this is a case of a poor quality, and likely hazardous lamp. Obviously, I took the lamp from my son and will have to replace it with a safer model. NOT RECOMMENDED, BUYER BEWARE.",

We already have lamps in our room for reading in bed, so now it just illuminates the entire kitchen in late night or early mornings. It works great at that, but not our intended purchase.",

      "text": "It was useful as a bedside lamp while it lasted. It's warrantied for 24 months but true to luck, it stopped working days after that expired. I contacted the company but they would only offer to let me buy another one at a discount. All the other lamps in my home are still working 5-10 years later. My guess is the bulb or other internal connection. The touch controls work but the colors can only cycle through in one direction. You have to wait for it to reach the color you want then stop it with a long press. Not bad but it would be nice to be able to manually cycle back and forth.",

      "text": "I bought this for my 5 year old daughter's room. I was worried it wouldn't be bright enough to read safely, but wow! It is AWESOME! It can go very dim and very bright. I actually like it better than the normal lamp in my own bedroom. If you are comparing this light to another brand just like it, trust me -- this one is the best. I bought another one similar to it... and returned it because it wasn't as good. Also, it comes with a plug and does not use batteries. So, I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5 that are still exploring outlets and getting in to things.",

To make it worse, the touch sensitive feature is unpredictable. I don't care if it looks \"sleek\" without buttons - if it works better with buttons, just use them.

Each day I have to cycle through the colors to find the one I like and set it up again. 2. Like another reviewer mentioned, the bulb can't be swapped out, making this a disposable lamp.",

The color modes do not dim at all, rendering them useless. The lamp light is not warm, it is closer to bright white, which is horrid to try to relax around. The light touch area is incredibly sensitive so you cannot have it near anything metallic. Overall an uncomfortable eyesore and thoroughly not worth it.",
