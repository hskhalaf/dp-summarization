Take out a section (will be two that stack if you buy the taller bookcase), open the sides, and the shelves fold down like vertical blinds. (new term\u2014>Horizontal blinds!) SO EASY! And then just put the top shelf on and DONE. No stupid tiny wrench, no pegs or posts or glue. Plus, when we move, we can fold the down in two seconds, wrap it securely, and make sure that the movers don\u2019t gouge it. Highly recommended and I may buy another one!",
