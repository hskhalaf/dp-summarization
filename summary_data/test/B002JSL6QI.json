If you are using it to straighten curly hair, and applying the heat directly on your hair all the time, it will burn your hair. It turned my beautiful, nourished, curly hair into a dry, brittle mess. I am throwing this dryer away and would never recommend it for direct, daily/repeated use.",

      "text": "I was so excited how light and quiet this dryer was. Huge disappointment is the red color bleeds and rubs off onto your hands and anything else if you have any water or product on your hands. I only found out when my white towels had pink/red marks on them. I normally put some moose in my hair before blowing it dry. I wipe excess moose off my hands but it's not enough I have to make sure my hands are completely dry before touching the dryer or else I have pink/red hands after using it. I literally have to scrub my hands clean before touching anything else. Such a let down. Searching for a new dryer.",

      "text": "This was a great little blowdryer until about 4 months into using it, the low setting on the blower stopped working---it only blows on high now which can be a little overwhelming since it is a powerful hairdryer. It dries my hair quickly though, is very light (so much less strain on the arms) and the long cord is very convenient. After I bought mine, I realized that the salon I use has them at every station! My stylist is also a big fan of these dryers, so there's a professional's opinion as well. I also love the red color!",

I love the balanced weight, the temperature and blower settings, and its relative quietness. While my old dryer only offered only searing heat or overly cool air, the Babyliss has cool, warm, and hot settings that are accurate. The blower has two options: low and high and they both work on all heat settings. This hair dryer is expensive, but worth it, especially considering how often it's used.",

      "text": "This particular model of BaByliss electric hair dryer is \"the one.\" Relatively lightweight, compact, QUIET, and easy to adjust and hold for excellent control. We purchased a second one because the first impressed so much with ease of control, and did I say quiet? Does not over-dry or cause static. This is a great value as a long-term investment in a tool that gets used daily, and will far outlast the value brands that we have purchased many times over in the past. No more of that, this is \"it.\" Highly recommended!",

Time will tell if it lasts longer than other dryers. Cleaning the filter is easy. Update: the plastic attachment tabs on the round disk-like filter on the back of the dryer broke off. It protects the fan from dust and hair. I will not buy dryers from this company again. very disappointed.",

I assume it has something to do with the rapid drying. So if you want curl and rapid drying, this one is for you. It is light and compact. It's probably not the best for someone who wants a very smooth, flat finish to their hair as you will probably make up for the time drying in time trying to straighten your hair.

Previous reviews noted the buttons are in a location that cause you to hit them- I have accidentally turned it off a couple of times, but you do get used to it, and in my opinion it's not a deal breaker. I definitely recommend this product, and the Babyliss diffuser to enhance your curls.",
