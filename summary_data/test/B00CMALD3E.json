It took a little time playing with the different angles and positioning to get the keyboard in just the right configuration, but with the placement freedom this keyboard gives you, the strain I'd feel in my wrists after a long day typing is gone. Most \"natural\" keyboards have an incline from the front edge to the back, which bends your wrists back, and creates strain. With this keyboard, there is no incline this way. My 1 wish for this is that the cord connecting the 2 halves would be RJ-45 plug-able instead of hard-wired.",

The ability to tilt the two sides of the keyboard independently of each other is very nice as well. The only con is that some of the keys are slightly different from where they are placed than other keyboards. That will just take some time to get used to, however, I really like the way this keyboard types.",

One thing some might worry about is the getting used to it aspect - you need to be more of a touch typist because you don't want to be bringing your left hand over to the right side of the keyboard. Took me about a month, now I''m fine and its absolutely worth it. And a side benefit - it has cut, copy, paste and del keys at the left hand - I'd love to have those on all my keyboards now, including the laptop.",

Otherwise, it works as it said but I find that it would take some getting used to and a lot of hair pulling before you do. Returning.",
