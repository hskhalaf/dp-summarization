      "text": "This is the best inexpensive gig bag for a Les Paul. I've purchased and returned (2) others - the $20 Epiphone bag (terrible!) and $24 Gator (better than Epi bag but no where near as good as the ChromaCast, ). The ChromaCast is heavy duty nylon, has a larger, tougher zipper and many pockets. The straps are padded and the bag will protect my Epiphone Les Paul Standard as well as any gig bag. If you're going on tour you should use a hard shell case, but if all you need is a gig bag, this one is excellent. I have not received any merchandise for free or at a discount for any of my opinions/reviews!",

      "text": "I've been using gig bags for years. Most of them are pretty standard. I needed a bag extra quick for cheap for a used bass I just purchased. Bought the ChromeCast not expecting much. I've owned both the SKB World Tour and Road Runner cases. This one surprisingly is better than all three. It's built better, has a lot of pockets, and all the zippers and pockets are solid and work well. Like another reviewer mentioned, the case came rolled in a square box rather than folded. So it laid out nice and was usable on first try. I'm buying two more of these for my working basses. They do a great job and are well worth the money.",

Holds my full sized bass perfectly with good balance and comfort. Has pockets to fit my book and cable and mini amp if needed or wanted. Came rolled up in a medium box. Better than folded up with left over creases. The zippers took a little while to work right because the pockets weren't completely straight from packaging, but after a couple of zips they seem to be aligning, straightening up. Good bag. Also good with lots of pockets for about $20.",

I think the bag will stretch further after a few days. It's only $20 & a bargain for a gig bag. Please realize the padding is thin & only offers minimal protection, though you'll have pockets galore.. I rated it 5 stars because it fits my needs.",

I have found that the bags that often come with a new instrument are just too thin to be of any use. They have no padding will not offer any protection. These ChromaCast bags are perfect. They have very tough ballistic nylon covers and more than enough padding. The straps are convenient and comfortable. All the bags come with convenient pockets. The electric guitar bag comes with more zippered storage pockets than I honestly know what to do with. They are reasonable priced compared to other brands. Great value",

If you need something inexpensive home storage or for very basic hauling back in forth then this a great option.

There is plenty of room for cables, a pair of pedal, papers and more. I like that it has several large pockets for my gear. It is a bit baggy for my Fender American Precision bass which leads to when placing it on the floor it completely misses the shock absorber and thuds on the ground. So I place it lightly on the ground or subway platform. It certainly has its plusses and minuses but for commuting to jams in NYC this bag is pretty good and great for the price.",

People might be skeptical because it's made in China, but guess what?-almost all of them are. I hope the zippers hold up. Some of the pockets are unnecessary and the skinny long one on the neck is impossible to get an arm to the bottom. I wish the main big pocket was large enough for a music binder, but whatever. Great for the price. Recommended.",

However, if you need something simple with plenty of storage and a little protection from bumps and dings - this is ideal. The shoulder straps are thin but comfortable, and were helpful for carting the guitar on my back through the office, without hitting every door frame in the process.",
