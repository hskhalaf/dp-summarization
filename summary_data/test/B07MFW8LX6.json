So right now I am very unsure of this water ionizer",

The unit works flawlessly and we installed the faucet the unit is under the sink. It is very convenient. We drink the anti-oxidant setting water all the time now and we have found it helps with our digestion and regularity and quenches our thirst better than bottled drinking water. We use the cleaning mode to clean our stainless steel appliances, marble counter tops and even my glasses. No streaks and cuts the grease. It is amazing how well it works. If you are thinking about an anti-oxidant machine, I suggest this one.",

I had to get a new faucet to be able to use the Aqua Ionizer Deluxe, as it will not attach to sinks that have a pull down spout. Make sure you have the right faucet before you buy the machine.
