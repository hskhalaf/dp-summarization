I wear between L and x-Large for shirts/jackets and the Large is very roomy and the sleeves are long. I can see using it for workouts - outdoor runs on cold winter days. Good for wearing inside when room temperature is in the mid 60's. Quality is very decent for the price. About a third the cost of comparable The North Face fleece. On Amazon the price fluctuates from day to day - $25 to $36 depending on the color/size. There was no size variation between the two L's that I got.",

I think I can fit 2 pairs of arms in the sleeve. Edit: wore it today. It is badly constructed; the fleece is asymmetrical. The right half of the fleece is bigger/puffier than the left half.",
