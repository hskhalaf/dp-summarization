However, I rarely get to use the printer because just about every time I turn it on it goes into a self diagnostic. There's no way to cancel this action. you can unplug it and plug it back in and it just starts the self diagnostic over. I've only printed maybe 30 pages with this printer over the course of a couple months, and just about every time I've printed it has done this to me.

If the color ran out you couldnt print in black, even if the black cartridge was full. There was a bunch of other ways HP seems to drive up the price of consumables up. No more HP printers for me.

So glad my friend turned me on this type of printer instead of the cheap printers and then you pay 60.00 every month for a refill. I can go abot 4 to 5 months depending on how much printing I do. Save money never had a problem with off brand ink for around 25.00. You get 2 and this will last you about a year.",

So the paper either hangs down or you have to hold it until it begins to print. This leads to the paper not always feeding in straight so sometimes the print is crooked. The other issue (which I didn't read for when buying) is it scans one sided only. I'm so used to scanners doing double side I didn't think to look for this feature. But overall nice printer.",
