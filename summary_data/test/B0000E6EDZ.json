It's about the size of a large dinner plate, the airflow is good, and the sound levels are reasonable. It has been running all night, every night for two weeks now, and I love it. :)",

I bought this fan to help keep the air moving more so I don't overheat while getting ready. Works like a charm. I haven't had any problems with it walking on the counter (but I do have it perched in a corner so it can't really move much). It gets used daily and hasn't failed me yet. Also, it's not all that loud considering how powerful it is.",

It wasn\u2019t too noisy at all and gave a consistent air flow that was perfect. The only feature it didn\u2019t have that we\u2019d have liked was some way to angle up and down.

When operating well, these fans are great - decent power for the size (can definitely cool a room down if the outside air is cooler), fairly quiet, good range of speeds. They do wear out somewhat quickly, though - usually getting more noisy over time, and eventually dying completely (I assume the motor gives out). I'd say each fan lasts through a couple years of use in the spring and fall. However, given the price and the limited selection of this size, I'm willing to replace them every couple years.",

Also vibrated a fair amount, had a tendency to walk around on the table despite the rubber feet on the bottom. Probably could use some blade balancing.",
