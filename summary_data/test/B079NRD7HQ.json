That shape serves no purpose beyond the aesthetic, but it definitely works for a corner position. In all other regards, the TV is perfect for my needs. The picture is sharp and clear, the built-in speakers are surprisingly good, and I found the remote and menu system intuitive and easy to use.",

It is trash for competative gaming. There isn't anyone to Express this frustration to over at Samsung. None of their tech support seems to know what refresh rate actually means.",
