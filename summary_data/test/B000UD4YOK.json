The secret to threading the pole segments together without stripping the threads is to (1) lubricate both the male and female threads with anything handy (I used silicone grease); and (2) to CAREFULLY line the segments up, then WITHOUT FORCING (I used gravity), screw the segments together. Stop and back up if there is any resistance at all. Everything came together tight and straight. It is cheaply made, but if put together carefully, the end product is solid and looks just fine.",

Considerations: Unlike the base and the accented pieces on top, the stand is or is closer to a black appearance instead of a uniform dark-bronze painted finish. It isn't very noticeable or distracting, but was enough for me to remove 1 star. It seems odd to me that the color doesn't match throughout the piece. I also would have really enjoyed if an optional extension piece was given to vary the height of the lamp. While the advertised height is correct, after putting it together, a few inches were certainly more desired.",

Why would someone design a lamp with a reading lamp function and put the ONLY switch at the top five feet off the floor whereit cannot be reached from a sitting position? In addition, the joints where it screws together are so flimsy that the lamp regularly appears to lean requiring the joints to be screwed back together. Doing that becomes an exercise in frustration! I think that the inside threads are so shallow that they are difficult to match with the coarser outside threads. If you don't mind crooked lamps or frequent frustration this lamp is attractive.

The main light is bright and also works nicely, and the 3 way switch ( large light, small light, both lights at once) works nicely. It was very difficult to assemble. The threading on one portion was quite difficult to connect and required both my husband and adult son. After much effort it is now assembled and upright, working well.",

Some reviewers stated it was difficult to thread the wires into the pole pieces and that the lamp does not stand evenly upright and/ or wobbles; thankfully we have neither of these issues. Lamp is sturdy and looks great in our Living Room. The one complaint I can relate to is the on/off switch - it is high up and a bit difficult to twist, other than that I am happy with it. Price is reasonable for the quality. Would recommend.",

One does come with the lamp, but the 100 watt does not and you need to purchase that separately. The regular 40 watt bulbs do not fit the arm lamp.

This lamp actually looks black and the base and leaf/swirl design are the only part of the lamp that is brushed and looks bronze colored. As others have reviewed this lamp cannot be dimmed but it does have 3 lighting choices. The quality is good and it was super easy to put together. I have it in my bedroom but it's versatile enough for a living room or den.",

On off switch and gooseneck for reading lamp is cheap looking, but not noticebly so.

This makes the reading lamp light uneven, which may disturb some readers. The lightbulbs recommended as \"often purchased with this light\" will NOT fit the reading lamp. I had to use a 40watt chandelier bulb to fit in the smaller opening. As other reviewers mentioned, the lamp is very heavy and will not tip. I am keeping the light.",
