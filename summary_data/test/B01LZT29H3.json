I would estimate that at least 50% of the time, the \"krill oil\" capsules leaked out onto the tissue. Do not waste your money. Evidently, the people that rated these 5 stars must have been extremely lucky to receive an exceptional bag that had no leaky capsules.",

I only take 500 mg per day (versus 1000 mg of fish oil), and I don't get any \"fish burps\" or any fishy aftertaste. Krill oil is supposed to be much better absorbed than fish oil; so you can take less of it. I bought the smallest size from BulkSupplements to test it out, and I'm pleased.

      "text": "I really like the packaging, small easy to store bulk bag. Good directions come with the supplements. And what they are used for. Second time I took these I did burp, yuk! But next day I did not so hopping that continues. Just been taking a week so far and all good. I took 100mg before so was not sure with the 500. Thought it would be healthier having a larger dose. I like the larger pack quantity hate ordering every 30-60 days.",
