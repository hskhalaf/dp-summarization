      "text": "AMAIZING home projector. I purchased this projector to create a cinema room in a basement and it is perfect for the job. I have a 3.5M screen of excellent image quality and the ST aspect means the Kids can still play Wii, etc without any shadows on the screen. My only recommendations would be to make sure you have a good HD feed as standard definition is obviously a bit grainy on larger screens, and the projection wall / screen is also good. I personally opted for a \"smartsufraces projection wall paint\" which works great, but to be fair, the picture was still amazing on some old dirty magnolia which was originally on the wall!",

      "text": "We bought the projector 3 years ago (with a 2 years guaranty). We have been very happy with it until the bulb needed to be changed. The bulb costs us approx. \u00a3200. Unfortunately the projector would not work again once the new bulb has been put in place. So we had to send it to be repaired by the manufacturer. Cost of repairs (as obviously is not under guarantee) \u00a3300. So think twice before buying this projector.",

Real value for money. On top of image quality, it got impressive sound quality, which I never expected. It just 2 days as of now, but I am still in dream, can come out of my room. It got amazing picture quality, sound quality, easy to setup and what else you need. I will strongly recomend this. Thanks to seller for quick responses for my queries and delivery was really quick.",

Remember this is essentially the same as the W1070+ but this has the short throw lens. If you have the luxury of space and need to save money, then you can just get the W1070+ but it will need to be further away to produce the same kind of size. I'm going to use this with a 120\" motorised projector screen and it will only need to be 2m away from the screen to produce this size of image!",

The picture excellent (using the HDMI port).I got this HDMI cable, to connect my laptop to the projector. I used a \"35 mm projector stand\" with the laptop 2 meters away. With no noticable drop in quality, so handy, for when the laptop is further away.",
