I held a flashlight behind the lifters so you could see how these are not only not solid, but even the wood they jammed inside had holes. As you can see, the finish was also damaged, and the stain job was sloppy and unfinish. They also have some kind of white film on them that won't come off. If your are considering these, you should pass. If you already own them, you should seriously check them out before you put any serious weight on these!",
