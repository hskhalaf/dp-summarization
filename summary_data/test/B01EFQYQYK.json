But after a full season using this on Lake Michigan and landing a substantial number of 20+ pound monsters, I'm completely sold! Not 1 break off the entire season. The color fades after time, but the fish don't seem to care. I now have 26 rods with this line on them. I use it for backing on lead core rods and spool up the downrigger and dipsy rods fully and then use a fluorocarbon leader. To do this with the name brand stuff is relatively expensive and I now see no reason to invest in anything else!",

The entire rig pretty much absolutely disappears once in the water. I fish primarily along the Northern California coast from shore, boat and (sometimes) piers. Winding it onto your reel is a bit different than monofilament line as it requires a slightly different technique and more tension on the line while winding. There are several YouTube videos that deal with this and I recommend watching at least a couple. If you want to give braided a try, I recommend this brand for its quality. And the price is certainly reasonable.",

However , the 80 pound test that I bought works like a dream for A-Rigs(umbrella rigs). This was a bargain. It has approximately the same thickness as 20 pound mono and ties on and casts with the heavy rigs just great. Pretty good price for something to throw them with that I trust with 20-40 dollars worth of tackle.",

The 30 lb. braid is as thick as the other Kastking 40 lb braid which hurts both the amount you can put on your reel and casting distance. Usually 30 lb. braid is equivalent to 8 lb mono, but this braid is equivalent to the diameter of 10 lb mono. Obviously you can still hold a lot more line than if actually using mono and still cast much farther but not as far as if it was had the equivalent of 8 lb. mono. Overall, it's a good value, long lasting and less expensive alternative but not my favorite Kastking product.",

Reefs are incredibly sharp so under normal circumstances the line should be perfect. The line is also cheap so buy the extra spools and re-spool here and there.",

I've seen some good reviews on it so thought I'd give it a try. I'll not waste any more money on this Braided line.",

    "description": "KastKing SuperPower braid line is a fishing line like no other! Our braided fishing lines are designed for increased casting distance and durability. You don\u2019t have to worry about fraying or break-offs. KastKing SuperPower MultiTuf PE Line Braid (Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene Braid Fiber) is made with same durable fiber that bullet proof vests are made from. Affordable KastKing SuperPower Braid fishing line comes in test strength ranging from 10 -150 Ib test, with many fade resisting colors available such as grey, green, multicolor, blue, white, pink and yellow. KastKing SuperPower braid fishing line is made with 4 high strength strands, while the higher tensile strength of 65lb-150lb has 8 powerful strands for even more smooth power. Our dynamic 8-strand line is wrapped tighter than our competitor\u2019s line for a smaller profile resulting in better casting and knot strength.
