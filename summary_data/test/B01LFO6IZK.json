In the morning my face is not oily, but looks deeply moisturized & rejuvenated. I believe the Moringa oil gives my face a glow and a refreshed appearance. Also, I believe this oil has helped to even out my skin tone and help to keep acne at bay. I've received many compliments about my skin since I've started using the Moringa oil. The scent is strong , almost medicinal, but subsides after some time. However, the benefits are definitely worth the consistent use.",

My husband and I have applied it directly to achy or painful areas and it works amazingly well at relieving the pain. I highly recommend this product.",

The bottle I received had a very strong rancid odor (like rotting walnuts), it was really thick, and it had a dark yellow color. The local brand I have smells fresh and slightly nutty, was thinner like a avocado oil, and was more clear in color. I tried rubbing it on my leg just to get it off my hand and it was really thick and sticky. It did not absorb well. I have already started the return process. Maybe I just got a bad one out of the lot - but it was REALLY BAD.",

This is my new favorite product and a little goes a long way. I think I will purchase for a couple family members this Christmas.",
