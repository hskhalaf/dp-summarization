Someone had told me about this product and it definitely didn't disappoint us. It quickly soothed his puffiness and itchiness. Within 1 day there was a huge difference. Swelling was down and he wasn't trying to tear his face off. It also worked quickly to clear up all the bumps. 4 days later you wouldn't even know he had poison ivy. Will most definitely make sure I keep this product on hand at all times in case of future outbreaks.",

This salve cut the itching almost immediately and was so soothing. It moisturizes really well. There are areas on my arm where I'm probably going to have some scarring from the poison ivy but this salve has kept the area supple, so I think the scarring will eventually fade. I am planning on using it as a moisturizer for dry skin this winter.",

Sorry Creation Farms but with your product I am literally applying it almost every 30 min it seems like. The poison ivy itch just won't go away like it did with your competitor. With No Reins Jewelweed Salve it worked in just a couple min & lasted for quite a while. I just didn't get that with your jewelweed salve.",
