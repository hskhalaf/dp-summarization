Im able to play video games such as emulators and pc games. the backlit keyboard is a great look too when using your laptop in the dark. the picture quality is also great, with great detail. the little speaker it comes with also packs a punch. Not to mention the touch screen the laptop has. when you dont want to use the trackpad, you can use the touch screen on it. I recommend this product.",

The one piece of advice I'd give is that if you upgrade to Windows 8.1, make sure to install a new ATKACPI driver for the backlit keyboard to work (googling it works better than trying to find it on the ASUS website).",

      "text": "I bought this and before even turning it on replaced the memory (16gb cas 9), hard drive (Samsung 840evo 1tb) and wireless (Intel 7260ac+bluetooth). The machine specs as built limited the performance of the laptop too much for my taste, but the price was right for the platform. Performance is outstanding with the upgrades, and Windows 7 AND 8.1 have great performance. (W7 experience of 7.3) Only reason I give it 4 stars is the initial hard drive was slow, the battery life is mediocre, and the edges are sharp (Not sharp as in good design, but sharp as in don't let it slip or it will cut your fingers). Otherwise, it's a great machine.",

I would stay away from this, buy a mac pro and put windows on it and then run it for the next 4 years, you will be way happier!!",

The laptop was on but never saw an image, even tried to connect via HDMI to my tv. So I sent it with the support service to get it fixed, it lasted 2 months there and just got it back. Other than that screen problem it is a great computer and I absolutely recommend it. My guess is I just had bad luck with a failed product.",
