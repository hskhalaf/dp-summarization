      "text": "I purchased this machine on February 13, 2018. Today a little over a year later this machine totally died. So naturally I contacted Delonghi's customer service who informed me that I was out of warranty by a few weeks. What! Listen to me, I and some others have stated this machine totally stops working. Delonghi instead of improving the quality of their products or replacing my machine, offered me a measly 20% discount on another machine. What! Why would I ever buy some $200 crap that's only going to last me a year? You've been forewarned. Its going to quit working on you too eventually. Don't do it!",

It makes wonderful air fried vegetables such as brussel sprouts, green beans, broccoli and air fried cauliflower taste delicious! I just add a smidgen of oil and seasoning and wait until it smells good. Slightly crisp edges that are gently browned with an excellent degree of doneness. I've found a lady from Canada on a YouTube channel that makes many things in hers, and she inspired me to make this worthy purchase. Chicken wings come out very well with this unit, as do many other recipes.",

I do not believe that a product that costs almost $300 should only last 1 year and 5 months. Now I have to toss it in the garbage. Way to back up your product Delonghi. I'll make sure to tell everyone not to purchase your products. My T-Fal Actifry is still going strong and I bought it in 2015. \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c",

I like the fact that it has a bigger capacity than my current T-Fal unit, but at least that one ($150) had an auto shutoff. Very disappointing and De'Longhi will be getting this unit back. I looked on their website and they do have one with this feature, but is an international unit and not sold in the US or Canada. I just have to shake my head on this one. I'll say it again, very disappointing!!!",

We tried making homemade vs frozen. Will try frozen and see if that turns out better. I ended up overcooking the chicken wings a bit, but the skin was AWESOME. Will just need to figure out the timing a bit. I think I just need more practice :) Cleanup has been easy, so far. UPDATE: Frozen fries/tater tots come out much better than homemade french fries. Roasted Cauliflower and Brussel sprouts were ok, but are better in the oven. I find it a big piece of expensive equipment for it's limited use.",

      "title": "Most reviews on Air Fryers are highly biased - this fryer is best kept secret",
      "text": "I have used 3-4 air fryers and frankly I liked them all. But using De'Longhi's has been a privilege to own. High quality product with great finishes. Cooking is impeccable. Most importantly, you are not constraint by cooking dry things only (like french fries, roast chicken etc), you can do ALL kinds of cooking. I personally, I love gravies, soups, and this air fryer is the best kept secret. One helpful tip: Add water towards the end when food is already cooked (if you are making soups) since I think the hot air (that cooks food) will have harder time to travel through water to cook any further. Overall: FANTASTIC product. Best kept secret. Beats all other air fryers.",

Came out with a little crunch on the outside and moist inside. Easy to clean. The only con that we have seen is that I wish it had a temperature scale/reading rather then a power setting (1 - 4).",

I've had it about a month so far and have made wings for college students, fries, chicken breast tenders and drumsticks (dry rubbed, not breaded), shrimp, mozzarella sticks, potatoes, bread and even black bean burgers. And I haven't even started on the long list of recipes in the De'Longhi app yet. Everything has been excellent. The most oil I've used in anything is a couple of quick sprays of peanut oil. Don't let the complaints about the temperature settings dissuade you, or the lack of auto shutoff. The functionality and effectiveness of this fryer are the things that matter most, and once you get used to using it you'll find it very intuitive.",

The length and width are the same as the 1163. The only issue with this product is the pan is not replaceable. Delonghi would make a fortune if they sold those separately. Still though, there is no rust at all on my 3 year old 1163. It's just difficult to clean, and most times, I ended up cleaning it once a week after using it for about 1000 days in a row.",
