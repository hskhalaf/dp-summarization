The blade stays steady and lets me cut precise straight lines. and it's strong enough to cut through any material I've made models out of so far. I've even used it to cut different plastics. The only thing I can possibly suggest having room for improvement is adding some padding to the handle, or having another model with more padding, but it only became uncomfortable after cutting through 4 ply museum board for 12 hours straight. So with normal use the handle is just fine.",

I had been using a big pair of scissors to break down boxes but since I was receiving so many deliveries, I really needed a box cutter. I was searching and recognized the OLFA tool on Amazon. It was like meeting up with an old friend. The design had not changed. It is very easy to use, you simply turn the knob that allows the blade to be moved to the cutting position or retracted. It is comfortable to hold and relatively light and easy to use. I highly recommend the product and the vendor.",

This OLFA knife has none of those problems. It locks down tight in any position, allowing much more control over depth of cut, and I'm much more comfortable working with it than with any other utility knife I've ever owned.",
