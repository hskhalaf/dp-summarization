But it is much easier to thoroughly cut the mat out once it's been brought to the surface. So my cat still ends up with temporary bald spots from fur cutting. I do think this brush is helpful and does a better job of lifting mats than any other brush I've tried. You just have to meet it halfway with the scissors.",

It's easy to hold and use, but I would really recommend getting one with longer blades for long-haired animals.

I was safe and effective. Relatively painless. It was a perfect solution. I dont see myself having to take her, a toy maltese, to the groomer ever. I also got the dematting comb. It was just too big to use on her. But this took easily and safely worked on every part of her body. Love it.",

It will not cut the entire mat out with one pass so if you don't have a dog that will sit still, I recommend you get some safety scissors instead and just cut the hair off.",
