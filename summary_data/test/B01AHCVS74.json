Immediately the ceramic cup lowered the temp of the coffee by about 15 degrees compared to this cup. However I don't think it kept the coffee hotter any longer than the ceramic cup. Will experiment some more. Overall though, don't think they will break like all my ceramic cups have when dropped, plus they look fantastic and would buy again if needed.",

They are stainless steel (SS), so naturally better for my health vs the plastic or styrofoam I was using while camping. In addition SS does not retain odors nor stain. 3. No BPA. That alone makes them worth the purchase price for me! 3. They are better for the earth, ridding it of unnecessary waste. Because they are SS, they clean up easily & are reused. 4. They look clean & are sturdy & sharp looking! The problems a few people had are likely unique & not the norm. I'm guessing the co. has good customer support.",
