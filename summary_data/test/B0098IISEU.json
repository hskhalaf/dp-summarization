Go to any court where there are lots of old guys, who have flattened out their feet with decades of tennis, and look at the brand shoes they're wearing--the majority are NB. But now you can take a brand new pair of NB 4E shoes from a few years ago, and compare to the same width in any current NB shoe, and the difference is stark. The toe box on the new one will always be way narrower. So much narrower that guys like me--a regular 4E--just can't wear them. Why would they do this? Weird.",
