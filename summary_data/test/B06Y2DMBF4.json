A couple of things: It takes some strength to control it, but so does any tiller; It digs right in and churns the hardest soil; I ran 200 feet of heavy extension cord and had no problem.

The combination can be a bit tricky as it has a tendency to hop around a bit when encountering tough soil, rocks, roots, etc. Hang onto it!

For loamy slightly damp, or previously tilled soil it smoothly does a great job stirring things up to a depth of about the blades; I imagine deeper if you were to work at it.

No trouble with hard-packed soil as long as you drag it backward, as the directions indicate. I used 150 feet of 12 gauge extension cord, and it (the cord) didn't even get warm. The cultivator motor was able to take quite an extended period of operation without getting hot. I am totally satisfied!!",

It was perhaps more powerful than I thought it would be, but that's a good thing. It easily tilled 8\" deep in the garden soil. Clean up took a little time since you need to take the tines off to clean them. It's stored away for the winter now. We did not use it on any really hard compacted soil or soil with grass or vegetation so don't know how it would work on that. Worked well for what we bought it for.",

It is a LIGHT duty tiller.",
