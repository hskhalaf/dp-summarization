I did drill a few small holes along the side panels to help the water fill the steps - the extra holes had them filled within a few minutes. I did not use extra weights to hold the stairs down and they have worked great. MUCH sturdier than ladder provided with pool. Now the whole family feels safe climbing in & out of the pool. I would definitely buy again!",

We\u2019ve only had it about three weeks and already the nodules have popped out of the holes and the steps are coming off. This is worst piece of crap I have ever seen!",

The only issue I had was how the steps themselves fit in to each of the side pieces BUT once I figured that out they went together quite easily and they stayed together all the way from inside the house ( it was a hot day) to the pool at the side of the back yard.",
