Probably one of the best steels I've had in a knife, but I'm still putting it through its initial testing phase. Carries so comfortably that you forget it's there. Superb design and versatility. I honestly think the knife looks goofy, but it is growing on me a little. My biggest complaint would be that, as far as I'm aware, it isn't possible to get this blade with the black coating unless you go half-serrated. So far, it has been a wonderful EDC and I can see why this is one of their best selling knives. Well done Spyderco.",

There are more affordable knives with comparable quality, but after 50+ years of mostly junk knives & tools I decided to splurge on some quality.

The Kabar Mule folder is a more substantial folder and seems to be stronger but heavier. Also there is no case/sheath provided but it does have a good clip for pocket carry. This is basically a utility knife not a tactical knife. The full flat grind is often mislabeled as a saber grind in descriptions. One hand open works well. Traction on the scales is bidirectional and very good. Available in many colors. The price is a little high in comparison with other folders.",

(this is a lightweight version with the fiberglass reinforced nylon, however the handle is skeletonized with more steel. I think anyone who buys one will have a reliable pal for quite a few years. This one is from Japan not China if that makes anyone feel better. :)",

The large thumb-hole and solid back lock make it fun to flip open. I like a larger blade, and the proportions give this one an elegant, interesting look. Although the handle is a bit narrow for a solid grip, it's so thin it practically disappears in your pocket. The texturing on the handle looks kind of like armadillo hide. I won't spend over $60 on a knife unless it's unique, practical, and high quality. This one fits the bill!",

Handle Material is very tough, yeah it's not fancy but the fancy stuff costs more money and isn't any more functional. Lock up is good, it is very possible to close with one hand safely, and honestly if you need stronger than this just get a fixed blade. Colors are cool. You should probably buy it.",

Also (and most importantly)...I am unable to flick this open like I can with my other Spydercos...I tried loosening the pivot screw a little but it still won't flick open...it is stiff.",
