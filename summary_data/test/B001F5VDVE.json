I am a small female, so these should have been plenty big around enough to stay secure and block out sound. Not so much. They do not expand completely, and when they do, the diameter just doesn't cut it. Hubby snoring, dog wheezing, all were clear as a bell. I spent half the night re-rolling them and trying everything I could think of, to no avail. I bought the big tub of them too! I'll be re-ordering my last brand and tossing these.",

      "text": "I love these! I use them for sleeping in order to drown out cars doing by, snoring family members and pets and even a hedgehog who runs on his wheel at night. Most of the time it completely drowns out the noise, occasionally if someone is watching TV I do have to ask them to turn it down a little if the bass is too high- but with the plugs in I can't hear what the TV is saying, just that there is some noise. Overall these are amazing! I find I can reuse them several times as well without issue.",
