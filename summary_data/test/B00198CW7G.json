This pump motor failed after 27 months, 10 months of which it was not used, as the pool is closed for the winter months. Not the quality I expected out of Hayward equipment. To those of you who would blame the operator, I have owned and maintained this pool for over ten years. I have regular inspections performed by a Hayward certified pool professional. The pump is out of the elements inside a small garage. This motor should not have failed this quickly.",

So I ordered the fittings and waited they came in this week so I installed the pump today and paid an electrician to wire it and could never get it to prime. So I disconnected the plumbing and hooked it up to some 1.5\" industrial hose and placed the other end in the pool and it still would not prime in a reasonable time. No choice now but to send it back.",

These pumps have a vacuum chamber, commonly known as a pump housing. The pump housing must be filled with water in order to create a vacuum, resulting in the pump drawing the water out of your pool or spa. The pump housing will remain full of water while the pump is on, and will remain full or partially full when the pump is shut off.\n * When powered on, the motor will begin to rotate. Two-speed pumps will power on a pre-selected speed or with some controllers, it will cycle at high before changing to the lower speed. The motor spins the pump impeller, located inside the pump volute. While the motor is rotating, the tips of the impeller are hydraulically sealed inside the pump diffuser, which is responsible for self-priming.\n * Self-priming can only occur if the pump has a diffuser--all in ground Hayward pumps have an internal diffuser. It helps to eliminate any air approaching into the pump housing from the suction piping. As all the air is removed from the system, you will notice bubbles returning to the pool through the return fittings. A full prime occurs when the bubbles stop returning to the pool and the pump basket is full of water. The filter pressure will rise as the pump reaches full prime. The actual gallons per minute (GPM) vary with the type of pump, horsepower, pipe size, distance from pool and other restrictions within the plumbing system.\n * Hayward self-priming pumps are very dependable and simple in design. They require a sufficient supply of water from the pool or spa, and no air in the suction lines. Air could come from a loose strainer cover, a leak in any valve, a pinhole in any suction line or a crack or loose connections in the underground piping.\n\nDO I NEED TO HAVE A STRAINER BASKET IN MY PUMP POT?\n * Yes. Without the strainer basket, debris will clog the impeller in the pump volute causing the pump to cease moving water. Be sure to clean your strainer basket, as well as the skimmer baskets, so water flow is not obstructed and the pump is not overworked.\n\nHOW DO I WINTERIZE MY PUMP?\n * To winterize a Hayward Pool pump, turn off the electrical circuit breaker that supplies power to the pump. Also, make sure that there is NO water left inside the pump. All Hayward pumps are equipped with drain plugs that will allow excess water to drain once the plugs are removed. Contact your local Hayward dealer for proper winterization procedures.\n\nHOW MANY HOURS PER DAY SHOULD I RUN MY PUMP?\n * There are many factors to consider; bather load, gallons of water, pump horsepower, type and size of filter just to name a few. A good guideline is 8-10 hours a day. On the cooler days and early and late season, you can cut the run time down to 4-6 hours because there is usually less swimmers and cooler water requires less chemicals. In peak season, when it is the hottest, raising the run time to 10-12 hours per day will help to keep the pool clean and circulating during it's time of heaviest use.\n\n(View larger) \nReference Number Description Number Required Part Number Model SP2610X15 1 Hand Knob 2 SPX1600P 2 Swivel Nut 2 SPX1600N 3 Strainer Cover 1 SPX1600D 4 Strainer Cover Gasket 1 SPX1600S 5 Basket 1 SPX1600M 6 Drain Plug w/ Gasket 2 SPX1700FG 7 Pump/Strainer Housing 1 SPX1600AA 8 Diffuser Gasket 1 SPX1600R 9 Diffuser 1 SPX2600B 10 Impeller 1 SPX2610C 11 Seal Assembly 1 SPX1600Z2 12 Housing Gasket 1 SPX1600T 13 Seal Plate 1 SPX2600E5 14 Motor Mounting Plate 1 SPX1600F5 15 Housing Cap Screw 4 SPX1600Z4 16 Motor Cap Screw 4 SPX125Z4 17 Mounting Foot [includes adapter (19) and screws (18)] 1 SPX2600G1 18 Mounting Foot Cap Screw 2 SPX1600Z52 19 Mounting Foot Adapter 1 SPX2600Q 20 Slinger 1 SPX0125F 21 Motor - 60 Cycle Single Phase [includes slinger (20)] 1 SPX1610Z1M",
