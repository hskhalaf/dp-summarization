However, when they arrived I noticed all the warnings on the boxes for small parts (magnets and batteries), also contains chemicals which present a hazard to health and should not come in contact with the mouth and eyes. With younger children (ages 5 and 2) in both households, I cannot in good conscience give this gift to my older grandsons. Very disappointed.",

However, there were no instructions about how to make the glow in the dark putty glow (it didn't glow), and the color changing slime did not change color. The video the instructions said kids should watch before experimenting was a dead link so no video. There was little actual experimentation or instructions. Limited fun and little education. Very disappointing. Little value for my money.",
