Like i said, VERY DANGEROUS and would never recommended this product to a parent. Avoid at all costs or risk having your baby be a victim of malnutrition.",

      "text": "Ordered replacement funnel since original is defective and will not operate the machine unless it seats correctly. No way to contact company about issue so I ordered the replacement part on 17 June. On June 29 a shipping label was created which meant it was delivered to mail out facility. July 14th still no product after more than a dozen emails all they said is the mail is slow yet it has never been processed by the post office. Its nice when it worked but plastic material degraded in less than a month rendering the entire machine useless. I hand wash in warm water but the part arrived in poor chewed up condition to begin with.",

This is a life saver and I am so thankful we found it. We call it our baby Keurig. No more cries as we wait for the bottle to warm up. Easy to use. If there's one thing you must have as a parent to a baby, it's this machine!!",
