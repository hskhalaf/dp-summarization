      "text": "No UK plug. The monitor is nice, it's certainly slim, and with multiple HDMI inputs, is good value of money. Just be aware that the mains adaptors supplied does not fit UK plugs. There is a universal transformer, and as is usual with electronics, separate separate EU and UK plugs to fit it. Unfortunately, the UK 3-pin plug has the wrong adaptor to fit the transformer, so it's pretty useless. You'll either need to steal a correct adaptor from another device (in my case the kitchen radio), or use the EU plug in a shaver socket. See pics showing transformer, and the separate EU/UK plugs.",

I just need to take a speaker/ set of speakers and can link my device up to the HDMI and am able to present anywhere to a few people on the large size screen. I am sure a setup with a Google Chromecast could turn it into a nice media streaming device.",

The one issue I have with it is that on bright backgrounds, you will see a horizontal scan line panning from top to bottom over and over again. This isn't an 'error', it's just how the monitor has been built. I chose to keep it anyway because it's subtle enough that only if you're looking for it will you find it. I'd consider buying this monitor again.",

Sound comes out from a headset input which is again ok",

The colours with the glossy IPS panel are vibrant and great to look at. I use mine either as a secondary monitor with my Macbook or with my PS4 for gaming. It works great for both. Only downside is the base is not detachable and there is no VESA mounting support. But if you don't care about mounting I would 100% recommend this monitor.",

Colours appear pretty much the same as my previous (profiled) monitor but altogether brighter and clearer. I shall profile it after a bit more use but I suspect it will require little adjustment. The only niggle I have is placing the adjustment buttons on the underside of the bezel which makes them fiddly to use, but as this is only likely to be done infrequently it's not a major problem. The software to enable adjustments to be done from the Keyboard would not install properly and I have given up on it.",

Also being the latest generation of panel from LG the response time is pretty darn good, and more that suitable for the gaming my son uses it for. Finally the stylish looking stand is really solid. it is metal and comes already attached to the monitor, no assembly required. It is probably one of the most sturdy budget monitor stands, yet looks stylish and oozes quality. I would thoroughly recommend.",

Although delivered promptly, the AOC monitor has a poor resolution, you can see the gaps between the pixels (like other customers have commented) and it is no where near as good as my 4 year old Acer monitor. Screen brightness is very poor indeed. Have used it on Mac and Windows10, on two different computers and the brightness is poor. I use Lightroom and Photoshop and the AOC monitor is no good for photographic work at all in my thinking, probably okay for general office duties but image quality also is poor. Avoid.",

For casual gaming it's more than adequate been playing Doom on it and it's fine, Civ VI is excellent, I'm sure if you where a pro gamer and every nano second counted you'd disagree but for me it great. Yes the GUI is a bit old fashioned and it's a little annoying that I've had to put a box under the monitor to get it to a usable height BUT the price and picture quality more than make up for these inadequacies.",
