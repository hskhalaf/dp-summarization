In the winter, a beard can get kind of course and scraggly, this fluffs it up nicely (especially combined with some conditioner and oil after!) and keeps my beard looking good (well to me anyway, the lady of the house wouldn't agree). I love the fact that there are no sulphates. The only bad thing I have to say about it is it can be a bit hard to get a lather going my hair when I use it on my head. I think this is probably a side effect of the lack of sulphates.",

I've been using it for about a week now and I can see a difference, my hair feels stronger and not as stringy. Definatly recomend it! Only thing is bottle is small, still worth it though.
