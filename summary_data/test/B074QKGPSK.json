I have had several larger kettle grills and one smoker type over the years; this one suits for downsized grilling, but is by no means too small. For instance, I put a rib eye & two NY steaks on and had room for a few dogs or another steak. It IS shorter than your usual kettle grill. The charcoal bowl is closer to the grill,so adjust your cooking techniques accordingly.",
