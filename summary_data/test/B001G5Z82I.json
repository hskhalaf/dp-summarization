Second, the thing has failed and now won't charge any device plugged into the docking slot.",

The remedy for this is to make sure the signal is sufficiently \"hot\" enough in order for it to not kick off. Keeping the gain output high on the source device and then controlling the volume on the Logitech eliminates this annoying little bug.",

So my nephew for Christmas wanted a portable speaker. I saw this on Amazon and knew that this would be an excellent choice. The reason I am giving this a 1 has nothing to do with the product but with the packaging. The speaker came with connections for an overseas market (different volts). Amazon made return easy and I expect to receive a credit in the future. As for my nephew, we ended up going to the Sony outlet store and getting him a speaker (at a higher cost).",

After some searching, I found a possible solution on the Logitech User Forum \"Set your mp3 at the loudest level and your Logitech Pure-fi Anywhere 2 at the volume you want. Apparently, the reason supposedly is that when your mp3 is not at the loudest, the unit doesn't always catch the signal\". So far, that solution is working for me.",

It recharges my IPOD when plugged into electricity (not when using the charged unit by itself). The sound is amazing.

It charges the iTouch when the iTouch is docked, it charges the player, when the iTouch is not docked (assuming the power cord is plugged int).",

I also auditioned the Altec Lansing IM600, and the Logictech won hands down. The only shortcoming is if you like lots of BASS -- and the best sound quality is definitely not by cranking it to the limit. All in all, you can't beat the quality at this price.",

As for ease of use and convenience, it couldn't be better. But the volume issues mean that I can't use it for presentations and large groups, as I was planning.

Other then that, it is perfect.",

Come on Logitech--get one produced so that I don't end up experimenting with others that may ultimately blow out the system if they aren't a right match. Thanks!",
