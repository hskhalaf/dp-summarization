They're actually better than the BB ones, IMO. They slide perfectly in my carpet and hardwood floors (I workout in my living room or family room.) Your feet (in shoes) don't slide off the disks. I am pleased and would buy again. (PS I'm a plus sized gal, my weight did not impede them from sliding which I wondered about. So, my fluffy gals, this product IS for you too!)",

Whether you\u2019re doing this workout or another of your own, these work great. They are holding up very well and really work your body, especially on core exercises. They\u2019re a good size. They fit my wife\u2019s smaller foot and my larger one. They aren\u2019t too big for her or small for me. For those looking to get in shape, these really help in adding balance to exercises and they intensify other workout moves very well. I rate a perfect 5/5. Thank you for reading and rating my review!",

After seeing her use them a few days, I decided to give them a try to see just how sturdy they were. I must say, these things are great! I used them in my gym on the short carpet floor and they slid nicely with my 180 lbs on them. Then I flipped them over and tried them on hardwood floor, still slid along well. I was impressed. SO after seeing the benefits and ease of use, I'm ordering a set for myself in a less feminine color.",

The combination of smallish diameter and shallow lip around the perimeter causes it to catch on the rug which causes my foot to slide off. If using it for abs, it'll probably work a bit better than the leg/groin exercises I'm using it for. That said, I've used it on my hardwood floor without incident (though I'm worried it'll scuff up the floor if I don't thoroughly sweep before using these, though that's not necessarily a fault of the product). Bottom line - works okay, and great price. Also, if you have thin carpet or hard surface floors you won't have any issues.",

I really like them! Once I got use to the amount of pressure I needed to put on them so my foot wouldn\u2019t fall off, I got an amazing workout. I use mine on Carpet and they glide right over it. Even my 7 year old granddaughter used them! Would definitely recommend these sliders.",

They work perfectly on carpet using the pink side and just as amazing on wood floors using the black side. I\u2019ve used these numerous times and have had zero issues, no marks on the floor and they slide beautifully. I\u2019m extremely happy with my purchase!",

This set lives in my living room and all of my flatmates jump on them from time to time. I use these for doing core workouts. I happen to love them. As with anything results are based on your individual dedication. They do work on both hard wood and carpet floors.",

For the tile I flip them over so the soft side is facing down, that way nothing gets scratched. So far they provide great results with my workouts, I use them almost every day. They seem so simple and easy, but they provide intense workouts when used properly.",
