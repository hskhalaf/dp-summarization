The shape and depth are great, and the little feet on the bottom of the basket are nice to keep it off of the bottom of the pot so your food is not sitting in water while it cooks. The silicone tubing that covers the handle of the basket makes it easy to lift out the basket without burning your hands, another nice feature. Love it.",

After that I decided my first accessory purchase would be a basket to contain the hot foods for removal from the pot without spillage. This one works nicely. The strainer basket is tightly woven which made it easy to rinse my rice before cooking. I love the ease in emptying the pot now when cooking eggs etc. A good buy!",

You can do the same for potatoes and other veggies. The basket is especially useful when you steam for example cut potatoes. Unlike the trivet, small pieces won't fall into the water and melt away.",

      "text": "I love, love, LOVE this basket! It fits perfectly in my 8 qt. Instant Pot. I've been using it a lot the past few weeks. I can easily fit 18 eggs in it to hard boil them (the 5-5-5 method works great for me), and it is also perfect for steaming ears of corn. The feet keep the items up above the liquid - although it WILL fit on top of the trivet that came with the pot as well - and the silicone handle stays cool, which makes it easy to remove from the pot. It's dishwasher safe, and it fits in my top rack nicely. Highly recommended for Instant Pot users!",

Overall, very happy with this purchase; and more importantly my wife loves it!",
