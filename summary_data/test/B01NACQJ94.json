The local hardware store didn't have it, so I had to make one. Once that and the electrical wiring was done (no plug was included), I got the guy running. The fan was quite loud and didn't offer good ventilation, I thought it was because I hadn't installed the aluminum filters only to find out they weren't included or forgotten. Yikes, all that hard work for a weak fan with a proprietary design with missing parts.",

It's just 3 wires so anyone with even an inkling of electrical knowledge won't have trouble. The fan has 3 speeds and the high speed is certainly not as loud as my previous range hood. The stainless matches really well with the Broan splash guard that I installed under it. It also matches the Bosch dishwasher. The light isn't super bright but seems to be sufficient. Wish it was a warmer light but I guess when cooking the cool white will work well. So far so good. Will update if I have any issues.",

If you expected this hood to provide additional light, think again. It is not going to get it done. When you head to the local hardware store to get the molding to fill the gaps, pick-up some additional undercounter lighting as well. If it was not such a pain to uninstall it, box it up and ship it back, I would be looking for a replacement. Live and learn.",

I just can't imagine anyone being okay with purples lights as that's going to look really awful while cooking. One last nitpick is the plastic covering that comes on the hood from the factory. Its a real struggle to get it off and once you do it leaves a nasty looking smudge than doesn't come off even with cleaning. We are very disappointed with this hood.",
