Well SmartCast would never start up so my tv was stuck on a screen that read \u201cplease wait, SmartCast loading\u201d. It would stay like that for hours. You could change inputs and start watching tv but but every time I turned on the tv it would show this screen. Researched it and found it\u2019s a reoccurring problem with various vizio TVs. So I returned it and bought a different brand.",

Overall the color is great, I found all of preset picture settings to be dull and dim except for vivid mode, so make your custom viewing mode by starting with vivid and color temp in cool for brighter whites and active array on High, then just experiment and tweak and you will have a great display.",

You have to change the input which requires a two-step process that includes scrolling to the side. A mild annoyance I would encourage Vizio to remedy in future generations of this TV.",

The only adjustment I did was switched to 'standard' mode from 'vivid'. Vivid was way too much for me, and made people look like oranges.

When changing inputs, the TV is very slow and often goes to a blank screen. This happens with my Bluray player and is excruciatingly slow with the Apple TV, which often takes over 30 seconds to switch. Furthermore, the TV randomly turns off, not only when switching inputs, but when content is paused for just a minute or two. The power saving feature was disabled and the problem still occurs randomly.",

Some people noted that they just added a sound bar and no big deal. My take on that is that I shouldn't have to add a sound bar to get good sound on a tv that costs a little under $500. Sound bar with optical cable sounds great but shouldn't be necessary.",

One day I woke up to the tv on couldn't figure it out, now it randomly turns itself off and on all on its own.
