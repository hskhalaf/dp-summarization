Also, the rail cushions have very little action, ball pretty much dies after hitting the rail. You just have to hit a little harder. If this table would ship with 1-7/8\" balls, better sticks, and cushions it would easily get 5 stars. I was contemplating 3 stars but we do enjoy playing on it as is.",
