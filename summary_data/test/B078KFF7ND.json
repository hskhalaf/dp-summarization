This circle is sturdy, but not overly difficult to press. Some of the metal circles are difficult to press. The cushioned pads feel nice on the palms and above the ankles where skin is sensitive.

Really wish I would have found this ring to be a great challenge especially because of the great reviews (which is a huge reason I bought). Also think it should be a little bigger it\u2019s awkward w/ the smaller size ring. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t need to be bigger if it had a lot more resistance.
