This is only because of the words you chose to teach the command, it may be different from what is suggested. For example, I used 'wait' to teach my dog stay instead of 'stay' or 'heel'. All in all this book is very clear. Each trick gets 1-2 pages with written explanation, step by step instructions, and color photos. Will be a great reference. I foster dogs and teaching them neat tricks always helps with the adoption process.",

Like an actress! I post them all on Facebook!!!! Worth buying?? Yes 100%.. Especially is you have a puppy 3 months to a year. But my 8 year old is also picking up the tricks well.
