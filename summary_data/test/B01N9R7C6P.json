We had two of the pink polkadot ones before this, and they were more pushy than this new model. We love the ripples on the chest strap to keep it from sliding. My daughter has been in thurs carseat since she was 4. Shes 8, almost 9 weighs 71 and is 4'2\". This seat is still very much comfortable and the 5pt will continue to fit for hopefully another year!",

Easy to clean and my son seems very happy with how comfortable it is. He loves the cup holders, his own arm rests and that he sits a little higher and can see more. All around another excellent product from britax.",

The padding is very comfortable. Lots of room and by far the easiest to install that I've ever seen. This thing is amazing in every way. Please do not discontinue this model!",

It is big and kind of heavy. But I love that. It feels rock solid and is obviously built above the minimum government standards. I have owned cheap carseats that are flimsy and are literally made out of flexible plastic that did not leave me confident that they would hold up in a car accident. The Britax Pinnacle doesn't leave me worried like that. Also, the click tight feature makes it incredibly easy to install properly. I love this carseat!",
