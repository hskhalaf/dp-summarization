      "text": "This is a really nice bag! Lots of flexible storage. Most of my fishing is either out of a canoe or using my Jeep as a \"home base\" as I fish from shore or wade in streams, this tackle bag has a spot for everything. Another bonus is that additional 3650 boxes are readily available locally for just a few dollars, really nice for changing seasons or fishing spots. I really like the plastic top and bottom to help with splashes and the rubber bumpers on the bottom are a nice touch. Well designed, well made, I can see myself using this system for a long time. Highly recommended if you often fish out of a canoe or kayak.",

Minor complaints would be the size of the front zippered pouch (smallish in depth) and the cheapness of the plastic tackle utility boxes. Compared to older versions they are more flimsy, brittle and the tabs that clip them shut tend to fall off.",
