I read several reviews and saw quite a few talking about how they tore apart. At first he wore them, liked how wide they were but didn't like how heavy they were. I never checked the weight and that's my fault. These are heavy to wear all day long. We, against our better judgement, decided to give them a try. Less than a couple months later the eyelet ripped off one of the boots. I would NOT buy these again or recommend them based on my own review and the reviews of others.",

The fit and finish is fine (hence the two stars), but within a month BOTH boots developed a very loud and annoying squeak when I walk. I followed all the quick fix directions on the company website FAQ to no avail. This leads me to believe it is a breakdown in the sole glue. The fact that they have a FAQ about squeaky boots is telling, isn't it? Did I mention that they've gone up in price about $50 in the last few years? Chinese junk. They'll never get another penny from me, and I can no longer recommend them to my coworkers.",

Bad: there were multiple times where one or both of the boots would develop a squeak while walking. This would sometimes last more than a week before going away. They went through 4 pairs of replacement laces. The back portion of the heel wore out very early on both boots. The front toe area coming off is why I'm needing to replace them. Its especially bad on one side. All together they did pretty well, not the best pair of boots but not bad.",

With the amount spent on these boots I will not consider this to be a wise investment.",
