We couldn't figure out how to get the scoreboard to light up. We watched youtube videos and read the directions over and over. It seems as though the led lights were broken. We spent about 2 frusterating hours messing with all 6 boards and only one of the 6 seemed to work properly. We called number for customer service and had to leave a voicemail. We are returning these boards. We had high hopes.",
