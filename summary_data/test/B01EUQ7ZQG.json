The headlight is bright enough for automobile drivers to see you at night but not bright enough to be of much use for seeing obstacles in your path in time to avoid them. Of course, it's completely useless in the daylight. The tail light is adequately bright at night but because the mounting system allows for no adjustment of the angle of the light, it mostly lights up your rear tire if your seat tube is inclined much off the vertical. You could no doubt improvise a solution to this but because entire assembly must be removed every time you recharge the light, you'd have to redo it every time. I\u2019m looking for another light.",

      "text": "I haven't used the lights yet, as I just received them yesterday, but aside from longevity after charging, I have a pretty good idea of the quality of the product. First, the charging-the cable does NOT fit well in the lights. The plastic covering the little recharge outlet covers it so the charger does not fit in the hole. Second, the rubber attachments that are supposed to hold the light in place under the bike's seat and on the front handlebars are way, way too small/short. They do not go all the way around as shown in the pictures. So far, not impressed with the product.",

      "text": "Did not have an opportunity to use these lights. The clip on the red light became unattached immediately when I tried to attach the rubber lasso onto it. The clips are attached to the lights using a screw in plastic, which is sure to break under any reasonable amount of strain. I was lucky in that I noticed this early on before I used the lights. The clip could have broken later while I was riding, after the window during which I could return the poorly designed product. I would recommend against purchasing these bike lights or any other similar bike lights. If you need rechargeable lights, you can always use rechargeable batteries with many different types of bike lights.",
