If you\u2019re just planning to use it in one place like on your kit in a rehearsal spot or practice room, it will probably be fine. Otherwise, I would just spend the extra $11 to get something sturdier. (Also, I purchased the 24\u201d bag; it\u2019s slightly better quality, but it will also not leave the practice space and just be there for cymbal storage).",

It's not super padded with a bunch dividers, but then again that's not what you are paying for with this.
