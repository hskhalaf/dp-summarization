In a salad, the flavor is (what else?) 'nutty' and a bit 'sweet.' Acidity is lower than in olive oil. If you are going to use fresh avocado pears in a salad, why not pair them with the same oil? It works for me...but olive oil adds a complexity so, mostly, I choose that. LA TOURANGELLE is a fine purveyor of vegetable oils and I have a renewing supply of my favorites. At some level of cooking, quality oils are like spices: specific ones stand out with specific ingredients.",

Although this is my first time buying food grade avocado oil, nowhere have I read that it's supposed to smell anything even remotely like this. It isn't nutty or fruity, and definitely not mild. The smell is so bad I can't bring myself to taste it, let alone use it for anything. What a waste.",

I drizzle it over my food. Avacado oil can be used for salad dressing also. There\u2019s no over powering or after taste. I even use a little to scramble eggs. It would be good if the container was larger but a little goes a long way if used sparingly. I will be ordering more on a regular basis. Good quality. This is great!",

    "title": "La Tourangelle, Avocado Oil, 16.9 fl oz",
    "description": "Size:16.9 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)| Style:Avocado OilLa Tourangelle Avocado Oil is 100% pure, all-natural and handcrafted from premium avocados. Avocado oil is processed on equipment very similar to those used to process extra virgin olive oil. The avocado pulp is first expeller-pressed usually using a centrifuge. It is then lightly filtered and \"polished\" using another centrifuge. It takes from 15\u201320 avocados to make 1 (one) 250 ml/8 ounce tin. The result is a beautiful, emerald green oil with high level of monounsaturated fats that will bring a delicious, light fruity flavor to your dishes. La Tourangelle Avocado Oil, like La Tourangelle Olive and Hazelnut oil, contains oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that may help to lower cholesterol. In one study of people with moderately high cholesterol levels, individuals who ate a diet high in avocados showed clear health improvements. After a few days on the diet that included avocados, they had significant decreases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, along with an increase in health promoting HDL cholesterol. The purity of La Tourangelle Avocado Oil makes it also an ideal partner to moisturizing your skin and hair. The skin absorbs it quickly without leaving residues. It has a light weight that\u2019s easily absorbed into the hair and scalp to moisturize. La Tourangelle is one of few remaining oil mills keeping a time-honored French heritage of roasting and pressing nut kernels into delicious oils. We are a family-owned company whose mastery of oil production is the fruit of passion, integrity, and pride. We strive to be the best artisan oil producer, dedicated to making carefully crafted, sustainable, natural products. With artisan care, we extract the seeds' essence and hidden natural treasures to create amazing products that bring delight in the kitchen and well being for the body.",
