But once we got into the warmer months there was no time for the cold temps to kill of the lice, and I didn't know until my vet informed me about the parasites that can live and breed in this stuff at the warehouse. Never will I purchase this from amazon again",

They make lots of happy hamster squeaks when they work with it. However, there's absolutely no way to tell when you're ordering which type you'll end up with. I always order white because it's easy to see which areas need to be scooped out every day, so I don't know about the consistency of the other colors/types.",

Ive used unscented natural wood chips and it works 100% better and last significantly LONGER than this crap. Im going back to old faithful!!",

But also starts to smell over time. I cant tell since I'm use to it, but my mom says it smells bad. Tge beding sometimes comes out either soft or a tad bit rough during the seasons. So you never know what batch you get until you open it. And it is worth the price, since you get 3 times more of the product. Due to the fact that it expands.",
