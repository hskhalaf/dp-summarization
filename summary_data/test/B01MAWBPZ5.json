It was low mess and had lots of dinosaur accessories. The only negative is that the dinosaur \u201cfossil\u201d arrived completely broken into hundreds of tiny sharp pieces. Even if it hadn\u2019t been broken the pieces would have probably been dangerous. I\u2019d toss the fossil parts because they\u2019ll fall apart in the sand and poke your kid the first time they try to dig for them. Other than that, the set is pretty rad and my kid loves it!",
