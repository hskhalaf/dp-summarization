My son has had no issues with making this into a shield, transforming it and shooting the nerf darts out of it. There is a slide on the shield that makes it into the shield then you push down the star to open the shield back up. For the nerf gun, you load the darts, pull back on the handle, aim and shoot. I definitely recommend this toy.",
