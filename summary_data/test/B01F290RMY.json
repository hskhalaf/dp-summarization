If you're looking for a DW style watch without having to shell out DW brand money, this is the watch for you. The Nato strap is very comfortable. The case is very slim. The lugs (where the case and strap connects) are very durable. I hit it on a banister pretty hard, the other day, right on one of the lugs, in the 'sweet-spot', with no damage. The crystal doesn't have any scratches and I'm very rough on watches. This is a great buy.",

Very stylish, comfortable and the case thickness at just 0.6 CM is one of the best watches I've owned at a fraction of the cost I've paid for other bulkier, less stylish watches I've purchased. If you're sitting on the fence on this watch, go for it, you won't regret it both in price and style.",

It does appear slim in the profile shown but the back part projects the watch up a bit, which is not a problem. Watch band is good and would be reusable on other watches.",
