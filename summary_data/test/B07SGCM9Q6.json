I don\u2019t believe this product is genuine. Update: 16/09/2020 After two and a half months these trainers are falling apart. Definitely not genuine and made with poor material. I\u2019m am running around 20 miles a week and walking around another 30 using these trainers. I\u2019ve never had a pair of Ascis so poorly made (hence that is why I believe they are fake). The box also said they were made in Vietnam. Don\u2019t buy them from this provider.",

However, anyone considering these for running in wet weather beware. The front upper is definitely NOT waterproof as the description states. I've been out in the garden a couple of times early morning when there is a light dew on (very short trimmed) grass and immediately felt dampness on my toes after just a few paces. If you are out in the rain wearing these expect to get wet feet! Summary: good looking comfortable shoe but waterproof description is misleading.",

    "description": "Ideal for those who run medium-high mileage, the GT-1000 9 running shoe offers optimal comfort and cushioning With every step. The comfortable 10 mm differential keeps the foot at a natural angle, while the visible heel gel offers cushioning and support for pronators. The construction of the upper entirely made of mesh, in the new generation GT-1000 ensures a better fit and a modern look. The duomax, an Asics proprietary system consisting of midsole materials of two different densities, is designed to provide uniform overpronation control. The excellent material of the midsole, speva, optimises the rebound characteristics and reduces the possibility of breaking the midsole. Thanks to the seamless gore-tex upper, which makes the GT-1000 9 waterproof and breathable, rain, snow mud and puddles will become part of your racing adventure, because nothing can hinder you. The gore-tex fabric keeps the water out of the shoe, while allowing heat and sweat to come out, so as to guarantee your feet ventilation and a feeling of freshness and dryness. These water-repellent properties, combined with the removable comfort inner lining, which provides cushioning and antimicrobial properties, create a healthy, year-round environment for your feet.",
