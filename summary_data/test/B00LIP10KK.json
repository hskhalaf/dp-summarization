It now uses up a huge chunk of the space in the player app, and not only that, but the ads are animated, and a huge distraction while watching a show. This is not what I paid for, and adding this \"feature\" after the fact is shady at best, stupid to the extreme as their sales are about to drop like a rock as a result. I'll gladly update my review back to 5 stars if they revert to the previous software minus ads.",

The video quality on this version is not too good even though it claim to be HD. I say it runs most of the time at around 480p which means that it drops below that while trying to buffer.

It is great for movies where elements of a scene are relatively stationary and do not need to be constantly refreshed. This is due to the underlying H264 video encoding technology.

The new software update only listed \"bug fixes\" as what what included, but really all they did was put ads everywhere! SHAME ON YOU, SLING MEDIA! UPDATE 4/11/15: I got a notification there was a software update. Hoping for removal of the ads I installed it. Instead, the update added MORE ads in the form of pre-rolls! Wow. Way to make your users hate you!",

Hopefully they make things right very soon. UPDATE: Slingbox just pushed an update to the desktop player, and now the ads are even more intrusive. Before they were static images, now they feature short video-like ads. Nice work Sling Media!",
