People complained about it pulling out their leg hair, but if you're a guy with long leg hair any roller you use will do that. I usually roll over my exercise pants anyway. I've used it a ton and it really helps break up my muscle soreness and it's easy to throw in a duffle. Highly recommend.",

I guess it's what I expected, not a miracle worker but helps stretch out the muscles a bit when needed.",
