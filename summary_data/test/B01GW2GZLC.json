I own several Hydroflasks & Yetis, but this 64oz i thought was the best in width & size, compared to others i've seen, which look more like jugs. And the neck & handle cap are very practical when carrying this chub. I havnt tried it w/ beer, b/c i mostly bought it for super icy water for the day. And the cap is more insulated than the regular sized flasks b/c it's meant for carbonated drinks. Now, if only Hydro Flask offered an elephant-sized straw!",

I usually fill it with ice on Monday and by Wednesday morning when I fill it up again (after having refilled it with water several times), the ice is nearly gone. I have not used it for hot beverages yet so I cannot speak to its performance in that regard. Additionally the bottle is heavy when filled (which should go without saying), however I've never found it uncomfortable to carry. I have not yet identified the best way to attach it to my bicycle for distance carrying though. Also, this growler doesn't show dings or scrapes very readily.",

Very sleek looking (we ordered the grey. Our friends already wanting to order one for themselves. No more worrying about breaking the glass growler rolling around in the back seat!!!!",

However the product itself does what it says. Ice stays whole for about 2 days. I didn't send it back because he works in construction and it would end up with more dents and scrapes anyway.

The only thing I am looking for is a mouth guard or other lid so I don't spill a 1/2 gallon of water on myself. Either that or I just need to learn how NOT to spill :)",

    "description": "From Tap to Trailhead. The revolutionary new Growlers from Hydro Flask allow you to take fresh, cold craft beverages on any adventure, while delivering the taste the brewer indented. The Fresh Carry System is leak-proof, double-wall vacuum insulated, seals in carbonation, and is easy to pour and transport. The cap design seals tight to hold carbonation and the unique one-handed design ensures a perfect pour. Though designed principally to keep beer chilled, carbonated and optimally contained between destinations, the Hydro Flask Growler also doubles as a coffee carafe, lemonade stand and whatever else you may dream up along the way. The double wall vacuum insulation will keep liquids icy cold for up to 24 hours while hot liquids remain steaming hot for up to 6. Double wall also means no condensation, so your Hydro Flask bottle will never sweat or perspire. Hydro Flask's 18/8 food-grade stainless steel interior is non-porous and rounded corners help eliminate bacteria buildup, as well as unwanted odors and flavors. The wide mouth is as easy to pour out as it is to pour in, and the new BPA-free Flex Cap is insulated to further protect your beverage from outside temperatures. Hydro Flasks are made from recyclable materials and are backed by the manufacturer's lifetime warranty. Features: The newest insulated growler from Hydro Flask, able to keep beer fresher for longer TempShield Protected Double Wall Vacuum Insulated Keeps Hot up to 6 Hours, Keeps Cold up to 24 Hours Durable, sweat-free powder coat finish (except for the Stainless option) BPA-Free, 18/8 Stainless Steel Lifetime Warranty Parks for All - With Hydro Flask's new giving program, Parks for All, they are focusing on one overarching goal: supporting the development and maintenance of public green spaces everywhere",
