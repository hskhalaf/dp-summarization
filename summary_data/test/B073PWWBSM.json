The color was a bit dimmer than I expected...I guess it\u2019s accurate to the product image, (I got the sea blue color) just make sure youre putting it in a brighter room because it can tend to look pretty dark. Pillows are a must. Honestly not super comfortable in general. Without pillows the back of the chair dips in too much. With pillows you don\u2019t have a huge amount of sitting room. Cons aside, it looks super cute! I\u2019m satisfied, it works with our room.",
