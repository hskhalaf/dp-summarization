Poured more water an hour later, and water was still steaming! Then 2 hours later, water was still hot enough for me to use to boil eggs...water for eggs reached boiling point in less than 2 minutes! Also, the included tea infuser was so much better than one I bought in a tea shop; no particles leak out of this one. Extremely happy!!",

The mechanism that lifts the spout lid also slides out of its connection when you open it all the way and that\u2019s a real challenge to put back together, especially when it\u2019s hot and ready to pour- which it usually is when it breaks. Either way, I\u2019m shopping for a new kettle.",

This whistle is NICE AND LOUD---can hear it wherever I am--so now I won't be damaging any more pans :) It took me a while to get the $$ together to buy this, but IT IS WELL WORTH IT.

The reason people buy whistling tea kettles instead of using their pots, is to have something that alerts them, even if they are in a different room or upstairs.

I didn\u2019t even hear the whistle. I\u2019m not deaf or hard of hearing. On returning the water had boiled out. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have a long errand. My apartment would have burned down.
