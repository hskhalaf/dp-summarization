I really like how versatile it is. They're really great for shooting in environments where I can't control the lighting and I can adjust each individual door and the matte black does wonders for reflecting. I've used it to shoot a couple of music videos and concerts and haven't had any issues using it. The follow focus system is on point and functional, tight and solid. I feel very comfortable strapping my camera into it. Professional filming set up, enhances my stabilization when filming while moving.",

      "text": "I think this Rig set is helpful for holding the camera steady when shooting video but the shoulder pod needs to be adjusted. The screw for mounting the camera slides easily to the ends and constantly unscrews by itself and could be lost so I added tape on each end so the screw is always in the center. It takes a few minutes to set up unless you always keep the camera mounted but in some instances it's better then carrying a tripod. If you can buy it in the 50 dollar price range it's worth it.",

Overall it took less than 10 minutes to assemble and works very well.
