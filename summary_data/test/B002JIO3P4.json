The backing peels off easily (important when your fingers are stiff from cold), they heat up quickly, and they last for hours. If you need more heat than wools socks will ever provide, get Grabbers. Happy feet, happy life.",

I work in an office, but its very drafty and constantly cold in the winter. Its frustrating to work in such an office where its so darned cold, but I get some relief with this product.",
