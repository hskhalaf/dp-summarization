I love the look and feel of the leather, sort of a distressed brown color.Right now with the gusset I have a real hard time getting my foot in them. But I'm having the laces fixed so I can actually tie them and the gusset removed. Then I can see how they really fit.",

But NOTE: the Sperry's listed with \"O/A\" like these, fir best to the exact size of your foot. In my experience other Sperry's still have too much space above the toe. And I'd you're like me then any space left is too much. Cause like...who needs extra space in their shoes, like seriously for what! -_- But these are great. Love em. And more on my list from this seller to buy as well. Shipping was great. They use FedEx, and the driver came right to my door and everything. Greest purchase.",

Shame on Sperry!!!",

Sad part is I wish they broke sooner so I could return them under the return policy and give sperrys another try.",
