The handles are not quite as solid when used as I would like (we initially tried a beautiful Kingston Brass...it was too big but you could really feel the higher quality difference). Was unclear if this model was Delta brand or not...after no Delta logo on anything in the packaging looked it up and Peerless is it's own brand \"backed by Delta\". Overall looks awesome and are happy with the price. Not too many to choose from for wall mounts!",

It's well-made and has design details that make it look like a much more expensive faucet. The arc is perfect for the basement sink. We took off the end of the faucet and attached a small couple so that we could attach a hose to the faucet and it works great. It is not easy to find wall-mounted bridge faucets at this price point that look anywhere near this nice. I would happily put a faucet like this anywhere in my house... and I am very design-oriented.",

It came fully assembled in the box, with the two needed washers. Would buy another one, if needed, and would recommend faucet on basis of quality, design, appearance and price.

I was afraid the fixture would stick out too far from the wall, and the faucet too far beyond that, but it's fine.

Thought about buying another type that had a hose attached sprayer and was fancier but cost was over $200 and didn't say anything about being lead compliant with California law or said didn't meet requirements.
