I hooked it up to a timer to save money because both our towels will dry with just 7 hours of heat. You have to fold the towels in thirds for them to dry better. We fit both our towels. We also use the other rungs for the washcloths. Definitely recommend",

In other words, you cannot turn it on, jump in the shower and expect your towels to be warmed up by the time your shower is over. It takes way more time than that! Finally, towels are warm in spots and not warm in other spots. Do not expect the same warming effect you get when a fresh towel is just out of the clothes dryer.",

The unit also takes about 45 minutes to heat up to a functional level, so unless you leave it on all the time, it's not that useful. And if you do leave it on all the time, you're using 120 watts of power, which is like leaving two desk lamps on 24/7.",

It takes some time for the towels to dry, don't expect to switch it on and have a dry towel within minutes. If it's on, it will stay warm to the touch, no threat of burning you or anyone else - it doesn't get hot , just warm. My parents liked it so much, they asked me to order one for them too. Works great.",
