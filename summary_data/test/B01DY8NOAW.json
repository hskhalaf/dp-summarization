I believe SYNTHA has the best flavors on the market. The taste is way better than any protein mix I have ever had. Worst part about it is that it\u2019s so good you\u2019ll find yourself making 4-5 shakes a day just for the taste. Highly recommend as it packs on the weight and muscle. Muscle recovery is also great when taking post workout. Has always allowed me to go hard everyday, even after a killer pump the day before.",
