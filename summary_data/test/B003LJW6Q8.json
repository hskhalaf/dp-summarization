Usually I use Barilla pasta, but can't find the small shells anywhere anymore. Saw these here and ordered, taste great, seem to have a nice full texture to them. I make my macaroni salad with small shells, not medium shells! These are perfect! Thank you! I can imagine they would work well in some soups too. Will continue to order them on subscribe and save as long as they are offered!",

This results in pasta with the exceptional de Cecco aroma, flavor, and consistency. Pasta easily cooks to perfection, has a great firm texture, and a delicious \u201cfresh\u201d pasta taste. It has a rougher surface, which helps the sauce stick to it. Since 1886 we have liked our pasta to be bronze drawn and slowly dried because we like it to fall into the plate full of taste, rough and always \"al dente\". Even though our taste has not changed, as we feel the same love for tradition, we have continued to improve our production technologies. Make de Cecco pasta the secret ingredient for your most amazing dishes.Buon Appetito!",
