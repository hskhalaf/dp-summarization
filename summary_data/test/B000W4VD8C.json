I typically have good experience with Coleman products (we have a tent we like) but we only used this 3 times before it completely melted. It was total junk. Incomprehensibly, the grill seems to have been made out of some type of plastic. See attached pictures.]",

This cooks quick (faster than I thought it would) and made the BEST hamburgers I've ever grilled - perfect inside and out! It is small so the burner is right next to the grill but very workable. Since camping I've come home and continued to use it instead of my large propane grill - it's just easier to cook on and clean.",

      "text": "LOVE this camping stove! Took it camping for a week in a cabin with no electricity. It worked phenomenally and have used it a few times since. The only down side is there really is no medium heat on the grill side. With the slightest turn, the flame level goes from low to incinerate. Still wouldn't get rid of it. I love it. The sides pop up to hold the top up AND block the wind. The drip tray could be a little deeper but overall it's a great option for a very small price!",

One can cook four hamburgers at a time, two steaks - for two people there is plenty of grill space. The stove burner is useful too. My only comment about that is a big fry pan does not fit unless you put the side down. The only reason I'm not giving this a five star rating is you can't turn the fire down real low. When you do it pops back up to a higher flame. I wish it came with a carrying bag and not charge so much for one separately. I would definitely buy this item again.",

It was fine for the first month but now it sounds like it has a gas leak when it\u2019s on. Second is, they need to make a cover for the grill side. If you try to cook anything but thin sliced food your gonna over the outside and the inside is still gonna be raw because your not able to trap heat in like a real grill. The amount of heat it puts off is very nice and it boils water quickly.",

The side burner is a big plus. 2 things I have noticed wit this grill is you cannot use a stiff grill brush with it, it seemed to take off the finish of the grill grates. Another thing that I have discovered is you can not cook with the lid down to get any type of internal heat, which isn't what is is made for, but of course i had to test it. overall a great little stove that i keep in my car just incase i decide I want to grill out somewhere",

You have to lift up the BBQ grill in order to get a lighter to it, which can be a pain when the grill is still hot.

I'm sure we can jimmy something, but I wish the set up weren't as sensitive.",

I would put aluminum foil in the bottom of the burner (with a hole poked out for the drain) for easy cleanup. It does make it difficult to use a griddle because of uneven surfaces, but it is possible (just be careful). The left burner will fit small pots well, but nothing much bigger than a small-medium pot. A little bit of ingenuity goes a long way with this product.",
