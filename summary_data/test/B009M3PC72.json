I think it's sensory overload and bikes in the size he would need, they don't have training wheels. This bike is perfect for him! He can balance on it, put his toys or stuffed animals in the basket, and most importantly, he loves it! The instructions to put it together were a little complicated, but all in all, it's awesome!",

It is missing 1) the seat post 2) the nuts to hold the wheels on, and 3) the pedals. Quality Control, by this company is a best VERY questionable. This is very annoying on a product with this price point. Now I\u2019m going to have to scramble to see if I can find the needed parts, just so the bike can work for the very first time.

The instructions were okay, but I had to watch some YouTube videos to figure out how to get the front brakes to work correctly. Rode the trike for less than 15 miles and started hearing a knocking sound coming from the back end. Emailed Pacific Cycle and was told to remove both back wheels and try tapping on the axle with a rubber mallet because the bearings may have tipped. That didn't work, so now they're sending me new bearings. I guess it's a good thing I'm mechanically inclined and YouTube exists!",

My assumption is that minor changes are made to design/parts over time and the company is too lazy to update the old instructions - assuming the that the buyer can figure it out.",

My only complaint is that there is only one speed, and quite frankly when my dog gets to a full on sprint (she loves to run...), she can pull my 130lb-self faster than you can when pedaling.
