The straps hold it securely to the headrest but if we go over big bumps or potholes it does slide down and have to be readjusted. This isn\u2019t any better or worse than the Chicco mirrors we have in our other car.",

This mirror has secure clips so that the mirror stays in place. The mirror moves using a little pivot and stays wherever you place it. It also is super clear and looks like an actual mirror- where as other mirrors are blurry and aren't as clear. It's also the perfect size- big enough to see your little munchkin, but not too big that it becomes distracting while driving. I will definitely be gifting this mirror to other mommys to be!!!",

      "text": "I\u2019ve ordered this product three times...because the mirror keeps snapping off and breaking. The first time was in winter so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The next two times happened during normal driving. I can\u2019t worry about a large mirror snapping off onto my babies, let alone having to keep replacing. Very disappointed and would not recommend for that reason.",

      "text": "great mirror! has two buckles, so i feel like it is very secure to the seat incase of an accident. It is bigger than you would expect but my twins love it. i use it in the house too when they are doing tummy time because it can stay up on its own and they love to look at it. Great product!",

I've only had it a couple weeks so I can't vouch for long term quality, but it seems to be very sturdy and I expect it to last for quite a while. The mirror doesn't jiggle around and hasn't fallen off the headrest (a common complaint I've seen about carseat mirrors in general). I looked at a lot of different carseat mirrors and reviews on Amazon that were almost twice as expensive, and I'm so glad I went with this one.",

The fact that this mirror can be tilted downward is genius and allows me to perfectly see my little one. Love it!!",
