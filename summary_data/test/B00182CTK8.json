I have been wearing these same model of sandals for 10 years now, and finally felt corageous enoug to purchase them on the internet to save some money, and they are wonderful!! I hope they never stop making these shoes because they are the only sandals I can wear comfortably all day, walk several miles in and look great with a dress. A tiny bit of \"fashion\" is sacrified for heavenly comfort, but for the sliight bulkiness of the shoe it is well worth it! Worth every penny! AND you can replace the incerts, and the sandals feel good as new so they last a good 1-3 years depending on how much you walk.",

I love Naot shoes, they are quality, I wish they weren't quite so expensive, my closet would be full of Naot shoes.",

I also noticed that NAOT had free shipping on returns which minimized the risk I felt I was taking. My English friend said she ordered a size 38 which is an American 7 and that's what I ordered since I'm a size 7. I am happy to report that the size 7 fit perfectly. The shoe is very comfortable and appears to be well-made. I began wearing them the day after I got them and haven't experienced any discomfort or problems.",

I have a very high arch and am on month 9 of healing plantar fasciitis in one foot. These are great for both of those issues because the heel has a lot of give to it, and the footbed conforms to support your foot. I adore Naots as a rule because they look kind of edgy/cute and not at all like orthopedic sandals! I have a feeling these will be my go-to sandals for summer.",

      "text": "I love this shoe. In fact I have it in 3 colors and each offers a slightly different look. I find this shoe comfortable, and I have very bad feet. So I just purchased the black patent to go with a very dressy blouse and pants, so I'll be fine dancing and moving around for an entire evening. I measure 8 1/2 and find this sandal just long enough, whereas the 40 is definitely too long for me in this shoe.",

The leather would probably have softened over time, but at the price of these shoes, I didn't want to take that chance. Also, I hate to say it, but they do look a little like \"old lady shoes\". I do have two other styles of Naots (Relate and Kayla sandals) and I would highly recommend the brand. With the other shoes, I put them on and they felt as if I'd been wearing them for a long time, they were so comfortable.",
