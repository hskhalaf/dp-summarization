You can't go wrong with this classic. All the instructions are nicely labeled as well as the balsa wood parts. Several of my friends were helping me and now they are buying some as well. You're never too old for model airplanes. :) I don't think the packaging has changed since I was a kid (except for a web address and a few tweaks). Awesome!",

As long as you have foam board, pins, quick dry cement, fine sandpaper and some patience it is a very enjoyable build, with better instructions than I was expecting. Took me about 15 hours. I added a set of E-flight bush wheels and a belly pod for a more rugged look but it\u2019s great either way. The only thing I would change is buying different tissue, but that\u2019s no big deal. Final note, it probably flies great with some micro tuning but it could definitely use some more structural components around the wings so be weary.",
