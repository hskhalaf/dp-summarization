They admired the shoe\u2019s feather-like feel, impressive ground contact, and its durable construction. Though some found the toe-box to be too wide for them, it still does not affect the positive rating the shoe received.This neutral road running shoe is a good option for those who are looking for a running partner that has minimal cushioning yet durable and flexible enough to provide a more natural experience.",

I got caught in one quick shower whilst walking home, and since then, they just smell. I have tried a few 'online suggestions' to clean them, plus a few washing machine attempts, but still they are not good. I just leave them outside as much as possible now. It's a pity, as I prefer Merrell barefoot shoes as I am so tall.",

      "text": "These shoes are very light and have a roomy toebox for the minimal experience. But have a very unnecessarily tight midfoot and heel, which really bothers me. When this is coupled with the unnecessary arch support, it really begins to press into your foot. I find this paradoxical, as if you are in need of a wide toebox, you'll also have a wider midfoot. The upper lining feels cheap and is not very breathable.",

Bit stiff and struggled to get a good fit around the ankle. Definitely a good shoe, hopeful Merrell can finally get it right in the 3rd iteration, as it offers a great mid way between barefoot and standard trail shoes.",
