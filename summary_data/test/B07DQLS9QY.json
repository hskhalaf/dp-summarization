The outside fluffy material is soft enough so my powder will stick to it, and the sponge inside the powder puff is spongy enough to help prevent freshly applied make up from rubbing off and not sticking to the sponge. It is a bit \"fat\" but the sponginess compensates and can fit between the space between your eye and the bridge of your nose.",
