The first few times I felt like it did nothing and I couldn\u2019t get it to start beading on my skin! Finally, with some trial and error I was able to figure it out. The trick is to NOT rub this product into your skin. You have to very lightly apply it all over and wait about 30 seconds before you start rubbing in circular motions. Also make sure that your skin is completely dry or else it will not do what it\u2019s supposed to. Hope this helps!",

There was no stinging or burning, but I DID feel a very slight tingling. I then proceeded to massage my face and the dead skin balled up and fell away. When I was done massaging my face, I rinsed the remainder off with warm water. My skin was baby-butt smooth! I am SO impressed with this mask and HIGHLY recommend it!",
