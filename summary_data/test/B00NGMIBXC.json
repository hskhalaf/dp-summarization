The captive screws are nice, but the hardware they use is extremely low quality. Bad threading on the rear of the case lead to one of the captive screws stripping out. I think the fasteners fit before the paint was applied, but the paint is thick enough it caused issue throughout. Also, the directions are ATROCIOUS. Absolutely god awful abysmal. A step above worthless. At least they included a ton of small hardware and all the stainless stuff fit nicely.",

If you want to fit three 3.5\" devices, you can't connect one in the lowest bay, because of the bent edge. It can be solved with L-shaped cables, but most of them are bent in the opposite direction, while you can't flip your HDD because of the mount holes in the case.",

This case also just looks so nice in a room. Because of the minimalist design it distances itself from the gaudy \"gamer\" computer cases that many people are used to. Really love it.

The front panel also blocks airflow to a good extent, which is significant as the case does not feature a lot of fan mounting options. Additionally, the front USB/etc cables tend to prevent a 140mm fan from being installed; only a 120mm fan fit for me. If you like the design and are only doing mild overclocks, this is a good case. For high overclocks or strong temperature control, look elsewhere.",

      "text": "Bought this case for my boyfriend when he was re-building his gaming computer. He was going to use his old dirty ugly case, but since I have to look at it on his desk next to mine I went ahead and got this anyways. It looks sleek and simple, and with the rgb strip I put in the top it really shows off his hardware. The quality is good for the price, just be careful not to scratch the plastic window or it won't look good over time.",

The dust filter on the bottom works well and is easy to access+clean. The rubber on the bottom pegs helps with keeping the vibrations as quiet as it can. The stock fans are great and not too noisy as long as you set them to around 700RPM. It is the best mid tier case out there in my opinion.",

The side panel screws were very difficult to remove, almost like they weren't inserted well and after getting them out, didn't always fit correctly. The front panel has plastic tabs that insert into holes in the case to hold it on. Even after using the instructions to remove the panel, one of the plastic tabs broke but not a show stopper. Well built and solid.",

Pre-installed fans runs quiet and have nice airflow. Removable SSD mounts make swapping drives a breeze. Front panel pops right off to clean and swap fans.

No spot for a DVD drive, but that's only because that space is utilized to fit a couple water coolers for your processor and or gpu. 24p cable to motherboard tucks away nicely along with all the other cables to the case. There's also a compartment for the power supply so those cables stay hidden and heat from the power supply doesn't rise into the rest of the case. Very clean and efficient. It also has thumbs crews which make things easy and it matches my white monitor and keyboard. Very happy so far",
