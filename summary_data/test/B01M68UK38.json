May of the other mixers I looked at appear to be more appropriate for a studio type use, but this unit is very appropriate for my desktop given it's small size of 7\" x 5.25\" x 1.25, the placement of inputs/outputs, and the use of convenient and compact 3.5mm stereo connectors to minimize the bulk of cabling going to from the unit. Clipping indicators help to keep the levels in check. I did not notice any sound degradation when using this unit, or any annoying hissing. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",

I have tested the Loop Mixer bypassing my other mixer and directly connecting it to my audio interface. The signal is much cleaner then my 12 channel mixer. I'm very impressed, with the Loop Mixer, and over all completely satisfied. It is a great addition to my setup and I hope to see more products from this maker.",

I love having the included adapter to connect a low-z instrument like an electric guitar. But the loop bus is where the magic happens for me. The loop bus duplicates each channel in the other mixer(s). It allows me to use one mixer to determine how much of each instrument to send to an effect, like reverb. The other mixer accepts the stereo output of the reverb unit and sets the \"dry\" level of each instrument. As I say, I'm thrilled with the results.",

I'm just a wee bit disappointed in the DM2 adapter that came with it. When 1/4\" cables are hooked up to it, it gets very heavy, and the connection is not very strong at the mixer for the weight. Any movement causes shorting with the speakers. Very loud. Get yourself a better quality adapter, use it only on a flat surface, or tape it down to something to support it. Everything else about this mixer for the price is stellar.",

It could damage downstream amps if you do not. I use this to mix the sound output of multiple computers, so I power the mixer with the same UPS that all the computers use. This prevents the power-on pop from damaging my amp when utility power fails. I haven't found any other options for 3.5mm mixers, so this is really all there is.",

Biggest problem though, is that the left audio channel is distorted through the headphone out, resulting in a really prevalent crackling sound at any audio peaks. Maybe it's my own hearing, but whenever audio is actually at an acceptable/\"hear-able\" level, this crackling is produced. In other words, I find that this mixer produces a really low audio signal compared to just plugging a headset directly to your device. Adjusting anything, whether from the connected device or on the mixer itself, results in horrible quality audio.",

I use it to port out all my seperate audio channels and then pipe them to my headphones and the output goes to the PC. it makes it easier for on the fly audio adjustments. That being said, i love the product. the only concern i have is the power button sticks. I fear it might actually get stuck and not be able to work once it is stuck. If it was made from metal instead of plastic i dont think there would be an issue.",

I hadn't been particularly aggressive with the power cable so I was surprised it happened. Still though, I got plenty of high-quality mileage for the price. I'm happily buying another as a replacement. Just be careful with the power cord if you get one, I guess.",
