Cons: The buttons are too close together, it can be hard to identify lolume - and +, and pause/play buttons. Lack of noise cancellation. Also, alow charge via micro USB is a bummer when most other gadgets are going USB C. In overall, I think these headphones are great and the cons do not bother me too much as I only paid 150 pounds on a black Friday deal.",

It's comfortable, well manufactured and connects without any problem to all my devices. If you desire something more spectacular you should try Bose or Sony.

Lasts for several days of frequent usage between charges. These headphones don't have a noise cancelling function but they do block out a lot of noise due to their design.

    "description": "Color:Gray\"\n\nWherever the day, or night, takes you, you can listen to music the way it was meant to be heard with the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H4 Wireless Headphones. Designed to move you as they move with you, these wireless headphones feature pristine Bang & Olufsen Signature Sound that delivers pure and well-balanced bass and treble with a clear midrange and a wide sound stage. No strings attached. \n\nThe pure sound quality of these headphones is backed up by a clean and minimalistic Jakob Wagner design that takes things back to basics while maintaining a sleek, contemporary edge. Honest and simple materials speak to time-tested quality and put the focus where it belongs: on the pure essentials. The headband of these over-ear headphones is crafted with soft lambskin leather for longwearing comfort, as are the outsides of the memory-foam filled ear cups. The cool sliders are made with stainless steel, which has been PVD-coated and hairline-brushed to a sleek and elegant finish. Ear cup discs of stamped, polished, and anodized aluminum echo the clean look, while cords are encased in braided textile and left partially visible between the slider and headband, adding a hip and durable design touch.\n\nMusic is social, but the headphone listening experience can be very personal. With the Beoplay App, users can further personalize the experience by matching sound profiles to particular activities or environments. Select a preset ToneTouch sound profile for working out, listening to podcasts, commuting or relaxing, or the app can intuitively adjust the tonality to find a sound that suits you best.\n\nWhether you\u2019re exploring a new city or rediscovering your own, these lightweight Bluetooth headphones won\u2019t slow you down. When a call comes in, simply use the on-device controls to answer and the built-in omni-directional microphone and clear Bluetooth 4.2 technology will allow you to communicate freely. The generous battery life of these headphones lets you enjoy up to 19 hours of playtime on a single 2.5-hour charge, so you can keep moving and experiencing life\u2019s adventures set to your own soundtrack.\n\n\"",
