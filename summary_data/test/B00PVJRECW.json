I'm not giving it five stars because the first ball we received went into the garage and came out with a puncture on one of the seams (we don't store machetes in our garage, but not sure what it hit). Regardless, it is obviuosly not super-quality but at this price I feel it deserves four stars. A replacement ball was sent expeditiously. We just had to go to the trouble of repacking the deflated ball and taking it to the UPS store.",

So you don\u2019t have to worry about that when buying it. It\u2019s an outdoor ball so you can use it both outdoors and indoors. It won\u2019t pop or anything if you dribble it outside. Another thing is that it\u2019s a 29.5\u201d .ball My favorite part about it is how it looks when spinning in the air because of its color scheme. It\u2019s an overall amazing product.",
