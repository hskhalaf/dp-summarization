      "text": "I purchased this because I live in an apartment and can't change light fixtures or switches to use a system like Lutron Casseta. I love how its all plug and play. Just connect the hub to your router, screw in the bulbs, and use the app to connect everything. I also connected my Hue system to my google home to give me voice control. I lost wifi one day and had to actually use the light switches, and just about lost my mind. I was so used to being able to use my phone or voice. If you are looking to get into the smart home game, this is a great first step. Get it.",

They seem to work great, are cheaper and are easier to set up and you have more choices when it comes to available components.",

      "text": "I hated getting up in the night to reach for switch to turn off the bed lights. So I started the home automation project and these bulbs are a great addition. They are easy to install and integrate seamlessly with Alexa. Plus, I like that you can dim them down to 5% and they don\u2019t even flicker. I was also skeptical that it wouldn\u2019t look good as a naked bulb in my scone, but it just looks great. Highly recommend for any automation project The only downside is price $19/ bulb kinda steep.",
