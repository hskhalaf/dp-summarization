I opened the unit and saw that there was a bolt that was not securing part of the wires in the unit. Also the batter tester wire was not secured to anything. It was just flopping around and could have touched another wire and shorted out. Returned the unit and decided to go with a different brand. BEWARE if you purchase this. Make sure all wires are securely connected inside!",

Would of been nice if the mfg. would put a couple brackets on the back of unit for AC power cord and two cables instead of having to wrap them around the handle. Very nice charger/booster with the 200Amp capability. Would purchase again, and stay away from the smaller units with no booster.",
