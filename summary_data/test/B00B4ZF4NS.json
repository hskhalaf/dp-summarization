Customer support is responsive but they just told me that it only has a one year warranty and told me nothing about the replacement rubber stops. - You get what you pay for. Will probably buy something a little more expensive but hopefully more durable.",

All made out of durable materials it seems, does not feel cheap like some products. I am very pleased with this product and will not hesitate to purchase this item again should the need arise. I will definitely check out their other products.",
