I did not get the listed number of servings per canister so I weighed how much the provided green scoop delivers and discovered that it provided 1/3 more product by weight than what was labeled on the \"serving size\". So just fill the scoop 2/3 full or use a smaller scoop....that is what I did. I wrote the company but they did not seem to think it was a problem. I did. When you use the correct amount it mixes and tastes much better.",

The one taste great (milk chocolate) without that aftertaste. It doesn't overload you with carbs or sugar to achieve the taste like others do (BSN). And lastly it's one scoop per serving with is a plus since it will last you longer, there might be cheaper options out there like EAS but you use double the amount to get the same result. So in the end it cost you more money in the long run. Will be ordering this again.",

Since the differentiating factor is taste and texture for me though, I was not happy at all. It is disgustingly sweet, to the point that when I mixed it with water instead of milk, it made me gag. It also tends to form clots, even though I use a shaker bottle with one of the easy-shake balls. I work out a lot, and drink 2 protein shakes a day, so I want them to taste at least ok. Will not buy again",

Think it\u2019s time to find a new brand although, I was impressed with the quality just can\u2019t deal with the issues. ** update now only 35$ but a pound less.",
