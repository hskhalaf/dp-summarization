Base is very muddy too. I bought on sale for 129 and doesn\u2019t sound better than \u00a320 headphones. I am surprised who are these people saying it sounds great. Noise cancellation is very limited. In my one day of use it blocked 80 pc sound from train and 50pc from tube. It didn\u2019t block rumbling sound or chatter whatsoever. So average performance there too. I do not recommend this product whatsoever.",

I could use them for several hours during my trips, and they never bothered me. While this model, being superior to those mentioned in many ways, lacks the simple user comfort.",

The ambient sound is a nice feature though. For the price these just aren't worth it I'd go for a cheaper pair for sure. One thing I will commend Sony for in this case is the battery life its quite impressive to spend 6+ hours listening to music constantly and still have 100% battery left.",

If your happy with average-in-class sound quality but are buying primarily for the noise cancelling then go buy Beats Studio 3 instead (don\u2019t be a snob until you\u2019ve tried them - you won\u2019t beat their noise cancelling, it\u2019s insanely good). These Sony\u2019s feel cheap, don\u2019t include a nice case and don\u2019t provide any form of effective noise cancelling that I could detect, other than the natural dampening of having sponges over your ears. With the Beats, the ANC is so good I have to lift them off my ears whilst vacuuming to check the vacuum hasn\u2019t run out of battery as I cannot hear it running.",

Provides multiple settings for noise cancelling, ambient sound control and normal mode. Ambient sound control is great for phone calls where you can hear the surrounding but also your call. Hands free phone calls have great sound with almost all background noise being cancelled out. Would recommend these headphones, comparing to the next level up pair, these are great value for money with only a slight improvement in sound quality on the WH-1000MX3.",

Tried NTM - ma Benz and the voices are insane and bass is crazy whilst being just right. It s like finally being able to listen to a bass line or low breathing, it s part of the magic. Folk music sounds lovely and jazz too. Worth putting in your shortlist",
