      "verdict": "Overall, the Skechers GOwalk Revolution Ultra received high praises for its comfort and durability. The sock-like fit and extra cushion afforded by the pillars also pleased reviewers. Though the upper was stretchy and easy to slip on, the softness of the material meant that the side-to-side support was inadequate. There were also gripes about the durability of the outsole and the lacking arch support. However, the footgear still came highly recommended because it was a very comfortable walking shoe.",
      "pros": [
        "Almost all of the consumers regarded the Skechers GOwalk Revolution Ultra comfortable for extended periods of standing, walking, and even working out",
        "The width and size of the footgear were deemed perfect by many people",
        "Numerous reviewers liked the sock-like style of the trainer because it was easy to wear and fully covered their feet",
        "The durability of this product impressed plenty of purchasers",
        "The cushion offered by the pillars at the outsole exceeded the expectations of multiple owners",
        "A small number of users raved about the lightweight nature of the merchandise"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A minority of shoppers were dismayed that the upper of the Skechers GOwalk Revolution Ultra was too soft and did not offer lateral support",
        "The outsole of the footwear got quickly worn out, as stated by more than a few testers",
        "The arch support was insufficient, said a handful of buyers",
        "A couple of commenters complained that the shoe was difficult to get on"

      "text": "Love these shoes for my standing desk. Only problem is they're really bad going up hills which I didn't buy these for anyway. The heel could definitely be more supportive. When driving its not comfortable, like the back of the shoe has a gap between the sole and it starts to pinch a bit. First pair I ordered was way too large for an 11.5 and I returned for an 11, which is now tight. I think the first pair was just mislabeled. Pretty good shoe but I wouldn't buy these again. I love the bottom of the shoe and would try another GoWalk series for sure.",
