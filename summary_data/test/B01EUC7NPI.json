      "text": "I bought this to replace carrying around a laptop when we travel for fun. It weighs just over a pound and is easy to carry around. I love all the features like the built in micro-USB port, and the included micro-USB to USB 2.0 connector cable, and the high screen resolution. The fact that I can upgrade the storage space to an available 2TB is mind blowing. Having up to 13 hours of workable time is another great feature. I bought a 128GB SD card to see if that is enough space for now. My wife thought we might need to get a wireless keyboard, but once she saw how large the on-screen keyboard is said that is perfect.",

I can use it all day long, watching movies, TV, have all of my platforms available, photos, music, use Word, and not run down the battery. Recommend a rapid charger for this, or charge it overnight because it does take a while. A bit heavy if you have to hold it. Recommend a good, sturdy case for this, like the Unicorn Beetle Pro Series, which also has a clear front shield.",

I would highly recommend recommend ithis so far. If I had it to do over, I would have spent a little more for the 32 Gig storage model, although I haven't even used the external SD card storage as of yet so that will likely be a non-issue.
