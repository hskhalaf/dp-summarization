I had it on a tripod taking pictures of dear on my deck when it started buzzing. People report this issue after a few days, few weeks, and in my case a year. Very unreliable and the camera has even been recalled in japan from what some people were saying. Very disappointed in Sony. Waste of $650",

A really wonderful photo tool for folks who don't want to be bothered by bulk and weight but still seek good, memorable, photo shots. The addition of the hot shoe is appreciated although Sony''s \"accessory\" viewfinder is out-sized in both bulk and price. The pivoting LCD screen is a very major upgrade and much used. The accessory grip that Sony has created seems like a poor copy of Richard Franiec's original design but works well enough although it feels cheap. Overall, this is a great little camera for the photo enthusiast who values traveling light but well.",

Between the very good RAW capture, manual controls, and F1.8 (when zoomed all the way out), this is a truly great portable camera.

It is a fantastic little camera that is super portable, yet it takes really nice and quality photos. Another part about the camera that I really like is the wifi capabilities and how you can transfer photos directly to your phone or pc. Not to mention the fact that you can use your phone as a remote control for the camera! Only downside to this would be the price... but you get what you pay for, and with this you're paying for quality.",

When I received it, the only thing that I could tell after very close inspection was maybe a fingerprint on the front of the item. Other than that, the entire camera appeared completely clean and new with no scratches anywhere. All accessories were present, and the camera functioned as it should for being turned on for the first time. The box was original and appeared a bit dinged up. I highly recommend anyone considering a used purchase to trust the amazon warehouse.",

    "description": "Capture detail in low-light conditions with Sony's Exmor R sensor and f/1.8 Carl Zeiss glass. This pocket pro boasts an ultra-sensitive ISO 12800, Wi-Fi sharing and an expandable shoe system. Better yet, a lightning-quick AF can focus in as little as 0.13 seconds. Suddenly, this award-winning camera just got a whole lot better. Input Output Terminals: Hi-Speed USB (USB 2.0), Micro HDMI, Multi/Micro USB Terminal, Multi Interface Shoe\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony Cyber-shot\nDSC-RX100M2 Digital Still Camera \n\nWhen beautiful scenery inspires the artist within, capture every exquisite detail with the compact Cyber-shot RX100 II. You\u2019ll enjoy extraordinary light sensitivity, breathtaking image quality and beautiful background defocusing thanks to a newly developed 1.0-inch back-illuminated CMOS sensor and F1.8 lens. \n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\nNEW 1.0 INCH EXMOR R\u2122 BACK-ILLUMINATED CMOS SENSOR\nExtremely high sensitivity and remarkably low noise are achieved by Sony\u2019s massive new 20.2-megapixel Exmor R CMOS sensor. Its back illumination technology collects light more efficiently and combines with image processing advances to bring noise to unbelievably low levels \u2014 equivalent to noise one stop lower sensitivity in the renowned RX100 II.\n\nLARGE-APERTURE F1.8 CARL ZEISS\u00ae VARIO-SONNAR T* LENS\nLegendary Carl Zeiss optics and unrivaled Sony imaging technology merge in a compact, high-performance lens that offers supremely accurate performance, powerful 3.6x (28-100mm at 35mm equivalent) optical zoom capabilities and an enormous F1.8 aperture with almost perfectly round seven-blade diaphragm for beautiful background defocusing.\n\nINSTANTLY CONNECT TO SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS\nTouch your Android\u2122 smartphone or tablet to the camera to create a connection. No setup is required beyond downloading the free PlayMemories Mobile app to your device. Made possible by NFC\u2122 technology, once connected, you can remotely control the camera\u2019s shutter release from your mobile device and instantly receive the captured image via Wi-Fi.\n\n\n\n\nEXPANDED ISO SENSITIVITY\n\n\nWith a new Exmor R\u00ae sensor that features the same adaptive noise reduction technology from Sony\u2019s flagship SLT-A99V, the RX100 II easily offers a wide range of sensitivity from ISO 160 to ISO 12800.\n\nEXPAND YOUR SHOOTING OPTIONS VIA MULTI INTERFACE SHOE\nA Multi Interface Shoe lets you attach wide-ranging accessories for photo and movie shooting. These include an electronic viewfinder, powerful external flash unit and stereo microphone. You can also connect with a compatible remote control via Multi Terminal.\n\nVIEW EVERY SCENE CLEARLY ON THE TILTABLE LCD\nThe 3.0-inch, 1,229k-dot Xtra Fine monitor displays scenes extra clearly, even in bright sunlight. It can be tilted up to 45\u00b0 downward to shoot over crowds or up to 84\u00b0 upward to capture pets eye to eye. You\u2019ll enjoy clear, faithful reproduction thanks to WhiteMagic\u2122 wizardry, which combines white and RGB pixels to boost brightness and visibility.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nCAPTURE DETAIL IN LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS\nWith a new Exmor R sensor that features the same adaptive noise reduction technology from Sony\u2019s flagship SLT-A99V, the RX100 II easily offers a wide range of sensitivity from ISO 160 to ISO 12800.\n\nHIGH SPEED AUTO FOCUS\nHigh speed Auto Focus To improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor R\u00ae CMOS sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera\u2019s BIONZ\u00ae processor, which provides intelligent response data to a new high speed actuator motor in the lens. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds even in low light.\n\nCOMFORTABLE CONTROL RING FOR MANUAL OPERATION\nA unique control ring around the lens works in combination with an intuitive, displayed user interface for meticulous SLR-type control over settings that satisfies even the most fastidious users. The control ring can be assigned to adjust various features (at various values) from basics like zooming and aperture to creative functions like Picture Effect. Moreover, it turns smoothly and seamlessly, allowing quiet, click-free usage while shooting movies including a new step-zoom function that enables instant selection of commonly used focal lengths.\n\nCAPTURE JPEG FILES, RAW FILES, OR BOTH\nThe DSC-RX100 saves pictures as compact JPEG files and/or ultra-high quality RAW files. RAW files save images prior to de-mosaicking, white balance, sharpness and color enhancement. This retains maximum latitude for enhancing the image on your PC.\n\nFULL HD MOVIES AT 60P/60I/24P\nCapture HD Movies in your choice of super-smooth 60p, standard 60i or cinematic 24p, all at Full HD 1920x1080 resolution. AVCHD\u2122 codec delivers stunning picture quality. MP4 codec offers smaller files for easier upload to the web.\n\nAUTO OBJECT FRAMING\nGive your photos a professional look with Auto Object Framing. Featuring advancements like exceptional two-person portrait capability along with Face Detection and Tracking Focus, Auto Object Framing not only turns ordinary photos into stunning compositions but does so automatically recognizing the scene then cropping accordingly.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FUNCTION BUTTON\nAssign up to seven different functions to the function button, to allow quick access to your most frequently used functions.\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT\u00ae WITH 3-WAY ACTIVE MODE\nOptical SteadyShot\u00ae image stabilization reduces shake and blur by countering camera movements in both horizontal and vertical directions. Active 3-Way stabilization adds digital rolling control that counters clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation, resulting in more stable videos even at long focal lengths. Active 3-Way stabilization adds digital rolling control that counters clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation, resulting in more stable videos even at long focal lengths.\n\nAUTO HDR MODES\nCaptures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle\u2014and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot (up to 6 EV stops). Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.).\n\nCREATIVE STYLE SETTINGS\nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, B&W, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste.\n\nFACE DETECTION/ REGISTRATION TECHNOLOGY\nThe camera can automatically detect and register up to eight individual faces and adjust focus, exposure, white balance and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. Can prioritize children or adults.\n\nMULTI-ASPECT RATIO RECORDING FOR STILL IMAGES\nCapture still images in any of four aspect ratios \u2014 1:1, 2:3, 4:3, or 16:9 (vertical to horizontal). This provided the freedom to choose a ratio that matches the scene or the specific shooting purpose.\n\n3.6X OPTICAL/7.2X CLEAR IMAGE DIGITAL ZOOM\nMost digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom digitally doubles optical zoom for closer photos.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT MODE\nRealize your creative potential with Picture Effect, a fun and simple way to convert ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes.
