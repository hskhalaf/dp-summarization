      "text": "Okay, first of all this is a very inexpensive microwave (don't know how it can be manufactured and sold at so low a price). So for the price it is an outstanding device. Yes, with 700 watts, you have to add about 50% to your normal cooking time (versus a 1200 watt machine). Yes, maybe it's a little bit more complicated to operate, and you have to close the door a little more forcefully than you might expect to make it run. But for the money, it's a little dandy!",

I can't address the lack of venting or power issues mentioned on other reviews because I don't use this microwave for heating up food; I use it for heating up bean bag heating pads. And it works great for those. I would say that if you have minimal needs such as heating up a single cup o' noodle soups in dorm rooms (vs full meal for family of 4), this is perfect for those needs.",

However, I have now had the microwave for a little over a year. Slowly but surely things started going wrong. Sometimes the START button wouldn't work. Now it doesn't work at all. Sometimes the first six numbers wouldn't work. Now the #5 button doesn't work at all and the other numbers are acting up. I have a coffee maker from Bella that has problems. My suggestion, if you see an item from Bella run, don't walk to another brand.",
