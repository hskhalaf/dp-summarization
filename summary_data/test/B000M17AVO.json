I knew precisely what I was getting so no complaints here... although one would think the price of PS3 Remote Controllers would have come down significantly in price. I am pretty sure I paid right around $20 when I first purchased one with my PS3 four years ago now... If nothing else it should at the very least be cheaper than a new PS4 Remote control (which at the exact same price point it isn't).",

Setting up the controller was fast and easy and it is so much easier to use to watch films. We like this controller and we are glad we purchased it.

We only use it for this reason so I can't really comment on the other features it has. It was easy to set up ... even the \"non technical\" person in our house could set it up.

Good stuff: - Battery life is really good (probably because it does not have a backlight) - No need to point it at the console. - Fits your hand well.",

It's a nice thing to have when watching movies through your PS3, but I mean you can basically do everything you need with the regular controllers. It's just kinda nice to have an actual remote with all the buttons laid out for you to see. Then again it's just another remote control added to the collection. Eventually I'll get a Logitech Harmony One remote to replace all my remotes. It does it's job though. It's worth $20, but I probably wouldn't pay much more than that for it.",

Please note: You have to turn on your PS3 before you even try to use it or set it up. Read the manual and you'll be fine. BUY THE REMOTE and you'll have a swell time. I sure did. Bye. :)",

Remote controls should always come with the items they were meant to control! Having said that, I think this remote does what it's supposed to do with the typical Sony refinement that the company's known for. It looks and feels like the remote that CAME with my Sony XBR LCD television. It's a lot easier than trying to control Blue-Ray/DVD playback with your PS3 controller. Fork over the 20 bucks. You'll be happy you did after getting over your initial bitterness about having to buy something separate that should have been included in your PS3 purchase to begin with!",

And it has volume control unlike the PS3 remote. So if you are using a recently made Sony TV you might want to experiment before deciding to buy this remote too.",

I give it 4 starts out of 5 because there's only two minor complaints: the buttons don't light up, and it doesn't charge via usb like the controllers do. As I said, those are minor complaints and they don't bother me too much. Overall, I highly recommend this product to anybody who is using their PS3 as a media player.",
