      "text": "This model is still reasonably priced and fixed the major issues of the previous versions (accidental card removal, trashing the data and often the card) and not seeing the viewing area. The one big outstyanding issue is the small amount of internal memory. If you use theis for a long duration, the 50 seconds of internal memory is more of a hinderance when repalcing batteries, etc. Why bother ?",

I took it to the lake with my girlfriend and tried going underwater with it. There is a terrible sound that it makes when you go from above to below water. I almost thought I broke my speakers. It was real quiet ...then BOOM! Then back to quiet again. I paid 85 bucks for it, which I can see as fair, but was still a little disappointed with the features.",
