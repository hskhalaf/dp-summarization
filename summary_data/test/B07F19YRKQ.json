They are light and the soles seem quite resistant to wear. My main criticism is they are far short of comfortable padding. An insole is a must. I infer this was scarified for lightness but they do not absorb impact well at all. I would term them reasonable and would still buy them again. Cactus",

Mesh is what makes the comfort and the feel is nice due to its ability to hold up with the lateral movement involved with tennis. Three stars because the box came heavily damaged; the 3rd party I got this through on Amazon only covered it with a plastic bag with no padding. Surprised it the shoes made it cross country.",

The only thing with this shoe is that it appeared to have some kind of defect to it, nothing too noticeable just like the shoes weren't identical. They are good quality. I do recommend ordering a half size up. Also these shoes are meant for people with relatively narrow feet so maybe consider ordering the wide foot. Don't see why these are $140 though.",
