Frame is rigid and let's you but the power down well. Did have to adjust the brakes to get maximum stopping power, buts that not uncommon with rim brakes. I put about 200 miles on this baby ahead of the triathlon, which I completed this weekend, and this baby was rock steady throughout. Looking forward to putting a lot more miles on this baby.",

Bike works great and again, highly suggest for beginners/advanced riders.",

My bad since I had paid cash and had no receipt even though I gave company the serial # and they could see it was new and not stolen.",

Also be warned that the shifters are twist shifters and after a couple of months they became loose. I just pushed them back on, but I fear it might begin to be a bigger problem in the future.",
