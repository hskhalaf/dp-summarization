I was a pour-over fan for a long time because I taste a clear difference in the coffee-brewing methods; pour overs are much smoother and do not have a metallic taste that I suspect comes from the way most coffee makers super-heat the water. I also like that it does not have a heater for the carafe so the coffee can begin to cool as soon as it's brewed and I can drink it sooner.",

The fill hole is relatively small, and the volume marks are hard to see be cause of the dark tint. Solution: fill with a 2 cup measuring cup! Solved.",

The lid on the mug is also not the best for drinking your morning injection of life. The lip on the front poorly done. I get the fact it is there to reduce splashing from the brew process, however, it enables liquid to escape from the side of the raised lip and then run down your face. The rim should be the same height all the way around to prevent the loss of valuable nitrous to your day.",

Also sometimes the steam with fog up the black tank at the top, but that is aesthetic and does not affect anything. All in all I say it is worth the money.

As to the smell, and flavor (mild), which I attribute to the plastics, it is true. However, I ran a 50% solution of vinegar through the system and received an excellent cup of coffee.

Talk about stupid... Also, the reservoir plastic is quite dark, so as others have said, it is very difficult to see the water level.",

When you fill the water container and coffee container at night so that it is ready for you to start in the morning there is no indicator that tells if the maker is on or off. I filled it one night and turned to do something else in the kitchen and it started brewing the coffee with out me touching anything. It needs a light to turn on when it is in on position.",
