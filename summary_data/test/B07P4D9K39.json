As far as installation goes, it was pretty straight forward and I had no problems connecting it to my WiFi network. I even connected it to my Echo show with no problems.

Motion detection is very sensitive and motion detection zone selection needs to be refined if used in higher activity areas. Adjusting sensitivity down helps, but still lots of false triggers, not clear in video what triggered the detection, possibly delayed recording by the device. The settings options in the app is not intuitive and needs to include some descriptions of what each settings actually control. Overall, very good for the price if comparing to the $200-$300 models out there. Hopeful of Remo sending out software updates, if so it will sell out easily!",

All the research and recommendations indicated this was a good device and a smart choice, and it's held up its end of the bargain. Installation and set-up were straightforward, app is easy to use, picture is clear and works well on both wifi and cellular data. Two items that I'd like to see a little improvement on are lag (detection/notification seems a little slower than I'd expect/prefer) and detection nuance (still not able to perfect my zones and sensitivity). But for the price (~$80 when I got it) I'm MORE than willing to manage those issues.",

Pro: I don't think they intended you to use it this may but you can silence your doorbell by selecting none instead of mechanical or digital. This is good a DND mode. I wish this feature could be scheduled or there was a quick toggle. Con: The video is very fisheye. When you are watching live it can correct the image, however, you lose some edges. Also, watching recorded video I don't see this as an option.",

My playback is not working properly it is nothing but a black screen, very disappointing. Bottom line in my opinion if your wanting security go with the name brand competitor if you want a toy go with Remo, half the price half the quality.",
