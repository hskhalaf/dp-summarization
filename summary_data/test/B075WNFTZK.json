      "text": "These look like great poles but the chrome finish on them had multiple chips on both poles from shipping I assume. My concern is that when your skis hit the bottom of the shaft, I would almost guarantee you knock off the shiny paint and see dull black underneath. After a season I think the finish will look bad. I returned to sender and purchased the Lollipop Ziplines. Those came today and my first impression is that they will look better longer because they are designed black at the bottom, so scratches will be less noticeable..",

I guess you could say I am a bit of gear junkie, when I saw this color I had to have them. These things are durable but the technical aspect of these poles are far better than any aluminum pole I have used in the past. Yes they may cost a little more but they will also perform better. The thing I like the most is the swing weight is the perfect balance for me.",

The only reason I gave these 4 stars is that one pole broke, seemingly for no reason, the first day I used them. However, Amazon sent me a new pair within 2 days at no charge, and I have had no problems with them, so my guess is that the first set of poles was probably damaged in shipping.",
