      "text": "These are great. I had a chance to compare these to Bose noise-cancelling headphones on a very long international flight. While the Bose are definitely superior, you only notice that you're missing a little extra noise-cancelling once you put the Bose on. To try to quantify, they're about 85% as good at noise cancelling (at 20% of the price!). They also have nice features vs the Bose, such as being able to listen to music without Batteries (although Batteries are required for the noise-cancelling part). Finally, they're more adjustable than the Bose. My wife always complained that the Bose were too big for her head, even on the smallest setting; these, however, fit her perfectly.",
