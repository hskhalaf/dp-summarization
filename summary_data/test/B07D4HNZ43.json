For being Stride Rite I am disappointed with the overall build of these shoes.",

Totally my fault, but I had to then reorder the correct pair and finally return the wrong size and now my grandson absolutely LOVES them! He loves to show me how they light up, and they look super cute on him as well. He is 5 years old.",

We thought about trying to glue them back in, but we couldn't think of a glue that would stay pliable enough for using inside a shoe and not leave a hard, irritating ridge.",

Of all the stride rite shoes from amazon or anywhere, these surprisingly were the least durable and worst quality. I ensure I won't re buy this pair.",
