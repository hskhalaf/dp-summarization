Also, the rubber seal around the lid was warped in several places so I'm not sure it will seal properly to be water-tight when it is locked on. I already tried to post one review with pictures showing all the damage, but it was rejected - what's wrong Amazon? Don't want accuracy in your reviews?",

The one down side is that my unit's \"Keep Warm\" setting seems to run on the hot side. So attention should be given not to let your already finished dinner become overcooked by keeping the \"Keep Warm\" function on too long.
