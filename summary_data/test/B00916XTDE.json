Overall great toy chest.",

Very well-made and great for any other type of storage, too. Available in other colors, as well as personalization. I liked it so much, I bought one for my daughter, who loves it as much as I do. I highly recommend this toy chest.",

Also, the bottom is a thin vinyl sheet and not reinforced with cardboard. Great for a toy box you plan to leave in place or for lightweight storage of yarn, winter sweaters, or blankets. Just not anything heavy. Unsure if I'd want to stack it either.",
