Even though I hate that my MacBook Pro is no longer a laptop, this product saved me hundreds of dollars at the Apple Store!",

The cover where you put in the batteries screws out, and you screw it back in using a slot that is designed to work with a coin, a really nice touch. I've even used a fingernail in a pinch. And it's quiet! Incredibly quiet. Perfect for typing around other people. Best portable keyboard I have found.",

It takes almost no desk space at all, pairs immediately upon activating, and definitely contributes to greater typing accuracy due to mandatory hand placement. It has a very nice tactile feedback upon keypress and is as responsive as any wired keyboard. The fact that it matches my aluminum fronted iMac is another plus.

I have found no failings or short comings in it - only positive attributes. There are less expensive options - but this keyboard works well, looks good and (fool that I am some will say) I trust Apple's products as they have generally served me well for the last 26 years.",

As for battery life, I haven't had it long enough to know how long that is.",

It syncs easily, the batteries last forever, it's lightweight, comfortable, and easy to use. And it'll work with my mac or my work pc too.",
