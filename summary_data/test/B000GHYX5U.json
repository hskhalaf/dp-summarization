At the birthday party of my grown niece, she confided in me that as a child (about 30 years ago) she loved my aftershave and even how she could sense the aroma in my luggage when I came and visited my sister's family. I know my spouse does not like the other family favorite, Old Spice, and I decided to try something that would last me even though expensive. The non-alcoholic Obsession for Men Aftershave Baum is perfect and very soothing, and I can use it quite sparingly. No one remarks on it so I assume it is not overpowering. And I love the scent myself.",
