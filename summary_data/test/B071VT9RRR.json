The deep fried turkeys were a little dry but not this one. The best part is that it is a LOT healthier than deep frying and easier to clean up. I injected Cajun Creole butter and rubbed it with oil and lime juice and slathered it with a spicy rub. 16 pound bird in the fryer for 3.5 hours. Don't listen to folks telling you 10 minutes a pound... here in Ohio it took 3 1/2 hours.",

      "text": "This is the best product ever! We camped over Thanksgiving weekend and didn't want to deal with gallons of oil or a turkey fryer. A friend mentioned this 'oil-less' fryer and we ordered it right away. We hooked it up to a propane tank, dropped in a 16 pound bird and had an awesome, juicy turkey in 3 hours and 20 minutes. We only checked on it to watch it cook. It will cook more than turkey but we haven't tried roasts or veggies yet.",

I had to re drill 4 holes in the legs to actually get them installed which cost me an extra hour to assemble. It appears that quality control is very limited in the manufacturing process. I'll review the actual workings of the fryer once I have used it a few times.",

    "description": "Style:FryerThe Char-Broil Big Easy TRU-Infrared Oil-less Turkey Fryer is the stress-free way to fry your turkey. With no hot cooking oil to purchase, splatter, or dispose of, the Char-Broil Big Easy gives you a delicious, safe, and simple alternative to oil-fried turkey. The Big Easy uses infrared heat to cook a turkey from start to finish just as quickly as oil-frying - and, of course, food cooked without oil is healthier, too! The meat is always cooked evenly inside of a double-wall cylindrical cooking chamber, powered by a fully enclosed propane burner. Char-Broil's patented Heat Wave infrared technology prevents flare-ups, eliminates hot and cold spots, and delivers juicy, crisp, and flavorful results every time. Safely cook a turkey (up to 16 lbs.) or chicken in about 8 to 10 minutes per pound, (slightly longer for roasts and most other large cuts of meat cook), there is no waiting for the oil to heat up. You can prepare your bird or meat with the same injectable marinade you already use, or you can use seasoned rubs on the outside - which is not an option with traditional fryers. Experience the flavor when infrared heat circles the cooker to penetrate the meat evenly and seal in juices. The result is a bird that's moist on the inside and crispy on the outside without the risk, hassle or added fat and calories of oil.",
