It hasn\u2019t disappointed and my wife and I sleep much better not worrying about whether he is too hot or too cold. The only thing we don\u2019t like about it is that the fan is a bit too noisy above level 4 (with the narrow air stream) and just noisy in general with the wide air stream. This limits how high we can set the level while our son is sleeping. This is really nitpicking though. Overall this was a great purchase.",

I had been using a space heater in each area to keep the chill away and wanted to replace each with something more energy efficient. I have had a Dyson vacuum for years that I absolutely love and decided to give the AM09 a try. It serviced both areas quite well and contributed to lower electric costs. I am using it this summer in the same areas as a fan to keep the air moving. It's quiet, energy efficient, has a great space saving design and can be used year round - it's terriffic!",
