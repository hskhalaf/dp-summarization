      "text": "The first impression by the looks of this device is astonishing, innovative and very premium! Not rubbish at all, even from its price value standpoint. I've listened several music genres and it never let down at all frequencies. Even though, on amp-mode \"off\" these headphones sounds phenomenal and crystal clear, without mentioning turning the amp-mode \"on\"! It's like you're at in the middle of the soundstage, while listening music. By my opinion, one of the best headphones on the market right now. Many users complain about the heavyweight issues, but however I do like it somehow. It's every penny worth it and I think I may call this as a worthy statement. Good job Blue!!! \ud83d\udc4d",

I did not find it too heavy and the pads are deep enough so my ears where away from the speakers. Very beautiful design, solid and well built. I use them in passive mode as one of my studio monitoring cans, and with the iPhone/iPad. I really enjoy listening to music on the Mo-Fi.",

I got to try them out listening to some jazz and yes, definitely worth the price, (although less expensive would have been great). Clarity and good sound and I like the way they fit on the head and ear. He's currently designing a moulded form oak box to store them in. Yes, he'd better look after them....",

Was looking for a good set to wear while working on my own music and replace my broken pair of Sony's from years ago. These are really comfortable for longer sessions, and the sound is fantastic. Even without the powered settings they are still great. Highly recommended if you are serious about your audio!",

    "title": "Blue Microphones Mo-Fi Powered High-Fidelity Headphones with Integrated Audiophile Amplifier",
    "description": "Mo-Fi is the first headphone that delivers real audiophile performance and sound quality on every device-from professional studio gear to laptops, tablets and even your phone. Oh, and we completely reimagined how it fits on your head, so you'll get both optimal sound and listen-all-day comfort. Because trust us, you'll want to. Mo-Fi is the first headphone that combines a built-in audiophile amplifier and insanely great-sounding drivers for a truly mind-blowing listening experience. Sure, this means Mo-Fi can get loud. But more importantly, it allows for the most accurate sound reproduction-so you'll always enjoy great-sounding audio, on every device. Frankly, it's surprising no one ever thought of this before-but hey, we're Blue. Innovation is what we do best. Mo-Fi is no ordinary headphone. From the multi-jointed design to earcups shaped-gasp-like ears, we completely reimagined the form and functionality, without any preconceived notions about what headphones are supposed to look like. The result feels less like a headphone, and more like a high-quality instrument you can wear. Some call it radical. We just call it Mo-Fi. Unlike other headphones that put more bass in your face whether you want it or not, Mo-Fi lets you choose the right sound for your music. No DSP tricks here - this is analog, baby. No matter if you're listening to 70s-era rock, modern pop, orchestral, hip-hop or something else, you'll have total control over your listening experience.\n\n\nMain Features\n\n * Output power:240mW\n * SNR, self noise:> 105 dB\n * Noise:< 20 uV",
