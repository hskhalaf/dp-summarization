Mine didn't come with a wall mount bracket, but it does have two holes in the back where screws/bolts can be installed to hold the sink to the wall. Was a little more work to install it, but I still would buy another one if needed for a small bath.",

The sink itself was just what I needed for a tiny half-bath, basically a converted closet. The 4 stars for easy to install was only because the sink is small with the area to hide intake pipes is only 7 inches wide.",
