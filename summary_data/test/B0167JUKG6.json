Tried it two different times both of which turned orange and very streaky, I didn't give it a 3rd try i threw all 3 bottles away. Wouldn't dare give these away unless you want them to look like a streaky oompa loompa.",

There is not the usual unpleasant odor associated with self tanners. I can put this on after my shower in the morning and wear it all day. Most other self tanners have had such an odor that I wear them awhile and then shower again to remove the scent. This lotion has a pleasant mild scent. The color is natural and gives skin the look of a sunkist glow. I will definitely buy this product again and again.",
