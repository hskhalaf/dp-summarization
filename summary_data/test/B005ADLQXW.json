While these are a tad too big for my tall 9 year old, they offer maximum protection, comfort and they look amazing. Almost pulled the trigger on a more expensive brand, but glad I didn't. Couldn't be happier.",

The only thing he doesn't like are the straps that go right behind the knee which hold on the flap over the knee joint. The straps rub and the flap flaps when running. The flap is removable which solves both problems, but exposes that area of the knee. Overall I would recommend these. They provide great protection, are durable, and lightweight.",
