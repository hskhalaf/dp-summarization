It's a perfect size, has silicone on the bottom to prevent sliding and scratching, silicone grip on the pestle so your hand doesn't hurt and it is a comfortable shape, is a perfect size and even dishwasher safe.

The fine-textured interior of the mortar provides just enough friction to make a good powder but doesn't impede movement of the pestle.

I understand that the bottom and inside of the mortar couldn't be slick/polished because it would scratch and get all messed up by all the crushing of the pestle, but with that being said, it not being polished caused us to not be able to get all the medication out of the mortar. There was always a coating of crushed meds left behind, even with scraping. Other than that, it's a great product.",

Peanut butter, cheese, mixing it with her food and even trying to hide in chicken broth didn't work. She would eat what was around the pill and spit the pill out. But now, with the EZ-Grip, we can \"powderize\" the pill and spread it onto a piece of lunch meat (preferably ham), make a roll up pressing the pill into the lunch meat and she eats it every time. The EZ Grip works perfectly and we are very pleased.",
