As the day progressed and some older ladies tired from the heat I allowed them to use my chair and both ladies said it was a blessing. I also allowed a small child who was overheating to use the chair. The chair was such a big hit. People started asking how much would I charge for 15 minutes in the chair. The chair is light and portable. It is easy to set up and take down. I love this chair.",

Having an attached sun/rain cover has proven very valuable when we're out camping, paddle boarding, attending festival concert, etc... After nearly 10 years of use we did see these chairs start to break down. Tears in the seat cushion near the arm on one, and the plastic feet will crack where the frame tubes attach, making the chair unusable. We didn't see problems start for almost a decade, so it's still a pretty durable chair compared to most.",

I always buy canopy camping chairs in this price range & my last ones lasted 10 years I don't see why with proper care these wouldn't last just as long.

You are going to wish that open area was anything but open. I figured out a janky way of using the bag as a make shift shade. That overlooked detail kept me from giving this chair 5 stars",
