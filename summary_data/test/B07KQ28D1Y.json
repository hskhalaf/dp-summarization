In addition, its durable build and surface traction leaves a good mark on those who have used this boot.However, its toe box configuration leaves a lot to be desired because of its restrictive design.

      "text": "This boot described as waterproof allows moisture to seep through the outer layer of the boot. Usage has not been heavy but the left boot boot leaks like a sieve . The boot has not been used during periods of rain or any bad weather. The fault has shown itself whilst walking through low level grass moistened by early morning dew. The fit is good and the boots are comfortable but a waterproof boot should actually keep out water. Unlike my old Berghaus boots long round laces the new pattern has a much shorter 'civilian' flat lace which does not allow for double knotting. Consequently, occasionally the lace can come undone.",
