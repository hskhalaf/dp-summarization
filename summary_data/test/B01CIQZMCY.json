They fit beautifully on middle and top row of stand without touching the bottom or rubbing together. The stand is also very stable even if the mugs are on one side. Just for reference, there are 2 styles of mugs here; one measures 3.5 inches high and about 5.5 inches wide and holds approximately 24 ounces, the other style is 3 inches high, 5-1/4 wide and holds about 18 ounces. This stand easily holds all 8 mugs. I would order this again!",

I do wish it were a little higher so I could actually fit mugs on the bottom rack, I didn't realize I would have that issue until after I purchased. So basically only the top 2 tiers are usable unless you prob something under the rack which I was too nervous to do. I have mine displaying my Rae Dunn and it's really cute. Another complaint is it's actually hard to get a mug on and off without hitting or taking off other mugs. the hooks are too close together in my opinion. But for now it is okay and looks cute.",

It says (and shows) that you can store mugs upside down or by the handle, but we store them upside down because hanging them by the handle isn't effective for the bottom level. We have big mugs, so we're unable to use all of the hooks on the top level, but that's a minor matter since we're able to store twice as many mugs with this one than the one that toppled over. I'd highly recommend this to anybody looking for a way to store their mugs.",

Then, I am unable to use the middle tier because there is not enough clearance. I can put two cups by the handles on each hook on the top tier. So overall I am not losing the capacity.

Some of our mugs are heavy, hand made pottery; and the rack is well designed with a wide and heavy enough base that it can handle the weight without compromising stability. There are 15 hooks, but be mindful that the bottom ones are too low to use for hanging mugs. So consider it something that can hold up to 10 mugs. The lower hooks do, however, work well as a place to dry bottles or thin bud vases. Overall an attractive, sturdy, and space-saving choice.",
