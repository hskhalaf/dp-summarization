The wiring provided is maybe 18 gauge, in any event thicker than other light kits I have used, which is good. These are claimed to be submersible, and the LEDs and their driver boards may indeed be sealed, but the housings are definitely not sealed against water entry. This may be by design, so there is no buoyancy effect, but water can go in and drain out of the housings. To be safe, I mount the taillights with wingnuts and pull-apart electrical connectors, and remove the taillights before backing my boat trailer into the water.",

So it was only natural that when we purchased a second trailer, we came right back here and clicked ORDER AGAIN. They came again, just as they should, installed nicely and have been working ever since. Would definitely recommend this product. Wouldn't hesitate to order again. (which I did)",

The wiring in them was faulty, lights would blink when hitting any kind of bumps (other trailer lights work fine, so we knew the issue was with the lights and not on our end) Save yourself the money.

Built my own kayak trailer based on a Northern Tools kit. After trying 3 other kits (original set, a Northern Tools replacement set, and a Wally-World set,) this is the only kit to have separate ground wires. The other kits have a thin metal shim off the mounting brackets that is supposed to act as a ground. Lack of a solid ground on the cheap kits caused trailer light failure with three vehicles. The LEDs are noticeably brighter than bulbs. The better quality of this kit is worth every cent.",

Not sure what it is made of, but it looks like cheap aluminum with a copper coating. Checked in several places and the same condition was observed. So the issue with non-working taillights is due to resistance. The current can't travel through all of the oxidized and pulverized wiring. Unbelievably poor quality!

Another reason, the ground wire just comes apart. You can't even strip the wire without it breaking or strands pulling out. Someone has a video showing this and that is what is happening. A bummer too, because they were so bright and worked well.....for a year and a month....disappointed.",

I've tested them on my trailer, launching my boat over 5 times now, with no issues. As far as the wiring quality, the wire shipped to my was just fine. I used it to rewire the trailer and had no issues. Although there's nothing exceedingly exceptional about this product, I'm giving this a five star as it did exactly as described.",
