I can use my phone with them on (iPhone X) but durability is almost non existent. Also-I bought them in XXL and they still barely fit, once they're on it's ok but getting them on is a struggle.",

Great glove except for that stupid velcro tab that only works for a couple weeks. Are snaps a rare commodity now? That is scary. There used to be many snaps, and other types of closures too. It seems wherever these are made they can't get snaps, I'd like to send them some because I love these gloves except for that velcro tab. They could make me a custom pair with snaps instead of velcro, which is how they should have been made in the first place. Great gloves.",

That is coming in handy this winter as I am biking routinely in the upper 40 and 50 degree range. I will definitely find something else as the weather turns warmer.",
