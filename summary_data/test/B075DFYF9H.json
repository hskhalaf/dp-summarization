Well, it made my face break out more than I have ever broke out and I wasn\u2019t having horrible breakouts, just a few. It never reduced the scars nor help heal the breakouts and it dried out my skin. I am so disappointed in this product and regret wasting my money on it. I do question all of the ingredients as they are not detailed on the bottle. Never again!",
