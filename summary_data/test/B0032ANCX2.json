I feel like the gel works better and a little dab foams up into a fairly firm foam to go a long way and stands up to get a very smooth shave. There is never any irritation and skin feels smooth and well moisturized. The gels all have a great scent too. I am glad I can buy them on Amazon for a reasonable price and quick delivery.",
