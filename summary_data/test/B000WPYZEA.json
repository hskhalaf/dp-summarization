This product is backed by H&R Block, the leader in the tax industry. You can even call a tax professional and ask a question at no charge if you get stuck. You also receive free audit assistance if needed. You may be able to find cheaper but is it really worth it? Especially if there is a risk of security? I think not. An accountant, by the way is just that...an accountant, not a tax professional. I've used this company for the past 10 years.",
