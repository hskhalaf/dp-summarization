      "text": "I didn't notice that the plastic that holds the bristles on one side was pulled away and cracked until after I used it. I should have inspected it when I unpacked it before using it. I found the handle a little slippery even though it has 2 small rubber knobs. I gave a 3 for softness because one side is soft like it is supposed to be. The other side is harder like it is supposed to be. If it had a better grip so not so slippery and if it did not come cracked I would give it a much better review.",
