While any broadhead will kill a deer when the shot is perfect, the huge cutting diameter of these heads puts them down when the shot placement is less than ideal. Face it, if you bow hunt long enough, you're going to make a bad shot. This broadhead helps put meat in the freezer on those occasions.",

Nice not to have to deal with rubber bands or collar. Just load and go. Open on impact. Everything has its trade offs but I would recommend trying it and forming your own opinion. Edit. Used on a buck worked flawlessly shooting 58#",

The built-in clip design eliminates the hassle and propensity to fail of o-ring designs, and the thick and wide blades survive contact with ribs, dirt, and rotten logs, better than any other mechanical and some fixed blade I've tried. This is the only wide blade mechanical I've been able to wash off and return to my quiver. The practice broadhead places right along side my field points. I have harvested two does with these broadheads with marginal shots. The wound channels are as advertised. highly recommended!",

One of the broadheads was bent afterwards but with the damage these things do and the blood trail they produce, it's a small price to pay. I usually use fixed heads but never again, these will be the only broadheads I use with my crossbow.",
