By the way, the top handle that split open a while back, I was able to glue. I just bought this siphon coffee brewer barely 5 mo the ago! All my appliances are Kitchenaid. This one is a complete failure. So frustrating. I\u2019m calling the manufacturer. 7/16/18 After several phone conversations, my Siphon Coffeemaker will be replaced with no extra charge.",
