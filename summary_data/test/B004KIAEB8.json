The nest week my wife found a leak at a seam that was not made properly. Contacted the seller via Amazon and received a message on May 1 that a replacement mattress would be shipped. As of June 13 I still have not receive a replacement mattress. Attempting now to get assistance from Amazon. - Edited down my original review to fit Amazon guidelines.",
