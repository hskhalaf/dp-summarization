(I wanted it to be my personal item for United's Basic Economy.) The zippers are metal. Strap is comfortable. My one criticism is the adjustable strap will not stay at the length I need, but I'm sure I can rig it so it will. Overall I am very happy with my purchase for the price I paid!",

I was sure it was going to tear but, after spending a very long time on it, I did finally get the fabric out of the zipper without any damage. This is a pretty bad design flaw and I don't recommend purchase due to that.",
