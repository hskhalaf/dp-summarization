I needed to use it right away so I placed a washer over the star drag wheel and that tightened it up. I don't think this is how it was designed to be. Also I prefer the longer reel seat so I changed it out from the short one (both are included). Could not adjust the drop rate very much but I use very light jigs. Frabil is usually very good stuff, I hope I just got one that slipped through QC.",

Because of the way the line lays on the spool it caused a few backlashes and tangles. Once I striped about 70 yards off and left about 30 yards on the reel it worked great. I never had another backlash or tangle the rest of the season. I plan on ordering another one of these reels for next ice fishing season.",
