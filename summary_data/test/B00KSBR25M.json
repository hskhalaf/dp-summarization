We bought this about 2 weeks ago to preserve flowers from my wife's wedding boquet, and, per the instructions, I've been tightening the straps every day. Today, I broke one of the straps. They say 'the hook & loop straps will hold more pressure than you can put on them!' but clearly that's not true. In any case, it seems well built and I'm assuming I just overdid it on the straps.",

So far, I've pressed one batch of plants and they came out beautiful. It's also easy to carry around. It comes with many good ideas with how to use your pressed plants. This shipping was pretty quick, about a week or so. I was actually quite surprised with how small it is, but it can hold a lot of stuff! The price seemed a little high but it works well and hasn't snapped. Thanks for the awesome product!",
