For some reason she's a huge Eiffel Tower fan. She assembled it and put it on display on her shelf. We were both impressed with how neat it was, so I went ahead and got one for myself. Minus one star because the build does not stay firm at the top... you have to manually adjust the straightness of the top of the tower, and then leave it alone and make sure not to bother it.",

Of the three, the Eiffel Tower was the most complex and fun to assemble. The way it all came together utilizing hinges is really cool. When finished, it was indeed the most beautiful of the three. Including frequent breaks the model took about 3 hours to assemble. I have it displayed on my desktop in my office opposite the Burj Khalifa. They complement each other well, the old world meets the new world of architecture. Look forward to building another.",

    "description": "Presenting the LEGO Architecture interpretation of one of the most iconic landmarks ever constructed - The Eiffel Tower! Designed and built by French entrepreneur, Gustave Eiffel, the original 324-meter-tall masterpiece of wrought iron engineering formed the grand entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. During construction, the 18,038 wrought iron elements making up the tower's lattice structure were bolted together at Eiffel's factory on the outskirts of Paris, before being transported to the site, hoisted into place by steam-powered cranes operating from the elevator shafts and assembled using no less than 2.5 million individual rivets. The resulting structure was extremely rigid and over the years has withstood storms, floods and everything else mother nature has thrown at it. Today, The Eiffel Tower is one of the world's most popular landmarks, attracting millions of curious visitors from around the world each year. With this exceptional model, you can now build your very own 321-piece Eiffel Tower in LEGO brick form and display it in your home, office or wherever you like!",
