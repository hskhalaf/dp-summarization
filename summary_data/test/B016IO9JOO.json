Most airlines have 22inch as a max. allowable height. I will attach a photo of the bag in the overhead bin of a JetBlue A320 (a plane with six seats per row with one isle)",

Even pushing their fabric back I can only get slightly above 19\". Seems nit-picky, but when you're looking for a carry-on bag of a particular size, an inch here and there makes a huge difference.

      "text": "Have been using it for months! Great bag, very durable, good for traveling. Fits in just about every compartment on board a plane. I fly often so I\u2019ve had the opportunity to try it on regional airlines to the big airlines. It\u2019s a great bag for anyone looking for a good bag with a reasonable price. Way better than the Walmart stuff I bought years ago. Mind you, it does have some battle scares but that\u2019s only cause after a while of dragging it with me on board I\u2019ve checked it in multiple times. So far it has survived being on the bottom too.",

My only issue is that somehow during baggage handling one of the main zipper handles broke off. I was able to put one of those key rings through the handle opening and it now works fine.",

I have the smaller and older version that can fit under your seat (19in) or in any overhead bin but needed more space for a 2week trip. This held everything and I loved the wheels because it is so much easier than dragging the suitcase. It hold a lot and the 2 pockets help to keep things organized. When it is fully stuffed and you can barely zip it, it is harder to get in the overhead bin so try not to do that.",

For many others who would rather not wait at baggage claim but prefer stowing bulky bags on overhead bins, just know that waits at baggage claims are never a factor in China.

I can barely pull the zipper around the corners of the case. I sent it back today to exchange it because I am afraid it will not last on my next trip. My sister bought the same suitcase, same color, same size, a few months ago and the zipper on hers is fine. So it may be a quality control problem.

While it is larger than I wanted, the quality is great. I used it for my holiday traveling, and it has plenty of room. Be careful not to fill it all the way, to weigh more than the allotted weight by airlines.

Even with the front pocket empty, the thickness tends more toward 10\", which may catch the eye of a vigilant Lufthansa flight attendant.
