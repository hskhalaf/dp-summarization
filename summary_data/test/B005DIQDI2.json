      "text": "I got this for both gaming (because the bottom of my laptop tends to get hot) and school work (because I like sitting on the couch and my lap is too low)! The second I put this on my lap I fell in love. My laptop has little skid-proof spots on the bottom so no issues with the sliding some people mentioned. Worth the price! I wanted something simple and comfortable but didn't like the prices of the other lap desks. This is absolutely perfect. I raved so much about mine that my boyfriend bought one too so now we can game side by side on the couch!!",

I was surprised at how cheap the product feels. But this is clearly a tradeoff since the board is so lightweight! However, since I have been using this desk to do my computer-based homework, I have eliminated my overheating issues. The lap desk is a serviceable solution. It also works on multiple lap configurations, like if I tuck my legs under me and set it on the uneven \"lap\". I was pleased at how stable the product is!",

I would personally suggest a lap desk with a cooling fan if you're going to exclusively use this for a laptop, but if that's unnecessary for your purposes, then this gets the job done.",

There is a single BIG 1 foot crack in the middle because it flexes when the laptop is on it and when I pick it up to place on a table. It was used for several hours daily every day.

My only complaint is that my computer slides around on it somewhat easily so if I am leaning over and tip it a little, it starts to slide off fairly easily. But as long as you're keeping it level and/or being conscious of holding your computer in place while tilting at all, it's great! Also, if your computer has rubbery/grippy feet I feel like this wouldn't be an issue. I have a new MacBook Pro and the \"feet\" (whatever those things are called...I'm not super tech savvy) don't have a whole lot of traction.",

This lapboard is also noticeably lighter than the three owned previously, too. It is plenty large enough to hold a book, crossword puzzle, plate of food, etc. However, it would be skimpy to play real-card solitaire, if anyone plays with paper cards, anymore.",

I wasn't sure about the 2 pockets described but I like them very much. I do a lot of needle work and they come in very handy to keep tract of all the miscellaneous items that usually tend to get lost. The two cushions on the bottom gently angle the table toward you. Overall, I am very happy with it.",

This, and clip style reading light....and you're good to go. This is my second one...this new one is in the car with my beach chair. :)",
