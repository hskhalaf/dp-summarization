The best part of this phone is that if someone texts me while I'm driving, I can listen and respond through my cards blue tooth connection without ever touching anything. It's all done vocally. No preloaded responses. It takes great pictures and the battery lasts a long time. The only downfall is the preloaded ringtones suck. There's not one ring tone on here with any kind of volume, and since my ears don't work so good, this is a problem.",
