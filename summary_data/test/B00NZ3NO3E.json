The knee grooves are nice and deep and soft. The hook for the rope is small but my rope handle stayed on just fine. I was able to get up and ride (for a short time) when I haven't even tried in ten years.",

The handle holder is awsome, it even allows me 200lbs to get up with out having to hold handle. Also you can place handle back on holder for a quick break on the arms without stopping, just pick it back up when ready while the boat is at speed. Wish they had this when I was a kid. This is my kids favorite water equiptment.",

On the hook of the board around the corners are some rough edges as well as on the very top of the hook on the surface is a very rough texture/abrasions. In addition to this, on the top of the board is also some dry watermarks (not sure what else may indicate this board was used then that). The overall aesthetic of the board is sleek and appealing but I'm disappointed with the imperfections it carries for being a \"new\" board.",

Had this board for a month now and my son is already carving and jumping in the water. Used it with my boat and Waverunner and it worked great. I even was able to do it at 42, 185lbs!",

Wakeboard-styled quad, cupped molded fins make edging and carving a breeze, while allowing release for spin-type tricks. The water-ski influenced edge bevel helps the bard sit low in the water for stability and allows quick edge to edge transitions when carving. From the built-in hook that makes getting up easy, to the super-stable ride that beginner and intermediate riders will love.",
