My dinner plate leftovers heat up in 3 minutes or less. Cons: None that I've found!

I wanted something that would be used to warm up lunch, but if it breaks down, like our previous microwave in the office, no tears would be shed over losing out on an expensive microwave.

Having said all that, at this price point the manufacturer probably cut back on some of the electronics. I get that. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who asks.",

I only used it for reheating , and after a few days it started making scary sparking noises... I was worried that it will explode in my kitchen. Also, the door didn't locked properly and I could even see the light coming out of the door edges. Seriously I don't know what crap was this.",

Only down side so far is that the stainless steel areas never seem to stay clean. They look scratched and fingerprinted already but I guess that is just a poor characteristic of stainless appliances anyway. Great price.",

Only loses a star because the keypad doesn't allow an exact time to type in. It just cooks for as many minutes as you poke a button, and have to hit extra time to bump it up by 30 second increments. Not a huge problem, just a strange interface choice, particularly when dealing with a low wattage oven that require more time to cook the same amount of food. Doesn't make me regret buying it.",
