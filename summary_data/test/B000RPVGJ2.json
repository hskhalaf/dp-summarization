When it needed to be replaced, I went back to Amazon to purchase again, and was amazed at how the price had gone up. Because it was my favorite mouse, and fit my hand perfectly, I ordered it again anyway, despite the expensive cost. Then something happened in my life, and I didn't get a chance to actually install it (comes with a CD) until the 30 day return period had passed. Turns out it doesn't work with Windows 10. Wish I could return it, but I'm stuck with a mouse I can't use.",
