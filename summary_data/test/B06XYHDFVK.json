      "title": "For a photographer, fabulous!",
      "text": "As a hobbyist photographer, I decided it was time to upgrade my aging monitor, and after a lot of research I settled on the ViewSonic VP2768, and I've not been disappointed. The colours are fantastic - and it's defintely helped me getting colour-accurate prints, being 100% sRGB - and the clarity is great, and at 27\" it's plenty big enough. My only gripe is that the auto-rotate software seems flaky at best, but given that I didn't buy it for that functionality (and I'd rarely use it in portrait mode anyway), then it doesn't warrant losing a star. Oh, and as an occasional gamer, it's held up perfectly well for the games I play :-)",

To add to this, constant flickering with black screen which I assume the monitor just turns itself off for a second. It varies to when it happens... I have installed the drivers and ensured all the connections are in place. I can only say at this moment that I am happy about the visual but no so with the current problems with this monitor.",

Even had the pleasure of unpacking from original packaging which Viewsonic do really well. It is up and running and meets all my expections, thought I would never be able to afford a really proper display for my Photoshopping. I will comment further when I done some work on it. Thanks! really great value.",

I always planned to purchase dedicated speakers as my purpose for this monitor is video editing, so I built speakers wouldn\u2019t cut it anyway, so I\u2019ll just buy these sooner rather than messing around with returning it.
