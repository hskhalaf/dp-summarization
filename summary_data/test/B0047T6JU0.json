I had originally purchased one similar from Pier One for $250, I didn't realize I would need two and did not want to pay $250 for another so I have been on the hunt for an identical one ever since! The one on the right is the Pier One shelf and the one on the left is the Amazon one! And they look basically identical! Very happy!",

My shelf ladder bookcase only had TWO of the FOUR holes hollowed out but came with all 4 pegs. Because I am not able to put pegs in and line them up with their corresponding holes the upper half of the ladder shelf sets off to the side of the bottom shelf. It is also missing ONE pre drilled hole for the screw on the side of the boards. I am unable to contact the company but really wish to tell them about these issues.",

This makes for a cleaner, albeit, permanent, join (which is what I wanted). I also coated the shelf surfaces with water-proof water-based polyurethane...since I intend to put plants on them...it worked perfectly. Only thing I would add for the manufacturer...include screw cap covers so the finished product doesn't have exposed screw heads. I bought some at Home Depot which makes the whole thing look much nicer. Overall, for the price, this is a great deal!",

A couple of other reviews mentioned this, too. It's fine, isn't really noticeable and works for me, but I wouldn't put heavier things on it. Like I said, still recommended. It looks great (looks more expensive than it was), the assembly was pretty easy to figure out, and it really elevates my living room.",

It was cheap, looks good standing over there in the corner and went together easily enough. The pieces don't go together perfectly but it's a bit on the rustic side and that fitment seems in character.",

It is very obvious too, but since that area of our room is dimly lit, we decided to keep the shelf. Taking it apart was just not worth it to us. You get what you pay for.
