Over one Saint Louis winter the rivets eroded sufficiently so that the riveted steel edge strip came loose, and the aluminum blade was too flimsy to shovel snow. This affordable snow shovel has a plastic blade with a riveted steel edge strip, but the rivets are inset in depressions: the rivets are not eroded during shoveling. And the shovel's plastic blade appears stiffer than my previous shovel's aluminum blade. I am confident that this affordable shovel will last longer than my former US-made aluminum-bladed snow shovel.",
