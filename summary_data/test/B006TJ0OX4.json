It leaves your pores SUPER CLEAN, and also has that kinda tightening feeling on your skin. I have COMBINATION skin, previously OILY skin, so I think this may feel too drying if you have dry skin.

Regardless, I'm happy with this product and it's generally the only face wash I use. It's great for sensitive skin and combination acne prone individuals.",
