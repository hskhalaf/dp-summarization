It's a bit too tight on the sides since the vehicle seats are a bit large for it. I expect it will eventually rip at some of the weaker side fabric, but that's an easy repair while modifying with a section of elastic, if necessary. It also has some extra height that gathers a bit at the top of the seat, but again not a big deal. The color is a perfect match for the beige interior. Very nice quality.",
