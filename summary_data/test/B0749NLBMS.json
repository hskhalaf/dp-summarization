The stand has an adjustable wooden \u201cfoot\u201d to hold items upright and the rubber grips hold it sturdily in place on the edges of the tub. My cat already has used it as his personal bridge and it didn\u2019t even shake or bow at all. The only slight problem is that the stand alone will not hold book pages open, but I used a cheap elastic headband and it works perfectly! You could also use any bookmark designed to hold your pages open. Great value for the price!",
