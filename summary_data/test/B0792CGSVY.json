It does not crease either!! I was really surprised and just love mine. As soon as the kids seen it come in they wanted a movie night indoors. I'll have to come back when I get pics and see if I can add them or a video because all the kids invited their friends and I totally forgot to show everyone how it looks.",

It is almost impossible to keep the black boarder straight due to the elastic material this screen is made of. If you don\u2019t stretch it the black boarder sags. If you try to prevent the black boarder from sagging you have to stretch the material which makes the screen look like a web shape. As you can see in the picture the screen is super thin and you can see right through it. Definitely one of those \u201cget what you pay for\u201d. I will more than likely be replacing this.",

Returned it, and bought this one based on reviews saying it wasn't too thin. This was easy to put up, and looks great. I saw a few people said that there were wrinkles when they got their screen, but I can't notice any wrinkles at all with the screen up. Projector looks great on it(only 300 ansi) too. Really happy with this screen and company for making my basement fun for movies and video gaming. Would happily buy other items from this company again.",

This is because of the uneven amount of stretch on the top and bottom, though our projection was still perfect, so I think it is worth having one side look weird. The hooks it comes with was pretty crappy, so I don't recommend using them. one came off and took paint off my wall.",
