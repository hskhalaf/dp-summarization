The downside is that it can take a bit. It\u2019s not something you want to do the day before going to the beach, as you\u2019ll have dead skin coming off your feet for at least a few days. Plus, if you\u2019re not diligent about exfoliating you\u2019re feet are going to itch as the skin peels off over time. So, works exactly as advertised, but it\u2019s maybe not something I\u2019d recommend for a relaxing experience. It\u2019s a bit different from a face-peel or mask.",

The stuff that has come off my feet during this process has been unreal. to think that was on my feet. I will get this peel again and I plan on getting my daughter some as well.",
