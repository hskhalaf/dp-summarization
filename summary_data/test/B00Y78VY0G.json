You do have to take care when using it and hold the drill as steady as possible while letting the blade cut its way through the lumber. Don't try to force it. Well made and nicely packaged.

The use of a hole saw let me cut out perfect holes exactly on the laser mark without leaving behind a mess of drywall dust at all.

    "description": "This Hole Saw Kit Makes it Easy \nJust set the cutter to the correct size and attach it to a drill. It will cut a clean hole while trapping all of the dust and debris inside its plastic shield.\n\nA Complete Kit \nEach kit includes an all steel hole cutter, specially designed dust shield with full ball bearings, extra blade for various surfaces, adjustment wrenches, and a durable storage case. The saw is fully adjustable from 1-3/16\" to 8-5/8\" and cuts up to 7/8\" deep on one side or 1-3/4\" deep from both sides. \n\nEliminate the Dust and Mess \nDrywall and plaster dust can be a nightmare to control, especially when working inside a furnished home. Dust and debris is captured inside the hole cutter's transparent cowl rather than going airborne and making mess. \n\nReplaceable Blade \nInexpensive replacement blades are readily available and can be changed in seconds. \n\nFull Lifetime Warranty \nOnly the cutter blade and pilot bit are not included in lifetime warranty but are fully replaceable after normal wear.\n\n*Not for use on uneven surfaces such as plank siding",
