I had only worn them a few times. It was a loud obnoxious popping sound. I decided to wear them to walk in because I would not hear the sound with my headphones on. Well after I finish walking, I look down to find the pink band was falling off. They are pretty and comfortable for about 4 wks then they are ready for the trash. I am really irritated that I wasted our money .",
