It does require some practice, but once you get the hang of it, you can get some lovely shots with a great depth of focus. For macro, get a tripod or something you can stabilise your camera with. Would look get further lenses my Neewer now I've got the skill down.",

      "text": "Excellent out of the box performance. Sharpness is good throughout larger apertures, while build quality is on par with more expensive kits. Fantastic for the price. On a crop sensor (APS-C) 35mm equates to a 56mm focal length, which is almost ideal for general subject-based photography. The only dislikes I have about the lens are that the focus wheel is slow moving (i.e. requires reasonable effort to twist), and the aperture wheel is free moving throughout 1.7-22 (rather than click-based movement). Both of these are minor as they are simply down to personal preference.",

      "text": "This lens has made getting my Sony a6000 worth it. I only just had enough budget for the camera and its kit lens, but getting this has made all the difference. It works amazingly in combination with the a6000's focus peaking (which lets you tell what's in focus when using the lens's manual focus). The pictures look pretty great. They obviously aren't as good as something much more expensive, but they definitely do the job and as someone just getting into photography this lens has been what really taught me about my camera and its settings. I'm very happy with it, especially on a budget.",

This lens is great for such a low price. Yes, the manual focus takes a little practice to get right however it takes some lovely photos and creates a great blurry back ground effect when used at a low F stop. Performs great in low light and has become my favourite lens at the moment and will be for some time I think.",
