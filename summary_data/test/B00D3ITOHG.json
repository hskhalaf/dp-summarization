I do listen to mostly hip hop or rap but chose these because of the sound clarity. Beats has the bass down but I dislike how \"muffled\" they sound. These Marshall headphones have enough bass to satisfy me but the overall sound quality is what puts these over the top IMO. They do have a filter you can keep in or take out very easily as the pads are magnet attached. I personally leave the filters out. Love that sound clarity and loudness. Overall I am extreamly happy with my purchase.",

The second one is more serious in that there is slight but noticeable background noise when being used. The sound reproduction itself appears clear and correct, so again I can get used to it. The bottom line though is that the headphones satisfy my need of being able to listen to music, not being hampered by a cord connection, and not imposing my choice of music on others in the household.",

I prefer the FTF on, the highs are at almost piercing level without them, but to each their own, nice that Marshall brought that choice to the listener. Minor qualms would be the plug input on both headsets are quite snug, meaning if you're gonna pull the plug when packing this baby, it requires a stronger pull than normal, although the jacks are sturdy and seems well built, not sure if this will cause wear in time. Hoping the jack will loosen through enough use.",

They are super sturdy and seem like they will last. The cord provided is also strong. They fit comfortably as well. I can hear every detail of the song; highs, mids, and lows.
