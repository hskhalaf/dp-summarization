This mat stays in place, no slipping or sliding like I had with other mats. I finally found a mat that keeps me safe in the shower!",

I have to hold it down the edge of it when she's taking a bath to make sure she doesn't slip. This is still the best suction less option I have found though.",

I am not able to use suction cups as it will destroy the new finish of my tub. I bought this and am so happy. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to fall anymore. It\u2019s well made and does it\u2019s job.",

Also, it has an extremely strong rubber smell and made my entire bathroom stink after about a week of having the mat open in the tub.",
