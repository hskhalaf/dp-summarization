Closing it also quite diffcult and required a lot of pressure.",

It casts the lines straight forward so if you need them high you will need to have the level high i.e. a tripod is handy. I found the magnets were not strong enough to attach to the thin metal found in drywall corners but worked well on any metal thicker than that. Comes with a nice protective case.",

It's like you have to set it, then shake it a bit with the idea of setting the pendulum (heavier to light/minimal settling shake) since the pendulum may have been overtightened or underlubricated or something. It's a bit fussy but the horizontal is better than the vertical. The vertical plumb line seemed unreliable to even bother though I've only tested the vertical once up against a brand new 78\" door level. I think the horizontal can maybe be useful/reliable but you might have to learn how the lazer works in various temperatures and at different distances.",
