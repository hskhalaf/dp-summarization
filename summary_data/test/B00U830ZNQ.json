      "text": "This worked awesome on a 2 story apartment building. When you start climbing and the ladder is flexing, you dont need it to be shifting sideways on you, and this solves that problem perfectly. The rubber grip on both sides works great and it fit inside a shallow gutter and still performed great even though it was tilting outward a little. The only thing i wish was different is that it had some sort of internal bracing so that when i put the weight of the ladder against the gutter there is less of a chance of it bending the gutter. Maybe something that braces against the back of the gutter slightly. Overall: super happy with the purchase.",

You'll need a long pole to lift this up and onto your gutter. Once up there, level and rest your ladder on this and you're good to go. I climbed up to the top on a lower spot and tried to wiggle the ladder side to side. This held it in place perfectly with it's non slip rubber. Definitely allows me to work cleaning my gutters more independently. Highly recommended!",
