      "text": "I bought this a year ago Christmas for my granddaughter. I was expecting it to be somewhere near the quality of the Cozy Coupe that was popular when her mother was a preschooler in the 80's. We were very disappointed when the steering wheel snapped off when my granddaughter was turning it. Fortunately, she wasn't injured as she was going at some speed. Unfortunately, there's no way to reattach the steering wheel. I expected a quality item and for it to last many years. As it is, it lasted 16 months. Now my daughter has a large useless hunk of plastic decorating her yard.",

I had to find the bolt cap at a local hardware shop otherwise going online it was like $15! Yikes. Anyways it took forever to put together and luckily I got it weeks before my nephews birthday.
