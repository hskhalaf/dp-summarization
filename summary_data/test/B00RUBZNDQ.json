      "text": "I absolutely LOVE these heat resistant gloves. I have small hands and wear about size 6 or 7 gloves. Every pair of oven gloves or mitts I tried on were way too big. Although the photo shows a young girl wearing them, they are perfect for a woman with smaller hands. They're great for handling hot dishes or pots, but are porous and would not protect from hot liquids. For my purpose, they're exactly what I was looking for and I am thrilled to finally have found oven gloves that fit properly.",

I say this, because I have tried multiple other Gloves and Mitts and other devices for holding hot dishes right out of the oven, and ONLY this Grill Heat Aid Heat Resistant Gloves actually have come through and worked as advertised. That is not to say that you can't feel the heat, but you will have the time to pick up and carry your hot dishes right out of the oven to another place that is maybe five or ten steps away without worrying about burning yourself! Great job, SMM Group ... you have a really fabulous product here!",

You can grab ahold of the hot grate and move it around, no problem. You might feel a VERY slight warm temp increase but that's all. But you can't hold on to the REALLY hot stuff too long or it will start burning the fibers and they will start turning yellow/green and getting crusty/stiff. It doesn't catch fire and burst into flame...the heat just kinda starts deteriorating the material. So you really wouldn't want to like hold a pile of glowing red coals in your gloves. :-) But short of that, these gloves are great.",

My only complaint is that the wrist cuffs are designed for little 5'2\" housewives, not giant BBQ Gods. In other words, they are very, very tight and impossible to get on without a lot of pulling. They are really tight. If you've got grease or BBQ sauce or whatever on the fingers, they're going to get dirty putting them on. I cut off 3\" of the cuff to make them easier to get on, but they are already starting to fray. Big hands? Look elsewhere.",

I can't believe I didn't get these sooner! I did read the reviews about wet heat getting through, such as boiling water, which was great advice from other viewers. I solved this by having a second set on hand made of silicone, which are used for the \"wet\" heats. These gloves are used for everything else as they withstand a lot more heat, and are more comfortable in general.",

This doesn't mean I leave my hands in the fire box any longer than is absolutely necessary; it just means that I have a few seconds where I can safely manage the fuel going into our stove.
