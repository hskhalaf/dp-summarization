As others have mentioned, this stuff doesn't seem to work like other air fresheners by masking odors. It just takes unpleasant smells out of the equation by some black voodoo magic. The only thing left behind is a faint scent of pine/floral. I'd be guzzling this stuff by the gallon if it were cheaper!",

This is an excellent product and the refill is an economical way to deploy the crystal gel in the smaller jars by refilling them when needed.",

Has a fresh smell but not purfumey like sprays. Does not cover the smell but eliminates it. Unless you pick it up and hold it to your nose you really can't smell it.

Almost immediately after setting out two small bowls of Fresh Wave, the smell was gone! The scent of this product is a little bit like Pine-Sol, which isn't my favorite smell, but the strength died down after a day or two, or I just got used to it. But I much prefer the smell of this product to decaying mouse! I also put a bowl in the downstairs bathroom and it helps in there too. (I have three little boys who often \"miss.\") I highly recommend this product.",

My only caution is to keep them out of pet and small children (I don't know if they're toxic but I don't want to find out) and if you're putting them in a paper bowl, put a cloth underneath, the moisture will soak through.",

I put a big jar in the basement and another in the livingroom and it really takes care of that old house/old basement musty smell. I also use smaller ones in each closet. It really helps with any odors. It is not a quick fix like a spray, but you will notice the difference within a day or so.",

While it helped significantly, it did not eliminate the odor completely. In addition, the product evaporates very quickly and this seemingly large 64oz jar will be gone before you know it. It produces a fresh clean smell that didn't bother anyone which is a huge plus. Would recommend this item but don't expect it to magically eliminate all odors.",
