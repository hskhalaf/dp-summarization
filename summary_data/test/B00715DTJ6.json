In short, the problem is with the main control board. The last unit I installed in September has gone through (3) main boards. The opener is on a dedicated circuit and the garage door is perfectly balanced. Genie did give us new boards for free except for the shipping which we had to pick up. Completely unreliable.",

I understand it is not the most expensive garage door opener but the bar/ rail keeps bending and causing the door to not operate correctly do to the metal being weak... I do not know how to proceed because I have paid to have it installed plus now to repair for a 2nd time in 3 weeks.... This is awful from a name brand company.",

Also, very important, DO NOT use the wall switch to start the motor first time. You must use the buttons on the motor to set up door open and shut movement limits! This must be done first.",

    "title": "Genie SilentMax 1200 Model 4042-TKH Garage Door Opener with Motion Detection Lighting, Ultra-Quiet Steel-Reinforced Belt Drive, 140V DC Motor, 3/4 + HPc 140V Belt Drive, Gray",
    "description": "Style:SilentMax 1200The Genie SilentMax 1200 garage door opener is the perfect option if your garage is attached to your home. This model comes with a 140V DC motor that is lighter in weight and provides ultra-quiet and smooth operation, so that your family will not be disturbed by a noisy garage door opener. The soft start and stop feature of the motor offers smooth garage door travel, an improvement over AC motors. It\u2019s powerful enough for almost any residential garage door, up to 7 feet in height (or 8 feet with an extension kit sold separately). The SilentMax offers increased opening speeds, up to 9 inches per second, yet still has safety features for your peace of mind. The Safe-T-Beam system helps prevent accidents via an invisible infrared beam across the door opening, which reverses the door if an object crosses the beam of LED light. The beams are enhanced with diagnostic technology to alert you if a malfunction occurs. Even the lighting system in the SilentMax is geared toward your safety: the 2 Bulb Bright Lighting System has space for 2 100-watt bulbs (not included) and an innovative power head design that places the lighting toward the back of the garage where you need it most. The SilentMax also features a built in motion detector that will automatically turn the overhead lights on for added convenience and security! Equipped with Intellicode Security technology, the SilentMax 1200 provides extra safety by preventing unauthorized access to your garage. Intellicode is a rolling code technology that automatically changes the access code on each door activation. The opener is fast and easy to install, with a premium reinforced low profile c-channel rail that presents a clean design to help protect against dirt and debris buildup. Flush-mounting capability allows for low headroom applications and requires no additional hardware for assembly. The Genie SilentMax 1200 comes with a Limited Lifetime Motor and Gearbox Warranty, and accessories include two pre-programmed 3-button remotes, a Wireless Keyless Keypad and a Multi-Function Wall Console (Control Panel) with vacation lock and light control button. Genie\u2019s SmartSet programming makes setup for the opener fast and easy, with the simple push of a button. Due to California Senate Bill No. 969, as of 01 July 2019 all garage door openers, sold to or installed at any residence in California, must have a battery backup system included. Please search for Genie battery backup to find one that is in compliance with this law.",
