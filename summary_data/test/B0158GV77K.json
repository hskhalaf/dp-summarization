So now I have two plugs I can't use because I don't have the app. Junk to me now. If you use IOS DO NOT BUY!!",

It is one of the very few smart plug on the market that can also DIM- not just switch! BUT: the company seems to be out of business, only the iPhone app works (but even on the iPad it does not work properly). Most other apps do not know/ recognize the product/ don't support it. The ZULI app supports Nest and Philips Hue- but not the other way around. It uses Bluetooth, hence it requires your phone to be around. If you are away you cannot operate them- which really limits the application.",

      "text": "These plugs are simple enough my mom, who just got a smart phone, was able to set them up. I like the fact they can integrate with any device in your home. They have allowed me to save energy by setting \"larger\" appliances that run when I am not home (i.e. cable box, internet router, etc) on schedules. I am excited to see the other ways I can save energy!",

    "title": "Zuli Smartplug: Smart Home Control, Dimmer, Energy Monitor & Timer (Individual)",
    "description": "Style:Individual\n\nThe only Smartplug that senses when you walk into a room and adapts the temperature and lights to your liking. Plug in your favorite lamps and appliances, and you get instant control from your iPhone. You can dim lights, set your space heater on a schedule, view your entire home\u2019s energy use, and control your Nest Thermostat. With 3 or more Smartplugs, the Zuli Presence feature can accurately pin-point your location within the home. The Zuli app senses when you enter or exit a room and sets the lights and temperature \u2014 just the way you like them. No need to fumble for the lightswitch in the dark, no need to pull your phone out of your pocket every time. A smart home the way it should be \u2014 controlling your home has never been this beautiful. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nYour smart home on your phone Stay comfortable sitting on the couch, reading in bed \u2014 wherever you are in the house \u2014 while controlling your lights and appliances from the Zuli app. \n\n\u2022 Dial the perfect brightness \u2014 right from your iPhone. Zuli Smartplugs turn any lamp into a dimmer \n\u2022 Perfect for space heaters, fans, window air conditioners, air purifiers, or preheating the espresso machine \n\u2022 Zuli works with the Nest Thermostat \u2014 control your lights and thermostat from one simple app \n\nBe comfortable in every room of the house Zuli Presence senses when you enter or exit a room and notifies the Smartplugs to set the lights and temperature \u2014 just the way you like them. You don\u2019t need to pull your phone out of your pocket, or fiddle with the light switch anymore. \n\n\u2022 Never walk into a dark room again \u2014 lights automatically turn on when you walk in \n\u2022 Saves you money by turning off unused lights and appliances when you\u2019re not in the room \n\u2022 Notifies the Nest Thermostat as soon as you come home \n\u2022 Requires a minimum of 3 Zuli Smartplugs\n\n\nSimple Scheduling Put your lights and appliances on a timer, and never think about them again. Have your lights turn on at sundown, or preheat your espresso machine.\n\n\nSee How Much You Saved See your energy usage at a glance \u2014 know what devices in the home are costing you the most. A smarter home means smarter choices.\n\n\nDial The Perfect Brightness Dial the brightness of every light as you would with a dimmer, even when it doesn't have one. Now you can always make sure the mood is just right.\n\n\n\nZuli Plays Well With Others Zuli works with Nest and Philips to create a more comfortable home. Connect Zuli Presence with your Nest Thermostat to set it to your preferred temperature as soon as you arrive home. Control overhead lights using Philips Hue within the Zuli app \u2013 so you can forget about ever using that lightswitch again. Simplified control means a more comfortable life. \n\nAbout the Startup \nDescribe your product in 3 words.\n\nHandsfree Smart Home\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWe lived in a shared house with other roommates and we got really tired of people leaving the TV and the lights on through the night. So we made some primitive prototypes and replaced our light switches and outlets \u2014 and we could control them from a smartphone. These simple prototypes would lay the foundation of what would soon become Zuli. \n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nWe\u2019re creating the future of how we interact with our homes. There\u2019s no need to press a button, or to use a digital interface \u2014 your lights, your thermostat and other devices in the home just respond to your physical presence. Zuli can sense when you\u2019re in the room, and when you\u2019re away and learns your preferences \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to worry about these things anymore. \n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nWe started out with just 3 people who believed in bringing the handsfree connected home to life. Over the last 3 years, we have been fortunate enough to find other people who believe in the same vision, and are proud to have them a part of our team to build the future of technology in our homes.",
