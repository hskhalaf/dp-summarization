We live in California and I'm wearing a blanket under the tent when I play with them. WARNING: Amazon recommends the tent be bought with this product:  I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend against it. The fan is very light weight and falls over often. The holes in the fan are big enough for an adult's fingers to easily slip through when trying to turn it on and off. It is a terrible combination and I highly recommend avoiding the fan that Amazon suggests be paired with this purchase.",

We've spent the last few winters trying to assemble forts the old fashioned way (blankets, furniture, etc.) and this was SO much better. Less disruptive, less mess to clean up, and my children loved having their own space to disappear into. Arguably the best gift I gave this Christmas. Definitely recommend!",

I found that it inflated very quickly with the box fan on the 3rd setting, and then stayed inflated on only the 1st setting. (Box fan not included. I bought a cheap one at a local store) Note that with the fan running, it gets chilly in the room in fall/winter.",

I so wish they had thought of a weighted bottom. Would have been a very easy fix. This is the only reason I did not give 5 stars. If it would sit properly against the floor it would be perfect. Still a fun, quick fort for my kids though. They are pleased.",

I'd say wait until your children are a little older and can sit inside of the fort calmly as my 1.5 year old constantly goes in and out and allows the air to escape making the fort collapse often.

It\u2019s very roomy once it\u2019s blown up and all four of my kids can be in it. It can get a little cold inside the tent because of the fan but as my son said, just grab extra blankets. I would purchase this again.",

This was a Christmas Eve gift so they could camp out in it before Christmas. They are in it as I type this. They love it. Wish I found it sooner. I was worried about two things with this. 1. That it would t inflate as intended and 2. It would be too much wind inside for them to sleep in. It inflated as intended and it is not too breezy inside as long as you keep the fan on low. 5\ud83c\udf1f\u2019s all the way.",

Its very large (we can fit two adults, two large dogs, and our son inside comfortably). You also don't have to worry about it caving in and suffocating any kids since it has no bottom. It also seems to \"hover\" just above the floor so the air or any occupants can escape. It is also very cool inside due to the breeze from the fan. Overall, very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend this to anyone with or without kids of any age.",
