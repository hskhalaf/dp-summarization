But two separate purchases showed permanent creases in the putting surface that made this item unusable. It seems the new and improved thicker mat is more prone to crushing when jammed in the box with the plastic return track during packaging. A simple fix but somebody should inform the factory. I returned the worst one and used a hair dryer to fluff up the synthetic nap as much as possible.",

It's useless for any type of putting. So sad this was a failure!",

We all know it's that simple, but it's not simple to get the two things right. But if you know you're hitting your putts where you're lined up, it helps boost your confidence and you'll take one variable out of he equation and make more putts. Good luck and enjoy.",

Getting the ball return assembled was straightforward (the ball return \"rail\" comes in three pieces), although the ball return rail is more decorative than useful, as the balls tend to stop near the base of the hole rather than rolling any significant distance down the rail.",
