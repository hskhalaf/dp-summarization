They're expensive if all they are is an audible alarm for water. Without the wifi part they're useless and overpriced. I tried resetting/re-setting them up to no avail. Now waiting on customer support to respond. Unfortunatley I no longer have the boxes or i'd just return them and move on. I would not recommend these at this time.",

An extra cord can be purchased to extend the total corded sensor area. Establishing a Honeywell Home account took a bit longer due to latency in getting the Confirmation Email (first attempts took a couple hours).",

I am slightly disappointed that the most frequently you can schedule the updates is three times a day: seems like a lot of water damage could occur in 8 hours. But setup could not have been easier.",

You have to go onto the app to see the humidity level. It does not send out notifications by text or email when the humidity exceeds the limits you set. We thought we had it set up incorrectly, and finally called Honeywell. We were told it just doesn't work, they know it, they have been selling it regardless, and may have a fix in mid December. Talk about false advertising!",

Worse, even after muting the alarm, deleting the alarm, resetting the unit and removing the batteries the loud piercing alarm would not stop. I called Honeywell and they said it must be a faulty unit.",

This product came with an extension cord, that connects to the detector, to get a better water reading. The only downside, is that it takes a minute to detect water or to send commands to the detector, like to silence the alarm. However, you can also just disconnect, then reconnect the batteries to silence the alarm as well.",
