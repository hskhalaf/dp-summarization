      "text": "The best purchase I made with this order was the square trade extended warranty. The propane regulator died on this smoker about 1.5 years ago. I was able to use it for chicken and poultry where I didn\u2019t need low and slow cooking, but it\u2019s finally given out completely. Usually I would be disappointed when I only get 1.5 years on a $300+ product, but this one made me irate. I\u2019ve replaced countless regulators on hundreds of propane grills and smokers, but for some reason Dyna-Glo decided to weld or otherwise permanently attach this most vulnerable (and easiest to replace) piece on the smoker in an intentional effort to make this smoker completely disposable.",

It looked empty with 6 whole chickens on it. The 2 burners are nice and help produce some great smoke from the old seasoned oak i have stacked which we cut chips from. Not sure i had very high expectations for this smoker but it really surprised me. I think it is 1 of the best online purchases that I have made. The cover is great quality as well. I was very happy that I purchased it.",

The chimney looks crooked. I used it for brisket and I have to stay next to the smoker for 12 hour. I got great brisket but staying next to the smoker is not easy and if I knew that earlier I would've bought the charcoal one because it gives better smoking and also need continuous watch. I like how big and nice looking but I hate the temperature changing constantly",

Also, burners do not have as fine of control as they need as the smoker can spike up in temperature fairly quickly with just a nudge on a dial. Drip pan tray and Smoker tray could use better rails as it can be easy to dump them if you don't pay attention when pulling them out to add water and/or wood.",
