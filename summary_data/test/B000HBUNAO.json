This pull up bar feels much stronger than a previous flimsy version I had. Grips are tight and I haven't noticed any spinning on them. I was nervous reading other comments about it not fitting on certain doorways. My trim is thicker than normal at around 3.5 inches, but the product fits perfectly snug and safe to use. I attached a picture hoping it helps other when ordering.",

I got this primarily because handgboards for training rock climbing strength are far more expensive, yet far less versatile for workouts. The holds are more juglike than perhaps ideal, but they are pretty thin, allowing for the simulation of much smaller holds. Absolutely recommended.",

Like many others have experienced, this thing needs a 3\u201d spacer or it fits on doors at an angle, not flush, and will slip off easily with just a little weight. Assembly was actually pretty straightforward, and the bar is very solid. Just can\u2019t use it. Seems like it\u2019s made for really old style door frames that are really thick. The box says fits standard doorways but it absolutely does not. Has to return, unfortunately.",

I'm only around 110 pounds so I can't comment on whether the max weight should be lower than the 250 pounds the product states but for my weight range it feels very sturdy.",
