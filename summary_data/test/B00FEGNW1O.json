I really couldn't be happier for the price. They're comparable to an Ugly Stik Tiger, but with a smoother action and at nearly half the price. The Tiger was my favorite factory rod for cats until I got two of these. I paired two of them with some Abu Garcia TG6000C reels and plan to be ordering the larger size for my 7000's. I will definitely be buying more...",

    "description": "Designed by master cat man John Jamison, Rippin Lips' new SuperCat Series feature six carefully selected length/actions, created to conquer the species and situations anglers face daily. Supercat glass our proprietary blend of E-Glass, S-Glass and graphite blank. Light but strong. The supercat 7'6 inch medium heavy action rod is the choice of serious catfish hunters. With a beefed up blank, heavier stainless steel guides and a fast tip, this rod is Tourney anglers #1 choice. You can use it for Bumpin', hangin', dragging' or bottom fishing.Unique among catfishing rods, SuperCat's custom EVA split grip handle yields tremendous balance for battling big fish, plus enhanced power for setting hooks and a comfortable under-arm fit while fishing. When building these rods, Jamison also insisted on extra hard, chrome plated stainless steel guides. (Spinning rod models also feature hard ceramic guide inserts for lighter line applications.) For extra protection and toughness, all guide wraps are epoxy coated. And to assure no bite goes undetected-even at night-all rod tips sport high-visibility tips.\nThis is the 1 piece version, we also have a 2 piece version on Amazon.",
