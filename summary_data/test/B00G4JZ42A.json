This system has incredibly slow write times, which makes it difficult to use with large volumes of data (exactly why you need up to 16TB of storage). Additionally, after \"just powering off\" the unit, the share and all data was lost. Eventually created a new share and found \"some\" of my data under the recycle bin, unfortunately not my most important files. I could understand if a hard drive gets corrupted (that's why storage devices like this use RAID), but to have the files just vanish is astounding.",

Nor does the \"automatic\" configuration or what is as referred to as relay. The box just says attempting to connect but never does. As for a local network back up device it works well enough, I have not tried much else. If I can get the port forwarding to work I would raise the rating. I do like the way it is built, the raid drives are easy to access, and even though the reviews say it is slow, for home use it is just fine.",

For a mac user, it does allow for time machine backups however i just received an error message about time machine cannot validate the drive so it is starting a new back up!",

I like that you can access it using your mobile device and also works well over the internet (cloud). Safety and security is also very good as I use a RAID 1 (mirror) array for important files with user access controls, etc. and a JBOD arrangement for streaming music and videos.",
