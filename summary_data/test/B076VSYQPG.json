Several tears together resulted in rectangular holes. Looks like the material just could not handle the hot sun. I got it mid-June and got first couple of tears around September/October.

While this is obviously due to the heat of the sun, I would think the manufacturer would produce a cover that could withstand the heat. This one cannot. At $90, it was not a good deal at all.
