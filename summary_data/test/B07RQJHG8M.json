I've heard a lot about DJI over the years, so I decided to try the Mavic Mini with the $400 price (this was double what the parts cost me for my first drone!) My phone didn't support the DJI Play app, so after BUYING A NEWER PHONE I was able to fly the Mavic Mini. I am blown away! Stable, smooth, I am VERY happy with my purchase. Video is clear, sharp, and excellent frame rate. More than enough for personal use, or even YouTube videos.",

The no-fly maps are easy to navigate. Great price for the value, great video quality including stabilization. Fly into the wind so the drone is being assisted by the wind when flying back home. Has been useful doing inspections of the roof and gutter at our house, and keeping away birds this Spring. Such a handy toy!",

The remote control is ok though it's easy to lose signal if you're in a high interference place, as it uses wifi. No yaw speed control is the biggest issue for me. No active tracking.

Pros: Excellent camera, amazing software, ultra stable video and stable GPS, compass and optically stabilized flight. Cons: Software is limited compared to other DJI drones. In a rural area with houses about 1 acre apart, I can get about 600-700ft away before losing signal... far less than others report.

Just be careful of flying in wind and remember that whatever the wind speed is at the ground, will be exponentially faster at 300-400 feet.

      "text": "Advantages: Small, pocket size - easy to carry around. Doesn't need registration. Easy to fly, nice features. Great camera - resolution, sharpness and contrast are great, good color representation. Amazingly stable videos, even in gusting wind. No video shake even during sharp maneurs. All in all, this little drone by far exceeded my expectations. On the negative side - SW need some more work, the DJI Fly App. locks up in certain screens, need to restart. This doesn't prevent you from flying the drone, it is just a bit annoying.",

It is extremely stable in flight. The phone app works very well with my Pixel 3 XL. The video quality is superb. It warns you when the battery is too low and urges you to immediately land. So far I have had no regrets getting this baby.",

And for both remotes, every time I turn the remote control off and then back on, the remote control beeps continuously until I \"calibrate it\". Very disappointed so far. Going to return both drones and hold off on picking this up for awhile. EDIT: After the 12/4/19 update, everything seems to be perfectly fine! Great job fixing this, DJI!",
