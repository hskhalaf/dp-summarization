The seller, however, is a scam. I added this litter to my Subscribe&Save orders when the large box sold for $15-something. After four deliveries I ran out of litter earlier than the scheduled delivery date and went online to order more. To my surprise I discovered that after the second delivery the price quietly went up to $23 and then to $29, and the next one would be ordered for over $30. Chewy and PetSmart, and if I remember correctly, even my local Stop&Shop sell it for less. Canceled the subscription.",

Its worst flaw was that it was a little painful to step on. The Super Soft is more of a sawdust consistency, and it is SUPER dusty. Little clouds of wood dust every time I scoop the litter. I wouldn't recommend the Super Soft if your cat has asthma or other respiratory issues, like mine. I'll buy the Original again but pass on the Super Soft.",

Ever since switching my cat has been happier, with less Uretic problems (which she\u2019s prone too) and went from using two separate litter boxes- one to pee in. One to poop in. Which she decided to start using two different ones when she got her first UTI a year and a half ago and stopped peeing in a litter box all together and would only go on towels, bath mats, or the floor itself- to only using one again!!!!

      "text": "Saved me & my kittens from inhaling clay litter dust. My 3 month old kittens switched to this supersoft litter cold turkey (which was a risk, I know) but I think they hated the scented, arm & hammer clay litter I had before anyway. The #2 odor is very noticeable, which is fine for me as I need to monitor their passings at this age and I scoop it up within 5-10 minutes. The tracking is better than clay, altho my black boy gets a bit of wood dust on his coat now and again.",

      "text": "Really love this product. Our tracing with regular litters got really bad after we adopted our tabby kitten. I started asking around for better litters and the tracing has been cut 75%. Before, I was cleaning the litter room every day, now it\u2019s once a week! I paired it with a large holed mat and the frequently bought scoop. The litter is lighter, too, and No dust! My kitties took to it after I mixed it with their old litter for a week and now we\u2019re on straight Oko Cat litter.",
