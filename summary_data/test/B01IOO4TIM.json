I was not disappointed. The real estate of this Dell Ultrawide is amazing. You can fit 3 windows in a single screen with enough information to still make it usable. The clarity and precision is also great. I'm a software architect by day, so I need as much real estate I can get to program, respond to email, and chat with my team. This makes it all happen with ease.",

Comes in a flat box and the minor assembly for the stand require no screws - just snaps into place securely. This is also my first curved monitor, and I love it.
