Installation was a bit annoying in the beginning, but once we figured it out, we got it in the wall no problem. Very good product, only thing to note is that some colors of regular marker don't show up very well, most likely due to it being glass, but I can still read it well.",

If you're going into drywall take your time or you'll end up with a messy result. I'd plan on using 2 people regardless of method as the glass is heavy. The US post office wouldn't deliver without a signature because of the heft of the glass, not a problem but it delayed delivery a few days.",

Once the poster was taped on the wall I leveled it according to the holes, which was probably the most tedious part, and drilled into the marks. In total, it took about 20 minutes and is perfectly level. I guess my advice would be to not overthink it.",

      "text": "I was looking to buy a whiteboard for my kitchen but wanted something that was more modern looking and well, prettier than your average whiteboard. This is perfect! I love the look of the frosted glass and how sturdy it feels. Mounting- the full size template made this super easy. I wasn't too excited about the drywall fasteners that were included so I used a sturdier one. But installation was quite simple and I was able to do it solo.",

This clear glass model was the perfect solution. Installation was super easy with the included template and I was able to get it hung by myself in about a half an hour. So far we have been very pleased with the look and performance. Just be sure that the wall you are hanging it on is not too dark of a color, otherwise it might be difficult to read what you write.",
