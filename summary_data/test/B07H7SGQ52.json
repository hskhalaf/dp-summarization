This makes \"bullet\" shaped ice cubes, hollow but still with thickness. It takes less than 10 minutes to get the first batch of ice into the tray and not long before the tray is full of these awesome bullet cubes!! What I love most about my Vremi Countertop Ice Maker is that it's fast. I'm able to cool down my drinks within minutes. Thank you Vremi!!",

I keep in on the edge of the table behind my desk, that way all I do is pull out the plug on the bottom and place a container below. I also put a sticky note on the edge of the top opening to remember to replace the plug on the bottom before filling!",

The machine has no keep cool or frozen function. That means you have to find place in your freezer to store the ice otherwise the ice will melt. It take at least 30 mins to make a 16oz cup of ice. The machine is noisy too. It\u2019s not returnable! It\u2019s better to buy a real freezer which is about the same price at Costco. Very regret to buy this bulky, pricy, noisy ice machine.
