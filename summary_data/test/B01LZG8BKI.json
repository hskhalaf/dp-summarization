      "text": "My 6 year old aboslutely loved these!! I absolutely HATED THEM!! They stain EVERYTHING! The crayons easily break off in chunks and then immediately start to dye whatever they touch. I have bright pink spots all over my wood floors that I cannot get out for the life of me! They have stained a rug, my fireplace, my sofa AND my granite countertops! They easily smear off paper too. My 6 year old colored a picture and climbed onto my bed with it to show me and got dye all over my white comforter. It's all over they're clothes, hands, shoes, etc. They were such a nightmare to clean I finally hid them!",

For anyone wondering, they feel like you're drawing with lipstick as another reciew said and act like a water color crayon when water is added and blended out with a brush. Fantastic.",

They are very pigmented, can be used as waterolors, blended very easily (especially with a baby wipe) and the colors are gorgeous! I plan to use these in my Bible Journal and they work just as well as my more expensive ones by Recollections that I purchased at Michaels! For 36 colors, this price can't be beat!

I have some Gelatos, but wanted a bigger variety like the ones in the class. These are very nice, do a great job, with or without water and the price is great, compared to single purchase Gel crayons, like Marabu. If you are just starting out these are great, I personally think they are as good as the much higher priced \"ART\" gel crayons. Highly recommend Picture shows one of my ongoing art projects-Rolodex card a day-with backgrounds made with this set of Gel Crayons.",

That's also why they'll get used up much faster than regular crayons but such is life. One complaint I have is that the actual crayon pigment doesn't match the color of the body plastic. So at first glance, this set seems to cover a nice gradation of hues for the same color, but in reality, you don't actually get that nice variation of hues - there a quite a few almost duplicates of colors.",

Other brands I've tried such as Crayola slick sticks colored even brighter and were more like lipstick than these, but there is actually a lot less mess with these crayons and the colors are still very bold.

They are fun to play around with but I will not be using these for any nice projects. If you just want to color and enjoy the creamy texture without wasting your gelatos, these are perfect.",
