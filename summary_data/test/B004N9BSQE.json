Some of mine were at least 12 feet in length and up to 2 inches in diameter and these loppers had no problem. I had already worked out my arms at the gym so I got an extra workout tonight.

I had to figure out the action of the ratchet system, but once I did, no limb up to 2 inches, was safe. Like I said, it's pretty substantial, but it is manageable for me, as i'm used to the heavy stuff. It is a really good tool and I think it will be hard to break. I'd buy it again, at this point.",
