He wagged his lil nub tail and walked right over to the bed as soon as I unpacked it. He was excited and hopped right on. I swear he slept hours before moving which is rare for him. The bed was ultra cozy, soft, plush, comfortable and relaxing for our doberman. We all loved the color and style! Has a nice pillow lip along the bed which is perfect for when he wants to rest his head. He LOVES it, we LOVE it! <3",

I have a 50lb Australian Shepherd who likes to sprawl out, and the Jumbo is probably bigger than he needs, but I don't regret it!

Sure, it comes in XL for like $43, which is nice, but the foam isn't super dense, so I don't think my danes love it like they would some of those $250 beds.

I wish it was a little thicker, but for the price, it is understandable that it isn't. The thicker beds were more expensive. He sleeps on this every night. We got brown so that it wouldn't discolor and it hasn't. Overall good. Would buy again and we may get this one again if this one gets too worn down.",

My advice is to really look at the dimensions. This is considered a large bed. My 12 pound puppy covers most of the bed when she stretches out.

Really poor quality. Inside is just a piece of foam like you would use for a mattress topper. Sad to return these, but the quality really isn't there.",

Compared to the super plush ones for $120 at the box store this isnt as thick, but it is soo soft and you can buy 4 of them for the same price. Recommend!",
