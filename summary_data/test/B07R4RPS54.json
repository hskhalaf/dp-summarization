The far left green marker is over 8; although it should be over 7. The neutral position of the indicator needle is 8. It should be 7. The orientation of the device is vertical. When using on a lawn, it is necessary to get one's face on the ground to read the scale. Although the scale design is bad, the device may be easier to use in a pot at eye level.",

      "text": "I purchased this meter a few days over a year ago - July 2019. Used primarily for moisture and very helpful - accurate, I think. However, USER BEWARE! THE PROBES BEND EASILY AND WILL EVENTUALLY BREAK! Mine broke recently - the 'aluminum?' side - where it enters the meter after a year of use (abuse?). I will order another one but will be much more careful with the probes. No other complaints - appears to be a good item. By the way, there is a wire inside the probe attached to the tip. The meter still works, just very awkward. Fairly easy to read but better if the display was angled in a more upward direction.",
