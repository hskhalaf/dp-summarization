Tenskon dials became loose( actual little bolts), causing constant timing issues once trying to stitch... Needless to say I am buying another brand.",

The light has gone out, it jams, it has had start/stalling issues I have had to troubleshoot, and now the bottom tooth feeder has completely broken. It was jamming my project again and I took a look to see the METAL had completely broken at the site it lowers and raises from. I will be buying a higher quality machine next. For future buyers, know this is an okay machine to learn on. Just don\u2019t expect your money to go very far.",

The only thing Iam not 100% satisfied is the noise (it's a bit loud) but I guess for that price it's still ok. The seam is perfect no matter which fabric I use or how many layers. Don't have to adjust tension all the time. Thank you for a good and cheap product :)",

She knows what she\u2019s doing and she loves this thing for whatever it does. She did show me what it does ( makes heavy stitches for jean hems ? Or edges on material projects ?) and I\u2019m not too sure, but it makes her smile and git off my case so it was a great purchase when I saw it on amazon deals.",
