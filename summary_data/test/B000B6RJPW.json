We needed to dig post holes next to an existing fence and thought this would make it easy, but we discovered that our T-handled digger (purchased a looooong time ago and still available on amazon) will accept a gas pipe rod as an extension to the handle which allowed us to just twist our way down into the ground (no pounding). I suppose that this is better than a standard post hole digger, but it's just not for me.",

      "text": "There's a lot to like about this tool. The length of the tool makes it possible to dig deeper than most store-bought diggers, making your job one step better than your neighbor's. This results in better post setting and saves rework time. Also, since it uses an inverted hinge, the top part of the hole doesn't flare as much as traditional post hole diggers. The all-steel construction means this beast will last a lifetime too. The only downside is the tool's weight. Before taking on a workday with this tool, make sure to warm up your upper body, as this thing can wear you out.",

My only negative comment is about the weight - it's quite a shoulder workout to use this, especially with heavy clay.

This is the only reason I could conclude other than cost savings in materials, but it does not bode well for the product design and ultimately the Fiskars brand.

After the 3rd or 4th hole, I noticed these started to bend a little. Each dig saw one of the handle bend more and more. They were starting to bend right above the swivel point near the bottom. Before they bent, they worked great!!!! I was happy with them and they made digging holes almost fun, if that is possible!!!! I was so disappointed. If they did not bend so bad, I would give them 5 stars!!!! I hope they make these better in the future.",

    "description": "The Fiskars steel posthole digger makes it easy to dig extra deep postholes in tough soil. The welded steel construction is far more durable than wood and won\u2019t flex like fiberglass, and it includes a welded steel pivot joint so there are no loose nuts or bolts. Sharpened blades cut into dense soil easily, and the offset handles let you dig postholes up to 12 inch deeper than traditional models while stopping your knuckles from smashing together as you dig.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Fiskars post hole digger features a unique handle profile that prevents you from banging your knuckles together when digging holes. The offset handles allow you to dig a full foot deeper than standard post hole diggers (up to 4-feet deep), while its all-steel construction lets you tackle the tough jobs. Pre-sharpened to cut through the ground easier, the unit's blades are welded directly to the shaft for additional strength, and the entire tool is powder-coated to prevent rust.",
