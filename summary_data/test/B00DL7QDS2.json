Another perk is the gyro \"switch\" that I learned immediately: rotate slowly to start the screw then rotate more to drive it in. Nothing to it. I've used it as a drill to make pilot holes for screws and it works great for that too. The ONLY negative is I had to buy the bag too - guess I can use it for a lunch bucket. Well done DeWalt!",

I've had Hitachi and Makita screwdrivers and like this one the best, but the longevity is just isn't there. I did not use it daily, probably average a few times a week. So if you're not going to use it heavily I recommend it, but if you use it for your work you might plan on replacing it every year",

I use it with the handle flipped down and grip it so my palm is right behind the center of the handle where the bit is and then it's very easy to rotate your hand left and right to control both the direction and the speed.",

I need a screwdriver that can go stick as well as drill because, in this environment, the hand position is more neutral when the screwdriver is configured as a stick.
