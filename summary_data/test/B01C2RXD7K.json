They sent us either a replacement or repaired the original one and now that one is now dead, no power and doesn't light up. At this price point this mirror should have ZERO issues. On hold on phone with Simply Human now for past 30 minutes demanding a refund. They refuse to refund just replace an obviously defective product. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!",
