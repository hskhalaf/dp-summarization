The metal ring which is meant to guide the pull string fell out almost instantly. The bag leaks chalk through the seems. So anything you put into the pockets attached to it gets really chalky.",

Also, it's too popular and so many people have this exact same bag at the bouldering gym so it's easy to grab the wrong one. I don't use the zippered pockets, but my phone fits (OnePlus 5T, 6\" display).",

It's easy to reach when hanging from my harness when I am rope climbing and can be puffed up to stand up on it's own when I am bouldering. Overall, pleased with the purchase.

There might have been a third time had the spring-loaded piece not exploded from the combination of being tightly wound around the climbing rope and my belayer attempting to lower me. Could this have been something I did? Certainly, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... you get the point.",

One of the chalk bags actually started tearing at the pull strings, so that kind of sucks",
