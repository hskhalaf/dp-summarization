This is also a very nice looking bag, and it is more lightweight than my last backpack that just seemed heavy for no particular reason. The bag has more than adequate strap adjustment to be very comfortable, as I am not a thin person. My only hope is that it is a durable as the last bag..but time will certainly tell!!

The backpack is perfect for school/light outdoor hiking/ everyday use. The backpacks straps are not so much comfortable as the strapsfeels like the standard Jansport Super pack backpack. The more you store in the backpack the less comfortable it gets so try to keep a light load. However, keep in mind you get your money's worth as all Jansport backpacks have life time warranty on it. So if your backpack breaks after you passed your Amazon return window, Jansport has lifetime warranty on all of their backpacks.",

This bag truly does the job! I would like a little more space in the main compartment, since it's SUCH a small capacity bag, but that's a minor complaint, and forces me to minimalize anyway :) Just a note about functionality and comfort -- backpacks that carry load closer to your body are ergonomically better, and it's very obvious that this was taken into consideration in the design. I love it!",

This bag would work as a carry on, it is a lot firmer suspension than the old bag, so I'm hoping it will be easier to lug around. The fabric is very distinguished. I would choose the limited addition again, it's very pretty. Looks more professional than my college bag. I like the way the bag opens, you can easily see the contents. Will use this bag for every day carry and for day hiking.",

Take the right strap off and swing the backpack under your left arm; now you have access to the side pocket zippers, the front flap compartment, and the nylon loops where you can hang your carabiners. This backpack is water resistant even in heavy rain, but don't stand under a waterfall or jump into a river with it. Personally, a waist strap would make this a better buy, but I can't complain.",
