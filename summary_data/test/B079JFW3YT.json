      "text": "I've been using the graphics dock with an HP Spectre on its internal display for a little over a month now, and I'm happy to report that it works exactly as I was hoping it would. The dock itself seems well built and compact, and even though the external power adapter is sadly about the same size, the complete setup is still very portable and relatively light. Graphics performance is about what one would expect from a 1050 - which is to say, good enough for just about anything you would want to run.",

      "text": "First thing i did was plug the eGPU into the wall outlet, then into my laptop before powering on the laptop. Turns out this thing doubles as a power adapter for my laptop as well so that's pretty convenient. The manual for this eGPU says to download and install a PC firmware first before installing the drivers, but i ignored the firmware and just installed the drivers. That was all it took for my laptop to start running games with this eGPU. While i liked how easy it is to set this thing up and how portable it is compared to other eGPUs, the performance provided by the GTX 1050 4gb is kinda lacking compared to other GTX 1050s.",

Initially the device seemed to work, however it would run into issues shortly after. Cutting out the display, 1050 would no longer be detected, and the dock would fail to function. The only way to bring it back was to unplug the machine, and unplug the dock and let it sit, after an undefined amount of time you could hook it back up and get it working. This was not a sustainable solution so we went ahead and returned the product.",

I am using it on a lenovo yoga 730, I lose about 15 percent performance compared to a standard 1050 in benchmarks, but this also a 4gb card, opposed to 3gb. When running it back to the laptop I saw pretty much no difference in performance compared to running to an external monitor, but make sure you have a 40Gbps cable and device that supports it. No you aren't gonna play games at 4k at high settings, but I'm happy I can play ESO at max settings at 1080p.",

Tremendous if you are vested in the ThinkPads, are an enthusiast/collector, or looking for something small and sexy to drive a few panels and not take up a ton of desk space.
