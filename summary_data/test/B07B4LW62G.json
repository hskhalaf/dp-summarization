These last about the same as any other rawhide and my dogs seem to love them. Kinda interesting that Amazon asked me to rate the flavor. Perhaps I should do a taste comparison? Get these for your dog. Great bang for the buck.",

These Cowdog Chews last a day to a day in a half because they are tougher and not as easy to consume.",

A 20-pack at this price throws the comparable \"knot rawhide\" bones from the pet store under the bus. Two of those types of bones that take the same amount of time to chew are more than the price of 20 of these. Glad I finally found an affordable, long-lasting rawhide my dogs can enjoy.",
