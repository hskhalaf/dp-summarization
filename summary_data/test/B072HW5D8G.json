      "title": "Pretty good quality little kit",
      "text": "Pretty good quality little kit. the lighters are keychain size and seem to hold their fuel pretty well thanks to the O ring sealing on the cap. the lighter fluid bottle has a rubber seal on the main body as well as the internal cap. everything is acceptable fit wise and the little lighters spark up well and put out a good size flame; they are not wind proof by any means. The keychain lighter fluid container works to fill standard zippo style lighters.",

      "text": "Nice lighter. Does everything it advertises. Be aware the flint is held in place by a machine screw that is not attached to the flint spring as I have seen on other, regular lighters. When replacing the flint, the screw \"pops off\" and may easily be lost. Reinstalling the flint & spring may be a challenge for the same reason.",
