      "title": "Very effective for release",
      "text": "This peanut shaped vibrating roller is a life saver! It definitely does a better job of myofascial release than the foam rollers. The vibrations are not evenly distributed though - the motor is housed on the same side as the on/off button and the vibrations are stronger there than the other side of the peanut. But given the benefits I am getting from it I really don't mind.",

      "text": "As a former DI scholarship athlete who still trains hard this product is invaluable for my overall fitness. I have used many myofascial release products to warm-up and recover. This product looses my muscles up better than foam rolling, using the stick, a lacrosse or tennis ball. Using this product has increased my mobility and flexibility. My wife is a former aerobics instructor who still takes HIT training classes throughout the week. She had been in pain for many months prior to us buying this product. After the first time of using the product it decreases her hip pain and she now uses it after her workouts to be pain free.",

      "text": "I like foam rollers and even the tennis ball trick. But this vibrating roller is Amazing!! I love it and it\u2019s great for hitting all the deep pressure points you really can\u2019t get (but try to!) with the other modes of muscle massaging and lengthening. It is extremely powerful- truly unlike anything I\u2019ve used before. I\u2019ve only used level 1 & 2 so far. My favorite thing about this product is how comfortably designed it is and rolls with ease against the areas I always need targeted- especially lower back and glutes. What a great find- def recommending this to anyone thinking of buying.",

It would start working on my problem points by shaking them out before fully utilizing my body weight. I also found this to be very helpful for releasing stress in my upper back and shoulders after a long day at the office staring at my computer.",
