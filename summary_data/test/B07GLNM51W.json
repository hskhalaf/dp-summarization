It is a bigger toy... My son is 3 1/2 and it\u2019s probably half the length of his body. For a little while it was too big for him to carry by himself. And he wasn\u2019t strong enough to make the Triceratops fall over. But now he\u2019s got no problem with it. A little pricey, but he loves it.",

If I had a penny for each time he fell backwards, I'd have been happy to make my money back. This is a long toy too, so now it's just taking up space. Do not waste your money on this, it will not hold anyone's attention long. It's just a giant green door stopper if you ask me.",
