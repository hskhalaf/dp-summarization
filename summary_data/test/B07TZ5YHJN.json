I bought this kettle thinking it was made in Austria or Germany. Expecting a quality product. Only when I read the manual did I see that this product is not made in Europe--deceived by advertising. The metal plate inside bottom of kettle shows spots--only used three times. Also condensation that builds up inside after boiling stays for hours. I have owned a few different electric tea kettles and that never happened. I am sending back ASAP--I'm worried about the quality and very upset over the deceitful advertising.",

This one doesn't dry as easily after use and builds up condensation inside, unless you open the lid 2. The spout is plastic, which is probably ok but my other one was glass and I feel safer with that 3. The opening on top is quite small, you might need a brush to get in there to clean rather than your hands with a sponge All in all, if this breaks again I will look for one that has a glass spout, personally preference.",

The lid opening seemed small and a bit awkward to fill, and it would have been difficult to reach inside to clean, but that problem has solved itself by the lid hinge disintegrating the other day. The pot still works fine, but it has to cool down before you can stick something down the edge to take the lid up, which now comes completely off. Design flaw if the plastic hinge can't stand heat!!

I like that the entire kettle illuminates when it\u2019s on (the previous one I had only had a tiny light) and that it is easy to fill and turn on and off. The water seems to cool faster in this than my other one, which is disappointing, so I find myself reheating it more. The water also has a slightly off-plastic taste. I\u2019m hoping that goes away with time. I\u2019ve cleaned the kettle appropriately, so I\u2019m not really sure of the issue. Overall I\u2019m pleased. I love the design and the capacity.",
