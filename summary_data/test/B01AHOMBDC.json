I bought a small bag of Pedigree and mixed it with this food so our puppy would ease into it. I guess I we had nothing to worry about. He loves this food. He is part Shepherd and part Black Mouth Cur. His breath is so much better also. He has a lot of energy and is a great puppy too. I feel better feeding him healthier food without all the byproducts and junk in it. I have this on Subscribe & Save since he loves it so much.",

Plus a big plus is there isn't a lot of waste to clean up as the dogs absorb the good nutrition. I am totally impressed with Rachel's line of dog foods. We have tried several - love them all - but I do like this one the best, and so do my furry little kids!",

It has pieces of dehydrated peas, carrots and chicken that our princess thinks are treats. The perfect mix is great on her stomach too, making yard pick up a breeze! Happy dog, happy mom!",

Therefore, after reading positive reviews on line, I switched to Rachael Ray Nutrish Dog Food. He absolutely loves the taste, and licks the bowl after each and every meal. In fact, after he licks the bowl, he walks away for a few minutes, and then comes back again to lick the bowl again. We both love Rachael Ray dog food!",
