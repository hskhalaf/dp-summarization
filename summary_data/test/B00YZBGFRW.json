I was reluctantly going to order a second bottle with the idea that at least it was great for my joints which also need support. I take 2 caps a day and started about 6 weeks ago. I am not taking the whole 3 caps but 2 seems to be working. My face is super soft and I am not sure if it is firmer but I think it is a little bit. I will come back and update in another 30 days.",
