While this is partial plastic, the fact that there was some plant-based material there was great. We LOVE these brushes. The head is a great size, bristles perfect softness, and the handles are great size wise to hold. We did use a sharpie to mark the handles so we know whose is whose, and we did have to stop keeping them in a cup, because the bottoms don't dry. We've purchased a new tooth brush holder to help with that problem. Will absolutely purcahse more!",

These brushes are much more sustainable than plastic toothbrushes and for that purpose alone, I highly recommend them. They are quite ergonomic in your hand, and although not as durable as their cousins from Australia and New Zealand (the bamboo brushes there easily lasted a half year each), I still very much enjoyed using them.",

They usually last a 4-5 months before the bristles start falling out but that's about when I would change my brush out anyway. The bristles are recyclable (I pull them out with pliers very easily) and the handle is compostable! Also, the natural look of the toothbrush suits my decor more than most neon colored toothbrushes which is not a big deal but a definite bonus for me!",

The bristles seem to get bent up a little quicker than the Tom's toothbrushes I was using beforehand. Not really impressed with these but their selling point is eco factor, not the product's performance or user experience.",
