So now at 3am I don't have to walk to the kitchen and mix a bottle, I simply grab the pre-water filled bottle from my nightstand and mix in one section of powder from this dispenser. It's very easy to fill and to empty, easy to clean and colorful. Price point is good and you also get a single serve dispenser too. Once we start venturing out more this will have its place in the diaper bag, I will probably need to buy a second dispenser!",

Mixing bottles ahead of time meant they either needed to be chilled or consumed shortly after and the Medela bottles made it difficult to get all the formula into the bottles filled with water without getting powder everywhere. I especially love the smaller dispenser because it's great for shorter trips to the park or library and I can use the larger dispenser for snacks such as raisins and Cheerios for my toddler. This is one of the best purchases I made!",

After formula, I used them to put snacks in like cereal o's, puffs, etc. When my daughter got older, she loved to put in the O's in the little containers (inadvertent fine motor skills toy too!).

Meaning the compartments allow powder to shift to another section if one the side or upside down. Since I do not make 8 ounces bottles at a time mine is only half full in each compartment so maybe it would not happen if you put 4 scoops in each. Also if you leave it upright it is fine but I am pretty organized and this is not always that way that it ends up in the diaper bag.",

So, I need to an old small tupperware cup with lid to hold the fifth feeding.
