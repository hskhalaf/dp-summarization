      "text": "I have used these shoes for many years and have always had a size 8.5, half a size bigger than my size in every other running shoe I have ever tried. Yet, when these arrived the rubber across the toes was so tight I couldn't even walk in them let alone run! These were a well designed and comfortable barefoot running shoe which has now been ruined by poor design. These are either faulty or just poorly constructed as to make the shoe so tight across the toe box is crazy in a shoe that it meant to allow the toes to expand as in all minimalist type shoes. Avoid!",

I checked the sizing and they actually use womens sizing despite this being advertised as a mens shoe. I'm usually a size 7 wide and went for the size 8 and it didn't leave much room for my foot which was perfect. Great for running on soft ground, but as theres not much padding definitely reduce how much you run on concrete, or at least build up to it.",

I've worn barefoot trainers and shoes for about 8 years now and these are the only ones that were instantly painful and excruciatingly tight. Furthermore, the heel seemed loose. I own NB Minimus trainers that I bought many years ago and they're incomparably superior.",
