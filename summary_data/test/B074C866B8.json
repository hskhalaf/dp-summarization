Use: I love the fact that is very easy to use in the phone without any problems and have great precission and functionality like a ps3 one in my oppinion. Cons: I like controllers with vibration but this dont have. You need to install some third party program to play your games in pc because it dont have the compatibility of an xbox controller 100% Recommend.",

This gamepad will work on some games only. so u have to have some skill to play a certain game with a help from a certain app. The instruction is somewhat confuse and i have some hardtime to understand several parts of it. The meterial is solid and the buttons look nice, the bluetooth connection is great. It may take sometime to figure out how to use buttons and things.",

I did not have one compatible game and all emulators did not respond. When it did respond, one could use the bumpers to go in and out of folders, the left bumper to select things, and the buttons on the front of the controller do nothing.",
