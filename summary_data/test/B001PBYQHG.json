The online interface when you upgrade is lacking as well. For as long as this product has been on the market, they need to make a few tweaks to stay competitive! The only positive is that you are not in a contract. The install is also easy.",

Thank god I didn't have to face that. But the monthly monitoring plan is cheaper than any other and the installation is very easy .",

I have subscribed to the basic monitoring service. I did order additional accessories directly from Simplisafe as amazons prices were not at all competitive.

You need to spend a few minutes on your computer selecting the monitoring package and the cell numbers you would like it to contact you on, but it is pretty simple.
