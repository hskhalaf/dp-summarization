Customer service was on point, able to tell me whether this would fit or not based on my description of my old spout. As far as the product itself, they were the least expensive delta Roman tub faucets I could find that I liked so that\u2019s good and they were stupid easy to install. Only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is because they smudge very easily with fingerprints and are kind of a pain to clean up after.",

The rest of our bathroom now has Moen sink faucets, Kohler towel holders, various brand light fixtures and knobs--all in brushed nickel--and they match fine. I suppose if you look REALLY close you would notice they aren't a perfect brushed nickel match. But with the various lighting in our bathroom you would never know.",

This was the cheapest of the four faucets I looked at. I bought one I thought I would like better (Moen Eva), but ended up returning it because it did not fit the style in the bathroom. I couldn't be happier with this one and it was worth the money! You will need to buy the valve, which I purchased the R2707. The valve looks intimidating because it says you will have to solder the connections. Push to Connect fittings worked flawless on the valve and I didn't have to labor on sweating the pipes.",
