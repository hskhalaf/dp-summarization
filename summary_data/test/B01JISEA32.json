The fragrance itself is powerful at first, but dies down to a very soft warm scent that both men and women comment on...all good comments! I highly recommend trying this scent if you're on the fence, it is a very modern sophisicated scent that has all day staying power. Good for date nights as well. I'm a Hugh Chanel fan and My Burberry Black comes close in comparison to Coco Mademoiselle for me.",

Might be a bit overwhelming for daytime use because of the intensity. A little goes a very long way. The bottle is just lovely and classic looking. Heavy glass with a tortoiseshell look cap. This bottle will last a long time. Photo with soda can for scale.",

Wearing it that way, I felt the perfume is noticeable without being overbearing to myself or others around me.
