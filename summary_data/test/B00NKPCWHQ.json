After one washing, they're pretty \"pilled\", and holding them side-by-side with the \"three pairs for <$20\" socks worn by other members of the family, I honestly can't tell anything \"special\" about the composition of these socks. Nothing wrong with them, but comparatively expensive and I must be missing something about the \"special features\".",

I have very large calves and boots often cause me discomfort, if not lasting pain, due to the socks getting pressed so hard into my calves. In the end, I'd definitely recommend these.",

      "text": "While I am far from the mountains, I do love ski socks. They are long enough to cover my calves...and not slip down around my ankles. Unlike more traditional winter wool socks with \"fluffy\" interiors, these socks are thin, yet warm and comfortable. I wore them for 30-40 hours before washing them and was never disappointed with them, nor did they smell...more over, they did not share the smell of my feet with the world. Without a doubt...my new cold weather sock. I might even go skiing!",
