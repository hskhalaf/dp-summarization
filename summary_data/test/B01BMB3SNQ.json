So I have a brand new unit, multiple projects backed up, some are paid projects, am out $260 and no unit to use. Garbage, only thing worse is discourteous Karcher corporate service.",

      "text": "This is my 3rd pressure washer in 3 years. The previous 2 years I wasted around a hundred bucks each on 2 electric washers. Each of them broke before the season ended. With this washer I didn't have to break my back bending over to get the nozzle an inch away from the surface because this thing has power to spare! Easy assembly and was up and running in minutes. The only downfall was not coming with motor oil. Luckily I had some lying around. Well worth the money and hopefully will continue to care for my home for years to come.",

I have gone through 20 tank fulls at least so far without any trouble. It is important to change oil after break-in period. The oil when drained the first time was clearly contaminated. I am going to change oil again soon, just to be thorough.",
