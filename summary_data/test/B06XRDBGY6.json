It doesn't even take much effort or strength to punch the hole into the material, which is a departure from leather punches I've used in the past. Comes with little extra tools as well (mini ruler, replacement pad for the punch, tool to clean debris out the hole once it's punched, etc.), which I appreciated! Highly recommend!",

I found a leather replacement band for my Apple Watch that I absolutely LOVED, but I have very small wrists and sadly, the watch was just a tad too loose on the smallest hole. Rather than return the band, I figured I\u2019d give this a go, and I\u2019m so glad I did. This leather hole punch is sturdy and easily punched through the watch band (I admittedly could have used the next puncher head size). The heads are easy to rotate through and feel hardy enough to have punched through thicker leather than my watch band. Great value.",

      "text": "Hole punching tool that is easy to use once you get the hang of it. I kept trying to loosen the screw because I couldn't rotate the wheel at all, and I even tried using a drill since the little screwdriver they give you didn't work either... but eventually I figured out that you can only rotate the wheel in one direction, and it was pretty easy to use after that. There was a noticeable dent on the black disk after the first time I punched a hole (without any cardboard to protect the bottom), but the result was a clean punch that suited my needs perfectly. For this reason I give it a positive review.",

The instructions say to place a piece of cardboard between the item to be punched and the metal plate under the punch. This makes it more difficult to punch the hole exactly where you want it .",
