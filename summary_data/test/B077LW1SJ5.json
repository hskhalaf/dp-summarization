THEY DO NOT FLOAT. They sink pretty damn fast actually. Not happy about that. But then, maybe a month and a half after ordering they are starting to peel. He doesn't even wear them very often. Would not recommend. And would like a refund actually.",

It's like the glasses are dirty but they aren't It's just glare because there is so much light getting in around them. If I cup my hands around the glasses when wearing them, all that glare goes away, but I can't function like that for very long. Especially while driving. :-) I will unfortunately return them. :-(",

      "text": "These glasses are extremely light, which makes them very comfortable while wearing. They look really nice and the design is awesome. They also make them so the sides bend out just enough to be able to fit them on your head a little easier. The only down fall to these sunglasses is since they are so lightweight they have a hard time staying when I put them on top of my head so when I walk into a store or whatever else they fall off the top my head constantly so I have to find somewhere else to put them when not in use. Other than that I love these, I would definitely buy again.",

The second is that they are fairly loose fitting and theres no way to tighten them, and that's coming from a guy with a head on the big end of the spectrum. I'd be careful if you've got a smaller head, these might just be too big for you.",

The wood grain is running the wrong direction in this area and provides little strength. A layered \"plywood\" construction would provide more durability. Anyone active should avoid these sunglasses, as they will not last. Sunglasses with a composite frame and wood / bamboo arms may hold up better and provide a similar aesthetic.",
