I was hoping for stacking cups that my kid would be able to work out size problem solving, but if you stack them smallest to largest, it is a weird balancing act. and to go largest to smallest like in the first picture, you have to force each cup onto the top of the other.",

However, age appropriateness is iffy as no baby can stack these because you need to use strength to lock them into place whether it be a tower or a ball, and same to disassemble.",

The fact that they can turn into balls as well is also neat....but my kids love to throw them to get them to crack open and do it all over again.

There soooo much you can do with it, besides putting them in number and color order. you can put the similar colors (blues) (greens) together and form a ball. You can put the happy little ball inside and make noises, you can also form the balls and put them into sizes (big-small). Just too many things you can teacher your child with this. They also seem very durable since my kids have thrown this toy up and down and they are still in perfect condition. =D",

She sits up to quietly stack and unstack the cups, or we click them into balls and she rolls all over the floor with them. They're great for encouraging your baby to crawl. She watches us stack them in absolute awe. This is one toy that I think she will play with for years, and it's such a nice contrast from all those noisy, battery powered toys out there.",

When you go to stack the cups, they just slide off. He loves stacking things so it's such a shame this toy did not work. The face ball is cute and my son enjoys playing with that piece.
