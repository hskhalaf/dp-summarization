She loves riding the bike and is able to whip it around with ease after some trial and error on the steering bars. great to see her get a little bit of normalcy as most 8-9 yr olds like her friends and other kids in the neighborhood. Update: 4.15.2019 Still going strong, 5yr old son now rides the bike too. 11yr old special needs daughter still rides bit looking for something bigger to accommodate her growing length.",
