      "text": "The iDevices Mini Kitchen Thermometer came in very handy for me recently during our annual holiday party. When you are greeting guests and socializing, you don't want to have to be popping in and out of the kitchen to check on a dish in the oven, and this handy little gadget allowed me to monitor progress with quick glances at my phone. Setup is simple and straightforward, and I had no problems downloading and installing the app, or linking to the device. I especially like the chart-style readout which shows the temperature rise, which helps you anticipate when the alarm is going to go off.",

      "text": "Everyone should own a meat thermometer and avoid the otherwise inevitable guessing game that can ruin meat in the final steps of cooking. The question is, is it better to own a traditional analog thermometer or something digital? While most analog devices work just fine, the digital version is surprisingly more accurate and the fact that it can alert the phone when the meat is ready basically replaces the need for an oven timer completely. The app itself installs easily and it's simple enough even for non techies to understand. It's not a revolutionary leap in either cooking or technology but definitely a welcome gadget that's worth checking out.",

Otherwise it is nice and easy to use. Not usre it will replace my higher end thermometer, but great for outdoor cooking for sure!",
