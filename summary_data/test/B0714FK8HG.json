These are small Biscuits so I'm OK with giving more than 1. Both of my dogs will chew these, but for medium to large dogs who gobble, gulp and swallow small treats whole, these Biscuits might be too small! For small to tiny dogs, these Biscuits would be perfect! Anyway, both of my dogs love these and I am very happy with them. Now I just wish these would come back in stock!",
