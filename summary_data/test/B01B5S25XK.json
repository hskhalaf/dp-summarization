It's not for diving and I recommend you take it off before washing your hands. The wood will dry out if exposed to too much water. But if it does, just give it a quick once over with Olde English.

He had to visit 4 different jewelers to finally find one who could remove a link for him so it would fit his small wrist (don't know why it was so hard to remove when it even included the small tool to remove them for size), but other than that he loves it and has gotten many compliments! Even from the jewelers he showed it to :)",
