My kids love playing wall ball and these balls couldn't even handle that after gentle usage after a month. Thinking this may have been a one time defect I bought a second set in March 2018. Same exact story, did one ball at a time to try and make them last longer. Didn't even go to the full 1.5 lbs inflation before I noticed the first ball in this second batch was lopsided straight from the factory.",

They were a breeze to inflate and are holding up well even after a few months. The fact that they come and such a large set and with a bag makes them well worth the price-which is extremely reasonable.
