It doesn\u2019t just wash off either. I have to scrub and it\u2019s still there on my skin. The ONLY thing these have going for them is their super soft feel.

One minus the manufacturer would do well to do something about: they don\u2019t taper off enough at the ankles, and they are a little too long. So: the problem is at the ankles, and is still a minor problem.",

Definitely not high waisted on me. These also felt more like stockings which I don't think I like very much. They took skinny people leggings and made them bigger with no consideration of shape. If you're basically straight down with relatively small hips (or proportion) these may be good for you.",

I also really prefer for my leggings to have a compression-like high waistband. These do check the box for high waistband, but I wouldn't say these are \"control top\".

They are very soft and they do have a great deal of stretch but they also don't appear very 'black'. They appear more charcoal 'grey'. Personally, I like my leggings with some cotton in them. It makes them look richer and deeper in color. These don't look as 'dressy' if that makes sense? But they are comfortable and they are not see through.",

Well to me they're just as soft and I'm more comfortable wearing them during everyday life since they're half the price.

These leggings stretch well as the fabric intends, without being constricting or compressing. Some leggings for sport are meant to be compression leggings; more \"heavy duty\" and not as comfortable as these are. These go all the way to the ankle, and yet don't constrict or impede with circulation. The most comfortable leggins ever, and very attractive, too. Fit so well. I am over the moon to have FINALLY found leggings that fit, look great, AND feel so soft and comfortable. I'm going to purchase multiple pairs for sure.",
