It would crash trying to run some of them, other the quality was really low and it would lag. But, the good news is that there's plenty of room to add a large graphics card and extra RAM stick in the case. It has two extra spots for hard drives too, one of them being attached to the dvd optical drive though. I've had it for a few weeks and I've had no problems. Good computer choice for anyone",

It even outperforms four core i5 7400 based machines. Add in the 16GB of optane boost and you can't beat this machine in a pre-built. It is only a hair slower in booting and loading programs than my SSD equipped machine. I added a $25 4gb RAM stick for 12GB total and dual channel capability. Needs a dedicated GPU if you plan on gaming and the keyboard and mouse leave a lot to be desired but overall very happy with the purchase.",
