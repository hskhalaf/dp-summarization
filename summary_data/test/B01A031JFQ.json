I was on this product for almost 4 months and not only did my cholesterol go down and actually went up especially the triglycerides. There was no noticeable change in my diet and in fact I went on a fast for 3 weeks of fried foods just a week before the blood test. I would not recommend this product at all. It seems to be a lot of hocus-pocus like a lot of the herbal products.",
