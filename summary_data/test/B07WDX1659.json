      "text": "I have bought 3 of these, 1 to keep and 2 to gift. Unfortunately the last was not packaged well & arrived beat up. Even the actual advent inside is beat up. I am waiting for the holiday to use the advent traditionally, but I hear broken pieces rattling inside; no doubt 1 of the candles inside. I love Ritual products & was thrilled to snag a few of these at this low price. The 1st 2 were packaged well, boxes look new & no rattling from inside. I'll keep the banged up advent for myself & hope not to find too many broken pieces as I open my advent this holiday season.",
