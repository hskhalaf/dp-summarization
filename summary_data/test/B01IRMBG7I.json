I'm just way slow at doing the review! \ud83d\ude02 I'm also an avid swimmer, so I put my bathing suit in it all the time after hitting up pools or the lake. I'm also very very happy that I threw a little money at it and got the 3200 rpm!",

I washed a small load of laundry in our Maytag residential washing machine, and when the spin cycle was done, I moved the load into this Panda, just out of curiosity, to see if it could remove any additional water from the clothes, AFTER the residential washer completed it's cycles. I was very surprised to see about half a GALLON of water come out of the Panda, holy toledo! This thing really works! After about 3 minutes the water was just dripping out, so I removed the clothes and they were just barely damp, like they would probably be dry in less than an hour if I hung them up.

The unit worked as promised, and once it settles into the spin (takes a few seconds), it's quiet. Less than half filled, it still managed to spin out about two cups of water. Impressive!

ALSO my hand-washed whites come out WAY cleaner when I use this in between wash and rinsing. Gets all the soap out which means all the grime and stains too. Super quiet too, much quieter than expected.",
