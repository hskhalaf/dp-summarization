Dog has liver abnormality from being kicked in the side as a puppy. One cat has major environmental and food allergies while the other needs sensitive digestion food, and our Ferret has had digestive issues her whole life. These containers are really sturdy with airtight covers that keep their food nice and fresh and hold a whole 5 lb bag of food in each. So glad my daughter found these! Best storage containers we have ever found.",

My only complaints are that it is difficult to move when full, and more difficult to fill due to its shape. Holding a 40lb bag of food over the opening to dump it all in is extra challenging since the container can only be filled if it is in a different position than how it's normally sitting. Requires a bit of finness to pull it off. As for freshness of the food stored, I can only assume it is of the freshest quality (our lab never complains, and I refuse to try it to see). It is definitely puppy-proof so far, which we appreciate.",
