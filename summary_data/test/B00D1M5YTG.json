You can program a code for each kid and see when they use it from your phone. You can check and lock the door behind them. Great for letting guests in before you get home. And you can set temporary codes for guests as not to let key copies Rome around. It's also nice that there is no waiting around for the key holder to let the family in when you all pile out of the car. After months of use we are very pleased!",

It shipped with the booklets as well as the large folded instruction guide but it was for another model. Once I found out the actual instruction was in the booklet, I followed it. Viewed online video too but the thing they tripped me was the installation of the deadbolt and whether it has to be turned up top. Wasted 1 hrs on this. So far the keyless entry is working smoothly. Will update after using for several month or years. The lock itself deserves 5 stars but the instruction and experience makes it low.",

I like that we can give codes instead of keys and that we can delete the codes when they are no longer needed. It's added safety and piece of mind. Plus, it freaking slick looking.

A pattern with dimensions is provided for this, and the design provides you a fair amount of flexibility. The lock works great, and easily paired with my SmartThings hub. The touch screen works well, and doesn't look out of place.",

Very happy with the way this lock looks and works. Feels extremely solid and safe. Now I need to get used to not carry keys.",
