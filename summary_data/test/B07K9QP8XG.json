I was initially disappointed. They felt hard and unresponsive. In hindsight, they needed breaking in. After about 100 miles, they began to feel really comfortable. The outsole has great grip and traction. I would say for the winter, these are warm, the upper is quite heavy, but I'd be reclautant to use them in the heart of the summer.",
