I had to replace the hanger with a plastic one after it broke. The design is great though. I use the hanging space in between the walls for the clothes that my baby is currently the right size for, and anything she's going to grow into later goes outside of the walls of the organizer. The hangers are good enough quality to hang clothes on, but they're not strong enough to hold the organizer with items on it.",

This closet organizer will definitively make mom's life easier. You should try it :)",

I suppose if you only put a teddy bear, a couple of diapers (like 2), and a couple receiving blankets and leave the drawer/baskets empty the hangers won't bend. The fabric is also on the cheap side. I also want to note that all of the images for this show it with that two tier metal rack, which is mildly misleading. All you get is the cloth hanging part with a few accessories. On the other hand, the price is pretty great, and so far it does its job.",

Might have to buy another 24 piece set to put on the other side of the closet for blankets and toys for when baby gets older. Definitely helps turn a bare spare room into more of a nursery.",
