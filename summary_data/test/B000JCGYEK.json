The main part of the jig was warped and difficult to rotate but we are no sure if it was a defect in the product or damage done in shipping as the case was shattered upon arrival and the thin bubble wrap envelope it came in was ripped and showed clear signs of having a much heavier package on top of it. The rest of the components seemed substandard and cheaply made. We were able to find a name brand for $10.00 less at our local big box hardware store with a metal case.",

Too many moving, plastic parts. The piece you have to spin around to catch the edge of the stile does not seat properly and should be made of metal, and is sloppy as well due to the fact that the ridges across the top of the jig don't allow your clamp to stay in place. I do trim and cabinets for a living and would advise you just spend the extra ten bucks and buy the Kreg jig.",

      "text": "I didn't buy this tool from amazon but I use it quite a bit. The hardest part is ensuring a tight clamp so that it doesn't slip during drilling. Also, keep in mind that while the measurement guides on the jig itself are exact your wood may not be. Usually more common with plywood where 3/4\" really isn't 3/4\" so you have to \"back out\" the drill bit so that you're not really setting the collar for 3/4\" but a little bit less. Test on scrap and you'll be fine but overall it's a great product especially for smaller spaces where you may have forgotten a pocket hole or for the ease of a smaller tool in your bag.",

They both have enjoyed it thus far in helping create a sorely needed bathroom sink cabinet replacement. The current sink basin is being held up by 2 1x2 sticks!
