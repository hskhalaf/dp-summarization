Easy to Assemble, says takes 40 minutes to assemble but once you look over the instructions it took me 10-15. Metal Frame and 2 support beams help make it so the bed doesn't collapse. If any of the boards break they're cheap to replace. Cons: Bed slides around on the boards a bit sometimes, always adjusting it before bed. A little noisy at the foot sometimes. Purchase this with the Zinus Memory Foam 8-10 inch, I have the 12 and its way high.",

It\u2019s noiseless, really easy to follow instructions, and overall just beautiful. I am super super pleased. I have a full bed with a mattress and topper and this fit perfectly. Very durable and sturdy and my bed is perfect now. I am in love! Also, the cute little cards they sent with the purchase was heartwarming. Thank you Zinnus!!",

I went to Lowes hardware and bought small plates to put under the legs and spread the weight distribution around. 2. The wooden slats are spaced a bit further apart than I would like. I am concerned that the Zinus 12 inch memory foam mattress will suffer from sagging or some other issue related to the spacing.",

There are no squeaks or noises. My husband put it together while I was out of town, and he said it was simple, and he has no issues such as missing pieces, etc. I love the height of the bed since there is plenty of room to put storage containers underneath. I also like that there are no legs at the corners where you would generally kick and stub your toes! Great product, and great price.",
