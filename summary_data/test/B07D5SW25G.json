Many neutral runners were happy of this trail companion\u2019s waterproof upper, the comfortable underfoot platform, and the high-quality design. Moreover, they liked its apparently good-looking fa\u00e7ade. On the other hand, some testers felt that the width was inconsistent.",

After having had the shoes for a few weeks now I am really happy with my much researched trail/running/hiking shoes. They are generously wide and also at least half a size larger than asics or puma running shoes. The main use for these will be for when I travel abroad and it is too cool/wet for trekking sandals. Really comfortable and waterproof and with good traction they are exactly what I need.",

Shoes are waterproof yet they seem to be be reasonable enough to stop my feet from overheating. I use these for walking to and from the station everyday day on a walk that is approximately 1 hour and I have been pleasantly surprised by these Comfortable supportive and firm yet deliciously light in weight. Special points for the super grippy sole.",

This was very difficult because they were glued in. I have now removed most of it and otherwise I like the shoes, so I keep them.",

On the negative side, I have worn through the soles in less than nine months - and I'm a light user. In mileage terms we're only talking a handful of runs for a serious athlete. So, if comfort matters most to you, buy them, but if you're hard on your footwear, don't. Me? I'll buy a new pair - but strictly for use in the gym. Trouble is, that's not really the point of these shoes, is it?",
