It didn't completely melt the chocolate, even though it was the type recommended for it, and 'fountain' is a completely inaccurate description for what this did. It kind of glopped out of the top then started immediately drying on the first tier. When we finally gave up on it we then found that it was impossible to clean so it could be returned...and just threw it in the trash where it belonged. I very much recommend you not waste your money on this item.",

It was however, not bad enough to make me regret my choice! I HIGHLY suggest pre melting the chocolate before adding it to the fountain. I did this in the microwave.",
