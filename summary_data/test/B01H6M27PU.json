For the money, it\u2019s hard to beat. I\u2019m a stickler for spine true rods and mine was wrapped about 12 degrees off center. I asked for a replacement rod and the company was very responsive, sending me one right away. Great customer service in my opinion. Most people don\u2019t care about spine alignment but I do. Otherwise I would have given them five stars. Like I said, for the money, it\u2019s hard to go wrong.",

Unless they are using a grossly undersized reel there is no way to avoid line slap and reduced distance from this otherwise beautiful rod! Fit and fisish are nice for this price point, too bad it doesn't preform as well as it looks!!!!! REALLY disappointed!!!! I can not recommend this rod, go buy an Okuma at the same price point and see what a stripper guide is supposed to look like!!!! Bare min 40mm!",

I did a lot of research and finally settled on Fiblink 12' for $59.99. I compared it to a 12' I was almost tempted to buy at Cabela's for $99 and glad I bought the Fiblink. Used itlast month in June 2019 surf fishing on Galveston Island throwing both artificial lures and cut bait with spider weights. Fabulous casting distance. Handled the 4 oz spider weight and cut bait just fine but probably pushed the limit slightly on the long cast. Ended up landing 4 shark about 2-1/2' each. This rod so far has proved to be an excellent value.",

My line kept getting tangled because of the how the metal supports for the top guide went over on top of the rod and that created a lip that my line(30lb braid) kept getting caught on. Maybe adding a drop of eproxy where that lip is might help prevent the line getting stuck in there.",
