It is also easy to plug in my charger which also nice all in all I'd say if you're thinking about getting this case go for it!

It also came with a little stand I never knew I would ever use. I actually use it all the time now! This case seems thicker than other plastic cases I've had, but not bulky and easy to put on and remove. It just seems like a really high quality product and the designs are so pretty!",

For these reasons, I feel it is important to rate the product and company at 5 stars. They did not have to accommodate me in the way they chose to. I am grateful and beyond satisfied. I have zero complaints about the case, it works to protect my phone 100% as I drop my phone CONSTANTLY and have experienced zero damages. THANK YOU !",
