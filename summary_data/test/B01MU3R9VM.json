The con above is really a pro once you get used to it. The Only True Con: Productivity. It is simply way too sensitive to write documents/code without randomly letters popping up all over the place as the slightest pressure actuates the key.",

Only downside for me would be that this is considered the \"quiet\" version, and it's not \"quiet\" at all. Maybe VERY slightly less loud compared to the louder cherry keys you typically get, but by no means is it quiet, so temper expectations if that's a key point for you.

If you're gaming that fast response might be what you want, but lower pad keyboards are faster (for typing) at least for me (at about 60 words a minute). Editing time is increased to a high level. Purchasing a different keyboard for data input; but keeping this one for wow factor. Love the programmable effects and Corsair updates the software frequently. High quality? Yes it is. Great colors? Yes. Very Cool!!!!!!",

BTW I have not mistreated this keyboard at all, in case you are wondering. I will be going back to using Razer products as I have a mouse and keyboard that I bought in 2008 that still work fine, I'm talking about the Razer Naga and Razer Anansi.",
