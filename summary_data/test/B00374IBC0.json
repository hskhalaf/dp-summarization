Not sure why people complaint about this product. It is a very heady duty cotton shirt with some sort of flame resistant chemical added to it...similar to the uniforms military people use overseas. It works perfectly fine. Being a shirt it is meant for regular/light duty; perfect for the occasional/recreational welding project. For crazy heavy duty work, as if you make a living welding professionally everyday, you definitely need an expensive welding jacket made of leather..which this one is not! Highly recommended welding shirt.",

I've done lots of grinding and welding in it and so far I have not managed to burn any holes through it. The snaps are nice quality and the velcro at the top collar is a nice touch. I would definitely buy another and I highly recommend it.",
