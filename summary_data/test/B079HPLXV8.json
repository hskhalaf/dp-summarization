Everything was packaged well, all bulbs arrived safely, it's easy to set up and use, and it looks great. Perfect for beginners. I would recommend investing in weighted bags to keep everything in place for any outdoor use or for indoor use when there is a crowd, because the stands are lightweight. My only \"con\" about this package is that the gear bag is pretty flimsy and seems likely to break soon after only a couple of uses. I will be getting a replacement gear bag and recommend the same for others. Otherwise, this is a great kit. Two thumbs up.",
