And, the provider, Oneness goes the extra mile by providing detailed instructions, plus the bandaids, swabs and healing cream needed for a complete treatment package. It all sends a message that this company wants to do things right. Well done, Oneness",

The jar itself is pretty small but a little goes a long way so it seems like it'll last a long time. Super happy with this purchase, and the price is great when compared to what else is out there and how effective it is.",
