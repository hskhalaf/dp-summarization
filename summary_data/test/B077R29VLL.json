      "text": "Got a nice Mossberg for Christmas, but it kicks like a mule. The pad that came with it is crap, but after I came back from shooting, my shoulder was a few shades of blue. Got this for it, and it fits like a glove and the pad is a wayyy better shock absorber than what was stock. Also, it's pretty nice to be able to put some shells on it. I'm sure it's still going to kick, but wayyyy less than before. :) Will post a photo as soon as I get a chance. :)",

It kicked more than my 20 gauge and less than the 12 gauge. Now my nephew can shoot it without flinching and he loves the shell holder.",
