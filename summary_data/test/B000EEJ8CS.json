It has taken me all this time to learn my lesson. Stick with the best and screw the rest. They sound incredible, last forever. They are easy on the fingers and bend notes high and crisp. I love them.

Of all of them I'd say the Paradigm slightly edges out the D'Addario. However, they also cost about 15 bucks a set. The Martins are beautiful when fresh but quickly fade and tarnish within a couple weeks seems to me. Hands down I prefer the D'Addario custom lights. Great tone that lasts and lasts and seem more durable than most. Best bang for the buck and actually sound better overall to my ears than the regular lights.",

These are light enough to make playing fun again and still retain some of the low end sound of more heavier strings. They last about as long as most strings and are a real bargain if you change strings a lot. I recommend them for professionals that need good sound and change strings often to keep that brand new string feel and sound. You can't go wrong with them unless you sweat all over them and don't wipe your strings but then again they are cheap enough to just throw another set on.",

Unfortunately for me, two out of three sets were bad. The first set lasted about a year - amazing! The second set, the G string broke after only a couple hours of playing. The third set, the G string broke while tuning! Both times it appears that the core became brittle and snapped, allowing the brass to unwind itself. Looks like I'll be switching to the much more affordable (and about as long-lived) Ernie Ball strings, as I have asked D'Addario for support on this matter multiple times with zero replies.",

That is there is more friction and my fingers seem to slide less freely up and down the fretboard. I also notice a bit more string squeak with these. I'll switch back to coated strings. I recognize that this is a matter of preference and I expect that those who use these strings would probably have some adjustment if the switched to the coated strings. So, to each their own. Happy playing....",

      "text": "I play the acoustic guitar for many hours a week and my hands can get pretty sweaty, so I put whatever strings I buy through a pretty heavy gauntlet, and these perform well for longer than most strings, even coated Elixirs. My Martin DRS-1 uses these strings beautifully, giving a perfect balance of full and bright tones when unplugged. When I plug in, I notice it\u2019s hard to take out the highs that can make it sound twangy but that\u2019s expected with an acoustic. I put in anywhere between 14-20 hours a week on these and change them about every two weeks.",
