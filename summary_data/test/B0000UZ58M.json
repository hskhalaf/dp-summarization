I only gave 4 stars because I had been planning to keep the cart folded into a corner inside out of the weather etc. I can't do that though because it has the STRONGEST chemical smell I have ever smelled. It's terrible. If you can keep it outdoors or inside of a garage it would be better.",

They are much too fragile for a cart of this size. I can fix the problem by purchasing more durable cotter pins at the hardware store, but I shouldn't have to do that, in my opinion. The wheel quality is fine. Other people have reported receiving cheap wheels. These were quite sturdy. The blue color is not the powder blue pictured. it's much more intense, and not that attractive to me. However, I bought this for it's supposed utility, not for fashion.",

The straight pins that go on last on the big wheels, The pin goes through the cap and the mandrel, then you wrap the extended pin around the cap, there is a groove, and it secures it.
