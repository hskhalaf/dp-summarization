I wanted a monitor to use when we're camping and it is almost impossible to find them with battery options on both. The reception is really good, very clear sound. I like that it shows the temperature in the baby's room and the range for it is really good. What I don't really like is that on the parent unit you can't dim the light. When a noise activates it at night the blue light is really intense and lights up the whole room. Also, the rechargeable battery on the parent unit doesn't last very long.",

The baby unit has died and I now find myself searching for another set of battery powered monitors. I get they were inexpensive, but it is frustrating nonetheless. I bought these specifically because both units are battery powered. We take them in the motorhome when we travel. The sound quality and range are both excellent. I like that it has a \u201ctalkback\u201d feature and that it tells us the temperature. This is especially important in the motorhome, where the climate is a little bit harder to control than at home. Plus they are just plain cute! Highly recommend.",

I charge them, make sure they are turned off and packed them to travel and when I turn them on they are at half battery or lower in less than 2 or 3 hours packed away for travel. And its not like I can easily take out the batteries due to the compartment needing to be unscrewed. Not sure if I got faulty batteries or not. I wish they lasted longer \ud83d\ude14",
