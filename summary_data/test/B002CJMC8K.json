It's an annoying feature that is overkill for a drop safe. The second safe worked OK for 4 months until the lock literally refused to open. Took it to a locksmith who couldn't get it to work. So...my $80 safe cost me $200 to have a locksmith crack in order to recover a few thousand bucks. Will never buy Sentry again.",

I get the impression that someone took a really well designed item and cheapened it by leaving out features, like a seal around the door, or a backwards sloping inward slot so that it sheds rainwater. Maybe a hood on top that extends out, or a flap, or a seal around the door? The double-lock system works, and it's a great idea, but it is rather flimsy. I would buy it again because is is very heavy, but you would be advised to make it waterproof.",
