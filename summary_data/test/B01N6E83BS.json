      "title": "Good quality sound machine for babies, batteries+plug in is a big plus!",
      "text": "Great product. Pros: Good variety of noises. Had the heartbeat sound both our children loved when they were newborns. It uses batteries or plug in. I've had sound machines for one or the other but both has been very helpful for home/travel with the kids. Loud enough that we normally don't put it to full volume. Cons: There is a noticeable sound loop. I only notice it when I'm doing late night feeding with the kids and I'm sitting there focusing on it. Otherwise I don't notice it. Interesting: The heartbeat sound is a little funky but still effective. Buttons make a clicking sound. Didn't bother us but it is pretty loud.",

The volume goes from virtually silent to super loud (then super super loud etc) in one click. There is no middle ground on this, it's either way too soft or way too loud. I had to move this far away from my baby's crib & cover the speaker with painters tape to muffle the sound and I was only on the 2nd volume. I hope they fix this moving forward cuz I would return this except I want the heartbeat sound....",

I've had numerous sound machines, all of which broke within 6-12 months because of the poor quality of the volume knobs (potentiometers). This one has lasted me well over a year, and I see no reason why it would stop working, as the failure rate for push button switches is much lower. Makes great white noise at a wide range of volumes. Remembers prior state, allowing you to just push the on button and resume the same volume and sound selection as the prior use.",
