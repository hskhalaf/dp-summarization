The seller averted this question when asked about the date of manufacture. Check out the Answered Questions section. I also had to call Apple tech support to get the AppleCare for this Mac. They didn't know why AppleCare was refused on line, but it may have to do with it being from 2018. The Mac Mini is just fine. Works great. Just wished I knew it was a 2018 model and not fooled that it is a 2020.",

When I plugged it in and ran my fingers along the metal of the case, I received an electric shock/buzz. The issue goes away after unplugging it, so there's definitely an issue with the power supply or construction of this particular unit. If I decide to purchase another one after returning this one I will update this review to confirm that it was an isolated issue which I assume it is.",
