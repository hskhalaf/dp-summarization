I have had trouble finding a helmet that will fit my gigantic head (25\" circumference) and this one does so perfectly and without making me look Rick Moranis playing Dark Helmet in the 1987 movie Spaceballs, like other big head helmets do. If you have a head that measures 25\" around, measured just above your eyebrows and around, this helmet will work for you and actually has just slightly a little extra room if you want it loosely seated upon your dome.",

Also at the cycle shop I had a medium that was really snug and the dial adjustment helped make it workable to test out bikesthere, but I feel like this size was a better fit for me (L) and all around I\u2019m very pleased with the purchase.",

Had been until a small screw was lost and the visor had to be fixed down which made it impossible to use on trails. Found this helmet and have been very happy. It's cooler than the Ambush and fits as well. It does not have the back of the head protection of the Ambush but it seems more than adequate for the job. Not that my head has a price but the Ambush is significantly more expense. Two thumbs up!",

That error contributed to the liner being miss-aligned. Yea, I know it's nit-picking, but, when I buy a product, I expect perfection.

It fits perfect, it's very well ventilated while riding and its extremely comfortable to wear. I commute 9 miles in direct sunlight m-f in 100 degree weather and I had no problems with it being black (some people say don't get black because it gets too hot in the sun).",

    "title": "Giro Hex Adult Dirt Cycling Helmet",
    "description": "The Giro Hex Mountain biking helmet features rugged style, big performance and impressive value. Features the new Roc Loc 5 fit system. After more than ten years of refinement, this ground-breaking fit system provides an entirely unique use experience with an unmatched level of comfort, stability, adjustability and weight savings. With Roc Loc 5, you can easily dial-in both fit tension and adjust vertical position with a single hand. Just twist the dial for a tighter feel on tough terrain, then back it off a notch and relax across the flats or a warm climb. Even with these remarkable features, Roc Loc 5 is still 40-percent lighter than its popular predecessor, Roc Loc 4. Roc Loc 5 systems is: 1) Micro Dial. The heart of the Roc Loc 5 is this ratcheting, micro-adjusting dial. A simple, two-finger twist of the Micro Dial opens or closes the retention system and each click is audible. 2) Three-Position Vertical Fit - It's never been easier to change vertical positions and fine-tune fit. We incorporated a three-position bracket that features 15-millimeters of precise up/down movement. Like the Micro Dial, this system can be adjusted without removing the helmet. 3) Carefully crafted ergonomic arms are shaped to be as comfortable as possible, yet work flawlessly with Giro eyewear (what we call Super Fit engineering). 4) Dual Pods - These two panels are designed to firmly grasp the back of your head while comfortably cradling the occipital lobe. Strap management - with Roc Loc 5, your helmet straps are woven through the fit system, so they are always in the perfect position. Complex Internal Design - Dozens of small parts work together seamlessly to provide exceptionally user-friendly adjustment. Minimal and Light, yet Strong - Although this fit system is 40% lighter than its predecessor, it's much stronger. In testing, Roc Loc 5 performs flawlessly, even after 6,600 cycles (equivalent to 3 years of riding with 3 round trips per day).",
