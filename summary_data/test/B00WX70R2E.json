      "text": "As expected Chippewa boots exceed my hopes comfortable fit right out of the box no real braking. Great shoe. The thing that amazes me is with such a high-quality shoe they still cannot put together a set of shoe laces that last beyond 3 days without beginning to fall apart. Although this is a very small price to pay for such a great boot at a great price. I had been a die-hard red wing fan for most of my adult life however the pricing climb in recent years had me look elsewhere. Chippewa as a new customer in me the last couple of years",
