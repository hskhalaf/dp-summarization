I like that I can change the challenge level easily, and that it doesn\u2019t fling me off (I\u2019m rather klutzy). Only thing, I wish the yellow and red modules had finger holes, as well. But it\u2019s not that much of a hassle. Overall, wonderful addition to my home fitness plan.",

      "text": "I got this balance board primarily for use with my standup desk because of it's versatility. With no Balance Modules inserted, the board only has side to side movement. As you add the progressively harder Green, Yellow, and Red Balance Modules, you introduce more heel/toe action, in addition to the side to side movement. I've also used it for pushups and body weight squats (usually in between breaks from my standing desk). It's very durable. Overall, it is a great way to help maintain good posture, fight foot fatigue, and keep active and energized for a long day of standing.",

Nothing wrong with Mfg in China but the marketing goes to great lengths to make it look like a small company in Hawaii. The brand logo looks like it was stamped on with a home ink stamp kit and the whole effect is poor quality. The plastic inserts don\u2019t fit perfectly into the bottom. There is a wide array of price points in this genre and this is way overpriced for the quality. That said I still gave it a 3 because I will be able to use it. Just feel like a got taken in, paying $180 including tax.",
