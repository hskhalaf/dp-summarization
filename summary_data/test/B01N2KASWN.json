Imagine a car accident with this hazard, which would become a projectile object causing a traumatic brain injury!! While this mirror has a great view of my child like other reviewers have stated, it is so unsafe, which outweighs any good. Do not recommend from a safety aspect. Want to return item for full refund. Mirror is in condition it came in. Seller, please allow this. Waiting on your response.",

The Lusso mirror definitely gave me a clearer view and I was able to see more of my son. The mirror is attached to the base and pivots but does not move while driving. It also came with a nice cleaning cloth.",

You will NOT be sorry. It is large so you don't need to deal with the drama of centering it and angling it in the exact position to see your kid (many trips runing back and forth from driver seat to child seat = unnecessary pain) AND the image is crystal clear. It's like comparing taking a photo with an old iPad versus a brand new iPhone. Night and day clarity. Enjoy!! We're probably getting another for the inlaws haha",

The double latches secures safely on the headrest so you don't have to worry about it falling on baby. I would definitely recommend this to parents of newborn because you get such a great view of your sweet (or crying) baby while driving (but remember to stay focus on the road ;-)).",
