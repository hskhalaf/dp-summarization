Every Kind bar I've purchased in an actual store are chewy; rather, I'm almost through my Amazon purchased Kind bar and ALL BUT TWO were extremely dry and crunchy. Definitely not ordering again on Amazon. The Dark Chocolate Chunk Kind Bars are excellent when they are soft and not tough as rocks. Unfortunately, it seems like the luck of the draw when purchasing these bars. My current batch are hard and too crunchy, not my preference but I'll still eat them.",

They are wide enough that you cannot take a vertical bite. You have to sort of bite at a 45 degree angle. But because they are very crumbly, pieces inevitably fall off. So they are very messy which is why I took a star off. At the office there is a pile of crumbs on the floor by by chair after I eat them. At home I have to eat them standing over the kitchen sink.",
