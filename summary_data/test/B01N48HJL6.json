      "verdict": "Although the Under Armour Highlight Delta 2 claims to be a non-bulky shoe, many users thought otherwise as they expressed disappointment with the shoe\u2019s larger-than-actual sizing and the unnecessary space resulting from it. Some have also pointed out how it was a pale comparison to its predecessor. The redeeming quality of the shoe was its impressive comfort, but maybe it was not enough for consumers to think the Highlight Delta 2 is an excellent running shoe.",

        "The shoe performed great on casual runs and brisk walks, a customer stated",

I have not done any serious runs in them and use them mostly for little run/walks with my dog around the neighborhood and occasionally at the gym.",
