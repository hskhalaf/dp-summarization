They are very light in the hand but actually feel decently well made. So far I\u2019ve not had any rust and the jaws have a close to perfect alignment with no flex when twisting a hook out. For the price this is a good set to keep in your box. Is it the best set out there? No.. but do you really need the best set out there? If your not running a charter boat day in and day out then these should do 99% of us just fine.",

You can tie it to your belt, that would be safer to keep the pliers from dropping into water. The stainless steel jaws are incredibly strong to unhook any fish. Including bass, walleye, muskie, pike etc. Overall, these are high quality fisherman friendly pliers. Best I have ever had. No complaints at all, highly recommend!",

Only reason for 4 stars is that mine didn't cut braided line cleanly, or at all usually. If you fish mono they're fine, just didn't cut it using 30lb power pro that I have on some reels. Still happy, especially since I mostly fish saltwater and even stainless pliers eventually get stiff and rust up. Will report back later after seeing how they hold up.",

      "text": "I first saw this when I went on a charter boat and the person next to me was pulling out hooks and getting back in the water so fast. I was so impressed I ended up paying the extra for pliers. While not the most exciting tool to boast about while fishing, I was very hyped and it's definitely worth it. They're extremely light, have the holster or you can just use the carabiner with the cable from my backpack side pocket. They're the perfect size in my hand and have a solid grip on the tips. I have a lot easier time removing hooks!",

However, I was able to bend it back to it's proper shape and now know NOT to put too much torqueing pressure on it. NOT a deal break but something to consider. All in all my favorite fishing pliers.",

I was skeptical about the cutting faces on the clippers but it cleanly cuts my various Suffix 832 lines from 20-50lbs and nips through flouro and mono leader material. Split ring pliers work as intended and do a nice job when you need to change out hooks. I typically keep a pair of hemostats on me for hook removal but the keyed jaws work well in a pinch. Recommend these if you're looking for a budget set of pliers/cutters and don't want to break the bank. Quality is excellent for the price.",
