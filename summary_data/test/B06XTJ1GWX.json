The infrared is very good when operating at night and I was surprised at how well it picks up details in the dark. As a security guard, this camera helps document my experiences and provides objective insurance against malign actors. The customer service provided by the company is very professional, responsive, and they support their product and customers extremely well.",

No short-cut. Not user friendly. (2) The 2 IR LEDs are bright red and highly visible. At night, this makes hidden recording impossible. The maker should use no-glow IR LEDS instead.
