When he plugs up the gauges they were not working. So I have recently just returned the gauges and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not sure how the refund will work for that. But now I have to go purchase another gauge for school.",

The tools in this kit could be purchased separately for around 100$ Hardly an expert set lok, no micron gauge, service wrench, mini split adapters, low loss hoses, de burring tool, core tool, thermometer, sheet metal tools, jumpers, Gallo gun, swaggers, fin combs, magnetic nut drivers, mirror and missing a lot more",
