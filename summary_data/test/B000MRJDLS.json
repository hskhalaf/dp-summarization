The board is large at about a couple feet wide and quality is better than expected. The number seem to be made of a strong vinyl and have held up very well. Even though the size was larger than I imagined it is still very portable which we need because we set up and tear down all supplies we bring each week. The numbers are large enough to be seen from any place on the court.",

My plan is to make custom labels to go over the \"Home\" and \"Guest\" spaces because the teams don't always sit on the corresponding sides of the score board and then the fans across the field have to work it out in their heads. I'm probably just going to make some black arrows on white backgrounds to point to either side. I wonder why the manufacturer doesn't just go that way?",
