Opened it up and a mounting screw on the PC board had worn through the insulation behind it and was touching the chassis. Melted the whole board. 10/1/17 Replaced this amp with another of the same model. This time, I have extremely quiet output with the same set up as before. Double checked speaker with a different amp, works fine. I'll be returning this one for a third try and see if I don't get a lemon again.",

Installation was a breeze and the quality is what I expected from Kenwood. I haven't had enough time to test it thoroughly and will update accordingly. So far the only issue I have is with the input sensitivity (gain). My head unit has 4V preamp but I have to turn the gain up nearly all the way on this amp to produce enough sound. Still testing songs and fiddling with the EQ, Xovers, and gain on head unit.",

I have it on a Alpine Type S 10\" sub and it really motivates the sub with good clean power. Best thing is that it's in a place that doesn't have a lot of air flow and it still doesn't over heat. I just took a 5 hour drive in 90 degree heat and had the volume turned up a good amount and it still kept rocking just fine.",

    "description": "Many of today\u2019s power sports have very limited space to work in and tend to be a harsh environment for electronics because of the exposure to outdoor environments. Kenwood\u2019s compact performance amplifiers are small in size so they fit even the most limited installation areas. The amplifiers also use a conformal coated main PCB (printed circuit boards) which offer extra layers of protection to help prevent moisture or damp air from damaging the product.",
