      "text": "I purchased this product after suffering persistent problems with Norton Internet Security 08 and Norton 360. I just couldn't keep the \"autoprotect\" and \"liveupdate\" features from breaking. After a couple re-installs and numerous manual fixes I gave up. The McAfee has been stable and quietly working in the background for a month now. Is either of these providing better protection than the other? Who knows! At this point, just not having to fuss with it all the time is good enough.",

      "text": "The installation process is not straightforward because it doesn't allow you to pick and choose which components you want to install because it comes with multiple features besides virus scan. There is no direct UNinstall from Windows Vista. The only way to uninstall the program is to download a custom uninstall program from the McAfee website. Unlike Norton, the virus scan kicks off even when you are actively using your computer. The interface was cumbersome because of the multiple products bundled together. Although McAfee antivirus may be good, I would not recommend VirusScan Plus with SiteAdvisor for those who use their computer all the time.",

The MS product is terrible and just slows your pc down with useless performance improvement software that they force you to have run automatically. Norton isn't bad but McAfee has been a solid brand for a long time so I stick with them. Installation is a breeze and having the 3 license ability is nice with a multiple PC home. I would recommend this version to anyone who has multiple PC's at home and is looking for a good stable non intrusive virus product.",

I feel protected with McAfee, and I've never had any problems while it's been on my computer. And it's nice to know you can put this software on 3 computers!
