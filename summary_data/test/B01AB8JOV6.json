These are not pro studio grade, nor are they the best quality in and of themselves, but they are a great cheap solution to treating slap echo and strident treble. Be warned, these are not going to soundproof your room. For true soundproofing, you will need restructure your walls with mass-loaded treatments. These will work fine for treble and midrange. Bass will be untouched, but that is expected. It should also be noted that some squares might be thin or slightly off on measurements. Again, these are cheap solutions for sound treatments.",

We built wooden frames out of 2x2's, filled them with Rockwool insulation and wrapped fabric around them. Works amazing. Don't waste your money on these unless you just want them for aesthetics.

They will not transform your room into a completely isolated foley stage. What they will do very effectively is reduce reflections. And if you live in LA, they ship REALLY FAST!",
