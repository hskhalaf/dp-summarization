The facial mask feels so comfortable and stuck well on my face, I was wearing it watching TV, it stayed very well, this was a surprise; after 35 minutes my face skin felt soft, smooth and moist; the lip mask and eye pad have clear instructions and they were easy to use; I keep my eye pad and lip mask in the refrigerator and use them before I go to bed and after 30 minutes my lip felt a lot more soft and very hydrated! my eye bags were gone! I love these masks so much! Definitely must be buy again soon!",
