However, I wish that mask part of it had a tighter fit to the face especially at the eyes and nose line. Price is on the expensive side of what I'd expect for such a product.

I wore this while walking in the Montana winter, along with some other cold gear, and found it a valuable part of my cold gear as well as easy to store and put on. It can also be worn as a hat or warm collar if the weather heats up, or folded up and put into a pocket or knapsack.",

Even after 4 hours in -16\u00b0F my head still manages to produce some sweat with this balaclava.
