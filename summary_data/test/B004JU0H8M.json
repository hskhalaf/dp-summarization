You can put it at the highest setting for newborns, and lower it as the child is able to crawl or stand; which helps not having to bend down so far. I think the current safety ratings are ridiculous. Many people are complaining about safety ratings, but as long as the paint doesn't have lead in it, me and older generations grew up in things a lot worse than this; and we grew up fine!

I didn't use the build in shelf because I don't need it right now since I already have a shelf previously.
