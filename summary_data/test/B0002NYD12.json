The other is a 32mm ratcheting wrench that has an issue with the ratcheting mechanism, it frequently locks and you have to jiggle it around a bit to make it work again. I have not gotten to actually use any of these items yet, all of this was just noticed from a brief inspection after opening the box. I have some concerns about what other problems will surface after some use.",

I have multiple sets of the gearwrench ratcheting wrenches but I've never had one fail on me yet. Don't use them to break bolts loose, they aren't meant for that. Break it loose with a regular wrench and then put this on it. I am a farmer and use them pretty regularly. These can be a huge timesaver in certain situations where only an end wrench will fit. There are some other brands that are stronger or have a shorter swing but for the price these are great.",

The other two messed up wrenches have a lot of slop & free play in the gears compared to the others (which have a considerable amount of slop compared to higher quality ratcheting wrenches) For the price of this set I am very disappointed. For your average home owner this would probably be sufficient but even then the quality is questionable. I would not recommend these to anyone.",
