Maxtor replaced those without any issue, except that the replacement drives (which were refurbished) also failed within 3 months. Quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data. BTW - each drive had dedicated cooler fan and pc's were on UPS so there aren't any excuses. There's a reason why these drives have one year warranties. Beware.",
