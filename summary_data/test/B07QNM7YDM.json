Also, they let the designers have free rein here so maybe they think all the black looks cool.

Like all Roombas, don't watch them clean because it will drive you nuts - when they go over the same spot 5 times and haven't hit another spot once yet. I like that it has the remote that shows that it's charging because my last Roomba, you never knew...it could be on the base but not on correctly so it wasn't really charging - this remote will tell you that it is. It's a good helper with a dog that sheds a lot.",

And that also causes it to take much longer to complete the service. But, overall, I like Josh.",

Gets the job done without having to revert to the really expensive models that map out your house for you. I love the rubber rollers on the bottom since they do not get tangled with hair they way the brushes do. ALso, this model is real easy to clean. all the brushes come off really easy and the hair that get pulled up wraps around the side of the roller. So this vacuum allows you to remove the roller and slip the bundle of hair off the spindle and into the trash!! No sitting there pulling hair out of the rollers!!",

      "text": "The E5 model is quieter and more stylish compared to the 690 model\u2014 we set up E5 and let it run for the grandparents\u2019 house. For the value, however, I feel that the 690 model offers very comparable features for less the price. I personally opted for the 690 model because it can do what I want it to do at a lower price. But if price point isn't an issue, E5 has a more stylish look and less maintenance because of E5's rubber brush instead of the traditional brush.",
