The order confirmation indicated I was shipped the C5FM. I instead received the C5EM, which is inferior to the C5FM. I ended up returning it even after getting a credit because the wireless did not work well and was extremely slow. It's important to check the order carefully.",

It's very annoying. Since I wrote the first paragraph of this review, the disconnect problem has gotten worse. The Acer now disconnects from the router every few minutes. There is nothing wrong with the router. My husband's PC has no problems, and it is connected to the same router.",

Solid state components make it fast. Chromebooks make things easier in many ways because of the integrated approach of Google - her email is available on her Chromebook as well as an Android phone.

      "text": "This chromebook is great if you have realistic expectations. This is good for watching movies and browsing the web. It uses Kodi. It\u2019s great for writing emails and writing small documents. This is NOT good for Wordpress, web design, working with long documents (even on google docs/sheets) or any sort of image editing whatsoever. The long battery life and low price is appealing but keep in mind, if you need a better processor, you are simply not going to find it at this price point. That being said this chromebook is dope.",

It's not unusable but doesn't feel high quality and doesn't really feel 100% responsive. I bought a wireless mouse and it solved that problem. Still would love for a better trackpad when I'm on the go.",

That said the one I received had a defect that I'd advise purchasers to check for. When playing a movie on it I noticed a bright bleed through along the upper left and a bit on the lower left. This was super distracting in dark scenes. Please check. I've removed one star for quality issues.",
