The Kingston has a 5 year warranty as does the Samsung - though it doesn't claim to be waterproof, shockproof, and dust proof. It does the the job. The Kingston drive has a key ring that is easier to attach to a key ring than the Samsung drive. However, the flat form factor makes it more difficult to insert and remove than the Samsung drive. As far as speed goes I copied a 3.4 gig file to each of the drives. It took less than half the time to wrtie the file to the Samsung drive as it did to the Kingston.",

I ran a few manual file transfer tests as well (with a mix of small, medium & large files), and it okay, but not as fast as the Sandisk.

And possesses something that for me, never be missing in a pendrive: its led light, which indicates us safely if it is in use (theme that in Kingston have been ignoring many of its models and now fortunately is back).

Unfortunately, the light is only visible from one side (would have been nice if the little light window were visible from both sides). Aside from that, it has basically worked very time.

      "text": "Thumb drives are not rated to last long compared to physical drives due to their internal charges eventually discharging. I chose the Kingston Digital 32 GB DataTraveler because of the long warranty, low price, and high reviews. I used the drive earlier today to make a recovery disk for my new laptop that does not have a recovery partition [what a nice surprise to find out a month after using the laptop]. Anyhow, here's hopefully I will never need the recovery disk. And if so, hopefully the disk reads and writes as accurately as hoped. Time will tell.",

By comparison, my PNY 128GB flash drive almost double or triple the speed in the same environment. I am revising my review to 4 stars after testing a similar drive (Samsung 64GB Bar) which has slightly better transfer speed.
