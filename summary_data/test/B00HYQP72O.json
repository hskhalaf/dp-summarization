I am about 215-220 pounds and have no issues with stability doing pull ups. I purchased some TRX type of straps and they are working out great attached to the bar, but I will have to get some 45lb plates to adequately stabilize the base for some exercises. I have not yet found a bar, but eventually I'll use it to do squats and some overhead press exercises.",

Easy to assemble by one person, just needed a ratchet wrench. Overall it's a great deal for the price. As far as the stability, I placed heavy rocks on the base to do kipping pullups but if indoors, I'd have bolted into the ground.",

The side bars do limit the range of motion, but it works well with inversions. I adapted most of my stretches to keep the weight under the bar and it works well. The stand would likely tip if swinging too much. I will eventually weigh it down with sandbags to do more angled exercises, but for now, I feel very comfortable with this stand.",

Cons: Instructions could be better. Assembly is kind of a b*tch. I suggest you use pliers or a wrench if you have one because the one Hex key they give you isn\u2019t going to do much. No safety catchers, you have to buy them separately.",
