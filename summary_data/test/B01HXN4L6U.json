      "text": "Bought this a year ago and when I got home last night I saw the bottom shelf holding the receiver shattered. Glass pieces were all over the area and took me awhile to clean it up. The Yamaha website has the receiver weighing 22 pounds so the shelf should have held it. Very disappointed and trying to contact the company to send me a replacement shelf. UPDATE: Fitueyes just sent me a replacement glass shelf. Happy they responded to my emails and now i can use the audio tower which looks great in my living room. Thanks Fitueyes!",

Look at the pictures of the finished product. This unit is built upside down. Once assembly is completed, you will turn the unit right side up. That said, each glass shelf has a matte side, and the glossy side. During assembly, the matte side of the shelf should face up. When it comes time to tighten everything up (step 7), hand tighten each leg, then in a round robin fashion, continue to tighten each leg. Do not over tighten. Enjoy...",

The weight for bottom shelves is 33 lbs each and top one is 88 lbs. My power amplifier weighs 80 lbs and I wanted to put it on bottom shelf instead of a top shelf, so I combined two glass shelves into one. See the attached pic. If they can include the threaded rod for 2 shelves, I would have given 5 stars.",

Mine arrive timely and in great condition. It was easily assembled and is sturdy once together. It is the perfect size for my needs and even has some room to spare. If you are looking for a small unit to house your electronics, this should be at the top of your list. My only gripe is no cord management, but that is easy to take care of yourself.",

I have a preamp and 2 monoblock amps so it can hold a good amount of weight but you really don't want to move it around once it's all loaded up. If you have to move it once it's all setup i highly suggest you remove some of your components first as this thing is mostly glass. The square columns are indeed metal albeit thin possibly aluminum, at first i thought it was plastic but this really is an all glass and metal console.",

Nice looking and perfect for my Audio components. Easy to assemble, as long you start out by following the instructions and make sure the threaded rod is more than hand tight. Take a pair of channel locks or something you can tighten it snug, but not over tight. After you do that, it pretty simple.the cabinet looks great and shows off my stuff. If your looking for a inexpensive Audio cabinet for you Audio, this works and looks very professional. I would definitely recommend this product.",

I just had my Harmon Kardon HK2000 cassette deck gone over and had recently purchased the silver (Japanese version) Marantz CD5005 CD player. That led me to bring out of retirement my Marantz 2240 stereo receiver which I had bought new in 1975 when I had worked in a small independent stereo store.. The stand fit perfectly in my small living room and the top shelf was sturdy enough for me to place the 2240 with the wood cabinet on. With everything in place, the whole system is rock steady.",
