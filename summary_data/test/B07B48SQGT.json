Cons: * Not for a fitness freak as it lacks GPS. * It's not as good smartwatch as Apple Watch but hey it's not as pricey as Apple watch.",

      "text": "The first 3 months of use went great. Then around December 2018 after a system update completed I started having display issues. Either the screen would not appear or it was covered with several lines. After some time the screen came back and at that time I shut it down to \"reboot\". This seemed to help however, the screen glitches are becoming more frequent and lasting longer. The buttons seem to still be operating as the unit vibrates but nothing is being displayed or several lines running vertically run through it. Now I am trying to use the 1 year warranty to get a replacement.",

I contacted the company and after a lot of emails , they will not replace my versa even though in one if their emails they said that they have heard from other customers that they have had the same problem. It was tracking my steps, vibrating for texts or calls but no display. So disappointed",

I had to clean and adjust the charger each time, and now.... it won\u2019t charge at all. I\u2019ve tried everything to trouble shoot including different plugs, different outlets, cleaning the posts and the watchback... and now it just overheats (not to the touch), permanently black screen, and no use. So disappointed. I hate to change brands because I love the Fitbit app and the community, but this was disheartening.",

      "text": "Less than 14 months after my husband spent $200 on my Versa, the heartrate doesn't properly track during my workouts. It goes in and out and even with adjusting the placement doesn't solve the problem. Because I'm less than 2 months outside of the warranty window, Fitbit has offered me a 25% discount on the purchase of another watch. That is nice but the same thing happened with my Charge 2 so spending another couple hundred for maybe a year-ish of usage doesn't sound like a good investment. I'm newly postpartum and just want to be able to accurately track my workouts!",
