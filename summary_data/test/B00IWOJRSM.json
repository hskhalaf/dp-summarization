Any longer than that and it's a charred mess. I dunno, maybe mine is defective? Anyway. Hate it. Would not buy again.",

I would recommend they add a latch so you don't have to sit there and hold it while it's working. I Dossow recommend a little cool collected fruit on the bottom kind of like we have in the George Foreman so you don't have a messy the counter every time you make a sandwich .",

The surface area is larger than the small Geo. Foreman grill. Also I like the fact that it is not slanted (we don't eat meat so don't have to worry about draining 'grease'). It cleans up easily. The floating top allows for different thicknesses of sandwiches and it beats using both a skillet and the toaster oven.",

I don't know how much safe it was, but I had to play with the plug and push them to narrow them end, try, fail and again push those connectors - so they could finally be connected to wall-plug. Never saw any electrical item , even china made stuff, like this! Potentially unsafe - can Hamilton beach confirm, if this is the way it's expected to ship? 2) Unable to adjust the knob to be able to accommodate well-stuffed sandwich (the picture shown by amazon looks fairy tale. My sandwiches are smaller , but still can't be accommodated)",

Plug in the power cord to turn on the appliance, wait until the light turns green and pop in a folded tortilla filled with cheese. Close the lid and wait a few minutes and BAM! Instant Mexican! No power button so you pull the cord from the power outlet to turn off. NON removable grills so clean accordingly.",
