When it is in use, the flames make the glass look like it is shimmery and has a water-like appearance. We purchased these to replace our lava rocks that came with our original fire pit, because the lava rocks did not hold any of the heat that was produced. The Starfire glass heats up quickly and seems to radiate more heat as we sit around our fire pit. They also cool very quickly. All of the stones were uniform and whole, we had no jagged edges to worry about. Ten pounds of glass filled our pit nicely. Would buy again!",

A really cool effect. The pebbles were good quality - no chips or broken bits in the bag. No issues with popping either but we usually keep the flame between low and medium, so don\u2019t know how they\u2019d react to high heat. All in all we\u2019re very pleased.",
