I thought that if I removed them, the two plastic pieces would open to reveal the battery. Wrong! I could not separate the two pieces of plastic. In a futile 10 minutes of frustration, I threw the thing in the garbage. My suggestion: Stop buying this Chinese crap, pay $10 more, and have a thing last longer than a few months.",
