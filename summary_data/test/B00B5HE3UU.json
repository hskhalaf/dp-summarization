      "text": "As a \"point and shoot\" (limited) photographer, this Canon (my second Canon) is a feature-filled yet simple camera that offered all of the \"make life easy\" features and more. My experience with Canon technical service has been great; they are responsive, very fair, and accessible. The silver camera (pictured) is the one I originally received and it had a technical defect. I contacted Canon and, within 10 days, I had a new camera (my is in black...and I really like the color). It operates beautifully. At this point in time (having only had the camera for a month), I am very happy.",

The Canon 330 fits almost imperceptibly in one's pocket even though it has a 10X zoom. Combined with an ultra-wide angle and a user friendly format once one gets used to it, it is an excellent camera to carry for photos clearly superior to that of a smart phone. I have used it indoors on high telephoto with no flash, results being fairly good. I haven't used it that extensively yet, especially in video mode, but I have been quite satisfied with it so far, especially for its diminutive size.",

I have purchased some previous Cannon cameras of this kind and this last version is even better with way more functions than I know how to use, but I keep learning as I go. I love the hybrid camera/video function and leave it on all the time so I have these little mini-movies of every event I take pictures at. The self timer, lighting adjustments, special effects features, slow motion, the wide variety of other settings and ease of use make this a much better camera choice for me.",

The only issue I have found so far is how to downsize the pictures easily for sharing - I'm sure there is an easy way to do it just haven't gotten through that learning curve yet! I have not tried the wi-fi setup so I can't comment on that. Overall it is a great little camera.",

First, it started while taking photos overseas. The error messages ranged from battery needed to be recharged - battery charger light would keep changing sporadically from no light to green to red - to lens related error messages. The seller - beach camera - pointed me to the Canon Customer Support who was not able to pinpoint the root cause for the problem and wanted me to send the camera back for them to examine it. I took a chance and bought two halcyon batteries which took care of the problem.",

I love the size (slides into any pocket), performance (wide angle to long zoom, picture size choices, quickly ready to shoot), and features (quite a few overrides of \"standard\" so can take good pictures in difficult lighting conditions). Small negatives: The performance should not be compared to SLRs - picture taking is not instant, but it is adequate. There is no full manual for shutter and aperture - but that is rarely needed.",

If you have a security code, you need to only enter it once. Couldn't be easier. You will need to push one button on the camera to turn on wifi, but that's basically it. No more laptops and cords, and the photos are definitely better than iphone quality.",

The program mode is useless and there is not much you can do to customize your settings if auto is not doing a good job. Still do not like it as much as my last camera, but maybe I just need more time with it.",

I am no expert in photography, but the pictures in auto mode come out very crisp and the colors are vivid.

It's a little strange that the timer is so many clicks away, but I'm getting used to it. Everything can't be at your finger tips. ... One tip for everyone, this camara seems to work better without the flash. So if a picture is a little dark or grainy, try it again without the flash.",

The large, clear LCD panel is easy to see, the zoom at 10x is nice and versatile, the lens and sensor combo quality seems great for such a small device, and the anti-shake technology also works well. You can just set it to auto-mode and let it do its stuff with great results. Finally, a point and shoot is much easier for her to hold and use than a smart phone, as well as producing consistently better results. She and I are both very happy with this camera!",

I purchased this days prior to a long trip without internet access, and had to wing my way through learning the camera without a hard copy of a manual. Luckily, it is quite similar in many respects to other Canon cameras I have owned with regards to the menu settings.",

Fitting a high-performance lens with such wide zoom range into a camera so thin would normally be considered an impossible feat, but Canon's expert optical engineering met the challenge, developing a lens that achieves outstanding compactness with high zoom power and superb performance. The zoom starts at 24mm wide-angle and extends to 240mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering an exceptionally wide range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 24mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nEXPERIENCE THE POWER\n12.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot ELPH 330 HS employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light\u2013capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\nCANON DIGIC 5 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS's image sensor to bring phenomenal increases in processing speed and power, delivering incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. The faster processing speed results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like lens correction, special scene modes and much more.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM FOR EXCEPTIONAL LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE UP TO ISO 6400\nThe PowerShot ELPH 330 HS gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and even when shooting video.\n\nGET THE COMPLETE HD EXPERIENCE\nCAPTURE BEAUTIFUL 1080P FULL HD VIDEO IN STEREO SOUND WITH A DEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON; ZOOM WHILE SHOOTING AND PLAY BACK VIDEOS ON AN HDTV VIA THE HDMI OUTPUT\nSimply touch the dedicated movie button on the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS to start recording video in 1080p Full HD that is breathtakingly vivid and realistic. You're free to use the full range of the zoom in movie mode, and sound is recorded in stereo. HDMI output allows you to view and share your video on an HDTV immediately, simply by connecting the camera to the TV with an optional HDMI cable.\n\nREMEMBER THE DAY IN CRISP HD\nNEW HYBRID AUTO UTILIZES A COMBINATION OF SMART AUTO AND INTELLIGENT IS TO CREATE A BEAUTIFUL AND STEADY 720P HD VIDEO CLIP IN MOVIE DIGEST MODE EVERY TIME YOU SHOOT A STILL IMAGE\nNew Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS brings enhanced image quality to the popular Movie Digest feature on PowerShot digital cameras. Movie Digest records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, any time you're shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this \"highlight reel\" is more beautiful than ever. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality.

The result of several improved technologies, High Speed AF delivers a significantly faster focus speed of 0.16 seconds and a dramatically reduced shooting lag time of 0.19 seconds for a super-responsive shooting experience that lets you capture every great shot as it happens. The technology also powers the camera's High-Speed Burst with continuous shooting at 6.2 frames per second. Moreover, images captured in High-Speed Burst maintain the camera's superb image quality.\n\n\n\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \nA CHARGE THAT LASTS AS LONG AS A MEMORY\nNEW ECO MODE HELPS REDUCE POWER CONSUMPTION FOR LONGER BATTERY LIFE.\nThe PowerShot ELPH 330 HS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae feature on the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nSMART AUTO\nSmart AUTO for the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS makes it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images and videos you're looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright, snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as \"keeper\" shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
