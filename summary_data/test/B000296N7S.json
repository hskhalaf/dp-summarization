Seriously though, I know it works very well on my two dogs - they sometimes pick up roundworms or other parasites from snacking on dead things in the woods. They don't seem to mind the taste and I haven't noticed any kind of side effect. In fact, one of my dogs is prone to diarrhea and has had clean fecal tests. Taking a course of Panacur has helped to resolve her periodic GI issues so I'm guessing she's more sensitive to parasites than my other dog. It's affordable, available without a prescription, and works well.",
