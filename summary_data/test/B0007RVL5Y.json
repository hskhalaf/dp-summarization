After using the product I can go back to that video and read his mind... His mind reads, oh IM going to make so much money off this colored water, and all these dumb consumers are gonna think it works.... Seriously mild soapy water works way better,",

Sprayed down the wheels and used a brush to work the stuffing in. Rinsed it off and it looks like a brand new wheel . Will attach pictures .",
