If you're wondering about the blood it's been from the last two deer I've gotten. During the gutting stages of processing the deer I'd forgotten that my watch was still on BOTH times somehow and I'm proud to say this watch was durable enough to withstand being soaked in blood. Not sure if that's a selling point but it's a testament to it's strength.",
