At first my grandpa was against the rollator saying he just needs a cane. After about 5-10 minute he fell in love, he actually sat in the chair part of the rollator instead of his dining room table. I stopped by his house this morning to check on him and he is still a hug fan of the product. Thank you for such a great product at a great price. My grandpa now has a new sense of freedom.",

Tennis balls and \"walker skis\" were useless. She uses this to come and go to dialysis. The only thing this rollator does not have is a foot rest. I solved that by taking cable ties and linking them together and tying them to the frame. This keeps the ants off her feet when she wants to sit and take a rest.",

      "text": "Great value ! Its very sturdy, and well made. It was so easy to put together, only took about 15 minutes. My only complaint is that I wish it had some sort of lock or latch to keep it from opening when its folded up. Also, its not easy to put it in the car. My car has a large trunk, but this still doesn't fit in it.... I have to lay it on the back seat. Glad I don't need it all the time, just on grass or other uneven surfaces, on which it works very well.",

My daughter was using this on a smooth, outdoor sidewalk when a back wheel snapped completely off, causing her to stumble and almost fall to the ground. I would recommend this walker for limited, indoor, carpeted use only as the wheels are made from smooth and inexpensive plastic material. - Easy to assemble - Easy to fold for transport - Brakes engage and disengage easily - Seat is comfortable - Wheels break easily - Device should be used indoors only",
