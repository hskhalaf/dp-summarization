Nobody offers nearly as much protection, they are cool because the vents actually work when you are moving and the palms are super tough but thin with fantastic feel. These gloves may not be marketed for dirt bike gloves ,but they still are the best designed dirt bike glove ever produced.",

I bought two pair because some other reviews had said they would break at the stitching after some use, but the price was still worth it. I have about 250 hours of game time with the first set and they are still holding up well.",

My only negative takeaway from this product is the cuffs are a little short. I wish they were another inch or so longer because they get kind of bunched up under the velcro wristband. Aside from that, they work perfectly for what I needed and I would definitely recommend them.",

There is a hook to connect both gloves together so they don't get lost easily. Lastly, they have a strap attached to keep them snug on your hands. Overall not a bad price for gloves being put to use in airsoft, I'm pretty sure these will hold up in snowy conditions as well.",
