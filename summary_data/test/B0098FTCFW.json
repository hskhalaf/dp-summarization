It took about 16 hours to get the space up to temperature (70 degrees) but has since maintained it nicely. Only negative I have to say, is the unit is smaller than I was anticipating.

However, once unloaded from box it's very easy to push and set up in room. Cons: Power cord short in length, remote control is very poor made \"buttons stick\" Pros: Heats room in minutes, easy to wheel on floor, PRICE",

The flames are random so theyre fairly realistic and the burning logs look quite realistic. The wheels were already installed so it only had to be plugged in to start using it. It arrived without a single flaw too. Very happy!",
