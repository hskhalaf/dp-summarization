If you want something dedicated to just 4x6 photos at a reasonable price, I recommend getting the 760 model. The newer models cost more and don't have any advantage over this one. All they've added is a ridiculous bucket and bright colors on the printer. I like the all white one better, anyway.",

It would be nice to be able to zoom in on a picture and then print, but I can do that with my other ink jet printer and it really isn't a big deal. As far as \"exact 4x6 size paper\", who cares! I will just use the pics for scrapbooking and will be cutting them up anyway. I already framed one of the pics and it fit perfectly. I only paid $75 for it and it was totally worth it!",

It was not possible to take it out. I tried to repair it but without any success. Everything is packed on the way that no repair is possible. When it was working everything was ok, but it stopped after 100 pictures. What to say? It is too expensive printer for so short `life time'. The price should not be more than $50-60.
