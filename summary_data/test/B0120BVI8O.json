What I like is that for loose skin makes you feel everthing is on its place and tight(not super tight) and you can wear it everyday without feeling you are short of breath. I think that for the price is good enough.",

I put this on whenever I remember. And for the price I\u2019m really happy. It fits over your body and it\u2019s tight enough. I\u2019ve used a few waist trainers in my life and they do actually help your shape a bit.",

Pro tip: move the hooks to the back for the best concealment. Even under a bodycon dress you can't tell I'm wearing it if the hooks are in the back.",
