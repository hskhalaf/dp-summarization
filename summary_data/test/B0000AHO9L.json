There is a black polyester insert with a handle that I can remove and carry the laptop separately. The other separate space has two meshed enclosures. I keep my laptop cords in there.",

As it ended up I did 4 stars and returned it as this model just did not have the internal layout that I needed/wanted. My old Samsonite (basically the same case) that traveled for 10+ years has several extra horizontal zipper sections at the tops of compartments which really helped to keep things flatter. This new one did not have them.",

This new unit is so poorly made I'm embarrass for the Samsonite brand. This new unit wouldn't withstand a single flight as a checked bag. I repackaged the unit for return right after I opened it..... come on Samsonite, we deserve better than this.",

I called Samonite 3x and each time was told to call another number. I got tired of the run around! I don't know what it is supposed to fit, but it does not fit a HP 15.4\" laptop. I don't think it will fit a 12\" laptop either. Oh well, so much for samsonite. I still have the Mobile Office and the portable bag that is way too small.",

It\u2019s is handle quality can be a deal breaker. I would like to send it back.",

    "description": "Size:18\"| Color:BlackNotebook case is made of ballistic nylon fabric with EVA foam backing. Design features a separate compartment for business and personal belongings, padded honeycomb frame laptop compartment, fully lined interior, and gusseted pockets. Carry with zip-away retractable handle or comfortable padded handles. Notebook case rolls on shock-absorbing softspin wheels.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSamsonite's rugged and attractive Business One mobile office boasts durable 1680 Denier Ballistic Nylon fabric with EVA foam backing and roomy compartments for your computer and other personal effects. The case's 1680D ballistic nylon is a standard, even weave of durable nylon originally specified by the Federal Government for military use. The term \"denier\" (D) refers to the size of the yarn used: the larger the denier, the bigger the yarn.\n\n The case's SoftSpin wheels travel more quietly than traditional inline skate wheels and reduce shocks by absorbing vibrations. Its push-button retractable handle locks when fully extended so you can push or pull the case, and the handle also locks when fully recessed, reducing the risk of damage when it's not in use.\n\n Stash your laptop in a padded compartment specifically designed to carry and protect it while you're traveling. Last but certainly not least, a handy organizer pocket offers areas to store writing instruments, cellular phones, PDAs, and other accessories.\n\n The case measures 17.5 x 14 x 9 inches (W x H x D).",
