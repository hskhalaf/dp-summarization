Why would Amazon think an easy solution for a customer would be to use web based services. The ease of use is what sells a product in today's world.

I'd stick with only buying the Amazon Echo, Tap, and similar voice activated user friendly devices because there is nothing to show on the ECHO SHOW. Basically now my Echo Show is a fancy clock with weather updates sitting on a side table collecting dust.",

I don't plan to return it just because it still supports Spotify and the hardware is very decent for the price I got it at. Love the speakers. But buying an alarm clock/music player was not my plan.

Cons: -No parental controls on viewing Amazon Prime videos.
