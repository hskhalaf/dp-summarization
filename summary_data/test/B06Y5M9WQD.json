      "text": "I was replacing a 15 year old receiver, and didn't want to spend a lot of money on the next receiver. This was a great win. I really wanted only a 5.1 system for the speaker set that I have in my small apartment, and the sound from this is lovely. I'm not an audiophile so this is great value for me. The only thing that I needed other than that, was banana plugs in the receiver. As for things I don't like. The menu system is pretty weak, and the pre-set HDMI buttons on the remote don't really make sense for a house with no cable and a lot of gaming/streaming.",

I don't have a 4K TV yet, but I feel safe knowing that once I get one, it's already compatible with 4K upscaling and HDR/Dolby Vision passthrough. I'm only a minor audiophile, but it sounds like music to my ears (pun sort of intended) when paired with some Polk Audio RM6751s. Amazon delivery was painless... There was minor damage in a corner of the box but it was superficial. Everything is great with this package. Can't beat that price either.",

They don't respond to emails and their tech people have little expertise. This is a very weak link in their product. Otherwise, I would give this product another star.",

      "text": "Aside from the price, the main reason I purchased this receiver was for the Chromecast built-in functionality. Unfortunately, the Chromecast implementation on this device is so buggy as to be unusable. Cast enabled apps are able to see the receiver; however, they generally fail to connect. On the rare occasion that apps successfully connect to the receiver, the audio is choppy and the controls are laggy. This seems to be specific to this Pioneer receiver, as I have no trouble using Chromecast with a Google Home located in the same room as this unit or with other streaming devices in my house. Very disappointed with this product and would not recommend.",
