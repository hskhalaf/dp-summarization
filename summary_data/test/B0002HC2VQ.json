      "text": "This chain mortiser is worth its weight in gold. I have been using this for the past 30 days and the only maintenance so far is tightening and oiling the chain. At this rate, I will finish cutting every beam for my 32 x 48' barn using the original chain. My advice is to let the weight of the machine do the working and not force it into the beams. I see no need to purchase a high-end mortiser (SwissPRO, HEMA) unless you're a professional timber framer.",

      "text": "Couple of minor issues including really crappy manual and some learning curve, so expect to burn a few pieces before you get going. The wing nut for the depth stop is crap and if the machine digs it can knock it loose so careful what you are mortising over. Also the little handle for dialing the head in and out couldn't be any smaller. my advice is leave yourself a little room and go back and clean up with a chisel. the teeth don't give a precise cut at least in oak. Other than that it is great",

I estimated that it would have taken a few guys the entire day to accomplish what we were able to do in a couple of hours.",

You can cut a 5\" wide mortise without any repositioning and a mortise for a 2\" thick tenon cuts in three strips. A 2x5 mortise takes at most a minute to setup and cut. Cleanup is minimal. It was delivered with a broken handle and some brackets bent up. Amazon was of no help but the local Makita service center is trying to get the parts replaced.",

I use these type of reviews, so felt somewhat obligated to pass on my thoughts on items. Again, very easy to use, just clamp onto the log, set the depth and make the cut. I have used it only with oak and it cuts a very clean mortise. I have had zero problems with this. Heavy, well built.",

The process is fast enough that I was even able to recut a mortise quickly while the crane operator waited to lift the beam into place. However, I feel like the chain is much duller now, and I can't figure out how to get it sharpened, and would like to get another one anyway, but the only price I can find is 550.00.",
