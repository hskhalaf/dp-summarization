All other shoes hurt my feet (and in turn my back- I have disc issues) after only a couple of hours. I even wear them on weekends if I know I'm going to be doing a lot of walking. All in all, they are extremely comfortable. I buy them a little big so I can wear multiple pairs of socks in winter (work outdoors), and even then they're not too tight. Love my Timberlands!",
