Too much money for a can of spray that lasts for less than 10% of the contents. Guess I need to find an alternative. Contacted the Company that makes Boeshield. They were excellent to deal with. THEY SUGGESTED I SOAK THE CANS IN HOT WATER FOR AN HOUR THEN TRY. WORKED PERFECT. NO MORE ISSUES. The company replaced the original products. Excellent company and excellent product. I highly recommend.",

By applying this lubricant after the ride including using a rag to wipe off the excess, the T-9 both cleans the chain and the nset ups over 3 hours as a waxy film.... Your chain attracts far less dirt with this lube.... I have used this T9 for over 10 years and have never found anything close to it on the market.... I also use this on my cars, trailers, lawnmowers etc... Anywhere that I want to either lubricate or protect metal from rusting....",

I use it on my planes, table saw and most any tool where rust is a problem. It does not leave that sticky film when it dries like WD does. It dries to a smooth, clean, low friction coating with no unwanted residue. Can't say enough.",

      "text": "Boesheild T-9 is my go to rust preventer for tools, work surfaces and most everything else. It leaves a dry paraffin wax finish unlike some other products often used as rust preventers like WD-40 or greases. This makes it ideal for tools that need a positive hand feel and not a slippery grease finish. I love using paste wax for rustproofing as well, but this product lets you do it very quickly and with almost guaranteed 100% coverage because of the aerosol delivery. Spray on one heavy wet coat and wipe the excess with a rag. Let the product dry for a few minutes and now you have a protected, good looking and great feeling surface.",

Now, it's easy to pull out. Also use it on all the house window opening and closing mechanisms once a year. That seems to be all that's needed. We have salty air at times in Hawaii and this does a good job of protecting all the moving parts from corrosion. It does the same nice, quick job as WD40 but hangs around longer.",

    "title": "BOESHIELD T-9 Rust & Corrosion Protection/Inhibitor and Waterproof Lubrication, 12 oz.",
    "description": "Size:TrueBoeshield T-9 was developed and licensed by global aerospace leader, The Boeing Company, to fill a need for high-performance, long-term metal protection and lubrication. T-9's rust preventative spray uses a unique formulation of solvent carrier and paraffin wax coating engineered to penetrate crevices deeply, displace moisture, dissolve minor corrosion, and leave a clean, waxy coating with lasting durability-without using Teflon, silicone, fluorocarbons, MEK, or acetone. Whether it be automotive, bicycle, industrial, lawn and garden, marine, RV or tools, T-9 continues to be the best option for rust prevention and waterproof lubrication.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nOn a seafaring yacht, a dusty ATV, or a shower door, T-9 has you covered. Boeshield T-9 endures muddy bike trails, rain-soaked back roads, and salted highways. It withstands farmer\u2019s fields, offshore oil rigs, and carpenter's workshops. For everyone from firefighters and road crews to cyclists and sailors, Boeshield T-9 is the proven solution. T-9 attacks existing corrosion, loosens rusty parts, and flushes out old lubricants. It is also extremely useful for drying wet parts, electrical motors and circuits, ignitions, and connectors. Apply T-9 and wipe off the excess for immediate use. T-9 dries to a waxy, waterproof finish without leaving a sticky film to attract dirt, dust, or mud. T-9 stays liquid long enough to permeate metal crevices and seep deep inside assembled components to leave a durable protective coating as well as lubricating and protecting-all without dismantling your equipment. Apply T-9 to any metal surface and let it dry. One simple step gives you a thin, penetrating film of durable, waterproof protection and lubrication that endures, months after month or mile after mile. T-9 dries to a clean, waxy, waterproof film that won't wash off in rain, puddles, or mud. You can rinse away sand, dust and grime with water, while leaving the lubricant intact. T-9 will not harm paint, plastic, rubber, fiberglass, or vinyl. It can be used on engines, wiring, and belts. T-9 is nonconductive and will not cause short circuits, so it's also safe to use on electronics. Use solvent or any emulsifying cleaner to easily remove T-9, or simply respray and allow T-9 to dissolve itself before wiping it off.",
