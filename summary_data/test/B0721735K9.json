She did keep slink/stalking the corner for a while afterward but hasn't attacked the chair since. Our Tomcat watched the event and steered clear for a couple of days. When he finally decided to claw the chair it was the exact same behavior. Neither of them have tried to claw the chair in the past week.",

It\u2019s been almost a week and zero footprints now for days!! Totally fixed an annoying issue. Now I can keep my plant there without it having little nibble marks. I would say the sensor is pretty sensitive it actually got me once or twice but no smell and just a small blast of air. I would recommend!",

      "text": "This thing is amazing! My cat would scratch at the door every night, waking me up. I bought this and put it right outside the door and it works amazingly well. Now I only turn it on when my cat starts testing it again, maybe once every 2-3 months. For the counter, I place it in the corner of the counter so it sees the whole counter top. Works there too. Downside is that sometimes the motion detection is spotty. Sometimes my cat can walk right up to it and it not go off. But it goes off enough that it works. Highly recommend this!",

This product is easy to set up and works as advertised. We have enjoyed blissful sleep and the cats are just fine! I especially love that there is an on/off switch. I\u2019m not sure if it would keep the cats out of a room with an open door or not - at least my cats might just run right past. I wanted to keep them away from a closed door so it worked perfectly for me!",

      "text": "Updated below. At first I thought this product would be great. It is top heavy and easily tips over. After a day and a half it stopped working. I cleaned the nozzle, checked the can of air, and reseated the sensor - nothing. I will call customer care and update this review. *I messaged the product customer service via their website and they were very helpful. They quickly sent a replacement with a return label for the non-working part. The second has been working without fail for several days now. Very pleased with the product and customer care.",
