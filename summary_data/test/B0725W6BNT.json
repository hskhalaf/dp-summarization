It's the perfect size - a little bigger than I expected but not excessively large, about torso length for my average sized son. The best feature is that it's surprisingly soft. The material is silky fleece and the stuffing is squishy. I'd say it's on the understuffed side, perfect for bedtime but not great for posing and sitting. I've purchased similar dolls in the past and was very happy with them, but none were as soft as this one. I'm very happy with my purchase and will be back for other characters.",

It is rare to find items this well made now-a-days. If you are looking for the iconic look of Batman, this is the plush for you.",

Well proportioned and he's kept his shape despite a lot of rough and tumble action from our 3 year old. It goes all over the house with him, and Batman does all his own stunts. Only small issue I've seen is that his cape is a dog hair magnet! So he gets hit with the lint roller every few days & he looks good as new. Definitely recommend & I'm looking into other characters from this line!",
