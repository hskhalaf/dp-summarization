I taped it so I could complete the setup process, but I would really appreciate a NEW middle drawer. This simple request has NOT yet been resolved or even addressed, for that matter. VERY satisfied with the product quality and value. Just wish somebody would answer my notes to the Seller about the replacement drawer. Would DEFINITELY buy it again.",

The quality is sturdy. Great position. Easy to put together (thanks dad!) but this can be adjusted to a normal desk chair as well as a stool I am using it with my herman miller and the combination is perfect. Everything on the table is adjustable. Compartments are perfect sizes unless your picasso or super savvy artist, I have not yet met any of those requirements but I am definitely a beginner. This is great for those long hours. Buy the lamp that is recommended too.",

My wife assembled the desk and she noticed that the instructions for placing the wire shelf basket would have you putting it together backwards but caught that mistake before assembly. We did have one cracked tray (as others have had), but the damage was not bad enough to contact the seller/manufacturer for replacement. I little glue will fix it. Overall, the desk is sturdy and nice looking. The tilt surface is a plus and our daughter seems to be enjoying it very much. 4 stars due to a couple instructional errors.",

I called the company directly and they resolved it immediately. If you intend to use the tilt feature then the holders on the side wouldn't work so well if tilted too much at an angle. They are optional to add to the desk although the ends are a little sharp without them. Overall a very nice desk especially for the price.",
