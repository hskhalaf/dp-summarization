I tried the Beats Studio Wireless, and although they had very nice bass, they lacked clarity. The Bose Soundlink II had very clear sound, but the bass was lacking. The Beoplay H7s were the best of both worlds. My only issue with them is that the ear cups are round instead of oval. I read that this had to do with sound stage, so I've learned to get used to it.",

Unlike some other manufacturers, these headphones do not introduce extra base to the sound. The supplied cable could be a bit longer with a built-in microphone so that I can talk on the phone.",

For longer listening the MDR1A are more comfortable and sound is more laid back. Very happy with the H7 purchase , they are great for my walks , which were the reason I bought them.",

BUT - these were clearly NOT brand new, despite being advertised as such. I purchased these only for use in my home studio, so they are not exposed to the elements and such - always in a soundproof booth on a stand. After a week they will NOT charge, so cannot be used wirelessly - which is extremely frustrating as this was the reason for the purchase. I didn't realize I hadn't bought from Amazon or B&O directly. Thus, I wouldn't recommend this company.",

      "text": "Wonderful and comfortable with a design aesthetic that is unparalleled. The audio quality is top notch. Unfortunately, the microphone is subpar as all communication when taking a call is muted according to the recipient of the call. Additionally, the background noise is amplified as well making it even more difficult to have a conversation if you are outdoors or in an open office. I would not recommend these as a headset for someone looking to use them for phone calls in addition to listening to music.",

They have full AAC codec support so when paired with my iPhone the sound quality is on par with wired headphones. My only hesitation to give it 5 stars is the touchpad on the right ear cup sometimes causes you to accidentally make calls or stop the music.",

To be honest the quality of material used in this product is outstanding. packing and design of the headphone is 5 out of 5. However there are many cons in the sound quality and sound engineering of this headphone that make me return it on very first week! at least I can admit that is not a good hadphone for professional studio works or even dj performance.",
