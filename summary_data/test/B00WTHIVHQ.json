It has a handy mesh compartment that I use for my razor. The side zipper compartments are handy. The only thing I would change would be adding another zipper to each side zip area so you do not have to completely open the compartment to get something out.",

So the size is actually better than you may think, but that also depends on how much stuff you bring with you. I don't tend to bring a lot of stuff traveling with me and don't have big bottles of shampoo and such. So it is perfect for my needs, but anyone that needs more than the basics, it might get a bit tight with size.",
