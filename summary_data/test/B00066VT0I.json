Even with a hardwired network connection the picture is often choppy and often falls out of sync with the audio. Don't waste your time with this product.

These, however, are the two formats that are supported the least, and a slow, jerky, framerate should be expected. I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue, and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable, the framerate improved, but not enough, in my opinion, for this device to even claim support for these file types. If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you, be warned, you should look elsewhere.",

The player loses it's connection and also takes too much time to load pictures. The indexing ability is poor if you have many photos in multiple directories.

You must create a playlist, save to shared drive/folder, and rescan that drive/folder in order play. Does not play AVI files as claimed. I check daily for software/firmware updates.

      "text": "I have had the DSM-320 for six months. It does NOT play DIVX (only some XVIDs with the audio out of sync), but the radio functionality is great! Firmware updtates are done every fifth to seventh year, so don't buy this mediaplyer in expectation of having a working product in the near future. It has still got more bugs than an African youth hostel. If you need AOL radio it is a great buy, but for anything else it is slooooooow, unreliable and very, very annoying...
