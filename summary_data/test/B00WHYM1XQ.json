The legos in the package are slightly larger than the traditional legos due to the young age of the target audience. It comes with a rather large Mickey and Minnie. Minnie also has a fabric pink skirt that you can take on/off. Each section of the train \"snaps\" together and stays relatively stuck together. A lot of other trains we have does stay together very well so each section is everywhere. My one complaint is the \"directions\" are not really clear and there is a cupcake that I cant figure out how to put together.",

He really enjoyed playing with this train, very easy to assemble, fun to play (especially if the boy likes trains/cars) and safe for kids since the blocks are big enough to make it hard for kids to put into the mouth. If you have ever seen kids play, you'll know how important it is for the toys not to have sharp or little pieces as it can be accidentally swallowed by the kids. Overall, very happy with it considering how happy my nephew is when he gets it. Money well spent I say",

She usually plays with this set as shown on the box - she hasn't mixed them with other Duplo sets yet. The train cars do not stay hitched to one another very well and this is the reason for only giving this set four stars.
