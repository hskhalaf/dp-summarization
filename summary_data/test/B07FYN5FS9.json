It is not sturdy at all, very wobbly side to side, and to make matters worse the mattress does not stay level. I put my newborn baby in this and she kept rolling to the side because her very light weight would tip the mattress enough to roll her into the side, risking suffocation. Her face pressed up against a spot that was not breathable mesh. Thank god I was watching her so closely since I felt so uneasy about the quality of the bassinet. Horrible, unsafe product. Please do not buy and risk your child\u2019s life.",

Not worth it. It was too small. He was growing by the day literally. We needed something bigger that we can use next to our bed and fit our small bedroom. This bedside sleeper did the trick! Pros: Baby sleeps better (naps and bedtime got easier after this purchase) Can see the baby easily Can access and grab the baby when he gets fussy Breastfeeding is a lot easier Room for growth Mesh sides, more air circulation Easy to put together Cons: None",

I made sure as did my husband. Another issue I had was that when the side zippered down, it was so long that it laid on the bed, and since it wasn't long enough to tuck between the two beds, it was a little difficult to sleep closely. It was a nice product overall, but it just didn't work for my family.",
