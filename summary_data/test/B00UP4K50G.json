      "verdict": "The steep price of the Salewa Alp Trainer Mid GTX was worth it based on consumers. The boot was supportive yet lightweight. The fit, comfort and undeniable durability also impressed users. The closure system, traction and customizable insoles of the pair received praises. Likewise, its light construction and quality were appreciated. However, the Alp Trainer Mid GTX has shortcomings too. People were disappointed with its narrow width and blister-causing heel region. Its lackluster breathability also didn\u2019t win the favor of a professional footwear critic.",

Although trails are reasonably well maintained, these boots worked very well on gravel, small rocks, and walking across small streams, etc. Very confortable also on the streets when in towns in rainy days, indeed waterproof. Yes I would recommend these boots.",

I wore them on a couple short 5 mile hikes and one trail was very steep with some tricky scrambles on and around loose rock, I never felt like I couldn't get a grip. It doesn't take long before to build great confidence in these lace to toe boots. Not sure how they are going to be under heavy loads and puttin in 20's, will find out and update. As far as day hikes and scrambling they are excellent!",

Easy break in! We experienced melting snow, very wet trails, and a fair amount of rock scrambling; I loved the great grip these boots provided as well as how waterproof they are. I nearly always wear a 10 1/2 in both shoes and boots, these boots fit very well. My feet are a bit wide and there was plenty of room in the toes and a snug fit elsewhere. Just what I wanted.",
