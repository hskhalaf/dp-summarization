This particular plush caught my eye since it is indeed from the Pokemon Center in Japan, and has a more unique pose than most Pikachu plush. He is a welcome addition to my Pikachu collection and will be to yours, as well. <3 edit: It's worth noting that you can now buy this cheaper on pokemoncenter.com if you're in the US!",
