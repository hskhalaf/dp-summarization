      "text": "I originally bought this tablet about two years ago. Initially, it offers a lot to a first-time tablet user: plenty of storage for apps and pretty quick functionality. However, there's no native camera app which isn't a big deal since you can easily find a free one on Google Play Store. Over time, I stopped using it as much and now the OS is pretty slow to start. If I don't use it for as much as a day, it is very sluggish doing pretty much everything, from opening apps to switching apps to swiping between home screen pages. This lasts for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour but after that it is pretty smooth again.",

At first I thought it could be due to low configuration, but the 1 GB is enough for at least running one app. Then I thought may be multiple open apps in background could be making it slow, closing all apps didn't work either. Then I though the background processes might be the reason and shutting those down didn't work as well. Finally I gave up and gave it to my 2 year old nephew to play with it.",

I like the weight and size better than my full-size iPad for a tablet. The battery life is not awesome, so that's why I took off one star. I have to recharge it after just a few hours use and - worse - it dies pretty quickly even when I'm not using it and even when I have it fully powered off. Still nice to have around though if you can get into the habit of charging it very regularly.",
