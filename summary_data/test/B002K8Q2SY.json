It has weather reports and news and the different display styles make it cool and practical. It would have been nice to have it battery operated so that it could be placed anywhere.",

      "text": "I've been using this wireless digital picture frame for 3 days. Setup was easy. So far I have only run it using framechannel to display my pictures, the weather, and the calendar. Nothing else thus far although there do seem to be many choices - I figure the weather and calendar are the only things I really want around all the time (because they don't require follow up). Image is sharp and bright. I bought mine for $55 from woot. I am thrilled with it for that price. Probably would be thrilled with it up to about $100. At current list, I think it is a bit overpriced, but I have not shopped this category much.",

The wifi has no other functionality now that framechannel shut it's doors. You're better off buying a cheaper equivalent without the wifi cause that's what your left with. Even when the frame channel was up and running, I had connectivity issues with it. Other than that, it's a great looking frame!",
