Instructions are logical...packing was good...and ease of postoperative maintenance (cleaning) was super easy. Adjusting the chain is very simple and it maintained tension the entire four hour use. Make sure to keep an eye on the chain oil level. It uses oil like an old Harley bike!",

The biggest caution I'll saw with this is that it's easy to forget it's a chainsaw because it is so light and quiet.

I have not tried it on a big log, or big tree as others have, I'll leave that up to the experts. It is very light and maneuverable. or me, so far, so good!",

However, to say it leaks oil is a major understatement. It literally drains oil. If you turn in on the side the oil drains out, as if you were just pouring it out. Whatever oil is left in it when you are done will be gone the next time you try to use it. AVOID this chainsaw. Losing all the oil makes it unusable.",

I would have to say the only down fall is that it burns through chain oil rather quickly and if it isn't sitting the right direction in storage the chain oil will leak out.",

It's nice not to have to mess with gasoline and its relatively short life span. It is very maneuverable, but strong enough to cut a variety of wood thicknesses. Overall, it's a great little saw for home use. It's short comings are is that the bar oil is pretty messy and it uses a lot. Additionally, it would be nice if DeWalt offered a small hard side chainsaw case.",
