This is a primary limitation of LED backlighting. You'll have to spend 2x more cash in order to get a higher color quality monitor.

The 4K is my main monitor with the WQHD as the secondary and I couldn't be happier. They work well in a pair, practically identical on the exterior. I've had no issues that I've seen other's complain about with shadowing, flickering or color. I tried to go with a larger 39 inch monitor but found it too large to be productive on, so this may be the perfect size. A few months in I'm very happy, I'll update this review if I run into any issues.",

Nice features include various ports for various ways to connect monitor, with many needed cables included with purchase (though for my purposes, I need to buy a separate mini-DP to DP cable for about $10). Adjustable height and orientation with sturdy swivel base are also welcomed touches. I liked it so much I just purchased a second one for use in my work office (as this one is in home office area).",

      "text": "Pros: amazing screen! Great contrast, resolution, and fps (with dp). Cons: first of all, it's really heavy. It's multiple times as heavy as my 1080 p 27 in monitor. Also the stand isn't amazingly secure. Even just pushing the power button the screen wobbles a little. It's not serious but it's noticable. Overall it's a great monitor and ignoring the stand there are no setbacks in regard to it's function (display).",

Its still no IPS monitor, but at the price the resolution makes up for it.",

I had to keep my other monitors for this reason, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'd recommend this without hesitation and may buy another.",
