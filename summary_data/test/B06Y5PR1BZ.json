I am hoping that you will take care of this since he has only worn it a handful of times in two months since I gave it to him. Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

However, even though it comes with the tool to add and remove links, it's still a good idea to take it to a jeweler. The links are difficult to remove and once the pin has been removed, the smaller holder piece on the other side (I don't know what to call it) doesn't want to stay in. My husband almost lost the watch because we added a link. The smaller piece popped out, and he only noticed when he heard the watch hit the ground.
