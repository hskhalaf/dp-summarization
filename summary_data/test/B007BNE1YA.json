This gives less lounging space and makes it harder to clean. The water bottle and holder are also much less sturdy. It falls off if it's so much as bumped.",

The water bottle which came with it attaches very securely to the cage. The water bottle itself is a cheap kind of plastic but it does the job and does not leak. It comes with a plastic hay loft.

I also purchased the smaller version, thinking the issue was the space between the double cage enclosures at the top. He continued to escape and I learned that wasn't the case after observing his escapes firsthand. It's a nice cage for larger animals, like bunnies. Just not for ferrets.",
