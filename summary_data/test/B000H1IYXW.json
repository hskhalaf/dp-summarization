I was excited to find a extra long bed rail and bought two for both sides. I love it! Set both up tonight only took about a half hour by myself(with a toddler helper not doing much help) two people could put one together and set up in no time. Fits perfectly for a king bed and is a perfect length almost covers the whole side. Extremely happy and well worth the money!",

The \"arms\" of the rail sit between the mattress and boxspring. This is customary design. The problem is that the arms are not flat, they stand approx 2.5\" tall. So when placed under the mattress they lift the mattress significantly in two areas causing the mattress to be uneven. I imagine over time it woukd damage the mattress. I can't recommend this product; not well thought out by the designers.",

Not good. And my sons 4.",

That being said, specific to this item, if you don't read the directions when snapping it together it's very hard to take back apart. This is great for safety and stability of the final product, not so great if you rushed into snapping it together to fast. The roll away feature is an added bonus, especially if your child doesn't need the guard rail all the time. I WOULD recommend the product.",

We have a pillow top king size bed, and the rail fits well with the pillow top. The rail feels very sturdy. I did not notice an odor as a previous reviewer mentioned. The fabric was also pretty well made unlike a previous review. The fabric in this box was not fraying and did not have any imperfections.",

The mechanism to lower the sides is easy to figure out, but difficult to do if you can't reach both sides at once (again, a good thing since our toddler is pretty good at figuring out mechanical things). Sliding the rail beneath the mattress to \"hide away\" is tough as the weight of the mattress kind of blocks it, but it would be doable if we needed to.",

Since the day bed has a set of springs underneath it and not another mattress you can't store it easily because it catches on the springs.
