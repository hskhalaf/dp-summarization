It has sat atop two 5.56 AR's, a 22WM, and now sits on my 300BO pistol. I have never had an issue with holding zero. The mounts require a little loctit and take some time to get set up, but hold the optic very steady. The illumination doesn't really bring much to the table other than a little better identification during low light, but has a nasty halo at full power. The quick adjustment dials are nice, but definitely not high end. Other all, great starter \"tactical\" optic for training, plinking, or varmint control.",

It has mildest, but when you zoom the optic this mildots are not magnified with the sight picture. This makes the mildots inaccurate at different magnification.

The QD scope rings are nice as well I may use a riser so I can still keep my BUIS mounted. I will update this review after I get rounds down range.",

Based on the overwhelmingly good reviews I took the chance on it but after a day at the range and the reticle maxed out to the right the closest I could get to \"zeroed\" was about 18 inches to the left of center. Frustrating day and waste of ammo. I thought about exchanging it for another that may work but I think I'll just spend the money on a better scope. Thanks to Amazon for the great return policy.",

    "description": "UTG 3-9X32 Compact CQB Bug Buster AO RGB Scope UTG 3-9X32 1\" BugBuster Scope, AO, RGB Mil-dot, QD Rings \nSCP-M392AOLWQ\nThe UTG 3-9x32 Bug Buster scope is completely sealed and 100% nitrogen filled. It is shock, fog, and rain proof for maximum reliability when mounted on your firearm or airgun application. Dual red and green illumination and an accommodating eye relief makes this scope a no brainer for all shooters who find themselves in the most diverse of environments and weather conditions. Standard for the SCP-M392AOLWQ is the included 2\u201d sunshade, quality flip-open lens caps, and quick detachable rings. This 3-9X32 Bug Buster is ready to meet your shooting needs right out of the box.\n\nTrue Strength Platform \nThe innovative True Strength(TS) Platform is a signature scope construction platform. Most significantly, it includes a Smart Spherical Structure(SSS) controlling the joint-like interaction between a scope\u2019s inner and outer tubes. The design provides long lasting reliability in these interactions to guarantee precise and responsive windage/elevation adjustment over time. TS has been at the heart of every genuine Leapers scope for more than a decade and has been fully tested on scope-killer airguns and elephant rifles with extreme recoil.\n\nMost Demanding Tests \nWe perform our testing based on actual users' input. We gather usage intelligence from all deployment aspects, carefully analyze their impacts and develop appropriate test parameters to ensure optimal performance under all conditions. TS has been at the heart of every genuine Leapers scope for more than a decade and has been fully tested on scope-killer airguns and elephant rifles with extreme recoil.\n\nPremium Lockable and Resettable Turrets \nWell-designed and constructed target turrets allow for crisp, consistent and precise windage and elevation adjustments. Its locking and re-setting features protect and complement one of the most critical parts in the optic for proper zeroing.\n\nParallax Free View from 3 Yards to Infinity \nUncommon throughout the market, this particular scope series achieves an impressive and unparalleled parallax free view from as close in as 3 yards out to infinity using its adjustable wide angle front objective.\n\nRGB Side Wheel Illumination \nLeapers/UTG pioneered red AND green reticle illumination in this industry in 2004, allowing for even more effective scope use under diverse environments and lighting conditions. The innovative side wheel control was then introduced for the RGB illumination, getting away from the traditional bulky rheostat on the eye piece and giving users quick and easy access for reticle light.\n\nRange Estimating Mil-dot Reticle \nLeapers/UTG started introducing mil-dot reticle optics from as early as 2003, pioneering the Range Estimating concept as a useful tool for hunters and shooters around the world. Today, the mil-dot reticle is widely accepted and used in this industry. Leveraging our years of experience in this area, UTG developed and refined the unique Tactical Range Estimating(TRE) mil-dot reticle and offers this feature in almost all of our optics. With some patient learning and practice using our TRE, shooters can enhance accuracy and performance in ways not imagined before. Regular mil-dot reticles found on the market usually have 4 dots in each direction of the cross hair, giving you 9 different aiming points for either windage or elevation. If you count the 2 inner tips of the opposite duplex cross hairs, you get 11 aiming points. In contrast, Leapers/UTG 36 Mil-Dot Tactical Range Estimating Reticle (TRE) has 9 dots on each direction of the cross hair, giving you 19 aiming points or 21 including the inner tips of the duplex cross hairs.\n\nAccessories \nUTG aims to provide application and solution oriented products, including useful and most commonly sough-after accessories. In addition to the flip-open lens caps, a 2\u201d sunshade and a pair of medium profile Max Strength heavy duty rings are included. The rings, with a saddle height of 15mm, fit on Picatinny/Weaver rails and are secured with patented, fully adjustable quick detach lever locks.",
