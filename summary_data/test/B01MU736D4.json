      "text": "Packaging was horrible. I hit this club on the range a total of 6 shots before the head flew off. The shaft broke off at the head. I travel a lot with my job and have been out of town since this happened and haven\u2019t had a chance to have it replaced yet. I\u2019m hoping that Amazon or TaylorMade makes this purchase right! If not, it will be my last golf club purchase using Amazon Prime. UPDATE: I called TaylorMade and they corrected my situation without question. My new shaft is in the mail. I\u2019ve hit TaylorMade drivers for years now and this was the one and only problem I\u2019ve had with any of their equipment.",

      "text": "I like the flexibility of this club especially the fade/draw adjustment. I bought the 12 degree version (Hank Haney's influence). But it can adjust up to 14 degrees and down to 10 degrees which is nice flexibility. I had the R15 but the M1 feels much more powerful. I also carry the R15 which I've adjusted upward to 14 degrees and play it like a big fairway metal!!",

I'm a beginner golfer so getting a two year old driver like this at a fraction of the original price is just as good as buying the latest driver from Taylormade.",
