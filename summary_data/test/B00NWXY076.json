I'd suggest going ahead and buying extras of everything just to have them on hand for the inevitable crashes as you're learning to fly. Also, extra batteries for this are super cheap compared to some of the other quads, so pick up a few of those so you can keep flying all day!",

The IRIS+ is the least expensive of 3D Robotics aircraft and the perfect platform to learn Pixhawk programming features. The controller has many exciting options to customize your IRIS+ to do more than what 3DR configures in it basic package. That basic package is more than enough for most users. Much more would overwhelm you. Get one, you'll like it.",

I have had previous interactions with 3DR technical support and they were completely unacceptable. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on a Dji or better yet build your own.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n3DR IRIS+ (915): The 3DR IRIS+ is your aerial passport: All you need to get started shooting photos and video from incredible new perspectives. Powered by 3DR's world famous autopilot, IRIS is a robot that will automatically fly itself where you tell it to go, while keeping a camera steady with 2-axis gimbal stabilization. And it?s so smart that it's simple. Advanced 3PV Follow Me mode turns IRIS into your own hands-free flying camera crew, and tablet-based software makes flight planning exactly this easy: If you can draw it, you can fly it. The IRIS power system gets you 16 minutes of flight time fully loaded, and you?ll want to fill every second. Product Features: IRIS+ Hardware Set: Complete set of replacement hardware for IRIS. Pixhawk External LED and USB: This kit includes external LED and USB modules to connect to Pixhawk. Use the provided four-position DF13 cables and connect to the I2C splitter module to set up a bright, multicolor LED and convenient USB port for your vehicle. Safety switch for Pixhawk: This safety button replaces the unit included with the Pixhawk kit. The safety button provides an additional measure for helping you power your vehicle on and off safely. Required for Pixhawk. Android OTG Cable: Micro-USB to Android adapter. Use with a ground station radio to view data and control a vehicle in flight. Connect the blue end to the Android device and the black end to the radio. PPM Encoder: This Pixhawk-compatible PPM encoder allows you to connect your PWM-only RC equipment to Pixhawk. Smaller than our previous PPM, our encoder will enable you to reduce all your channels to a single wire, excluding ground and power wires. Includes a PPM Encoder module, 10-position input cable (7 cm), and three-position output cable (12 cm). Cable pack: Complete set of 10 replacement cables for IRIS.
