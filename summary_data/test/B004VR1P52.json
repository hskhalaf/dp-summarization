There was one point when we were driving down the road that our tubes fell out at least 3 times. 3 different people in our group bought these tubes and when it came time to get into the water only one was losing air. I became worried but only having to stop 2 times throughout our 10 hour trip down the river did I have to stop and air it up only because I was super worried. The tube survived our crazy trip down the river even hitting many rocks along the way. This thing is super durable.",

Was the only one with cold beers :D The raft is very stable while on the water, sturdily constructed, and I like that it has cup holders and several attachment points for me to tie onto. I wish the product would specify the size of the cooler you need, it's actually quite a large space. My cooler was so small that I was able to put it in sideways. I'm planning on buying a huge cooler to fill the whole space for future trips. overall I love this cooler float and can't wait to take it out again.",
