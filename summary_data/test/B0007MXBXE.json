      "text": "This printer is a steal at the price. The color copies are great. It's way too loud, though--loud enough to be very distracting in a modest-sized room. I've replaced the four cartridges once so far--it's delivered with undersized ones. They are surprisingly pricey--the total for the four comes close to the cost of the printer. Notwithstanding all of that, it works well (double-sided copies, even) and the price was right.",

At the time it was the cheapest per page to operate, and that was with factory toner cartridges. You can buy refilled, or save even more and refill them yourself! It prints very well, and I have not had any problems with it. In fact, I bought a second one for me I like it so much! Even though it is an older model now it is almost the end of 2013, I would still recommend it over any of the current models available.",

The duplex feature is a welcome addition and I hardly get any misfeeds. There is an outlet for the heavier wt papers.",

I don't think that there is any other printer at this price that will duplex (print on both sides).

(1) limited color range. e.g., deep red gets printed as orange. (2) cannot print fine lines -- if you try to print line-art, then expect the lines to be thickened. if you have alternating black and white lines of equal width, the printout will show black over-powering white significantly. i am getting another hp 2600n, but will keep the 510n around for draft work and volume duplex printing.",

What I have found after using this for a month is that the starter toner cartridges have lasted-- I just changed the yellow after atleast 2000 color pages being printed (mostly greens), and the other cartridges are still going strong. I have not had any problems with this printer, just make sure that you select the proper type of paper that you are printing on. I would definitely recommend this color laser printers to others.",
