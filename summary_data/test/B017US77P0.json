I have tried soaking them in hot water,putting them in the freezer ,even my two sons have tried with no luck also it sounds like a plane taking off way to loud. I will never buy a cuisinart product agin not worth spending extra money for in my opinion a cheap product",

I just took it out too late to send it back so now I\u2019m stuck with this.
