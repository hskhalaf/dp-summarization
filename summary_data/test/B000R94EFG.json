      "text": "I just rec'd a replacement set after going directly to DeWalt customer service site. They replaced the original set because the three largest drill bits broke off. This appears to be a problem due to brittleness. When you see the broken pieces there is no sign of twisting. The pieces do not look like metal, almost like plastic in nature. Because these bits are expensive to replace individually it is good to get another new set. Bottom line is be very careful, taking out as little metal at a time as you can to not break the bits. I do not think DeWalt has acknowledged they have a problem, I will see when I try out the new bits.",
