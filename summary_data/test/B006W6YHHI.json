A couple weeks ago when I received the latest order, he had a couple and started having (TMI alert) loose poops that progressed to looser with blood and mucous. I wondered about the Greenies, but couldn't rule out anything else. Then, last week, it happened again. Greenies was the only thing introduced back into his diet on a regular basis. Without them, his gut recovers and is OK. Has anyone else experienced this?",

Now my dog is very happily carrying on the family tradition. We give her one when we brush our teeth before bed/ to let her know its bed time at night. She can hardly wait. Our vet always compliments her teeth too! My only complaint is that I had signed up for one 36 treat bag per month 'subscribe and save' and it doesn't lock in the price when you subscribe! In December it was $19 and today its $33. What gives?",

I didn't do a before and after of her teeth to see if it's actually cleaning them but she enjoys them. I've seen them recommended by veterinarians so yeah if she's happy, we're happy.",
