I've not had any issues with it, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. UPDATE: After nearly two years of everyday use, I have to say that this wallet has held up well. The zipper still works, and the wallet still looks good overall, if a bit worn. I still think this is a very good purchase.",

The quality is great; made out of leather. My old one is still good; although a couple of the CC slots were getting a little worn out; the ones I use daily. Aside from the usualy VISA, AMEX cards, I also use it for restaurant/supermarket GCs and membership/store loyalty cards. I highly recommend this wallet if you have similar card usage like me. :)",

The zipper also doesn't quite open completely without finagling it so the wallet, especially the top of the wallet, doesn't completely open without finagling.

Put it in a side pocket; it's about half again the width of a generic triple-fold and can expand to perhaps twice the thickness; with a few items (including coins) in there, it's maybe half again the width. It will hold credit cards, other cards, and cash, and one or two of the pockets could be used to hold a small amount of coins. After a few days of use, it seems to hold together well.",

Feels thicker than my old wallet which has the exact same contents. Guess I'll really know after a car ride and how much of a impression it leaves on me. ;)",

I also cut off two-thirds of the zipper pull so it would more easily fit in and out of my pants pockets. And now I have a relatively thin and nicely functional zipper wallet.",
