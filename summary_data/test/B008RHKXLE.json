      "text": "I'm a big fan of modern wool for its ability to breath and wick moisture, even in hot weather, so I wear different weights of wool socks year round. I'm also a big fan of many Smart Wool products for these reasons and that their products don't itch, which is why I gave these socks a try. These socks are comfortable, well made, and don't itch. However, they do pill heavily, especially at the heel. This is a weave problem, not a problem with wool itself, since other similar wool socks I've tried from Darn Tough and Duluth Trading do not have this problem.",

No blisters in unlined leather boots is another great use. They also dry out very quickly even if they are soaked. Worth the investment as they are really durable also. One note, if you want them to fit tight, like for running or basketball you should order the size meant for a slightly smaller shoe size than you actually wear. Otherwise you can feel a very slight \u201cslip\u201d under your forefoot as the fibers fold over when you push off. This is why they give you such a cushioned feel despite the thin material.",
