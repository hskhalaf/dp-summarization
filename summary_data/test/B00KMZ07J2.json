I definitely feel like I made the right decision going for this phone! Beautiful 1440p screen and I've never noticed the phone go slow either.

      "text": "Beware this product is early made my LG and has some serious heating problem. Compare to high street it was cheaper on Amazon and bought it. Even after 1 hr of use this phone heats up like hell. On Normal usage it heats up and you can feel it on the screen as well. Battery life has been worse that I have ever seen on any phones. Too much heat and you battery drains faster.",

Only down side is the short battery life. Have tried disabling features etc, however this causes a less connected experience. Please lg - let us purchase a 4000mA plus battery and give us the 5.1.1 update for lollipop. This may help with the longevity of the product.",
