In the 'things connected' panel, it's hard to know which device is which without viewing each one. My wife accidentally splashed a tiny amount of water near the one in our guest bath the other day, my phone lit up with a string of texts. Exactly what I needed, something that will actually get my attention. I travel a lot but I can't shut everything down each time, so this is real peace of mind for me.",
