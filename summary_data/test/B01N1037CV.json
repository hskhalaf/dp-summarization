Previously, my favorite Mario Kart was Double Dash. This game is just as good as that one. I would say they are tied. It would be better than Double Dash if only they would have brought back tilt-a-kart, which was the best battle map ever created. Cant have everything though.",

Different kinds of vehicles. 4 different racing speeds. Single player, and online player. Cons: The only cons I can think of is that it doesn't have all the tracks from all the Mario Kart games, and it doesn't have the two person vehicles of Mario Kart: Double Dash.

I purchased it as a Christmas present for my daughter, but I've probably played it more than she has. Brings back a lot of memories when I used to play the original Mario Kart on Super Nintendo and N64--just much better graphics. If you're looking for a fun game to play by yourself, with friends, or with family, I highly recommend this game. The great thing is that you can play Mario Kart online against other people now.",

      "text": "This is a great game! its a ton of fun to play and made some nice improvements from the previous wii U version. you start off with all of the characters and difficulties unlocked but you have to earn the different cars, wheels and gliders by getting coins in each race. Each character has a unique place style with different weights, handling and traction, meaning that every character you play as, you need to change how you play it. The only issue with this game that I have is that too much is given to you in the beginning of the game and I wish I had to unlock the different characters like in previous games",

Played this game with a friend and I haven't had that much fun playing multiplayer in years. Also nice to know I kept my green shell sniping skills all these years.

Sometimes she even places high in the rankings. This is a HUGE plus so thank you Nintendo.

The hardware limitations are understandable, but I have a feeling that many players would have rather seen Nintendo explore a cut in resolution or graphics quality before cutting frames.",

My only complaint is that they didnt update the netcode from the Wii-U release, connecting to lobbies online can often take 1-3 tries to get a stable connection. Its 2017, I shouldnt get dropped from online lobbies nearly everytime i try to play online.",

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe marked the return of the actual battle mode and a few Switch exclusive content. I just can't imagine how good Mario Kart 9 will be after this masterpiece",

Theres lots of maps such as Rainbow Road,Excitebike Arena,Sunshine Airport,Super Bell Subway,etc. There are a whole ton of Karts and Motorbikes to race with. I'd recommend either the Jet Bike and Master Cycle. Overall this a great Mario Kart game! I'd highly recommend it.",
