Medium = 1 star for poor quality control - one of two handle was very bowed or warped (picture). Seems to be due to grain of the wood being very curved, but at some point the maker should just toss it and say this piece of wood doesn't make a good spoon. Large = 4 stars, measures as indicated, but seems like at this size the spoon bowl should be larger. It's basically the smaller spoon with a longer handle, not a proportionally blown up version of the smaller spoons.",

    "title": "Eddington\u2019s Italian Olive Wood Cooking Spoon Handcrafted in Europe, 13.75-Inches",
    "description": "Size:13.75-InchesEddington\u2019s Olive Wood Spoon makes cooking beautiful and easy. For all of your food preparation, cooking, baking and serving, this is a perfect kitchen utensil for whipping up everything from a snack to an evening meal and holiday feast. Lightweight, yet strong, and safe for everyone to use, even families with budding young chefs just learning to cook. Although it fits nicely in a kitchen gadget drawer, this attractive cooking tool displays beautifully on the counter, always at the ready. Favoured for its beautiful grain and dense durable character, Mediterranean olive wood has been used for centuries to craft fine tableware and utensils. Carefully sourced from selected groves mainly in the south of Italy, the wood is only harvested when olive production has ceased or branches have been cut as part of the pruning process. Over time, with oiling and use, olive wood will darken in colour and develop a rich patina, further enhancing the appearance and grain. It will not scratch surfaces and is safe for metal and nonstick cookware. Hand wash only.",
