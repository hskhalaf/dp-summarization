I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s broken considering the output does not work. I\u2019m very upset because if I order a new one it won\u2019t be here in time for my vacation.

Unit working as expected. No issues. Need longer use with multiple charge/discharge cycles to determine if the quality is long lasting. Really like configuration that permits using a lightning cable to charge the battery and then using the same cable to charge iphone or ipad thus requiring only a single cable for travel. Charges even faster with USB-C and high capacity charger (which we use at home). Case material is hard plastic and I believe it will crack if dropped.on a hard surface especially if the edge makes the first impact. Recommended",

The only negative thing is that this battery pack itself takes forever to recharge when you finally need to. To charge it fully takes 12 hours or so, I usually charge it overnight. Considering price I would definitely recommend it. I have an iPhone 6 that is constantly dying around 50% and I have already replaced the battery once about a year ago ($60) so this has been perfect instead of having to replace the battery again or buying a new phone.",

It comes with USB to micro USB to charge it. You use USB to Thunderbolt out or USB to micro USB out to charge your devices. Great price, nice design, versatile and lightweight with a lot of power. I recommend it.",
