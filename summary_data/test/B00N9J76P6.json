I am 5'5 (well 5'4 3/4) and around 130lbs 34DD and this suit, the size 5, fits like a glove. All the surf brand ones I've tried or had in the past are sooo crazy tight and uncomfortable up top. I can easily take this suit on and off myself and it seals nicely around my neck. It is great for swimming and doesn't make you feel awkward like some suits do.",

I'm 5'11\" and 160 pounds and size L is really good for me except a little tight in the crotch area, but I take that as a compliment. My wife is 5'4\" and 120 lbs and women's size 5 is perfect for her.",

I like how there are grip pads on the inside of the knees, this was a super important feature I was looking for when choosing a wet suit. I also like the rubber seals around the wrists and ankles, Jet skiing requires constant movement and it keeps the suit in place. Super easy to take on and off. Great price!",
