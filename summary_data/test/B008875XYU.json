We recently got a robovac (Eufy 12) that has a low profile but still needed about another quarter to half inch to get under our sofa and love seat. Enter the hockey pucks! The feet on our furniture have about a 3.5 inch diameter, and these 3 inch diameter by 1 inch tall pucks work well to raise things. We attached them to the bottom of the feet with some heavy duty double sided carpet tape. Our Eufy now loves going under the sofa and love seat!",
