Again within 9 months the wifi signal is very low and am getting slow internet speed. When I contacted the customer care, they told me I have to pay $99 for their technical service for an year. I can easily buy a new router. This is not customer service. 2 Products are getting into fault within an year, and we have to pay for customer service, seriously Netgear, didn't expect from an Big organization. Please do not buy netgear, There are many other options available.",

Doesn\u2019t matter if you spend a lot or a little. Very disappointed. I don\u2019t have the money to buy another one. I would recommend don\u2019t go with Netgear.

It got to the point by April that it was dropping a couple of times every single day and required rebooting it 2-3 times a day. My boyfriend and I have both been teleworking so this became unacceptable when signal drops in the middle of a meeting on several occasions. After replacing it with a new router about a month ago, we have had flawless connection since. Shame that these routers aren't built to be reliable longer than about a year.",

The speed on it is great, I've had no issues streaming videos or uploading photos. I'm a cable cutter so streaming sling and Netflix is no sweat.

Very disappointed about this since 5GHz is the only fast wifi channel I want to use at home. Also the signal range is very limited, weaker than a wifi extender: my router is on the 1st floor but signal is terrible on the 2nd floor and in basement (about 6-10 feet away up and down).",

Apparently, Spectrum, who recently purchased Oceanic Cable, does not charge for their modems. Also, since my landline was part of my internet package with Spectrum, I still need their Modem for the phone connection. Sigh. Even the tech at Spectrum acknowledged that this combo Modem/Router has greater range than the Spectrum Modem.",

      "text": "Amazing Modem! Yeah, it was a little expensive, but it's definitely worth it in the long run rather than renting a modem monthly from a cable provider! It's small and sleek, and it provides fast internet and WiFi. Never really had a problem with it and I've had it for almost two years so far. It's been compatible with X-Finity by Comcast as well as Time Warner cable. I especially like having our own modem because cable companies cannot adjust the speed of the internet to their liking. It seems like this is a tactic for you to buy a higher speed internet from them. Well this will not work for me. Highly recommend this modem!",

Replace with a Motorola SB6121 modem, and a TP-LINK TL-WDR4300 router, and had much better response time over 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, and ethernet. With the Netgear, I would sit and wait for a web server's address to resolve, which made it seem like a DNS issue, but I tried using Google and OpenDNS and both were equally slow. I could not stream content reliably without waiting for it to buffer often, even though my internet package goes upwards of 105Mbps down, 20Mbps up. I was not satisfied, and am glad I switched to another setup.",

      "title": "Great modem, not so good wireless router",
      "text": "I bought this product because I was tired of paying the monthly rental fee from Timewarner for a modem. As a modem, this devise works great. What I was not overly happy with was the wireless router piece. I had an Apple Airport Express prior and wanted something will alittle more range and this did not deliver. I tested this side by side with the apple express and the express had a greater distance and faster speeds. So needless to say I turned off the wireless and bought an Airport Extreme. In hind sight I should have gotten just a modem by itself and had the wireless separate, which I do now, just by disabling the wireless piece.",

Again, I miss access to 5G, but I knew what I was buying and feel I found a great deal for what I paid. I'd recommend the C3000 to anyone looking for a budget centric setup, and have only praise for Netgear's products.",

I am having to reset the Router about once every 24 hours. Have other items that require re-booting when this occurs. Range is very limited also. This is definitely not a good product. I have had other Netgear products with reasonable success. Save yourself a lot of grief. DO NOT buy!!!!",

My first failure occurred within a year of owning. I replaced it through RMA warranty from Netgear. It took about 10 days to replace. The first symptoms were the ethernet ports failing and spotty WiFi. My replacement has recently bit the dust, dying suddenly in the middle of streaming YouTube videos.
