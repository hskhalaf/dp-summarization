No trouble pairing with my hub, except for one case. Contacted tech support who got right back to me, but the problem mysteriously resolved itself. Still a little intimidated by the prospect of the 3-way installation, so maybe I'll update once I've done one of those. Had trouble getting them to fit into a 3-gang box, but fixed it by cutting the tabs off the heatsink with a pair of tin snips. I figure if they're all touching each other, they form one big heatsink and it's probably fine.",

These work great with Home Assistant, an AEON Labs ZW090 Z-Stick, and a Raspberry Pie 3b. They all show up in Apple's Homekit through Home Assistant. I did run into a problem where one of my led lights did not like the dimmer, so I had to swap things around. Unless the LED lights say they are dimmable, purchase the switch instead of the dimmer.",

Note though that although you dont need an add-on switch like other brands, you do still have to rewire that box. But, Zooz provided great instructions to help. Update: The three-way function is hit-and-miss. Sometimes flipping the normal switch will properly trigger the on/off, sometimes it doesn't and I have to flip it again or walk over to the actual Zooz switch. I'll probably be replacing this with the actual GE three-way/add-on setup, as those have never failed to act properly.",

      "text": "This product was recognized by Smartthings V2 hub and works as advertised with existing \"dumb\" switches in a 3-way and 4-way setup. It does require a neutral wire for connection. THIS PRODUCT HAS ISSUES WITH GFCI CIRCUITS! I origionally wanted to use it to control an outdoor outlet which requires a GFCI circuit. The switch would trip the GFCI before you can even get it to pair. I ended up moving it to another location which doesn't require GFCI and it works fine.",
