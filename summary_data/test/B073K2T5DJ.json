The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the carrots stained the inside Of the housing even though I washed it immediately. Takes up a lot less room than the food processor and is easier to clean. Some reviews complained about the quality and that some parts were plastic. Though there is plastic, it is sturdy and I think it will function well. New plastics can be as durable as metal. I found nothing cheap or flimsy about it.",

It's also one of those gifts that just keep on giving because they last so long and can be used with so many different varieties of good. The giftee was very pleased with the set, and I got to witness first hand the magic of the expanded uses of the KitchenAid.",

Hopefully I am more pleased with the shredder and grinder when I finally get around to using them :(",

At first, I was apprehensive about attachments for my KitchenAid and WOW was I wrong. These attachments is well made (like the Ferrari of kitchen stuff) and sturdy. The grater has one large feed and a second that fits in the middle for smaller food and more control. Due to this purchase I am looking into more attachments.",

I was already familiar with the meat grinder attachment, so I know this works really good at grinding meat. The sausage stuffer works, but if you are doing a whole lot of sausage, I would suggest a manual stuffer because it will be much faster. The vegetable slicer is ok, but not the best for softer vegetables. I ran a bunch of tomatoes through the course die on the meat grinder, and had instant tomato sauce! Worked perfectly. I also shredded 26 cups of zucchini to freeze, and it worked flawlessly for that. Overall, I am impressed, and can't wait to make some small scale specialty sausages soon!",
