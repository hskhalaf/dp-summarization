I\u2019ve had Optoma and Benq projectors before and was a little hesitant buying this Viewsonic for first time, but a 4K projector for a grand had to be seriously considered. It\u2019s streets ahead of what I expected. The performance through my SkyQ box in UHD is simply stunning. It\u2019s quieter than units I\u2019ve used before and the colours are really beautiful. I also use via my Sony 4K player and again the movies are just stunning, I genuinely see the improvement over HD, which was something I was concerned about with a 4K projector. For the money, this is just an absolute bargain.",

My projector is very quiet I barely notice it and it supports all the 4k content I have thrown at it. I am currently using nvidia shield tv to run YouTube and Netflix and Amazon prime and it runs them all fabulously in 4k. The picture quality is stunning and I just purchased a 4k blu-ray player and that looks amazing. This is a great projector at a good price and I have absolutely no regrets with my purchase.",

This Projector has a USB-C port. I can plugin my MacBook Pro (2017) and get a 4k image of my desktop with one cable (no dongle), and it charges the MacBook Pro too! Great picture, great sound, long life LED light source (in theory), portability and USB-C. Great at this price. Viewsonic customer service has been great.",

      "text": "I recently purchased the ViewSonic X10-4K Projector to watch TV and movies on a larger scale. I love the modern design, it is definitely one of most aesthetically attractive home projectors available. It only takes me a matter of minutes to setup and thanks to the short throw and lightweight design I can easily use it around the house. Despite its compact size, I was extremely impressed with image quality; the 4K Ultra HD provides crisp detail, high brightness and vivid colours. Sound quality is also excellent with the premium Harman Kardon speakers. I also like how this projector connects to Wi-Fi so I can easily stream from my phone or use the inbuilt apps to watch my favourite shows.",

I get the impression that the design is solid on this one. It also has a good throw proportion at a short distance for me too; I get 112\" @ 12ft.",

I didn't rate the 4k image either, it's not native as you'd expect at this price point but the pixel shift feature didn't seem to add any clarity. I would rather spend the same money on a high end HD, decided to return the unit.",

Eats a lot of energy, but in winter it also keeps the room warmer :) Generally though I'm happy with it.",

Although, the price point of this projector makes up the difference there. Does crank out some heat, but when ceiling mounted it's not so bad. Overall, I can't imagine not having a projector now, and this one is pretty sweet for the money.",

My last complaint is my biggest. Only 1 of the hdmi ports is 4k. It's a 4k projector. Why have an input that can't handle 4k? You'll need a 4k hdmi switch if you have more than 1 4k device.",
