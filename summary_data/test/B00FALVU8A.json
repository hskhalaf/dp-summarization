Pretty much all polishes and waxes have similar results when you look at a picture someone posts immediately after doing the work, don't go by that. This stuff doesn't last very long and doesn't do a good job of repelling any rain. Maybe it does a good job of protecting against sun but this is looking like it's just lotion for your paint. In my experience, a good wax will keep your car looking fresh long after it's used. This doesn't.",

When I first put it on, the water beaded but almost 6 weeks later, not so much. My car does sit out in the sun and I am hoping that the protection is still there. This product does smell good and is easy to apply. I used an orbital buffer which made the work even easier. I applied mine to plastic trims and windows and removal was simple.",

Being a carnuba-based wax, it's not going to last as long as a synthetic wax. You can either have a long-lasting wax that looks ok, or a short-lasting wax that looks great. This is the wax that looks great. I keep my car garaged when I'm not using it and get 2-3 months out of each application but if the car is left outside I'd guess you would need to reapply once a month.",
