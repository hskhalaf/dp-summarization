When soaking is finished, it is a breeze to drain and rinse the beans by just pulling up the inner pot. I have used it many times and it still washes up and shines like new.

Quality is immediately apparent through the pieces. Works great for steaming shrimp, lobster, clams, etc. Perhaps the only downside is that the main pot is too large to fit in our refrigerator, but contents can always be moved to smaller containers. A small price to pay for gorgeous pot ware. Well worth the price and recommended.",

In any case, it's a bit of an overkill for my purposes, but I'm sure it will come in handy one day when I decide to steam a lobster!",

    "description": "This family-size 12 Quart Pasta/Steamer Set makes cooking and draining pasta easy. With handy measurement markings and an induction-ready base, dinner has never been easier. Includes a Flavor-Lock lid for healthier, steam cooking.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSimmer that crowd-size batch of three-alarm chili or boil up enough spaghetti to feed the whole block in this 12-quart Cuisinart Chef's Classic stockpot. Made of professional quality 18/10 stainless steel that won't react with acidic foods, the pot features solid cast stainless-steel handles, a tight-fitting lid, drip-free rim, and a mirror finish that retains its brightness through dishwasher, freezer, broiler, and oven use up to 550 degrees Fahrenheit. For even, conductive heating, an aluminum disk is encapsulated between two layers of stainless steel in the base. The stockpot measures 9 inches high and 11 inches in diameter; 14-1/2 inches including handles. \n\n What makes this four-piece set special is its versatility. Included is a deep pasta insert, so you can lift out and drain your cooked pasta all in one fell swoop, without needing a colander; and a steamer basket that sits in the top portion of the pot and allows you to steam broccoli, shrimp, pot stickers, and all kinds of healthy, fat-free foods. The pasta insert and pot have the same riveted stainless-steel handles, while the basket features a swinging handle that tucks out of the way when the lid is on top. Every piece is dishwasher-safe. Cuisinart covers the pot set with a limited lifetime warranty. --Ann Bieri",
