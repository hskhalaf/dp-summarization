Setup was a bit slow, but I was very careful handling the ink etc and making sure I knew what I was doing. My intial results are pleasing. I am very pleased with the photo printing. I printed only one text document, but it seems good enough for my needs under the standard setting. Printing for me is reasonably quiet. Obviously, I don't know if it is an ink hog. Prices for inks are inflated for most manufacturers, which is a drag. I would be nice if ink prices were more reasonable. So far, a good choice.",

One downside is that the regular paper tray is REALLY small! Constantly have to load paper in it. Not meant for major print jobs.",

My only complaint is that it does take a while to \"warm-up\" when first turned on. But, this is only a minor inconvenience. I highly recommend this printer to anyone. Good Job Canon!!",

It prints documents well. The PROBLEM is the paper source. It constantly says the cassette is out of paper when it is not. It sometimes pulls photopaper out of the rear tray when there is plenty of paper in the cassette, wasting photopaper. I am about ready to return it. When it prints, it is fine. But checking the printer every few minutes becomes frustrating. I have been pleased with the ink usage as opposed to other reviewers.",

I deselected the automatic determination, but the bottom line is that if you are feeding any sort of 8-1/2 X 11 paper, apparently it's impossible to print from that tray. The only option is \"plain paper\" which tells it to print from the cassette. Even when telling it to print from the rear tray. I hate this thing. And now my order will be DAYS LATE.",

The problem is this printer uses pigmented ink which is very expensive, instead of dye based ink. The printouts using pigmented ink are supposed last longer but we were replacing a home printer and were not in need of the better/more expensive ink. All my fault, the printer itself is fine.",
