Spray close to food and it\u2019s a smaller area that will be covered. My husband likes it to spray on food prior to grilling. I use it for my air fryer and just in general in the kitchen, from saute\u0301ing to roasting fresh veggies. And it\u2019s a great way to know how much oil you are adding to a salad.",
