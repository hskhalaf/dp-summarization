Like the original, you can use all your EOS lenses with an adapter, as well as the small number of lenses designed especially for this format. I have a Canon G7x that performs very well, but the larger sensor of the EOS M3 have displaced it for many purposes. I think this camera is better than many of the reviewers have said. If you're a Canon user, and are looking for something in between a full frame model and a carry-everywhere, pocket-sized camera, you should definitely consider the M3.",

However, a couple of weeks after this purchase Canon announced a new model, the M5. While I could have returned this kit, I decided to keep it as I wanted the lenses and the difference in price, two lenses plus camera vs. two lenses only was $180, i.e., I got the M3 body for just $180. I have pre-ordered the M5 as it is substantially improved. However, having the M3 body will come in handy, it is smaller and lighter than the M5 and should serve me well for different occasions.",

I can't wait for the aftermarket batteries, thats the downside to new camera have to wait for a bit, because canon wants $70 for new one that would be a spare. I waited until canon improved there mirrorless cameras, and its about there of course you will read reviews that other brands have X or Y feature etc... but this one works great compared previous models.",

But it has a problem in most other uses, it has to focus the lens for you!! and most M3 lenes are AUTO focus.. so you can not take pictures in the dark or of the astronomy stars in the sky. for astronomy you have to use \"M\" manual setting and turn off all auto stuff. sensitivity is good.",

A pleasure to operate, with the sophistication to create stunning still and moving images, the EOS M3 is an ideal EOS for many applications, such as portraiture, landscape, travel and everything in between. With its large 24.2 Megapixel APS-C sized CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the EOS M3 captures high-resolution images and Full HD movies suitable for most any application. Its lightweight, mirrorless body and interchangeable lenses add a whole new level of portability to the EOS system without compromising performance. In addition to a number of dedicated EF-M Lenses, the EOS M3 is compatible with a range of EF* and EF-S* Lenses and Speedlites, has an optional shoe-mounted electronic viewfinder, wireless capabilities, plus numerous features designed for fun and fast image capture. The EOS M defies the assumption that compact means compromise, with performance and features photographers and moviemakers can rely on to help bring their creative ideas to life. \n\n* Mount Adapter EF-EOS M is required.\n\nSLEEK, WITH THE POWER TO PERFORM\nWonderfully lightweight and compact, the EOS M3 is both stylish and speedy while including a host of proven EOS controls. It can be appealing to anyone who appreciates a portable, mirrorless body but wants interchangeable lenses, a large sensor and the manual controls and image quality associated with the EOS line. Similarly, for photographers used to carrying larger SLR cameras who want something smaller as a companion or as a solo camera, the EOS M3 operates and performs similarly to SLRs in the EOS system. In addition to EF-M series Lenses, it's also compatible with a number of EOS accessories including EF Lenses*, Speedlites and more for powerful, seamless EOS operation that's incredibly portable.\n\n* Mount Adapter EF-EOS M is required.\n\nTHE POWER TO CAPTURE STUNNING MOVIES AND PHOTOGRAPHS\n24.2 MEGAPIXEL SENSOR\nThe EOS M3 features a 24.2 Megapixel (APS-C) sensor capable of capturing large image and movie files. At 24.2 Megapixels, the EOS M's sensor delivers images suitable for enlargements with sufficient resolution for significant trimming. Whether making poster-sized prints, zooming in on a particular detail or making Full HD movies, the EOS M3's sensor is primed to deliver. An ISO range of 100\u201312800 (expandable to 25600) means images can be captured with low noise and high detail, even in dimly lit situations.\n\nDIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nComplementing the EOS M3's CMOS sensor, Canon's DIGIC 6 Image Processor not only speeds up camera operations, but also helps enhance a number of the camera's advanced features. The DIGIC processor aids the camera's sensor in capturing detailed images with reduced noise at high ISOs and enables high-quality movie capture with a number of different movie compressions including MP4. On top of that, it enhances the camera's Dynamic Image Stabilization system and even helps improve the AF system's face detection accuracy.\n\nCONSISTENT, SPOT-ON AF\nA fusion of AF technologies designed to quickly achieve and maintain AF, the EOS M3's Hybrid CMOS AF III system is impressively fast, delivering comprehensive and accurate AF coverage over approximately 80% (vertical) and 70% (horizontal) of the entire image. With an optimized phase difference AF sensor built into the EOS M3's CMOS sensor's individual pixels, along with a secondary contrast detection system, the EOS M3's focus system is equipped to focus quickly and accurately in many situations.\n\nFAST, INTUITIVE CONTROLS\nCapable of creating superb stills and movies automatically, the EOS M3 offers a number of control options for speedy manual operation. The camera features a Front Dial that's placed directly around the shutter button and is complemented by a dedicated Exposure Compensation Dial positioned within easy reach of the camera's thumb grip. In addition, the EOS M3 has numerous custom functions, including user-programmable shortcuts, customizable buttons and much, much more. It's comfortable to hold, with a fluid and ergonomic design that's familiar to EOS users.\n\nMORE OPERATIONS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n3.0\u201d TILT-TYPE LCD MONITOR\nThe EOS M3 has a large, high-resolution, 3.0\u201d LCD monitor that tilts up 180\u00b0 and down 45\u00b0, ideal for composing not only self portraits, but also for taking pictures at high and low angles with ease.\n\nINTUITIVE TOUCH SCREEN FOR SELFIES AND EASY MENU NAVIGATION\nThe EOS M3's touch screen is not just for defining AF points and for selfies! Designed to be accessible without hindering access to the lens and shutter button, the EOS M3's touch screen is fast and easy to use for many operations. With a Quick Control screen like those found on other EOS cameras and a number of functions superimposed over the image in a \u201cU\u201d pattern, settings are easily accessible without taking a finger away from the shutter or altering your grip on the camera. It's easy to change the camera's settings while maintaining the ability to quickly take a picture.\n\nEOS COMPATIBILITY FOR CREATIVE CONTROL\nWhile a number of lenses and accessories are designed specifically for the EOS M series, the EOS M3 is also fully compatible with over 70 of Canon's EF* and EF-S* Lenses plus other EOS accessories like Speedlites, Speedlite Transmitters and even Macro Ring Lites. Whether the EOS M3 is a primary or secondary camera, it boasts smooth compatibility with a wide range of EOS accessories.\n\n* Mount Adapter EF-EOS M is required.\n\nEXTERNAL ACCESSORIES FOR ADVANCED OPERATION\nELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER (EVF-DC1)\nIn addition to its compatibility with EOS accessories and Speedlites, the EOS M3 is compatible with Canon's high-resolution Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC1. Easily attached to the camera's hot shoe, the 2.36 Megapixel EVF-DC1 can tilt up 90\u00b0, and for photographers who wish to hold the camera up to their eye, it helps the EOS M3 deliver operation and feel similar to that of an SLR. Especially helpful in bright sunlight, or in situations where composing on the screen is not convenient, the EVF-DC1 can be an indispensible accessory for the EOS M3.\n\nEXTERNAL MICROPHONE JACK\nFor expanded operations including Full HD movie recording, the EOS M3 features not only a built-in stereo microphone but also an external microphone jack that adds a level of versatility and convenience for moviemaking.\n\nSUPERB MOVIEMAKING MADE EASY\nFULL HD VIDEOS AT 24P AND 30P IN MP4 FORMAT\nThe EOS M3 can capture 1920x1080 Full HD video at frame rates of both 24p and 30p, and can record in MP4 format for easy sharing online.\n\nMOVIEMAKING MADE EASY WITH MANUAL MOVIE CONTROL\nThe EOS M3 is a fine moviemaking tool. With touch-activated AF and a number of manual controls available, it's easy to make intuitive setting adjustments silently and on the fly using the EOS M3's dial, controller wheel and touch operations. The EOS M3's external microphone jack adds further versatility to capturing video.\n\nVERSATILE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION\nBUILT-IN WI-FI\nThe EOS M3 is designed to make Wi-Fi connections* fast and easy. It can exchange data with other Wi-Fi compatible Canon cameras, connect directly to Canon's Connect Station CS100 device, upload directly to various web services like CANON iMAGE GATEWAY**, Facebook and YouTube, and even play back images and movies on DLNA-compatible digital electronics.\n\nBUILT-IN NFC CAPABILITY\nWith its built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) capability***, the EOS M connects directly to NFC-compliant Android devices by simply touching the NFC icon located on the camera to the device.\n\nREMOTE SHOOTING & WIRELESS PRINTING\nWith the Canon Camera Connect app installed, the EOS M3 connects and can be controlled by your compatible smartphone or tablet for simple remote shooting. Plus, it can also connect and print directly to IP-compatible printers.\n\n* Compatible with iOS versions 7.1/8.4, Android smartphone versions 2.3.3/4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4/5.0/5.1 and Android tablet versions 4.0/4.1/4.2/4.3/4.4/5.0/5.1.
