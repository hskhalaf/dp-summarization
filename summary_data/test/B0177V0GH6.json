Now I see it all on my wrist when it vibrates. It's helped me stay on top of my meds and deliver news/weather in meetings when it matters. It's also motivated me to get up and walk more with my dog.",

So that's one more thing to remember to pack when traveling because the battery only lasts 3 days max. (The vivofit 2 - the non-chargeable battery lasts for months)",

      "text": "I've been using mine for over a year now and haven't had any major issues. I like the step counter even though I rarely hit my mark. The exercises are great, I enjoy using them whenever I can. I especially enjoy the sleep mode - lets others know if I'm going to be in a cranky mood. Oh wait, that's normal. I mostly like to walk during my lunch break and this little gem is a great motivator. For a great medium replacement band very close to the original go here:- They also have a nice Pink and Blue with the black claps. All in all, great purchase. I love my Garmin Vivosmart. My friends are so jealous.",
