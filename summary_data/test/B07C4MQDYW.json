      "text": "When I bought this was skeptical whether it will perfectly capture weight as the mode of holding the weight is constantly moving . But surprisingly it gives weight almost with close accuracy . Though it is perfect tool for weighing up to 50 lbs, beyond that I guess it is difficult to hold it in hand as the length of the instrument is shorter and would not give enough room (length) to hold it steadily . If the product is more lengthier then it would have addressed that issue . I guess it\u2019s trade off for its compactness. This is not for some one who needs 100 percent accuracy ( decimal level accuracy )",

I wasn't strong enough and had to hold the suitcase away from my body which is a totally unsafe way of lifting heavy objects. Today I have neck and back pain. Also to change from kg to pounds you must depress the button rapidly or it cycles back to kg. Other than that it seemed to be accurate. If you're strong this may work for you, but I am disappointed.",

The backlit LCD display is a nice improvement and the ergonomics are pretty decent too. The strap and buckle design is good, quicker to do/undo. Unit is light and compact as we hoped. Description did not mention a \"hold\" feature, quite pleased that it does do that. Was a little annoyed that one of the endcaps came right off, will have to glue that on. For the price, its a nice scale.",
