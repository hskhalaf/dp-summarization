Ordered it and it arrived in 2 days - got it all set up fairly quickly and what a difference! This 6 core beast runs my Blue Iris camera system at about 8-9% utilization. Love it.

The topside fan gets a bit loud once it has been on awhile, but honestly it didn't become an issue until it had remained on for some time. Some basic power settings can serve to alleviate that concern. I would recommend this PC to others.",
