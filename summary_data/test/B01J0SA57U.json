I give it five stars because it's very easy to assemble, roomy, colorful, a great price, and seems to be of good quality. I like that the top is mesh so that air can move through more freely and light can come in. Something I didn't notice when I ordered it is that tent pegs also come with it in case anyone wants to set it up outside to keep it from blowing away. I would buy this again.",

Definitely well made and durable. Only wish there was a way to attack the collapsible tunnels to the round openings. The size is right but there isn't a way yo hold them to the tent.",

Awesome for creative play and to change up the mood.",

It is a pretty big tent, and I like the netting on top so when it's in doors I place it under the fan. You can also place a small fan in one of the opening so air is flowing when the little one goes to sleep. I have not used it outside but with the trap like material I think it will do great outside. FYI it can hold adults as well :)",
