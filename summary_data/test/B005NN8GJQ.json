The wrist strap is especially useful, since I frequently take off the gloves during a typical snowboarding day. Since I frequently take off the gloves, having the liners underneath is a necessity. My phone's touch screen isn't super responsive to these gloves, but I don't mind much. There are two a cinches to keep the snow out of your mittens and the mittens on your hands...has a small pocket for hand warmers. Very warm and waterproof, would recommend!",

    "description": "The life of a mitt is not easy. More than any other part of your riding kit, mitts have the most contact with the elements. With that in mind, the Burton team chooses the women's bestselling Burton GORE-TEX Mitt + Gore warm technology. DRYRIDE 2L fabric, and a GUARANTEED TO KEEP YOU DRY GORE-TEX membrane protect this Thermacore insulated mitt from the worst weather conditions. The Screen Grab synthetic leather palm gives you full coverage touchscreen control using tech that will never fray, wear out, or wash off. A removable four-way stretch fleece liner dries quickly and gives you options for any weather. Wear just the liner when shoveling, just the shell in sloppy spring conditions, or combine the two for total midwinter warmth and comfort.",
