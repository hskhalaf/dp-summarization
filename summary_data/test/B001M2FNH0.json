We got 2 triceratops and 2 pentaceratops. We are building bodies for them with more magic and of course all kids want a T. rex over 2 pentaceratops. Would probably purchase elsewhere for this reason.",

I'm very pleased with these, we put them in a plastic shoebox full of play sand for my preschooler's dinosaur theme week at home. We use a paintbrush to dust off the sand like real archaeologists. Pinterest has a ton of cute stuff I did for her lesson plan and I picked up several books at the library. She is enthralled. Came back to Amazon to purchase some fish figurines for the Ocean themed week. Recommend these \"bones\" 100%!",

It's not enough of a problem to return them so we'll probably do some kind of project with the ones that don't stand up.

At the end of the week, I buried a skeleton in plaster of paris for each child to dig out.

He understands \"extinction\", can describe what paleontologists do with precision and great detail with relevant vocabulary plus is non-stop with questions - - all of which is distressing to his grandparents who keep asking him about being an engineer (like Grandpa) or a lawyer (like his dad). I get blamed. As to this bag of skeletons, they are durable and can take punishment when small hands play with them. Unfortunately, but understandably, they do not differ proportionally in sizes. After observations in museums, he is already aware of size differentials.",

They are very cute & close enough to accurate that we were able to find & identify them correctly in the Dino Book. Great Buy for any Dinosaur fan :) I do recommend them! Enjoy!!!",
