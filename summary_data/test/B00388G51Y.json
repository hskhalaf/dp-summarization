This American Elite tire is a replacement for the American Elite tire that I mounted on my Bike two years (and 15,000-miles) ago.I After riding 15,000-miles of 'Cross-Country' miles on the American Elite tire that is currently on my Harley Street Glide, my tire still has adequate tread remaining on it for 'Around-Town' and short rides. I bought this tire so that I can have 'Fresh-Rubber' on my Harley before I ride (6,000-miles) to Idaho next month.",
