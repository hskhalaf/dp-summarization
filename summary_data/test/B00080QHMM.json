It will stay in place after one use. Voila! Experience the heavenly seal.",

If you are a professional, or own a tire shop, you'd probably want to upscale, but this one will do fine for weekly checks, and now I'll be certain to check more often, cause I like to use it.

Be sure to hold it straight and this will give you a very fast, easy to read readout and it will be the same each time. Add a little air, and the readout increases a little.
