Application includes 11.5 men's 6\" boot and I am using them when I build trails, standing in brush and moving dirt with a rake or shovel, often times pulling the dirt over my boots. They do increase the temperature of the foot HOWEVER, no more cleaning out my boots, dirty toes and ruined socks. I find the drawstring applied with a knot is perfect over the other types that include a buckle or strap, no notice to the strings under my foot and they do not come undone. Getting a second pair!",

These gators fit around my lower leg nicely, are not too tight, and also stay around my boots during the 4-5 miles I walk trimming and cutting my lawn. They seem to be well constructed and considering what I paid for them, are a real bargain. I highly recommend them!",
