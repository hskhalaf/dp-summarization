      "text": "This light light is awesome for cost, However a few drawbacks are the mounting screws and hardware. This only comes with one length of bolt, but two different screw heads. ( Flathead &philips ) As you adjust the bolts to mount the light fixture the hardware bracket bends making it very very difficult to line the bolts up with the holes. Another drawback it the small bolts that hold both the top of the light on and the light to the wall. The nuts come lose from the bolt as it's two piece construction..this makes it easy to lose while install/ changing bulbs. I'd recommend glueing the nuts to the bolts heads.",

The crews that go into the mounting bracket and stick through the unit base were way too long, and as they're covered by small/shallow nut cups - they couldn't cover the depth of the screw sticking out. Backing the screw out on the inside left it rather wobbly, so I picked up some shorter screws that stuck out to a depth that the nut-cups could handle. Also, I ordered 3, but of course one arrived with 2 broken panels - thankfully Amazons return/replace policy worked just fine for that.",
