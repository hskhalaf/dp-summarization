      "text": "I love this thing! I have two dogs who have no idea they are supposed to be \"backseat dogs\" and they try to crawl all over me while I am driving. This net keeps them in the back area of my SUV and also hold all of their walking goodies for when we go to the park. I am unable to use the doggy seat belt with them because they choke themselves trying to get in the front. This gives them ample space to move around without being a hazard to me while driving. PLUS all of their stuff is kept neatly in one place instead of being thrown all over the car. SCORE!!",
