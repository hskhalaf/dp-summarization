We ran it continuously for 80 hours without a problem. When topped off with gas, we could get about 11 hours of power, more than enough time to get a cool nights sleep in oppressive heat and exhaustion.",

Another great feature - you can daisy chain multiple units together if you need a larger power supply. I definitely recommend getting the wheel kit for it as its a bit too heavy to move around easily without it.",
