      "text": "Great Camera! Compact, Sturdy, FUN. Accessories are easy to find. Use is pretty intuitive, right out of the box. Uploading pictures to the PC is quick and EASY. Resolution is outstanding! There are so many \"fun\" features: including (but NOT limited to) black and white, snapshot video, ability to hook it to the TV to see it on a big screen... The quick snapshot is VERY handy when capturing \"fast-action\" shots (like our toddlers)! Highly Recommend! (I LOVE IT!!!)",

You'd think Sony products would have some compatibility here. I do recommend you get a larger memory stick.",

I install fully-charged batteries and within 24 hours, with the camera turned off and not in use, the batteries are dead. I've tried several different sets of batteries with the same result. Can't figure out the problem and I don't want to send it back so Sony as I'm certain it would cost more to repair than a new one. In fact, I think I'll buy a new or used one.",

The camera's lens wouldn't come out and I got it replaced with another one from Amazon. Amazon did a great job by sending the replacement in two days time. The resolution is awesome and loaded great many features. Particularly, I liked the \"live histogram display\". The thing I did not like about this camera is the \"Plastic Casing\". As of 12/29/05. Then I lost the flash bulb too. Sony is asking $171 for the repair.. What a waste!!",

I have to say, it works better than some CANON models! I took a photo of a same stationary subject with both cameras. I found out that the SONY's output was better than the CANON's. So I went for Sony. The camera has various features to enjoy including Video recording and OPTICAL/DIGITAL Zoom. Well done SONY! :)",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSCP93A 5MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "This Sony Cybershot digital camera features 5.1 megapixel effective super HAD CCD; 3x optical and 6x digital zoom; 32MB memory stick recording media; 1.5\" 123K pixel color LCD screen; MPEG VX fine with audio movie mode; 10-second self-timer and much more. Includes battery charger; A/V and USB cables; wrist strap; software CD-ROM. Made in USA. 1-1/2Wx4-1/2Lx2-1/4D\".\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWith its small size and quick reaction time, the Sony DSCP93 digital camera will be your constant photographic companion. You'll pick up amazing detail with its 5.1-megapixel CCD--and produce poster-sized prints. The affordable, 5-megapixel DSCP93 offers point-and-shoot simplicity with a variety of features normally found in higher-end models. It features a 3x optical zoom, 9-shot burst mode, high-resolution 1.5-inch LCD screen for reviewing shots, A/V connection to view images on your TV, and a high-resolution movie mode that's limited only by your Memory Stick's capacity. For a step up in price, check out the Sony DSCP100 brings a high-quality Carl Zeiss lens, compatibility with Sony's Cybershot Station, and even more compact size to the table. \n\n Optics and Resolution\nThe 1/1.8-inch Super HAD (Hole Accumulation Diode) CCD allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise, and provides a 5.1-megapixel effective resolution (2592 x 1944). The Real Imaging Processor offers greater clarity and picture quality as well as improved response time and battery life and decreased shutter lag. The DSCP93 has a 3x optical zoom lens that's combined with a smooth 2x digital zoom for a 6x total. \n\n Movie Mode\nCapture video with audio at 30 frames per second (fps) at VGA size 640 x 480; the included 32 MB memory card will store 87 seconds of vide at this setting. Movie length is only limited by the amount of storage you have on hand. The Video Mail mode captures a smaller movie (160 x 112 pixels) that's more suitable to sending to friends and family via e-mail. \n\n More Features\nIn addition to optics, the DSCP93 offers the following additional features to the DSCP73: \n\n * The 1.5-inch LCD monitor has a 123K-pixel resolution--double that of the DSCP73--enabling you to review fine details in your captured images. \n * 9 Shot Burst Mode: Capture up to 9 shots (fine) or 15 shots (standard) at 1.2 frames/sec. even at 5 MP resolution. Perfect for high speed subjects or fast moving action such as sports. (The DSCP73 has only a 4-shot burst mode.) \n\n Other features include: \n\n * Resolution modes: 2592 x 1944 (5.1MP), 2592 x 1728 (3:2 aspect ratio), 2048 x 1536 (3MP), 1280 x 960 (1MP), and 640 x 480 (VGA) \n * Live Histogram Display: Available in capture and playback the Live Histogram displays the concentration of pixels at each luminosity value making it easy to evaluate correct exposure. \n * Real Imaging Processor: The innovative Real Imaging Processor in the DSC-P93 not only improves picture quality and clarity but also improves camera response time, decreases shutter lag and improves battery stamina. \n * Selectable Focus Mode: Monitoring AF (Auto Focus) helps you anticipate the action by focusing even before you press the shutter release. \n * Conversion Lens Compatible: Increase your shooting options by adding either telephoto lenses to increase your optical zoom, or wide-angle lenses to increase the width of your field of view. You can even add filters for special effects. \n * 5 Area Multi-Point Auto Focus: By evaluating 5 separate focus areas of the frame, Sony\u00d5s Multi-Point AF system can intelligently focus on the subject and avoid mistakenly focusing on the background. \n * AF (Auto Focus) Illuminator: Briefly illuminating the subject, in low--or no--light conditions, the AF Illuminator helps establish a positive focus lock. \n * Multi-Pattern Measuring: Independently light-metering 49 points of the frame, Multi-Pattern Measuring establishes the optimum exposure, even when highlight and shadow isn\u00d5t centered in the frame. \n * Multi-Burst Mode: Captures 16 320 x 240 frames as part of a single 1280 x 960 image which plays back sequentially in the camera (selectable 1/7.5, 1/15, 1/30 second). \n * Manual Exposure Mode: Manual Exposure Mode provides extended control with 46-step adjustable Shutter speed (30 \u00d0 1/1000 sec.), and 2-step Aperture control. \n * Scene Selection Mode: With 6 Scene Modes, parameters can be matched to the shooting conditions. Choose from one of the following: Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Soft Snap, Candle, or Beach. \n * Slow Shutter Noise Reduction: During long exposures, Slow Shutter NR captures the scene, and then the CCD noise pattern with a dark frame exposure. By subtracting the two, even long exposures can be clear. \n * Pre-Flash Metering: With a momentary pre-flash, the camera illuminates the subject and sets exposure through the lens for accurate flash metering. Adjustable flash level and red-eye reduction ensure great flash shots. \n * 9 Shot Burst Mode: Capture up to 9 shots (fine) or 15 shots (standard) at 1.2 frames/sec. even at 5 MP resolution. Perfect for high speed subjects or fast moving action such as sports. (The DSCP73 has only a 4-shot burst mode.) \n\n Direct Printing\nThe Cybershot DSCP93 offers PictBridge functionality, which enables you to transfer pictures from your digital camera to a compatible printer--such as the Sony PictureStation DPP-EX50--without a PC or image-editing software. Images can be viewed and selected for printing right on the camera's LCD, with menus for print quantity, date, and index print. \n\n Storage and Transfer\nImages are stored on Memory Sticks, and the Cybershot DSCP93 is compatible with Memory Stick Pro media--for storage up to 1 gigabyte. The included 32 MB Memory Stick will store 12 Fine and 23 Standard 5.1-megapixel images. The DSCP93 transfers images to PCs and Macs via a speedy USB 2.0 connection (which is backward compatible with USB 1.1 ports). \n\n Power and Size\nThe camera is powered by two rechargeable NiMH AA-sized batteries (2100 mAh). The included adapter/charger provides power while you transfer images from the camera to your PC. It measures 4.63 x 2.13 x 1.38 inches (W x H x D) and weighs 7 ounces without Memory Stick or batteries. \n\n What's in the Box\nThis package contains the Sony DSCP93 digital camera, 32 MB Memory Stick, two AA-size NiMH rechargeable batteries (NH-AA-DA), battery charger (BC-CS2), A/V and USB cables, wrist strap, and CD-ROM with photo editing software. \n\n Sony Photo Vault\nThe optional Sony Photo Vault mini CD burner eliminates worry about running out of space on your Memory Stick when travelling. It burns images to mini CD-R's without a PC interface--just connect your camera using a USB cable. The Photo Vault also has a Memory Stick slot (compatible with Memory Stick Pro and Duo) and features a built-in photo album capability to display photos on a television screen using a television's standard AV input.",
