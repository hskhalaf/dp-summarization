I was disappointed that I had to take the watch to a repair shop and pay the money to get the watch working. I called the vendor and they told me that they would reimburse me up to 10$ for the battery. Unfortunately it is the inconvenience not the $ that dissapointed me",

It is quite heavy initially however with a few wears, you don't notice the weight. Easy to read, easy to operate and easy to wear, it goes with everything. A1 service via Amazon. I have nothing to complain about.",
