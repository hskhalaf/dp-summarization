      "text": "I bought this couch for my husband to put in his garage/man cave. It is a faux leather, so easy clean up. He loved the cup holders, so his friends can have a drink when visiting. He also liked that it can fold down into a futon - we plan on using for our camping trips. It arrived in one large box, and was super easy to put together- (I think it took my daughter and I about 10 minutes). Quality seems pretty good - but for this price, I didn't have high expectations. We may buy another one for the basement!",

I was excited for this couch but could say that I'm quite disappointed with the result.",
