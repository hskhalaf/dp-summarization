Very good cushioning for heels and soles which have become more sensitive - can't think why - but it might be something to do with a) the badminton racket or b) my age. Trainers are usually on the small size in my experience but these need to be bought at your normal size - they are a generous fit and width. Tried the 'usual' size - I buy (10) - in trainers initially but these were very much too big and I needed to buy my normal shoe size (9).",
