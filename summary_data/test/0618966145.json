It is extremely helpful in identifying our permanent residents and those passing through on a migratory pattern. So far it has answered all our questions and the illustrations have been helpful in precisely finding the characteristics necessary to label the visitors and learn more about their habitat. A Peterson guide that will not disappoint. That said, it is hefty book and one you probably wouldn't want to carry around for true birders.",

The big drawback is that it's too big and heavy to carry in the field except in a backpack. So I had to buy a very similar guide that's a little smaller, and I leave this one at home. It might as well be a coffee table book instead of a field guide. For that reason I'd go with the separate, lighter Eastern and Western guides (or a different guide such at NatGeo's), since the likelihood of spotting a bird outside the one you're carrying is very small.",

With excellent field guides also now available from National Geographic, Sibley, Audubon, Smithsonian & Kaufmann; perhaps Peterson's greatest legacy is the popularization of this foundational natural history avocation to the point that it's devotees can and do support such diversity and quality.

She had left her oldie but goodie bird book at the other house, so I purchased this Peterson guide for her at my house and I'm thrilled. It arrived in a very timely manner, was in great condition, a large book with mangnificient pictures and drawings. She's carrying it with her, following the birds, from front to back of our house. Great buy!!",
