      "text": "The product itself is of good quality. The reason for the 4-star review is the shipping container. They were shipped in a much too large box without wrapping the high-speed steel counter-bores to prevent them from banging against each other during the shipping process. I was so disappointed when I received them knowing there would be damage to the flutes, but there was not damage to the flutes near the pilot, so they are useable, but still very unprofessional shipping practice. Other than that they are great.",

      "text": "Works great, bits are sharp and effective. I used these on a cast iron cylinder head to do some modifications. Ideally, you want to use these in a drill press. I had to use the #8 counterbore bit in such a way that putting my workpiece in my drill press wasn't practical, so I used a hand drill and a steady hand, and it worked out great. I will say, the wood block for mine did not say \"accusize\", nor did the bits have accusize engraved on them, so it's possible I received a knockoff? Regardless, the quality was still good. I expect to use these again for more projects.",
