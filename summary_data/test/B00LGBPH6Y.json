      "text": "Bought this for my son who is right between the small youth helmet size range, which he has been using for a couple years, and the adult size range. This helmet seems well made and was comfortable for him to wear. With his baseball cap under it it fit good enough but the issue for his age and height was the mask length. When he was in a squat the mask rested on his chest protector and he was really unable to turn his head. Returned this one due to this. Shame they don't make more of an in between size.",

There seems to be no inventory in replacements for it on the Easton website. Very disappointed about the chin pad situation. Guess I'll try to find a generic brand chin pad to replace it before this season starts.",

I purchased used on Amazon but it looks like it was never touched. Used it only about 3 times since I purchased, but it has been great. Taken a couple foul balls to the face and I have been happy with the protection from the helmet.",
