I would definitely buy this one again, it is easy to clean and the tank doesn't get slimy if you don't clean it daily, once a week works great, just like the instructions say. I really like this one, mainly because it doesn't use a ton of water on the lowest setting, but it still has enough \"steam\" coming out. Others I have tried go through a full tank a night, as you can't adjust the flow low enough. Definitely worth the $$.",

I can't say how pleased and surprised I am at this product's performance thus far. It is very nearly silent, requires no filters (seriously, are those things disgusting and annoying to replace or what?), and I could tell the difference almost immediately. I also like the essential oils drawer; still messing with how much to actually put into the thing to get the right result. The water tank is plenty for a full 24 hours of run time and refilling it is super easy. Highly recommend this product.",

I cranked it up to high and woke up to 58% humidity, which makes you wake up feeling like you inhaled water. Turned it to low and got 49%, which ended up being about perfect. It can run for about 3-4 nights on low and the oil diffuser works well if you put enough oil in it. If you're getting this for the same reason I did I would recommend getting a digital humidity gauge. They cost less than $10 and will let you figure out what level of humidity works best for you.

      "text": "We have 2 humidifiers. I was stoked about this one though because of the essential oil feature but I think it is a major flaw. First you don\u2019t smell it much unless you add quite a bit in the tray. The tray uses a sponge substance to absorb the oil but here is the major issue. As the oil sits there it can start to smell bad since it has been absorbed into this sponge. It has caused ours to smell like an old gym bag if we run it. I\u2019ve scrubbed every piece down and have Febreezed the essential oil area and soaked the try in soapy water. It smells less but still remains.",

So, it's on the man to fix the problem. This, by far, is the best humidifier that we have every had. Not only that, I don't have to add water every night before bed. It will last for 3 to 4 days on a low setting, so on those days that I forget to fill the humidifier, she won't get mad. There's still water in it! This thing is quiet too. I can't even hear it over the sounds of my wife's snoring. This works great!",

When we started using the heating system for the entire house during this winter season, my daughter started having nose bleeds constantly due to the dry air inside the house. Eversince we started using the humidifier during bedtime in her room, she hasn't complained about having to wake up in the middle of the night to deal with nose bleeds. And using some essential oils to the product gives an added benefit of her room smelling great. Great product overall, I would highly recommend it just for helping my daughter out with her problems .",

Other humidifiers just have an opening at the top you can simply pour water in to refill. Also, seems a little flimsy, questionable quality and there is an annoying blue light on the tank that lights up the room at night.",

I don't like these kinds of practices by companies on Amazon. Even the email address on the card (giftdepartment@outlook.com) seemed suspicious. So, either the company selling this is doing this, or their data is not secure, and someone else knows I bought a humidifier (it said so on the card).",

The tank is designed in a way that when you remove it to fill, the shape of the tank is very awkward. Water drips all over the place when you turn it over to fill. It won't site upside down without falling over. There is a cap over the hole where the mist comes out that falls off when you turn it upside down. It seems like the tanks could be designed in a way that is a little more practical. It does work well, and I would recommend it. But it could be a little better.",

The instructions stipulated that distilled water, or water with a low mineral content should be used. But, I just used tap water, due to its low water-hardness level.
