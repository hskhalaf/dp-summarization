The fine mesh on this item is great and little to no leaves ever leak through (unless they are super fine, almost a powder). They look cute standing up in my cup and I also enjoy the little holder to place them in after use as it keeps the tea from leaking onto my counter and making a mess. It's easy to fill and clean out and with 4 different colors, I can use a different one while the previous one dries out (which makes it even easier to clean). I really would recommend this for tea lovers.",

I like the individual size for a single cup of tea instead of having to use a larger pot size infuser. A great value to boot at this great price!",

You can't even notice it because the bags don't really fall apart or get a huge whole, it's like some dust dissolves from parts of the bag. Anyway, these infusers are a perfect replacement. After use I wash and dry the container, and leave it in my tea leaf container for next time. Sure beats drinking plastic!",

      "text": "I use these for a tisane (tea made with non-leaf plant parts), and they're perfect. They're also really cute, and I love how you can hook them over the side of your tea mug. If you steep teas or tisanes that are a little powdery, some of it will filter through the mesh into your cup, but that's true when I use my muslin tea bags, too. I like how durable these are and how easy they are to clean. Definitely recommend these for tea lovers",

This has been an amazing solution. Very easy to clean, very easy to use. The tiny coaster is nice too! I keep two at work and two at home for use and haven't had an issue with any. I noticed a few complaints about the flower part stretching out or coming off completely. I haven't had this issue since I set the rim of the cup right behind the nub holding the flower.",

I also like that the flower bends enough to hold onto the rim of the mug so you dont have to fish it out. And I like the little \"dish\" to rest the infuser on. Just overall easy.",

Only thing is they float up to the top of the tea bc they have air in them (they do eventually settle back down so it's no problem) but when you take them out when the teas done steeping water gets trapped inside so you might have to hold it at an angle for the water to escape and tap it a bit, but that's just a minor step u might want to do but it's not a big deal",

The height of the flower allows you to safely and easily remove the infuser without touching the hot water. I was between a few options, I am very glad I chose these! To top it off, they are adorable!",
