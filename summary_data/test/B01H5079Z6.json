But unfortunately, by showing a picture of III as the lead image, you can easily believe, as I did, that you were ordering three dinosaurs, not one. For that reason I am giving 2 stars as it is misleading for value/cost. Not giving 1 star as no where does it say 3 dinosaurs, but the description could be clearer of what you are getting. I feel duped.",
