The representative looked up the cover and suggested another non-porous cover to ensure proper suction. He then suggested that if I, or the recipient has any questions to call him. After purchase I received an email offering the same service. For service alone I would highly recommend this product. The functionality of the Whale Tale is impressive and excellent. The durability looks to be very good. It's light enough and small enough for transport. I would highly recommend this company and this product.",

I was a little uncertain about this handle as I feared that it would not be able to maintain a sufficient suction on the back. Well it can maintain a suction and holding and carrying the tablet is so much easier with this device. It's now possible to carry the tablet with one hand while using a stylus with my other to make notes using PDF editing apps. The whale tail also works great as an adjustable stand. I would highly recommend this product.",

However, the suction part doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. I would think that the suction would hold for a day or 2, but I'm lucky if it holds a few hours (using the pad at work). The first one I had stopped holding suction for even a moment and Octa was fabulous about exchanging that part. The new one has held as good as it can for months. I've just gotten in the habit of pressing the button once or twice every few times I pick it up.",

After 'pumping' to fix the tail to my ipad the tail immediately started becoming unstuck, this was noted by the button coming out and making a clicking noise.

The new one has the same problems as before the only difference is that it now comes unstuck much faster than the first. Looks like a design fault with some units not very happy.",
