The flavor is a bit sweet (but not overly sweet; I don't have a big sweet tooth) and it's very cinnamony. Note that the label reads \"Gourmet Seed Butter,\" so it doesn't match the photo on product page here on Amazon, which reads \"Cinnamon Seed Butter.\" (I was worried they'd sent the wrong product when I first received it.)",
