Doesn\u2019t even smell like pee I don\u2019t know how to explain it. It smells like it even after washing but then once it\u2019s dried it smells ok, so strange",

He was already on the last button at 18 lbs, and he's now at 11.5mo/22lbs these are getting really tight across his tummy/groin area. They work well - he only ever had a very mild number 2 early on, but they contained it fine. Obviously if he pees, it'll be wet, but otherwise these work well. I would put the max weight around 23lb, maybe 25 lbs if your kid is more tall/lanky, and not a tubster with a belly and chunky thighs like my son.",
