Its mesmerizing aesthetics, thankfully, is coupled with an amount of comfort that exceeds expectations. This thing of beauty is also outstandingly light and requires a very minimal break-in period.That said, this Danner hiking boot took a beating for its underperforming insole. To sum up, Danner\u2019s Mountain Pass is hard to ignore, not with its blend of great qualities overpowering its workable downsides.",

      "text": "Boots are light weight, comfortable, size was correct. But developed a really annoying squeak in the left heel after about ten months of regular wear (not worn as a work boot). Danner support suggested removing insole, checking shank (was not loose); didn't help. Replaced sole, which also didn't help. Return for repair looks like a hassle -- you pay to insure and send boots to repair facility where they are \"evaluated;\" definitely not a no questions asked warrantty. Squeak doesn't affect comfort but would interfere with any activity that depends on being quiet on the trail (like wildlife photography, hunting, etc.)",

Im not sure of the lasts but the tramline (503 last) i believe fit perfect .5 size under my actual size. The Mountain lights fit perfect .5 above my actual size. I read somewhere that these fit \"true to size\" but true to size was much too narrow/short for me even in EE width. If you normally wear a 11.5 EE i would suggest going with the 12 EE. Great boots just like the others i have from Danner. It actually happened that the \"amazon recommended size\" was correct in this case.",

But they are one of the most comfortable boots I've ever had. And lightweight you could easily walk 10 miles in them with no problem! Very easy to break in, my feet never really hurt during the break in of a couple days. I have had them about two months now and they fit like a glove.. hopefully I can get a few good years life out of them. And then I could resell them.",
