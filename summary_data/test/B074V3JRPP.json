I went to the chiropractor and he had a tens machine that he used it worked very well. Went to my brothers he has a really bad back and he showed me his tens machine. I didn't know you could purchase one. I thought u had to be a doctor or something. This machine is a absolute god send!! Whenever my back acts up I put it on n it instantly takes the pain away! The charge lasts forever and i love it has so many different settings! I swear by this thing!",

The controls of this unit were a little difficult to go through to see which settings would be of most benefit but once learned they wer ok. Most people will not use many of the settings available. The greatest drawback, and this is true with all tens units, is that it is difficult to place the pads in the correct positions on your own back. Lower back fine but help is needed for mid and upper back.",
