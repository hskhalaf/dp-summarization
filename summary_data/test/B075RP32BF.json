I wouldn't recommend for extreme downhill. Get a dirt bike helmet for that! Lost a star because sizing is completely wrong. My son's head measured on the low side of a small. I took all the reviewer's advice and ordered a medium. Glad i did because he's on the tight side of a medium. As the padding compresses it will fit him better. He's 12 with an average size head. Take everyone's advice and order the next size bigger than what you measure!",

Exceeded expectations. Quality product. If your kids like mountain biking, don't fool with silly regular biking helmets, get a legitimate face and head protective helmet. Unfortunately ordered after horrible accident that left son with stitches on chin and road rash all over face (while wearing an ordinary biking helmet).

I measured and ordered the recommend size based on my measurements and while my HEAD fits just fine, I have a prominent jaw line which causes my lower cheeks to be entirely squished (uncomfortably) in this helmet. Not sure if even going up a size would help. The facial portion of the helmet is very narrow. Perhaps it would fit better on a female with less of a jaw, or on a male with a smaller face.",

Fitment is a couple of centimeters too small. I have a 58cm dome and while this says to fit up to 60cm, I highly doubt it would do it comfortably. Other than that, product is decent.",

Weighing in at just 950 grams, the Sanction has 15 vents for optimum airflow and its low-profile design is sized smaller for younger riders. Featuring a hand laminated fiberglass shell for lightweight strength and offered at a recession-busting value, the Sanction is ready for anything.\n\n Specifications:\n\n * Weight: 950 grams / 33.5 ounces \n * Vents: 15 \n * Strap Color: Black \n * Usage: BMX Race \n * Certifications: CE EN1078, CPSC Bicycle \n\n Size Specifications:\n\n * Small: 52 to 54 centimeters / 20.45 to 21.25 inches \n * Medium: 55 to 57 centimeters / 21.65 to 22.45 inches \n * Large: 58 to 60 centimeters / 22.8 to 23.6 inches \n\n About Bell:\nMore world champions have worn Bell Helmets than all other helmet brands combined.
