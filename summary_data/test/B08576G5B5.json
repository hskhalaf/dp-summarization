And no need to wind or unwind it on the hose cart..So glad I got it now only had it a week and no leaks...phew.",

Why only 4 of 5 stars? the hose is made in two parts, an inner fairly flexible hose and a knit cover to keep the inner hose from over-expanding when under pressure. The knit cover is HIGHLY susceptible to abrasion. Lay the hose on a sidewalk, turn the water off and watch it shrink --- but also watch the covering abrade (almost visibly). I have not used the product long enough to test longevity but i rather expect to be buying another one in a couple of years. YES, i would buy another!",

      "text": "So the 50 feet is if you stretch the whole hose to it\u2019s maximum. The actual hose when not under pressure is give or take 30 feet. Yes it won\u2019t tangle, but it also won\u2019t go around the side of your house easily at all. The outer fabric moves almost independently of the inner hose and gets stuck on everything. The whole product is just a bit eh. Could\u2019ve been so much better, and don\u2019t advertise your maximum length as your hose length on a flexible hose, that\u2019s just silly.",

Although my first hose broke (the inner membrane detached from the hose end), the company\u2019s lifetime warranty and responsive customer service was so good (they sent a replacement within two days) that I\u2019m willing to take a chance on a second hose. As for the hose, it is so much better than a traditional hose. Lightweight, easy to move around the yard, and it retracts very easily. I also love that it comes with a nozzle attached. Definitely a solid purchase for anyone with a garden or yard!",

An even more important question, for me at least, is how good is the \"lifetime\" warranty. If the time comes when I need to get my warranty replacement I will update this review. 1 star if no warranty fulfillment and 5 stars if they live up to their promise. Hopefully that won't be for several years. I would have preferred a lower price and no nozzle since they don't seem to last very long. Wonder if the lifetime warranty also applies to the nozzle??",

I'm careful to follow the directions that came with it, have it shut off and turn water on slowly, let it expand before opening it up. When done leave it open so the hose will empty. I think if this is always followed, this will last a good while. No more having to stop to unkink a hose, which is very nice.",

The hose nozzle that it comes with is also good quality. Has many different settings, I prefer the shower setting to water the plants.

So far, this one seems much more durable, and behaves as I expected: stretches itself out when filled with water and once the water is turned off, retracts to half the length. Very lightweight and easy to maneuver. And while I think this hose is likely quite durable, I'm also more careful with it than I might have been with the original hardware store purchase.

What is really disappointing is that the return window has closed. Three months is not enough time to fully evaluate the quality of an outdoor product (most products in fact). This hose did not even last a full season. The price charged does not merit that poor quality of this product.",
