It\u2019s a cool vacuum, but I\u2019ve been using it for three months and the threads on the main carpet head have already worn themselves out. And I cannot find a replacement available anywhere. Maintenance on the rest of the device seems to be quite straightforward and simple.",

With the High Torque XL cleaner head, auto does a good job switching the power up and down depending on the surface. For deep cleaning, boost mode works really great. I like how the outsize version comes with two batteries and two chargers. I love the cordless; makes vacuuming a breeze. Just click in a battery and go! Easy to do maintenance quick vacuuming during the week. The unit is balanced well and easy to use, but if you are a female with arthritis it might be a bit much.",

I was afraid the push to hold power button would irritate me and wouldn\u2019t be convenient but actually isn\u2019t bad especially for the job the vac does. I can easily vacuum the house two times and it still manages to pick stuff up. I also love it cause I can easily just vacuum something up. One downfall is the battery isn\u2019t removable so if it dies, it dies and you have to wait.",

Both vacuums would power on and off by itself after only weeks of use making it almost impossible to use. Both vacuums would continuously get clogged with very minimal use. I would have to take apart the entire vacuum every 5 minutes just to pull out the dog hair from the inner tube of the vacuum. TERRIBLE DESIGN.. If you are looking to purchase a cordless Dyson purchase the V8 animal instead. I have had much better luck with those as I own 3 of them and they have never given me any problems.",

Depending on your carpet height, it may require some extra strength pushing through but I think it\u2019s more to do with the suction power than anything else.
