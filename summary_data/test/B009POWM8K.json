There was no other common factor (no common nets, filters, no new fish added or other things that might have been contaminated or diseased) besides the food. All fish were healthy and vibrant before this. They did well on this food up until the bad batch...",

I took some time to work with the 4mm pellet. Simply tossing them in gently greatly improved its sinksbility. I assume less air trapped on pellet allowing it to submerge. I give it 4 star.",

If you have dojo loaches with your goldfish, beware of that. I now soak them for 30 minutes before I feed (they take a long time to soften up) to minimize one of my loaches sucking these pellets into their gullets and choking to death on the hard pellet. I've also had one goldfish choke on these too but was able to work it out after 20 minutes. They stay hard for a long time. My pond goldfish and koi have no issues and love these the most to more expensive pond foods.",
