After a rain storm a stream of rust was coming out so I tipped it over and it poured out liquid rust. Now I keep it under cover on my patio. I would return it but too much of a hassle as I would have to disassemble it, package it and pay for shipping. So disappointed in this product as this is a major defect!!!",

I relocated to south Texas and had been looking in stores for patio furniture for a year. Could not find a glider which was both comfortable and had provision for air circulation in the seat. (Cushions and solid surfaces have you sweating in short order in 100 degree weather. And, yes, I do sit outside in the shade with a fan in that weather\ud83d\ude0e) Finally read reviews on this item and bought sight unseen and sitting untried. Very happy with decision and product!

      "text": "Got this to replace an old 2-person swing that is finally falling apart - the gliding action is nice, but of course not as great or as freely moving as a swing. It was easy for 2 people to put together with clear instructions and they provide one extra of nuts and bolts which is a nice touch. It looks good, a dark grey, and is comfortable to sit and glide upon.",
