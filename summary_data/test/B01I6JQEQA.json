I added some sticky Velcro squares to the top to keep it on because with every movement it would come off. Now it doesn\u2019t. Also after being opened for about a week, it finally stays up. And doesn\u2019t fold in anymore. \ud83d\ude0a I changed my rating from 1 star to 4. I am so disappointed with this. My baby absolutely loves it without understanding. This thing will not stay up no matter what. She gets in and it collapses. She moves .. and it collapses. Nice thought but bad design. I\u2019m returning not even an hour after delivery.",

Because of the price I got it for (less than $20) I wasn\u2019t expecting something perfect, as I paid twice as much for my niece\u2019s thru a different vendor. This is not a very sturdily made pop up tent and it shows by the price. The material is quite thin. It will serve its purpose for a short while, which I am fine with, as long as no eyes get poked out from failed stitching of the tension rods. I see duct tape in this tents future to prevent that.",
