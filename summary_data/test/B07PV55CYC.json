Generally these shoes are well constructed however the eyelets are not reinforced like in previous models (maybe to save weight) but it does make the shoe feel cheaper. The insides and toe are reinforced though but my problem has always been on the outside developing a hole by my little toe. My biggest complaint though is even though I ordered the same size they run slightly larger an issue I could deal with in everyday shoes but for running this is going to be an issue and I might end up donating this pair",

I work a job that involves a lot of restraining of people when they get out of control so they get stomped on all of the time and yet still hold up great. Lastly, they're very fairly priced. 10/10.
