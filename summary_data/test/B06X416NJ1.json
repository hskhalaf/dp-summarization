So, if you have an AMD A-Series processor you can have integrated video, but if you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you need a dedicated GPU (Video Card).",

Put this along with Corsair 3000mhz DDR4 and was disappointed when the board can't clock the RAM to it's correct speed. The board is unstable above 2400-2700Mh and passmark puts the RAM in the 61st percentile which is quite disappointing. I've read others have had similar problem with other high-end RAM as well. It works but you probably shouldn't get this board if you want the best bang for your buck. I'd say keep under an x1500 with this board.",

Access next-generation connectivity and speeds with NVMe M.2, USB 3.1, DDR4 support and Gigabit LAN. 5X Protection III ensures component longevity and reliability while SafeSlot Core adds protection for PCIe slots. The Ryzen CPU requires a discrete graphics card and any MB that is compatible with Ryzen CPU needs a discrete graphics card to run. This is a CPU limitation and the customer should be do their research on the CPU before buying. Ryzen CPUs do not officially support Windows 8, it only supports Windows 10. In AMD\u2019s press release, they stated there is no official support for anything before Windows 10 for their Ryzen CPUs. The customer should also know that this is a CPU issue and not a MB issue.",
