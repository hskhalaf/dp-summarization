      "verdict": "When it comes to stylish yet affordable lifestyle sneakers, one brand that immediately comes to mind is Steve Madden. Such factors are seen in the extremely inexpensive pair of low-top Steve Madden Fenta.This style is far tamer and modest versus the runway-ready selections from the brand. Plus, the shoe is equipped with basic cushioning properties.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the Steve Madden Fenta buyers are drawn to its sharp and stylish design",
        "The majority of the reviewers have mentioned the upper is made of moderately thick textile",
        "This shoe is among the Steve Madden shoes that offer sufficient cushioning, according to several wearers",
        "Quite a lot of owners have stated that it\u2019s comfy straight from the box",
        "Others have noted that its oxford style makes it suitable for casual work setup, weekend sprees and even for night outs downtown",
        "Not only is this style liked by many when paired with jeans but with chinos and khakis too",
        "This shoe comes very affordably"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Many reviewers say that the Steve Madden Fenta is poorly assembled",
        "Some buyers have shared that it is slippery on smooth surfaces like tile floors"
