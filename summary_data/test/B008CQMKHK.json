I've never purchased something like this before, and it took me a bit to realize that the house was actually stuffed into the sprayer. Once I found that out, the entire process was easy, I sprayed the inside and outside with this, and it sure did its job. The next day I noticed a dramatic difference with the ants and critters that were crawling around. I would definitely purchase this again once I use up the bottle. It this review was at all helpful to you, tell me so by hitting \"YES\" below. Thank you!",

Thankfully I found this spray and after spraying both the outside and inside of my home myself within 15-20 minutes, was completely bug free for so far almost 4 weeks now. I will be spraying again soon however this product has passed my test! I would definitely recommend this product to others.",

Had one on my arm, I sprayed it directly, and it just sat there like nothing happened for a minute, then jumped away. And since they specifically only talk about ants, roaches, and spiders for long-term control, I'm betting it doesn't repel/kill fleas for any length of time. Haven't yet tried it on ants, since I'm instead using Terro baits for that now.",

      "text": "DANGEROUS! HAZARDOUS! Ortho made this product with a pathetically thin plastic container. When the product arrived, I removed the nozzle from the side and the package ripped open! The insect poison immediately started hemorrhaging out all over my kitchen! If the package can't withstand simply removing the nozzle to begin using it it is an absolute HAZARD! Do not buy this product. The last thing you want is this poisonous fluid pouring all over like it did in my house.",

A week after application I was still spotting spiders in those same problem areas of the basement and noticed the same amount of earwigs and yellow sac spiders in my home. Maybe they were there before and didn't have a chance to come in contact with the poison. Maybe this doesn't work on spiders..who knows?",

Spraying around my doors and along baseboards in the kitchen and basement keeps all the bugs away for a long time. It's definitely more effective than raid and it doesn't have any odor. The spray nozzle can make your hand hurt after a while but you have a lot more control over the chemicals than with an aerosol spray.",
