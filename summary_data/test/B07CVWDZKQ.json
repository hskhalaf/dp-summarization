There are a few hiccups, WiFi for example can suddenly freeze (turning it off and on again seems to fix it) and the 'stereo effects' on headphones is just plain awful, and has to be turned off each and every time you plug headphones in. That all said, I still feel this is a 5 star review (or maybe 4.5 at least) because its a nice looking phone that is quick, has huge storage, and does what I am looking for. Battery life could be better, but its no worse than previous phones I've had.",

The fingerprint recognition is poor, I mostly have to enter the PIN. And the PIN can only be 6 digits maximum, whilst the Honor 9 allowed me at least 7. Like most smart phones this comes wit the usual bloat ware preinstalled, much of which, annoyingly, cannot be removed without rooting the phone. A worthy successor, but with a few quirks",
