There's no turntable - you just set the food in the oven and it stays still while it cooks. This really reduces the amount of food that gets splattered around, and the lack of a turntable means that it's ridiculously easy to clean. Two minor quibbles: the beep (there's only one) is quite a bit louder than a typical household microwave, and the door hinge feels worn after only a few months of use. Neither of those are big deals, though. I love this microwave.",

This fits the bill perfectly; simple and tough, easy to clean, no rotating plate to fall on the floor. Nobody needs gimmicks like dedicated buttons for popcorn or potatoes anyway. The only drawback is an extra loud end-of-cycle buzzer. I might try to mute that a little. Despite being commercial, it's great that this microwave can easily do lower power or multi-stage heating too.",
