      "text": "This is my second pair of these Converse shoes. The first pair are pretty worn out but I still wear them in the garden and rely on these handsome new boys for casual or daily use. Note the black laces, very nice. You never know if your new sneakers are going to fit the same as your last pair but Converse is very consistent in their sizes and these fit like a glove and oh so comfortable. If you wear a 9 buy a 9, you should be pleased with the fit!",
