We were running 2 watt LED's in our outside fixtures before these, and even they drew tons of bugs. These do not.

      "text": "I bought this on a whim for my son, set it up in his room and he loves it (especially with Halloween approaching). The light produced is a deep orange, like a low sapwood flame, and the flickering is a realistic waving rather than the strobing effect sometimes seen. Overall a very cool idea and good implementation. Note that my wife hates it because she says \"it's going to give me a seizure\" (she has never had a seizure, just being dramatic).",

I will update in the future if/when they burn out. They're a little on the expensive side, but nothing too ridiculous considering we only need a few.",

But stylistically, they are awesome. One of my favorite impulse home purchases ever. Clever design and works great.",

I used them in exterior fixtures with frosted glass and they looked strikingly realistic with the one small exception that the \"flames\" are more orange than yellow. True gas lanterns tend to have a yellowish white flame not so orange, so that part is a dead giveaway.",

Doesn\u2019t look cheesy at all. I get compliments all the time. I liked them so much I bought 4 more for the rest of my exterior light posts around the house. 1 by the front door, 2 next to the garage, and 1 on the back patio.

So I went back to the original gift-giver and got the specifics on our bulb. We've ordered several of these bulbs since, including the smaller candlebra ones. We are absolutely delighted by them! More expensive than the competition's, but worth the extra money.",
