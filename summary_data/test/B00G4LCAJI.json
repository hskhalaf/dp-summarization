Tighten the lid of the glass carafe to avoid the carafe from leaking. Hold the plastic portion of the lid in one hand and secure the glass carafe with the other. Tighten the lid gently clockwise [righty tighty] to tighten the plastic portion and prevent coffee from leaking under the threading/seal.",

Makes an excellent cup of HOT coffee, is it $250 better than the Cuisinart? Probably not, but I went through one Cuisinart a year, this one should last longer. Overall I'm happy with the Moccamaster, but after reading all the reviews I guess I was expecting some cosmic.coffee experience, and it's just not that, it's coffee. One more thing, 15 Cups? think again, maybe 15 European espresso cups, but plan on 6 American coffee mugs worth and you won't be dissapointed",

It's hand wash only, which means extra time and effort and also the use of lots of water to rinse the detergent out. Then it calls for coarse ground coffee and that requires some effort to get the grind right. It's a waste of money, time, effort and water when you never know how it will taste and, more often than not, it is just lousy. Bleh.",
