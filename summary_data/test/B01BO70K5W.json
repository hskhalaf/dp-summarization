      "text": "This sofa looks nice and I really like the fllip up/down function for storage and bed. The overall design is great. Should be really easy to install.(less than half hour) However, they really need to improve their quality control process. The package I received came with wrong size screw nuts!!! It took me a while to find out that the installation fasteners were stardand M8-1.25 metric size and the nuts were 5/16-18 inch thread size. Really dispointed when I found out I have to stop the installation process and get the M8 nut at a local fastener store. Moreover, the hinge looks weak, will see if it is durable.",

I have not tried the reclining sleeper feature yet. I'm giving this couch a 2 star review because it never came with instructions to put it together. It just came with the bolts and tools. I'm currently trying to contact Poundex Customer Service to see if they can email me the instructions for the couch.",

      "text": "I've had this sofa for almost 2 years now. It looks great and has a ton of storage. It's fairly easy to lift up or fold down into a bed. A couple of my friends that were helping me move assembled it and it took them about 30-40 minutes and seemed pretty easy. The one huge con is that it is extremely uncomfortable. The little padding it has is already worn down and you can feel every piece of the wood frame. I've never sat on such an uncomfortable piece of furniture. I've learned my lesson and I will never buy furniture without testing it out first.",
