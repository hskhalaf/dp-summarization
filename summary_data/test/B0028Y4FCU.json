They fit right onto our charcoal grill and then we sit them on a towel, ready to eat! You can see in the photo we have a dozen on the rack, but they are really big oysters.",

So far this rack has worked perfectly and has made grilling shucked oysters much easier (compared to taking each oyster off of the grill one at a time). Now I'll be able to easily cook 24 oysters at a time.",

Before this I just layed all my oysters on the bottom of a tin foil turkey pan, it worked good until you took them out and all the juices came out of the oysters. With the rack it eliminates the rocking back and fourth of the oysters when you take them out of the oven. Highly recommended if you like to bake oysters in oven.",

This rack makes it easy to manage about two dozen clams at once, and get nearly all the juice into your bowl along with the clams. Use long tongs and grab the lower shell-half after the clam opens up. (The meat will be in the top, making the cooked clam unstable without a rack like this.) Works just as well with oysters, but I have not tried mussels yet. Seems to be constructed very solidly. Highly recommended!",
