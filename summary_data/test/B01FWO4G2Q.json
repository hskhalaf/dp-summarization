It was delivered on time, packed very securely , undamaged , with easy to follow instructions & the hardware included. I was able to install it with a friend who had an injuried arm as my consultant & moral support/ assistant. We are both in our sixties. The mirror was heavy but manageable . I am 5'3\" / 120 lbs . learning to be a \"Handyman\" after a recent divorce of a 40 yr marriage. Need to work on my measuring skills & using tools more effectively . The mirror project was a success !",

Our first one arrived slightly cracked (rough shipping, I'm sure) and a new one was sent out immediately so as not to hold up our remodel. Any company that stands behind their product and offers affordable, quality, products is a company I will do business with again. Thanks HH!",

That may seem a small item, but that was important to me based upon my bath remodel. It's also not wood, but appears to be medium/high density fiberboard. Also, one of the soft feet cushion pads was missing, implying quality control issues. I'm not sure I would return the item, but think I could have purchased elsewhere and saved money with no difference in quality.",

The hanging rings on the back of the mirror flip up too easily and could not catch on the hooks provided. Ended up having to string hanging wire through the rings. Wish we had done it that way to begin with. If you use wire do not try to hang it from 1 centered nail you need to use 2 nails.",

I looked in-stores but there aren't many options to choose from, either the design is mediocre or the quality is not great.
