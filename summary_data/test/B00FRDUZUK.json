I own both A7R and A7S: - A7R: perfect for shooting with details in mind. Shutter vibration exists but insignificant.

So far no inadvertent pressing of the record button that I experienced with the NEX 7. I would also like the option for a cable remote.

NFC: One-touch remote, One-touch sharing\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony\u00ae \u03b17R Full Frame Compact Interchangeable Lens \nDigital Camera \n\nNo other full frame, interchangeable-lens camera is this light or this portable. Features 36MP of rich detail, a true-to-life 2.4 million dot OLED viewfinder, Wi-Fi\u00ae sharing and an expandable shoe system. It's all the full-frame performance you ever wanted in a compact size that will change your perspective entirely. \n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\nWORLD'S SMALLEST AND LIGHTEST1 INTERCHANGEABLE LENS FULL-FRAME CAMERA\nSony's Exmor\u00ae image sensor takes full advantage of the Full-frame format, but in a camera body less than half the size and weight of traditional full-frame DSLRs.\n\nULTIMATE FULL FRAME 36.3 MP RESOLUTION WITH NO OPTICAL LOW-PASS FILTER\nThe newly developed 36.3-megapixel 35mm full-frame Exmor\u00ae CMOS sensor delivers unbelievably high resolution in combination with high sensitivity and extremely low noise. Sony removed the optical low-pass filter to bring out the full potential of the sensor and lens, thus achieving an enhanced sense of clarity with supremely realistic details to the very edges of your photos. An AR coating also reduces flare and ghosting.\n\nGAPLESS, OPTIMALLY POSITIONED ON-CHIP LENSES\nSony optimized the design and positioning of every on-chip lens (OCL) covering every pixel to significantly enhance light-gathering efficiency. A gapless on-chip lens design eliminates the gaps between the micro-lenses to collect more light. Moreover, each on-chip lens is optimally positioned depending on its location to accommodate the sharper angle of light entering the periphery, which is caused by larger sensor dimensions being teamed with the E-mount's short flange-back distance.\n\n\n\n\nNEW BIONZ\u00ae X IMAGE PROCESSING ENGINE\n\n\nSony proudly introduces the new BIONZ\u00ae X image processing engine, which faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, via extra high-speed processing capabilities. Together with front-end LSI (large scale integration) that accelerates processing in the earliest stages, it enables more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations and lower noise whether you shoot still images or movies.\n\nFAST INTELLIGENT AF FOR RESPONSIVE, \nACCURATE, AND GREATER OPERABILITY WITH\nFULL FRAME SENSOR\nThe high-speed image processing engine and improved algorithms combine with optimized image sensor read-out speed to achieve ultra high-speed AF despite the use of a full-frame sensor.\n\n\n\n\nFULLY COMPATIBLE WITH SONY'S E-MOUNT LENS SYSTEM AND NEW FULL-FRAME LENSES\n\nTo take advantage of the lightweight on-the-go body, the \u03b17R full frame compact interchangeable lens digital camera is fully compatible with Sony's E-mount lens system and expanded line of E-mount compact and lightweight full-frame lenses from Carl Zeiss and Sony's premier G-series.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nDIRECT ACCESS INTERFACE FOR FAST, INTUITIVE SHOOTING CONTROL\nQuick Navi Pro displays all major shooting options on the LCD screen so you can rapidly confirm settings and make adjustments as desired without searching through dedicated menus. When fleeting shooting opportunities arise, you'll be able to respond swiftly with just the right settings.\n\nHIGH CONTRAST 2.4M DOT OLED EVF FOR EYE-LEVEL FRAMING\nView every scene in rich detail with the XGA OLED Tru-Finder, which features OLED improvements and the same 3-lens optical system used in Sony's flagship a99 DSLR. The viewfinder faithfully displays what will appear in your recording, including the effects of your camera settings, so you can accurately monitor the results. You'll enjoy rich tonal gradations and 3 times the contrast of the \u03b199. High-end features like 100% frame coverage and a wide viewing angle are also provided.\n\n3.0\" 921K DOT LCD TILTS FOR HIGH AND LOW ANGLE FRAMING\nThe tiltable 3.0\" (921k dots) Xtra Fine\u2122 LCD Display makes it easy to photograph over crowds or low to capture pets eye to eye by swinging up approx. 84\u00b0 and down approx. 45\u00b0. Easily scroll through menus and preview life thanks to WhiteMagic\u2122 technology that dramatically increases visibility in bright daylight. The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.\n\nSIMPLE CONNECTIVITY TO SMARTPHONES VIA\nWI-FI\u00ae OR NFC\nConnectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi\u00ae/NFC control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, \u03b17R also supports NFC (near field communication) providing \"one touch connection\" convenience when transferring images to Android\u2122 smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control \u2014 a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone \u2014 connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.\n\nPC CONTROL W/ REMOTE VIDEO CAPTURE CONTROL\nRemote Camera Control allows you to control your \u03b17R from your PC using a USB cable. Feature control has also been updated to include video capture control.\n\n14-BIT RAW OUTPUT FOR RICH TONAL GRADATION\n14-bit RAW image data of extremely high quality is outputted by the \u03b17R. This data fully preserves the rich detail generated by the image sensor during the 14-bit A/D conversion process. When developed with Sony's Image Data Converter RAW development software, these images deliver the superb photographic expression and rich gradation that only 14-bit data can offer.\n\nFULL HD MOVIE2 AT 24P/60I/60P W/UNCOMPRESSED HDMI\u00ae OUTPUT\nCapture Full 1920 x 1080 HD uncompressed clean-screen video files to external recording devices via an HDMI\u00ae connection in 60p and 60i frame-rates. Selectable in-camera AVCHD\u2122 codec frames rates include super-smooth 60p, standard 60i or cinematic 24p. MP4 codec is also available for smaller files for easier upload to the web.\n\nMULTI-INTERFACE SHOE FOR FLASH AND MICROPHONE FLEXIBILITY\nUnlike conventional cameras, the \u03b17R features the advanced Multi-Interface Shoe that dramatically expands compatibility with Sony digital imaging accessories, thus raising the potential for photo/movie shooting.\n\n4K STILL IMAGE OUTPUT BY HDMI\u00ae8 OR WI-FI\u00ae FOR VIEWING ON 4K TVS\nEnjoy Ultra High Definition slide shows directly from the camera to a compatible 4K television.
