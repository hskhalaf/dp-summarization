My interstate is a bit of a racetrack (3 lanes, packed all going 80 no lane discipline - swapping lanes, no signals over and under taking all the time - not using mirrors and sitting in the blind spot). I have these adjusted so I can all of the adjacent lanes - they are very very good. Easy to install and very clear. I rely on them",

Although these shipped with swivel mounts, I didn't need them (though I thought I would)... the fact that these are real glass, and can be mounted either with or without the swivel really make them a quality blind spot mirror. All of my vehicles have stick on blindspot or bracket mount convex semi mirrors and as far as the stick ons go, I think these are my new favorite.",

I expect the 3M automotive tape used for mounting the mirrors to last a long time.
