It comes with 4 extra props so you can replace them once they are ready to be replaced. This is very sturdy and has prop guards so that it does not damage walls or it self once crashed. I recommend it 100%. The only thing is that the joysticks are very small and just a bit hard to control the drone with. I wished they were a bit higher than they are and had some short of grip to make controlling easy. other than that no complaints. 5 star.",

The controller will require 2 AA batteries which is not provided. Drone body is about 2 inches side to side and about 1 inch tall without the prop guards and landing gear installed. Everything is fairly easy to put together. The little drone is so light weight that if you crash it, it'll probably not take much damage. Also fits well in the hands and easy to operate. Overall, I like this little drone. Fun toy to play around with in the house And also in the playground",

It kept flashing all 4 lights which meant low battery; even though i've charged it for hours already. When we did finally get it to work, it's flight time was only about less than 10 minutes. That seems fair enough I guess since my drone also has a small flying time window. It comes with extra propellers which is a plus!",

It's not staying put when starting so the calibrating isn't working for me. while it's seems easy, there is a learning curve to try to adjust so it will fly or 'float' at same area...

Pros who already know how to fly will still have just as much control over it too. Perfect for flying indoors.

      "text": "I bought this for my wife for Christmas, 2017. She loves the size and the fact that it is so easy to fly. Altitude hold works great. It can fly normal or headless. It does 360 deg flips in all directions and really doesn't lose altitude when doing so. Very responsive, and it charges fairly quickly. It is the gold model and is pretty sharp looking. I would definitely buy another one. I haven't had any issues with it so I can't directly comment on the customer service, but Syma makes a good drone, and from what I've heard their CS is great.",

The battery lasts 5 to 7 minutes but that\u2019s expected from a drone this small. Word of caution, do not fly the drone outside on a windy day because it will be swept away. Mine got blown away into an empty lot with long heavy grass and lost it.",

Unfortunately, after just 4 days after she got it, the plug in the drone where the charging cord goes was somehow pushed inside the drone, making it useless. It was fun for 4 days. EDITED TO ADD: Jimmy from SYMA store contacted me after seeing my review and not only apologized for the issue but offered a refund as well. SPECTACULAR customer service. It is clear they wanted to make it right.",

I wish the flight time was longer but it's not bad considering the size, plus that's the case with all drones, even the expensive ones. They just eat batteries. Don't hesitate to buy this, you'll be happy!",
