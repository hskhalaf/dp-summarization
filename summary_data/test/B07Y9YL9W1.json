This Bojing unit is cheaper but despite the same wattage, the Lasko unit does seem to heat the room up faster. Don't let that be the deciding factor. This unit is very lightweight, easy to move around and great value for the money. However, the knob used for selecting the heating option is difficult to turn. That is the only setback in our opinion.",

It has feature to adjust the thermostat to 3 modes which include cool wind, low and high heat. Along with that it has adjustable thermostat controller. I like it\u2019s safety feature. It has tip-over safety switch which will turn off the heater in case it falls down. It has button to switch from auto oscillation diffused mode which will cover 70% of the area to focused mode.It has a fan mode which I can use in summer. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase since I can use this heater in winter and summer both.",

The tip off security feature is a plus. The only downside is there is no way to set to the desired temperature without using a thermostat, but it\u2019s not a big issue because once yo set it you don\u2019t need to change it again.",

One minor complaint (doesn't affect my rating though) is that it was a tad louder than I expected. It doesn't bother me much since I usually have headphones on, but it might bother some who prefer complete or near silence.
