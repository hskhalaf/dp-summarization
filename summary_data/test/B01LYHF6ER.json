I cannot speak to the long life of moving board. My seven year old loved it, and keeps asking to play. I do see a few house rules being needed over time. Well worth the $13 price.",

It's technically Harry Potter themed, but it doesn't really affect gameplay much other than the cards being themed and the board having HP characters on it. The game itself is extremely cheaply/poorly made, and the actual value is probably more like $5 than the $10 we paid. However, the laughs were so worth it that I would absolutely buy it again or even recommend it to other people. It just should probably be considered somewhat disposable, especially if you're playing with kids or people who can't be gentle.",

We have Trouble and Sorry, and this game is kind of like a mix of the two because you have the pop bubble with a die in it, and you also have draw cards that add a little interest to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone with young children who like games and Harry Potter.",

It's like \"Trouble\" with an added factor of drawing cards when you land on marked places that add an extra component of randomness. Some of the cards give you the opportunity to send one of your opponent's pieces back to start, for example. The Harry Potter theme got him interested in playing. The game lasts long enough to be really satisfying in a one-more-game before bed kind of way. I recommend for a restless kid(s) and adults who are easily bored. If it doesn't last long, well, it was cheaper than a movie for the 3 of us already.",
