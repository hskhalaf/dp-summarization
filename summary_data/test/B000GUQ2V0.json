I had no trouble locating inktanks, and they weren't any more expensive than the ones for my Epson.",

When you use select genuine Canon photo papers and inks, prints can resist fading for up to 100 years when stored in an archival quality photo album.

In addition, ChromaLife100 prints, when created using Canon Photo Paper Pro or Photo Paper Plus Glossy, have up to 30-year light fastness when displayed under glass.\n\n Launched globally by Canon in 1999, the Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) advanced print head technology is one of the keys to the impressive speed and high photo quality of the iP1700. FINE technology uses a ground-breaking high-performance, multi-nozzle print engine that ejects consistent and microscopic ink droplets. You can also take advantage of Canon's software packages to help edit and customize your prints. Easy Photo Print 3.5 software makes it simple to enhance and print amazing digital photos through your computer while Easy Web Print software gives Windows users the tools to properly print Web pages in full color without trimming off the right hand margin. The results are high-resolution photos and documents with sharp detail and clarity in less time.\n\n The iP1700 comes with a one-year limited warranty.\n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nPixma iP1700 photo printer, cartridges (PG-40 black, CL-41 color), power cord, easy setup instructions, document kit (setup instructions and user's guide CD-ROM, quick start guide, registration card, and cross sell sheet.)",
