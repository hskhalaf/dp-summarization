I knocked off three stars for: 1) the loose lower handle (can't tighten further but constantly falls off), 2) having to frequently turn it off and upside down to manually pull the string out while repeatedly clicking the feed button, and 3) it takes a lot of pressure to keep the handle depressed while using, so it makes my hands ache terribly for days after a single trimming session. I wouldn't repurchase, and do not recommend this trimmer.",

However, the battery life on the item has been declining rapidly between the first and approximate 12 use. The first time, the battery lasted 40 minutes. After a dozen uses, the battery life is down to approximately 10 minutes. In addition, there is a problem with the safety interlock that prevents the trimmer from turning on all the time. I think that this trimmer will die fairly soon. I will call customer service to see how they will fix this problem.",

No more stopping to coax out or fix more cord. It's completely automatic. Haven't had to change it out yet, could last another season before swapping out the cord cartridge.",
