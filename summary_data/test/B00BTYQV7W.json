So ultimately I'm stuck with a chair. It would have been okay if they said that in the description and not misrepresent the product.",

The only issue I have with it is a few weeks ago out of no where the chair has gotten super squeaky. I can't move, turn, stand, or do anything on the chair without it making lots of noise. If you're okay with the squeak it should be fine. I think it's a great chair for the price.",

It came with the tool required for assembly and spare parts, however, the back does not recline independently as the illustrations show. The seat and back recline as one (1:1) ration and and even on the lowest tension it will not recline effortlessly. This is not as I expected and after using this chair for about 6 hours I think it is okay-ish for the price I paid. I purchased the RELAXOBAK Original Orthopedic Posture Corrector for 16.99 - silly piece of plastic has significantly increased my comfort.",

I'm a lightweight guy and it feels like I'm sitting directly on the cushion board, so I imagine it'd bottom out even more for heavier folk. The fabric is also a bit scratchy and a bit too textured, causing slight discomfort even when clothed. Again, if you do computer work, stay away and spend a little more to ensure your comfort. The price was very reasonable and now I know why. On the plus side, it was very easy to assemble and feels sturdy.",

The ability to adjust the chair to allow it to lean back is nice, would be better if the chair could lean back a bit farther. She has used the chair for about 3 weeks and likes it.
