I cook most days and it chops so well because it does not reduce the onion etc to a pulp like my food processor does. I can fine chop a large onion in 10 seconds and its so easy to clean up.",

Unfortunately, this one is very soft plastic and when I put items in it to mix up a recipe, the handle wouldn't even turn before I heard the plastic beginning to crack. About the only thing that can be stirred well in this thing, is boiled eggs and soft tuna. I am so disappointed. If you try to mix up veggies that are too hard, I am not sure it will hold up for you.",
