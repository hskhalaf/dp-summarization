I was worried the peppermint might be too heavy in fragrance or have an overly STRONG natural cooling effect on my muscles, but overall the peppermint wasn't strong enough to leave a lasting impact on my muscles. I would have loved to have a tad more peppermint in the bottle for the natural impact it does have on our muscles but more than anything, I am happy the peppermint wasn't over-powering. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this massage oil because the ingredients are kind to the body and lastly who doesn't want to feel like they are laying in a field of lavender?!",

I don't notice a whole lot of pain reduction from the oils themselves, just from a deep massage with it.
