The first weekend (Friday through Sunday) that I wore them I put in a 15, a 14, and a 12 hour day for a combined 28 miles of walking on uneven asphalt, concrete, and gravel. My feet felt as well as could be expected with no swelling, blisters, or abnormal aching. I would recommend the ASICS Gel Excite 3 for anyone looking for a supportive shoe that will get them through long days. Great shoe for the value.",
