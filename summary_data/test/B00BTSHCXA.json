This unit is actually better than the Bluetooth headset that I use while driving in my semi truck. I've tested this going down the highway at 70MPH and the person I was speaking to could not even tell that I was riding. The Controls are easy to manipulate even while wearing riding gloves and I really enjoy the FM receiver feature.",

This time, it is going back and I will never trust this company again.",

After explaining why I couldn't, their response was \"I'm sorry\". Well yes you are sorry.....sorry customer service. I'm repairing it at work and found that it was just a corroded internal battery, so I ordered a replacement for $16.",

    "title": "Sena SPH10H-FM-01 Bluetooth Stereo Headset and Intercom with Built-in FM Tuner for Half Helmets",
    "description": "The SPH10H-FM is a Bluetooth Headset and Intercom designed for half helmets By attaching the SPH10H-FM to your half helmet, you can call hands-free on your Bluetooth mobile phone and listen to stereo music by Bluetooth wirelessly and have intercom conversations in full duplex with other users Offers exceptional sound quality for both incoming and outgoing sound in its class Easy-to-access and intuitive button operations make the SPH10H-FM a perfect companion for motorcycle riders Bluetooth Specification v3.0 Working distance (intercom) of up to 980 yards in open terrain 4-way conference intercom Multipoint for Mobile Phone+GPS Voice prompts Bluetooth stereo headset for Bluetooth audio devices such as MP3 players Bluetooth music playback control by AVRCP (Audio Video Remote Control Profile): play, pause, track forward and track back Crystal clear and natural sound quality Simple ear pad design for quick installation to half helmets Compatible with shorty helmets in the market Easy headset controls by versatile Jog Dial Bluetooth hands free for Bluetooth mobile phones Water resistant for use in inclement weather 10 hours talk time, 7 days stand-by time Firmware upgradable Peace of mind - thanks to the 2-year warranty\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe SMH10H-FM-01 is a Bluetooth v3.0 + EDR Class 1 Stereo Headset with long-range Bluetooth Intercom designed specifically for motorcycle half-helmets. With the SMH10H-FM-01, you can call hands-free on your Bluetooth mobile phone, listen to stereo music or voice instructions of GPS navigations by Bluetooth wirelessly, and have intercom conversations in full duplex with a passenger or other motorcycle riders. This version of the SMH10H features a built-in FM radio to listen to your favorite stations in addition to intercom use.\n\nFeatures include Bluetooth 3.0, multi-point connection, and conferencing for up to 4 people Thanks to the latest Bluetooth v3.0 and the advanced digital processing technology, the SMH10H-FM-01 offers the best sound quality for both incoming and outgoing sound in its class. Also, its super-thin and compact form factor contribute higher performance for sports bike riding and makes the SMH10R a perfect companion of motorcycle riders.\n\nBLUETOOTH V3.0 WIRELESS\nSMH10H-FM-01 can wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices supporting HSP/HFP (Headset Profile/Hands Free Profile) and A2DP (Advance Audio Distribution Profile). HSP/HFP is standard in all phones with Bluetooth features. Almost all Bluetooth MP3 players, smartphone, and audio dongles support A2DP to send stereo audio to Bluetooth headsets like the Sena SMH10H-FM-01. Enjoy Bluetooth music playback control by AVRCP: play, pause, track forward and track back.\n\nOther Bluetooth features include Multi-Pair to allow intercom functionality for 4 persons, and compatibility with select motorcycle GPS systems.\n\nUse as an intercom, or connect to your portable devices VOICE PROMPT\nSafety is a key factor when out on the road and Sena has integrated voice prompts into all of their units to ensure riders can maintain handsfree control. Voice prompts allow riders to operate functions such as GPS, volume control, mobile phone calls and more without needing to take their hands off of the handle bars. Sena provide voice prompt options for multi-language, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.This is necessary to ensure safety is maintained during times of traffic or congestion.\n\nINDIVIDUAL ADJUSTABLE VOLUME PROFILES\nYou can easily decrease/increase the volume of the voice, music and intercom using Jog Dial. The SMH10H-FM-01 can save volume levels of previously connected profiles. This means that phone volume (HSP/HFP), music volume (A2DP), and intercom volumes will be saved separately and return to its own saved volume level whenever associated profile is reconnected.\n\nProfile volume adjustment is only affected during the use of its specific profile. However, when changing volume during standby mode, then volume change applies to all profiles. Alert tones like low battery warning and connection tones can only be adjusted in standby mode.\n\nEASY INSTALLATION FOR MOST HELMETS\nThe SMH10H-FM-01 will fit onto various types of helmets. The standard clamp, included in default packaging, will fit onto most helmets. For installations which may require extra wire length, ear buds instead of speakers, and wire microphone instead of boom microphone, Sena offers different types of clamps as an additional accessory (sold separately), to allow various installations and user preferences.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nSena SMH10H-FM-01 Bluetooth Headset, speaker/microphone clamp unit, USB power and data cable, DC vehicle charger, 3.5mm stereo audio jack cable, glued surface mounting adapter, microphone sponges, speaker pads, velcro pads, Allen wrench (for installation), microphone cap, manual, warranty.",
