Over the years, I have developed some back problems from this heavy lifting due to poor form when fatigued. Using smaller, starter gym belts just don't cut it when you are squatting 400-500lbs plus. I realized I needed a \"real\" lifting belt at that point. Enter this baby. It keeps your core very sturdy with it's thick, sturdy build. If you want to lift heavy, this belt will definitely fit the bill.",

When squatting heavy, this gives you something substantial to push against and you focus on the lift rather than belt insecurity. The leather is nice and stiff and just about has the elasticity of a piece of iron. Perfect. I just got the belt and have used it for only a few lifts so far, but I'm not feeling concerned about it's longevity. I'll certainly update this review if I end up having any problems at all. I really don't foresee any issues though...this thing is rugged.",

Then when you wanna take it off it's almost like another workout to get the prongs out, they needed to be curved a little more I think.

Make sure you know exactly where to measure, as it should ride higher than a normal pants belt. That being said, there is plenty of length and if you are relatively trim, the fit should be easy: 36-38\" mid section will be LARGE, although the temptation will be to chose Xtra large.",
