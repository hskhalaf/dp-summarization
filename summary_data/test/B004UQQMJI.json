It's super heavy, double stitched, vented. The bottom elastic closure didn't work really well, and the leg loops were nice if you have a grill with legs. I wish it had a center cinch strap with buckles to allow you to tuck the cover under the side shelves. I may add this to the one I have. The buckles would allow you to quickly undo it without having to reset it everytime (hint, hint). I'm guessing these are modeled on the Weber grills.",

The material is heavy and stands up well to freezing winter conditions -- though I'm sure I could easily crack it if not careful taking it off during the super cold days.",

My husband had to struggle to get the cover on the grill each time he used it. I bought a size larger this time and he is very happy with it. I don't expect to have any tearing at the corners now because there isn't any stress on the corners and the cover is made very well. Good value.",

I think I'll try Amazon basics this next time, they are half this price, and see just how long that lasts, it certainly should beat seven months. I had done a prior review of this cover and was very happy with it because of its construction but I didn't include any longevity and now I have. This cover by the way is in the sun and probably would last longer under a covered porch. But being out in the sun in Arizona seven months is all I got.",

Its super heavy duty and the straps on the bottom do a great job of keeping it in place. It cleans easily and looks really nice. Sits in a somewhat sunny spot and has not faded at all yet. Would definitely recommend.",

This is why I only gave it 3 stars. I expected it to last longer than a year and a half.",

Unless you will be keeping your grill cover indoors or out of the elements, it will be in the garbage in 12 months tops! Cover arrived with rusted insignia and loose stitching sticking out in multiple places. Not worth returning since the rust is probably inevitable and hanging strings in stitching does not seem to affect functionality. Otherwise this is a nice looking cover, made with seemingly durable fabric. (See updated review above and DO NOT BUY!)",

The additions of the side handle, draw string, and buckle helps to keep the cover from blowing off. The material is very heavy and thick and seems like it is much better then the original Weber grill cover. It recently rained and the water beaded well on the cover. Would definitely recommend over the Weber cover as this seems like it is much better quality and last longer then the vinyl material that Weber has used.",
