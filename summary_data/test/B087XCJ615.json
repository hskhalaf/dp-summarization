All the parts - all in good order/condition - well written instructions and parts manufactured to fit PROPERLY -- you simply couldn't ask for better. At the price point of 75% of what Lifetime sells for their Chinese made junk you are MUCH better off buying Brutus brand items.",

Assembly was easy and took 2 people about 3 hours just taking their time. The most challenging part was getting the set anchored. I'm very satisfied and will likely buy other play equipment made by this brand.",

Next day I figured it out and now that it\u2019s all done. The kids love it! Comes with most of the tools you need to assemble and the kids can enjoy it for many years.",

Attaching to the anchors was rather tricky but manageable. I believe they need to think about some better solution. We'll see how it survives. So far my kids 11and 6 very happy. Anchors is a must imho for kids older than 6 but still very sturdy.",

Makes it easier to move to mow the lawn. Highly recommend.",
