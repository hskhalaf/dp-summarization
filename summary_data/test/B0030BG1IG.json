IE if your grass is very overgrown or you want to only edge 2x a year it will be a decent amount of work with this, which can be nerve racking when the blade finally cuts through the bunched up sod. You'll likely have to go at it twice once at a higher level, given the price there are better products out there. My review does not reflect this, however as with some of the other reviews, mine also broke the first time I used it. The front wheel broke (not came off, broke).",

This has the potential to work, but I think it really needs a thinner blade to work optimally. Did OK along my sidewalk, but not so good along a flower bed that had overgrown somewhat. Might work OK to keep a freshly edged bed in shape, but don't expect it to work miracles if it's already ahead of you.",

When it does it vibrates harshly up the handle really bothering your hands even with gloves. Also, because of this, I would expect the blade to last long either. I went back to a new B&D edger.",

The power is there, and the extension cord really hasn't been an issue or as bothersome as I thought it would be. Also, i thought about getting an edger that uses a fiber instead of a blade.

The unit is fairly light and has no vibration. If you have a long driveway make sure you purchase a long ext. cord and KEEP the cord away from the blade. I would recommend this brand and the price on amazon was the clincher.",

So what if the cord is a little bit of an inconvenience but its no more of an inconvenience than going to the gas station, storing and mixing fuel, making a mess on string trimmer etc, etc. I leave the Lawn Edger at its deepest setting and it always cuts a clean, neat trench next to the sidewalk. It Does Not throw rocks and dirt backwards or far away in front as some might suggest. It will not replace a string trimmer for the jobs around trees so I will be ordering an electric Greenworks string trimmer soon..",

We'll say that again - our entire product line will never release an ounce of carbon emission into the air. 4 Year Warranty - Double The Industry Standard. When looking for lawn tools, we know you're thinking about quality. You're looking for something that will get the job done and get you back to your weekend. That's why GreenWorks backs every tool with a full four-year warranty - we know our products will perform at the highest level and always be reliable. GreenWorks high quality products are manufactured to last. That's why we back every product with a warranty that's twice the industry standard. We'll provide all the power you need without polluting the air or forcing you to keep hauling your gas can to the nearest station (especially in the middle of a mow). No more tune-ups or maintenance. No more emissions. Fifty-four million Americans mow their lawns every weekend, according to the EPA, using 800 million gallons of gas each year. Along the way, homeowners spill more than 17 million gallons of gas while refueling. That's equivalent to the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster. It's time to move beyond clumsy, harmful gas-powered mowers. It's time for GreenWorks to be your lawn tools for life.",
