On top of that, I found it at a major discount home goods type store for under $5.00. So, shame on me for the impulse buy. Sometimes, these deals aren't as good as they seem.",

There is not a smooth transition from the upper section to the lower section which causes dry goods to \"catch\" on the lip and not flow smoothly. Also, you can't really tell from the pictures but the lower section is folded in on itself which causes a restriction. I have tried to use this funnel to fill my peppermills with peppercorns and it fails miserably. It might work okay for liquids but not for dry ingredients.",

I especially like the fact that the filter piece can be easily removed when you only want it to act like a funnel. The only superfluous thing about this item is the loop on the outside, which is unnecessary. This is a very good purchase and an item that will stay in your kitchen for years to come!",
