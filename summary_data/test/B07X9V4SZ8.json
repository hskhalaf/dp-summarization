      "text": "I needed an affordable truck tent to travel to visit my family. This worked perfectly. The fabric is plenty tough enough and it fit very well even though I didn't remove my Tonneau cover. Easy to assemble and break-down but I did need assistance getting the rods into the pockets - two pair of hands helps a lot! I put in a twin size air mattress and a 3 inch foam topper and slept like a baby. It did not rain on my trip so I can't speak about performance in the bad weather, but the construction makes me believe that it would handle this well. I really like being up off the ground!",

Amazing truck bed tent that is easy to put together, sturdy in inclement weather (camped in it on Oct 27-29, 2019) and with a Mr.Heater Lil Buddy it stayed 72 degrees in the tent the whole time. This tent is well worth the money.",

      "text": "I bought it for our 2005 GMC 4x4 with a standard short bed, (6'5\") the tent fits pretty nice. The only thing is the tailgate end of the tent is wider than the tailgate and the tie down straps hang over the ends of the tailgate, so the tent door fit is a little loose. Other than that it fits real nice. The rain fly fits like a glove and should work real well. We haven't used it yet, other than just putting it in the truck at home. We plan on using it for Deer hunting. I gave it a 5 star rating for the price and ease of assembly.",

I drive an 04 tundra double cab, so i cant speak to fit with other trucks. Some others have better luck, seems like it works well with fords. Material is nice though, just wont work for what i needed",

Also, mine looked really good, better than the pictures on here surprisingly. One note, it does have built in flooring, so if you have a tools box, you'll have to put it in front of that; I don't believe the tent would function if you just cut out the bottom either. You could get creative though if you needed too with some 550 cord, or something, if you really wanted the flooring gone to put the tent over the tool box haha",

Ours was old and made for lots of tossing and turning. Also, my daughters wrapped the anchor straps which are metal in duct tape. I would recommend that so you do not have it clanking or chipping any paint as you set up.",
