Healthworks Maca Powder is certified organic, pure, all-natural, vegan, dairy-free and kosher. Our Maca Root Powder is raw to ensure maximum nutrient absorption. Used as a powerful nutritional staple by the Peruvians for thousands of years, Healthworks Peruvian Maca Powder contains Protein, Fiber, Vitamin C, B Vitamins, Calcium, Iron, Potassium, Copper, Manganese and Fatty Acids. Maca Powder is known to have a strong nutty or malty flavor, which can feel overwhelming at first. Like any new taste, it can take a little time to get comfortable with a new strong flavor. It is important to start out by using \u00bd teaspoon, and only increasing use if you feel comfortable. Healthworks Maca Powder can be added to your smoothies or juices, which can help soften the taste. The Maca Super Root Powder can also pair well with sweeter fruits to help ease the strong flavor. Great with smoothies/drinks, cereals, yogurt, oatmeal, energy balls, baked goods, cookies, ice-cream, trail mix, granola bars, coffee and snack foods. Healthworks Raw Organic Maca Super Root Powder also goes very well with Healthworks Cacao Powder, Chia Seeds, Cacao Nibs and Goji Berries. Ingredients: Lepidium Meyenii",
