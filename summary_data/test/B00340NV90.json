Nothing removed it so now I\u2019m basically faced with having to use a solvent which will destroy the upholstery. This is a great chair for a massage but don\u2019t buy it for tattooing.",

If you don't do it in this order the legs won't line up with the holes on the seat or the cross bars won't reach the leg bolts. It will save you a ton of frustration I promise! I wish the arms would lock into the seat but that is a minor issue. Overall I am quite pleased with it.",

      "text": "I'm only giving this chair 3 stars for two reasons: The directions are horrible! Not only are they tiny crapy pictures but in the directions some of the pieces are mixed up, so after I finally got the chair put together (which was not easy) the bottom and top halves didn't adjust properly. I had to take it apart and switch pieces around until it worked right. reason number two: I'm pretty sure I'm missing a piece and thats never a good thing.",
