It almost doesn't require powder over it. It does a decent job blocking my very light hyperpigmentation (PIH from former acne), and it hardly feels like anything. Absolutely love it.

      "text": "The makeup is awesome, but the color is difficult to match to my skin. The sales lady at Sephora store had warned me about that. The light is too light for me and the medium is to dark. The colors do not line up with their other makeup lines so it's a little tricky (I'm a Medium in their tinted moisturizer line). I mix the light with a powdered bronzer to get the right color for me. But the product is awesome! Has a nice light feel. Not to heavy but gives decent coverage. It is not gonna cover up major flaws, but nice for a day to day use.",

For me, I got it for the sunscreen and tinted primer aspect. I've had bad luck with primers before. But this has been a great primer. And I love the boost of moisture it gives my very dry skin. I'd buy all over again just for how long it extends my make up.",
