A little water and a paper towel removed it easily so based on how well made it was and how much of a hit it was at our wedding, it gets to keep a five star rating. Everyone thought it was super cute and it worked well for us. One small thing of note, we thought the bride had dirty blonde hair in the pic but its definitely brown in person. It didn't bother us much but may be a deal breaker for some bridezillas.",

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the picture frame is separate, it comes with it but it isn't actually held on by anything at all which I thought was pretty odd but the hands kind of hold it up. With a little super glue this was worth the money. The same exact one on davids bridal was $40.00. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to save some money!",

We will be married soon and I know everyone will love it as much as we do. Just wish I looked like the bride.",
