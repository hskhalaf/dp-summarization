However, my 3 year old has zero issues with these. Thank you for giving us this option! We highly recommend to other parents looking for a vitamin for their children that refuse liquid, gummies, chewable and flavored powders. For reference, we give this to our 3 year old.",

I ordered 2 bottles (came in 2 separate boxes of equal size and packaging and fit the contents of both inside 1 bottle with over half of the bottle still empty. The ridiculous amount of packaging alone makes me not purchase again. The ingredients are good, but the quantity of actual vitamins in each serving is too little. 33% of the RDA of Vitamin C, for example. It's also not chewable. It doesn't claim to be, but I assumed being a children's vitamin that it would be, in some way, easy to administer to children.",

      "text": "My daughter is 10 yrs old petite. She's so tiny that she still wears size 7-8 in clothing. This is her 2nd bottle and I've noticed the difference in her appetite. I feel that this is the perfect vitamins as we have tried different ones. Cons: its a little too big compare to the other vitamins but my daughter got used to it.",

      "text": "Small enough for my 4 year old to swallow I had her swallow a small piece of food first since she practically inhales food things anyway. She then was able to swallow the pill on the first try! My 6 and 8 year old had no problem as they have been swallowing lactose pills for quite awhile. I love that these pill are not full of junk or sugar like normal kid ones. My kids love them too and talk about getting long hair! Win win!!",
