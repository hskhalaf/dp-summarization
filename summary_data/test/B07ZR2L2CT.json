The dual screen i think is great just not much support for it app wise. However this phone is worth it with or without the 2nd screen. Its light, slim and has a good battery life. I haven't had a single issue with the fingerprint scanner and the sd card has a drawer it doesnt go under the battery. Im so impressed that i am currently looking to replace some of the appliances in my house with LG.",

I have just recently lost mine and will be purchasing it from LG. The dongle is strong so it is harder to pull out. But, if you lift it up or to the side the magnets are useless. It needs to be better. I rate this 1 star less because of the charging dongle. It can definitely be improve on.",

When I go outside to feed my chickens or mow my yard I don't lose wifi. I don't constantly lose connection, like I did with all my other phones.
