The black light is bright and the unit is silent. Works well without any additional noises for operation.I have it set on the table, that turns it on from 8:30 PM until 1:00 AM and I mounted it on the corner of my deck. For only 4 1/2 hrs, I got a lot of mosquito carcasses in that little box. Then, I clean them with a small brush. Don't hesitate to buy this. This bug zapper is a must!",
