He is very happy with the amount of food he can put into this lunch box. He uses the top mostly for things that he doesn't want to get crushed and uses the bottom for heavier items like cans, bottles, and tupperware containers. Plenty of room for ice packs as well. The blue is just like in the photo. It is a very well made lunch box and will last him a long time.",

I ended up going with the 9 can Cooler by Coleman that not only fit more than this one did in spite of smaller dimensions but the strap is stitched into the actual product and is much more solid.",

The bottom one can hold containers with a flat bottom. I wish that was the bigger of the two compartments but it\u2019ll do for the time being. If you are looking for a lunch box that can hold juices or bottles upright then this will not work for you. Bottles have to be laid flat which I usually don\u2019t like because they are more prone to leakage that way. If you aren\u2019t looking for that feature then it\u2019s a decent lunch box.",
