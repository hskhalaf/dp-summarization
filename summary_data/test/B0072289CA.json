I also added a surfactant (liquid soap) for treatments 3 and 4. I have used similar products with the same active ingredient in the past successfully. I don\u2019t know what the issue could be other than a dilution problem on their end. Dandelions start to wilt in 5 days or so, and then recover and are happy to go to seed. There has been no rain in my area during this treatment time. I don\u2019t know what the issue could be, but I cannot recommend this product.",

I then knew I was thinking correctly, that I needed a professional lawn treatment person to treat my lawn with a 2-4 D herbacide. I also need to have dicamba in the herbacide's mixture so it kills creeping charlie (ground ivy). That requirement was a big reason I should not keep your product.",
