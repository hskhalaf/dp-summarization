He told me that I might like the v7 and he wasn\u2019t wrong. I am in my 60s, weigh 215, and walk briskly every morning (5k in 45 minutes). These shoes are more supportive and comfortable than my ASICS. As a result, I purchased another pair and might get a third with wild colors just for grins. I guess that an old dog can learn a new trick or two; I\u2019m now a NB guy!",
