I thought I would take better care of them more as they seemed prettier and like I\u2019d want to take good care of them. I am SO impressed. The sound quality, never have problems with the microphone (I\u2019m on conference calls a lot of the day), battery has never been an issue and have had zero connection problems (iPhone XR). What surprised me most is the fit of these! They are extremely comfortable, I often forget they are in my ears and they NEVER fall out like my apple ones did (RIP EarPod #3 to subway track). Going to take very good care of these babies.",

So dont listen to badly engineered songs then blame the earphones. These aren\u2019t going to hide flaws like lesser headphones can do. Also fit in your ears directly effects the tonal balance. So take time to find the right wings and tips for your ears. The sound should be natural and a little warm with taught bass. Take the time to set them up properly before you judge. Took a couple listening sessions and adjustments for me to get that wow moment.",

Long lasting battery life and really easy indicators to show when they need a charge. Overall they are far superior to similar products and I would definitely recommend.",
