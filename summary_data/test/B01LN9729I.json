The extra hooks always come in handy, the leader lines are perfect for when you want to catch a gar or any toothy fishy, not to mention the lures are brightly colored and appealing to the eye. However one thing I didn't like is exactly that, there are slightly too many bright colored lures. This kit would be spot on if it contained some darker colored lures personally. Really giving it 4.5 stars only because it could use 1 or 2 darker colored lures.",
