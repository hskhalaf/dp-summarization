      "title": "over priced, wires way to short",
      "text": "everytime you take headset up to see the real world the earplugs fall out. For a safety reason I would not use these alone in a house. They really do block everything out. So no vision or hearing is a big no no. The wires SHOULD be thicker and a few centimeters longer. Shame Headset didn't come with standard headphone jack as even pound land headphones have the same cheap wires as these. Unless you REALLY want total immersion best to stick to the over head ones that came with the headset. Much comfier and dont take ages to keep refitting to your ears. The sound quality is acceptable.. Sounds same as most \u00a320 plus headphones nothing exciting",

      "text": "These are a great addition to the Oculus Rift headset. I mainly got them because they block out all external sound - they do an excellent job. The sound quality is great for earphones but don't expect the same quality as from full over ear cans. The experience is much more immersive and they don't leak too much sound. Really easy to install using the tool provided (the tool also comes in the oculus box). Overall, although a bit pricey, definitely recommended if you don't want to hear any outside noise while playing games/watching movies and want a more immersive experience!",

However, put these on and it\u2019s a whole new experience. The outside world completely disappears and all that\u2019s left is you in your virtual world. The sound quality is very very good too. I use the middle size buds and they are so comfortable. Totally recommend these to anyone who loves their Rift. Well worth the money!",

      "text": "I've had these headphones for 3 months now and the sound quality to me is great - I'm no audiophile though so look for another review if you care more about that. They are able to muffle external sound and for me that was a necessity. I wasn't able to fully feel immersed and thought I'd try these headphones and they've worked perfectly. I still never feel fully immersed like some people can be (usually in videos) but it's much better than before. As a side note, they are incredibly comfy and I forget they're in my ears for the most part.",
