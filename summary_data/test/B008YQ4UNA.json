Magnetic crystals are from amazon and used little magnetic jewelry claw clasp I also found on amazon to hang the crystals. Same with a package of 10 battery operated candles with remote",

I realize the only way that I will be successful in getting all of these straight is to heat the metal and re-work it. I have not had the time to do so yet.",

I purchased candles locally and since it didn't sit well on the chandelier, I attached foam tape around the candle, and it worked perfectly. Also, it was spray painted black and looks so beautiful! The item was shipped to a military overseas address and I had to pay extra to the vendor. I'm very satisfied so that was still worth it.",
