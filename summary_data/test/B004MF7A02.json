      "text": "ound quality is decent but the 3d effect is virtually non-existent. I have in the past year started to have major wiring issues with the speaker. This is probably due in part to the fact that I move the speaker around a lot (I have this setup in my kitchen but will move the speaker around the deck door outside) so now it keeps cutting in and out of 1 or 2 speakers playing in the bar which is mostly annoying due to the volume changes and lack of sound consistency. That being said, the bass is pretty excellent overall i would say save a little extra $$ and buy yourself a real system.",

Adjusting the base, treble, and subwoofer are easy. I did have some difficulty with the set up in order to make the Bravia Sync work properly but once the right connections were made, it was great. For anyone looking for a rather easy system to use for a small room like a den, etc., this system is just right. The 3d surround sound is not at all bad and when used with the subwoofer, very good considering the cost.",

The design was well done (it all flows together, very square, hard lined elements in a matte black finish), the sound was sub-par because the subwoofer stopped working (we don't know exactly when). The subwoofer is also very large, but again, the design is nice enough that it isn't terrible to place under something, but it's cumbersome. Especially when re-arranging. I would not repurchase or recommend this, but I do not regret purchasing it as a first-sound bar.",

The sound reproduction is good/really good, and the sub woofer can put out some bass. Disaster movies, Action moviesall are more enjoyable by bringing some of that low vibrating bass. And since it syncs with my Sony KDL TV, the volume is easy to change and I can run my chromecast straight from the back HDMI. I also like how if I only want to use the TV speakers I can, as it has an HDMI pass through. This has been a solid addition to my entertainment set up.",

Well, thankfully I can say that the Sony speaker system has been an excellent addition to my living room entertainment center. I was looking for a low-profile speaker bar with wireless sub-woofer, and this system seemed to best fit that criteria. Setup was extremely simple (took more time to unpack than to set up) and the speakers look great! The sound it unbelievably crisp and the base is great. I placed the subwoofer in the back of the room which seems counter to many of the recommendations, but I'm more than pleased with it. I HIGHLY recommend this system!",

When I set everything up and turned it on for the first time, I was blown away at the sound quality and clarity I was hearing. Even at full volume, the clarity was incredible. The wireless subwoofer sounds great and looks great. Extremely easy set up to any tv, especially if you have a Sony Bravia tv or other Sony devices (I.E. Blue ray player, Playstation) I would recommend this sound bar to anyone who wants that high quality sound that won't leave a hole in your wallet",

We got a good deal and the product came in earlier than expected. Thank you Stephen and thank you Amazon.",

The way the sound bar is set-up all HD cables go through the sound bar and it acts as a switch. I am unsure if this is a problem with our cable box or the sound bar itself but it can sometimes be annoying. However, it's a great value for the price and I would recommend it.",

It took me maybe 15 minutes to read through forums and setup the best-sounding configuration to my liking.
