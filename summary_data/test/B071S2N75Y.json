Runners and casual shoe enthusiasts alike were even appreciative of its apparently high-quality construction, as well as the relatively inexpensive price. On the other hand, there were those who thought that it was narrow while some had complaints about the construction of the underfoot platform. Nevertheless, the Sequent 3 was deemed a worthy successor to a relatively fresh yet well-regarded series.",

        "The design of the Nike Air Max Sequent 3 appealed to many consumers who wanted style and functionality in a single package",

Unfortunately for me, it was a full size too small. Had to return it, but it was not available in 11 from anyone on Amazon. Had to get it elsewhere. Luckily for me, I found it for slightly less plus free shipping! Once I received an 11, the shoe fit perfectly, is very comfortable, and i love the look of it. Shoe is also very lightweight. Four stars for the look, feel, and design, but am deducting one star because they are so much smaller than what is expected.",

Each pair I\u2019ve had did this and I only wore them for walking, no running or training. It\u2019s a shame because they look great and the cushioning is great... for a month until the air pocket busts.",
