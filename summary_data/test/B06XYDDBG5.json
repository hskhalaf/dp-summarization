My rat is now on an antibiotic and I have to bath her with anti-itch shampoo once a week. (Until better). My other rat loved it and had no issues. I'm not 100% sure if the main source of protein was soy, but that is a very common allergy. Still think it's a great food. Just a friendly warning.",

I am a vegetarian myself, but don\u2019t wish for my beliefs to interfere with their health, values and natural instincts. Rats enjoy a chicken bone to chow, every now and then!",
