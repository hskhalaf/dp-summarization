He will spend between 10-30 minutes playing with it until we need to do something else (a nice little break). We have had it for a couple of months now and it is well built, sturdy, has smooth surfaces and really seems to entertain an infant. The ability to change from musical tunes to sounds is nice (there are 3 keys on the keyboard for the baby to strike). This will probably be a great toy until the baby starts cruising or walking but the quality is nice enough that future babies should enjoy it also.",

The only issue I have with it is it won't stay locked in place. My baby got a little taller so I moved the side pieces up a notch, and no matter how many times I do it and make sure they're \"locked\", after a little while of him playing and moving around in it they slip back down to the bottom notch. It definitely brings the safety value down on this toy.",

Overall pretty pleased.",
