We set ours up in a hard to reach place and I have to 'reset' them at least once a week. I don't blame the lights, I think it has to do with my WiFi router. I wish they were longer and cost a bit less, but these are top of the line LEDs. I'll likely be picking up 4 more for the kitchen over/under counter lights.",

I have a master degree in network engineering and tried everything possible to get these lights to stay connected to my network but they refused to stay connected. They dropped randomly very few minutes. Great when they worked but completely not worth it. Too bad because the brightness and colors were exceptional but come on they have to stay connected or they are worthless. I\u2019d give them zero stars but that\u2019s not an option. Back on the hunt for a strip I can use with my SmartThings network.",

Apparently it is a general issue with a number of units. Asked for a refund and have not heard back from them. Also the app and connecting to the unit was pretty flaky. I was hoping to connect multiple units but after the issues with this and their slow tech support I have decided to go back to Philips Hue.",

      "text": "This is most definitely the best light strip I've seen, and is way brighter than even the hue strips that I was envious of previously. But what really wowed me, was the light pattern theme mode (where each zones in the strip lights up a different colour). Plus being able to \"paint\" the wall with the app is unexpectly fun and useful. I was quite on the fence about this, but after watching a youtube review of LIFX Z by Amanda Woolsey, I decided to take the plunge. Haven't regretted it so far. I do wish they implement some sort of animation soon. This would really work well on a Christmas tree if it did.",
