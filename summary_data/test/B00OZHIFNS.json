You'll have occasional issues mounting it (usually to get right height); the clip wants objects like ladder sides and frame lumber, not so much finished door jambs or thick furniture. Do yourself a favor and get a standard camera tripod, 60\" or more if you can find one. The unit mounts to it just like a camera would.",

It's not a mode issue or anything that their troubleshooting helped with. The horizontal laser is simply broken. The extended warranty was such a hassle I gave up even trying and just trashed the thing.",

The laser line can wash out if you have too much light in the room. I often work with a very bright LED work light in rooms I am remodeling and I ended up turning off the LED work light when using this laser. Good product for the money.",

I am very impressed with this little unit's accuracy, ease of use, durability, and battery life. The red/green level indicator light is great. If the light\u200b is green, the beam is level. If the light is read, you simply \"eyeball\" the unit until you get a green light. Really fast and really easy to use. My only complaint is one that I think is common to all laser devices: The beam widens out, and is over 1/8\" wide at 30'.",

I still haven't bought one but it is very tedious to adjust the height of the level line by stacking up objects of varying thickness!",

    "description": "The HAMMERHEAD Compact Self-Leveling Cross Line Laser with Adjustable Mounting Clamp projects bright horizontal, vertical or cross lines onto flat surfaces with the accuracy of \u00b11/4 inch at 30 feet. The unit will self-level when positioned within 4 degrees of level; an LED indicator turns red when the unit is positioned outside of the self-leveling range. In the lock (manual) mode, the cross line laser can be positioned to project lines that are not level or plumb for projects that require them. The included adjustable mounting clamp easily attaches to a variety of surfaces to extend the utility of the tool. The cross line laser may also be mounted on any 1/4\" threaded tripod screw. Kit includes: (1) Compact Self-Leveling Cross Line Laser, (1) Adjustable Mounting Clamp and (2) AA Batteries",
