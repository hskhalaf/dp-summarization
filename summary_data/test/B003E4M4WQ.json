This product was supposed to be brand new and looked brand new, but I wonder if it was reconditioned. If it was not a reconditioned item (which I took care NOT to order), it was grossly defective. I can't believe other people have given this DVD player such a high rating, but perhaps they eventually found out there was something wrong with it--as I did only a few hours after first use.",

The buttons are set up in the most illogical, least intuitive way possible. Unless the designer set out to manufacture the world's worst remote control, it's a major failure. A testament to being able to see and touch something prior to buying it.",

The buttons on the remote are super tiny, there's like a hundred of them. Even with my glasses I can't see them. It comes with one page of instructions printed too small to read. Let me count the ways this thing sucks. Bye... returning this garbage",
