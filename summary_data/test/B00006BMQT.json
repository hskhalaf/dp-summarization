Bought these based on reading Amazon reviews and not wanting to pay at least twice as much for Bose. They speakers are fantastic, sound like a dream. Very easy to install once you plot out where to locate them. I had the advantage of an attic space above my great room to ensure there were no obstructions in my preferred locations, so I was able to do a self install project. Turned out beautifully! I HIGHLY recommend these speakers.",

I've owned Polk bookshelf speakers and I love the sound of them. Very crisp/clear highs. So I bought these w/o listening to them first. My assumptions were correct that Polk puts quality in all their speakers big and small. These were easy to install and they sound fantastic. Perfect highs and mids, and a decent amount of bass from a small speaker. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",

These speakers can't replicate the sound quality of bookshelf speakers or freestanding monitors, but that's not really what these are for. Low end frequencies are missing, because it's not a subwoofer. It's great for in-home casual audio solutions. Listening to music in the kitchen, bathroom, or garage is a great use for these speakers. I would not suggest installing them in a home theater setup, you'll need to spend a lot more to get speakers up to that task.",

It sounds worse than the Logitech Z130 computer speaker. I did not know this speaker came out over 10 years ago when I bought it. Don't buy this for ATMOS. The dispersion is weak, you have to be directly under the speaker. There is no way it meets the 45 degrees recommended by Dolby.",

Go a little bigger than the template, if you ask me, that way the speaker will go in the first time. Grinding off 1/8\" extra drywall is a mess you don't want. Once the speakers are in and covered, they really do disappear, except when the stereo is playing. That's when they make their presence known. These speakers clamp down on the drywall just like the wall speakers do, so aside from the speaker hole, they don't do anything to your drywall. It's a clever system.",

I've installed almost a 100 of these in various projects (including my own home) and have not had one bad one or had to replace one. Unlike Bose units, these speakers disappear into the ceiling and use actual speaker surface area to make sounds natually without tricks from a single bass unit. These are great for music and movies.",

    "title": "Polk Audio RC80i 2-way Premium In-Ceiling 8\" Round Speakers, Set of 2 Perfect for Damp and Humid Indoor/Outdoor Placement - Bath, Kitchen, Covered Porches (White, Paintable Grille)",
    "description": "Size:RC80i, 8 Inch| Style:Set of 2RCi Series In-Wall Speakers deliver incredible Polk sound to every room in your home without using any floor or shelf space! Now you have new options for more flexibility and performance from Polk Audio. Out of the box and into the wall (or ceiling), that\u2019s how easy it is to install new Polk Audio RCi Series In-ceiling Loudspeakers like the RC80i. Dynamic Balance drivers and aimable tweeters ensure spacious imaging with amazing clarity as well as a well-balanced sound in any listening position, not just a small \"sweet spot.\" Paint them to match your decor and they practically disappear, leaving you with nothing but high-performance sound! Installation is easy as 1-2-3: cut one hole, feed the wires, and simply drop the speaker in. Rotating Cams secure the speaker safely with no extra assembly or mess. Klippel motor optimization uses laser measurement technology to ensure a smooth excursion path at either end of the volume spectrum for uniform performance at both low and high volumes.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe Polk Audio RC80i 2-way In-ceiling Speaker delivers incredible stereo sound to any room in your home from speakers you can barely see, without using any floor or shelf space. The RC80i is easy to install, requiring only that you cut a hole, feed the wires through, and simply drop the speaker in where it is held in place by rotating cams that safely secure the speaker with no extra assembly or mess. Once installed, the paintable grille and flange allows this in-ceiling speaker to virtually disappear in the room.\n\nPolk Audio RC80i in-ceiling speakers in white. The Polk RC80i utilizes a eight-inch dynamic-balance, mineral filled polymer-composite cone with a rubber surround that outlasts cheaper foam surrounds, as well as a one-inch ring-radiator tweeter with a 15-degree swivel mount. The swivel-mounted tweeter is aimable for direct high frequency control that ensures spacious imaging with amazing clarity, and well-balanced sound in any listening position, even off-axis listening positions, rather than in just a small sweet spot. \n\nConstructed of rust resistant hardware and durable, moisture resistant materials, the RC80i is safe for use in bathrooms, kitchens, saunas, or even under outdoor eaves, and a glass-filled composite baffle that provides a dense, acoustically inert platform for the speaker's high end components. This unit features strong composite driver baskets that keep moving parts in rigid alignment, a wide-dispersion design for even sound-coverage throughout even large rooms, and a wall-distance toggle switch that flattens frequency response when installation requires placement near a corner or adjacent wall. The RC80i also features a tweeter-level switch that lets you tailor the highs for your room acoustics, and is timbre-matched to the Polk Audio Monitor Series for seamless, enveloping imaging when used in a home theater system.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nRC80i speakers (pair), 2 grilles, 2 cardboard templates with paint masks, owner's manual, and registration card. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe RC80i features a beefy 8-inch woofer to produce the maximum amount of bass and a one inch dome tweeter for depth and detail, resulting in rich lifelike sound from an in-ceiling speaker\u2014performance unheard of just a few years ago. An ideal solution for areas requiring big, room-filing sound without the big speaker cluttering up your room, The RC80i's wide dispersion capability means you'll hear great sound no matter where you are in the room.\n\nkey features\n\n * Paintable grilles allow you to make your speakers disappear completely into your painted walls (but you can always leave them white too).\n * Out of the box into the ceiling installation. The RC80i uses rugged stainless steel hardware and powder-coated aluminum grille for years of dependable performance. (Please note that RCi Series loudspeakers are not suitable for exposed outdoor use. For outdoor applications, use our Atrium Series speakers).\n *  Swivel tweeter. The RC80i features a swiveling tweeter so you can aim it toward the listening area for greater accuracy.\n\ntake a look inside this product \n\n\n\ntechnology \n\nDynamic Balance\u00ae and Klippel Optimization Like all Polk speakers, the transducers in the RC80i speakers are products of Dynamic Balance technology and Klippel Optimization. A Dynamic Balance tweeter or driver has been designed using microscopic testing, materials science, and precision-designed interfaces to reduce or eliminate mechanical breakup that adds distortion and colors the sound. Klippel Optimization ensures the speaker will perform well at both low and high volumes levels.\n\nBlue Polymer Woofers with Rubber Surround Provide excellent damping and bass response while resisting deterioration. Your RCi speakers should last longer than your house. Other speakers use flimsy paper cones and foam surrounds that fall apart due to time and exposure.\n\nTimbre Matched The RC80i, like all RCi series speakers, is timbre matched to our freestanding speakers - such as Polk Monitor, TSi and OWM series, just in case you need in-ceiling surround speakers to match your freestanding fronts.\n\nwhy you should consider this product\n\nIf you're looking to fill a room or your home with life-like sound, you should seriously consider the RC80i for its high performance audio, ease of installation, and amazing value. Use RC80i's all around your home where you care about good sound or as rear channel surround speakers in your home theater system.\n\ntechnical specifications\n\nDriver Complements Tweeter 1\" Diameter (2.54cm) \nDynamic Balance tweeter with metalized \nsoft dome in ball-and-socket swivel mount Mid/Woofer 8\" Diameter (20.32cm) \nDynamic Balance driver with mineral-filled \npolymer cone and rubber surround Electrical Total Frequency Response 35Hz - 20kHz Upper -3dB Limit 20Hz Lower -3dB Limit 50Hz Nominal Impedance 8 ohms Efficiency 90 dB Recommended Amplifier Power 20 - 100 Watts per channel Inputs Spring-loaded clips Dimensions Overall Depth 3 5/8\" (9.21cm) Overall Diameter 10 3/4\" (27.30cm) Shipping Unit of Measure Pair Total Shipping Weight 10 pounds Installation Cut-Out Diameter 9 3/8\" (23.81cm) Mounting Depth (assumes 1/2 in) 3 1/8\" (7.94cm) Pre-Construction Bracket PB LC80i Warranty* Speaker Warranty Lifetime *To ensure a valid warranty, Polk loudspeakers must be purchased through an Authorized Polk Audio home or car loudspeaker Dealer (such as Amazon.com).

McMillan4.0 out of 5 stars Very happy, they need a little break-in to sound their bestReviewed in the United States on July 19, 2018Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase Kind of surprised they live up to the hype. I'm an 'audiophile' but also I have realistic expectations for outdoor wall-mounted speakers. I bought these to mount on my covered patio, high on a wall.\nFor outdoor in-wall/in-ceiling speakers in a non-ideal location, these sound very nice. Relaxed and smooth midrange and good bass. At first listen they were 'just ok', kind of hard and muffled sounding, but they broke in after a day of playing at a moderately loud volume and opened up a bit.. which is typical .. but it was still a little unexpected for me.\nSo, give 'em a good crank and let them play for a day or 2 before you evaluate them critically.\nI don't understand why you'd use a spring-clip speaker input for these. Simple spades would be better. I prefer to solder something going in a ceiling or wall... spring clips are for good if you disconnect/reconnect more often... and also makes it impossible to weather seal. Minus 1 star for the stupid spring clip terminals.Read more 35 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse VJS5.0 out of 5 stars Still sounds good after 10 year.Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2017Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase Still cranking out music and movies over the last 10 years.

Bought these based on reading Amazon reviews and not wanting to pay at least twice as much for Bose. They speakers are fantastic, sound like a dream. Very easy to install once you plot out where to locate them. I had the advantage of an attic space above my great room to ensure there were no obstructions in my preferred locations, so I was able to do a self install project. Turned out beautifully! I HIGHLY recommend these speakers.Read more 27 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Marko5.0 out of 5 stars Great value for the money.Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2016Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase Ask any audiophile what kind of ceiling speaker you should get and they will say, \"don't get ceiling speakers, dumb a%#,\"\nI love music and like surround sound and these things serve their purpose. These are great for most of us human beings and look better than a bunch of four foot tall black boxes in our living rooms.\n\nInstallation was relatively easy. The manual suggests sticking a cork screw in the middle of the speaker grille to remove it, so I did. Ruined that grille in the process by warping the hole I pulled on. The best way to remove grille is to slightly lift (with corkscrew) on the very edge hole and then rotate, pick another hole and lift some more (like opening a can of paint, but slowly).\n\nI called Polk to get a new grille to replace the one I ruined expecting to pay a few bucks but they sent me one for free!Read more 72 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse MG5.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding in ceiling speakers!Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2018Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase When our house was built, we had it pre-wired for ceiling speakers. We just didnt have the builder over charge us to install cheap speakers. I've owned Polk bookshelf speakers and I love the sound of them. Very crisp/clear highs. So I bought these w/o listening to them first. My assumptions were correct that Polk puts quality in all their speakers big and small. These were easy to install and they sound fantastic. Perfect highs and mids, and a decent amount of bass from a small speaker. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.Read more 12 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Anthony Jonas4.0 out of 5 stars High quality speakers for ambient musicReviewed in the United States on January 21, 2019Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase Installed these in the kitchen. They were well packaged, easy to install, and have durable construction. The aimable tweeter is a nice feature. These speakers can't replicate the sound quality of bookshelf speakers or freestanding monitors, but that's not really what these are for. Low end frequencies are missing, because it's not a subwoofer. It's great for in-home casual audio solutions. Listening to music in the kitchen, bathroom, or garage is a great use for these speakers. I would not suggest installing them in a home theater setup, you'll need to spend a lot more to get speakers up to that task.Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse VP1.0 out of 5 stars Sounds worse than the Echo DotReviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase I used Yamaha Rx-A880 to power it for Zone 2 to listen to music in the kitchen. It sounds muddy. I though something was wrong the receiver zone 2, so I connected it to the old Denon 3805 receiver. It still sounds terrible even with the help of the BSR-3000 graphic equalizer. It sounds worse than the Logitech Z130 computer speaker.\nI did not know this speaker came out over 10 years ago when I bought it. Don't buy this for ATMOS. The dispersion is weak, you have to be directly under the speaker. There is no way it meets the 45 degrees recommended by Dolby.Read more 5 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Temper1.0 out of 5 stars Product is confusing AND IT NOT RETURNABLE!Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2019Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase This product is not returnable.

They really blend in and are easy to install....but you need to be mindful. When cutting the hole you must keep your drywall knife on the line and never go inside the line as this will make it more difficult to insert the speaker. You will have to shave the area you went inside and that crumbles the drywall a bit. Now....when tightening the speaker to your ceiling I highly recommend doind it manually. When you start tightening there will be some tension because the clamps are turning outward and rubbing the post. Then you will feel almost no tension when tightening. As soon as you feel tension, you know you have reached the drywall and you should only turn the screwdriver one and have more times. Once you have them mounted, play some loud music through them and watch to see if any gaps open up. If so simply tighten the side that the gap was noticed...remember not too tight. I really like thes speakers and the price was right.Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Incredibly happy with the mids and highs this speaker reproduces.\n\nI happen to have a single Klipsch R-2800-CSM II installed in another room. The Klipsch sounds much better than the Polk given the better low frequency response.\n\nYou\u2019ll probably want to install a subwoofer to fill the RC80\u2019s out, but if you don\u2019t have the space look at the Klipsch R-2800-CSM II\n\nRecommended use: ceiling speakers on 7.x or ATMOS setup.Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

I am a great fan of movies and music so I wanted the best sound system thus I ordered the 8 inch speaker. I was exited to set this up and use it with my family but after watching the first movie with very decent sound quality I couldn't help but notice all the screws on my ceiling drive wall were being pushed through the paint and covering chalk. Even tho I did my best to secure my ceiling as I knew there would be a speaker going on to vibrate it, but the 8 inch was stilling damaging my ceiling. I decide to contact the company to at least exchange my few un-open speakers with smaller ones but they were not willing to help. This left me disappointed as I was left with 6 unusable 170$ speakers and a damaged celling.Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote. Please try again Report abuse Amazon Customer5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound in an easy-to-install packageReviewed in Canada on October 28, 2019Size: RC80i, 8 InchStyle: Set of 2Verified Purchase I bought these speakers to add two height channels to my 9.2 Onkyo system and they did not disappoint. It's always tough to purchase something like a speaker without a a sound check and a good listen. Since my front towers were Polk, I thought I'd take a chance on these, for a tonal match.\n\nThese 8\" Polk speakers pack a decent sound into a solidly built package. The circuitry and magnets provide some heft to each unit. The aim-able tweeter is a nice touch, especially in a ceiling mount for a Dolby Atmos setup. When I did the Onkyo automated audio setup with microphone, it chose a cutoff point of 80Hz for these units, so they can handle some bass. Then price on Amazon was the same in CDN as the 6\" Polk SC60i at the local Best Buy.\n\nIn my opinion, these are a great combo for added height channels in a home theatre. Installation was very easy and the tabs that hold the speakers to the ceiling (or wall) tighten easily and hold these speakers securely.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

These have great tone. The adjustable directional tweeter is excellent to fine tune for your primary sitting areas. Bought these just in time for Superbowl..... AWESOME! My son was amazed by how well the sound fills the room. Watching our favourite movies has taken on a whole new dimension. One thing I did was create a box out with roxul insulation in the joist space. It helps with sound loss and transfer to the room above. The only thing I may say is that I could have gone with the 6's instead of the 8's for my intended purpose, room is approx 15' x 25'.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Out of the box and into the wall (or ceiling), that\u2019s how easy it is to install new Polk Audio RCi Series In-ceiling Loudspeakers like the RC80i.

Klippel motor optimization uses laser measurement technology to ensure a smooth excursion path at either end of the volume spectrum for uniform performance at both low and high volumes.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe Polk Audio RC80i 2-way In-ceiling Speaker delivers incredible stereo sound to any room in your home from speakers you can barely see, without using any floor or shelf space. The RC80i is easy to install, requiring only that you cut a hole, feed the wires through, and simply drop the speaker in where it is held in place by rotating cams that safely secure the speaker with no extra assembly or mess. Once installed, the paintable grille and flange allows this in-ceiling speaker to virtually disappear in the room.\n\nPolk Audio RC80i in-ceiling speakers in white. The Polk RC80i utilizes a eight-inch dynamic-balance, mineral filled polymer-composite cone with a rubber surround that outlasts cheaper foam surrounds, as well as a one-inch ring-radiator tweeter with a 15-degree swivel mount. The swivel-mounted tweeter is aimable for direct high frequency control that ensures spacious imaging with amazing clarity, and well-balanced sound in any listening position, even off-axis listening positions, rather than in just a small sweet spot. \n\nConstructed of rust resistant hardware and durable, moisture resistant materials, the RC80i is safe for use in bathrooms, kitchens, saunas, or even under outdoor eaves, and a glass-filled composite baffle that provides a dense, acoustically inert platform for the speaker's high end components. This unit features strong composite driver baskets that keep moving parts in rigid alignment, a wide-dispersion design for even sound-coverage throughout even large rooms, and a wall-distance toggle switch that flattens frequency response when installation requires placement near a corner or adjacent wall. The RC80i also features a tweeter-level switch that lets you tailor the highs for your room acoustics, and is timbre-matched to the Polk Audio Monitor Series for seamless, enveloping imaging when used in a home theater system.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nRC80i speakers (pair), 2 grilles, 2 cardboard templates with paint masks, owner's manual, and registration card. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe RC80i features a beefy 8-inch woofer to produce the maximum amount of bass and a one inch dome tweeter for depth and detail, resulting in rich lifelike sound from an in-ceiling speaker\u2014performance unheard of just a few years ago. An ideal solution for areas requiring big, room-filing sound without the big speaker cluttering up your room, The RC80i's wide dispersion capability means you'll hear great sound no matter where you are in the room.\n\nkey features\n\n * Paintable grilles allow you to make your speakers disappear completely into your painted walls (but you can always leave them white too).\n * Out of the box into the ceiling installation. The RC80i uses rugged stainless steel hardware and powder-coated aluminum grille for years of dependable performance. (Please note that RCi Series loudspeakers are not suitable for exposed outdoor use. For outdoor applications, use our Atrium Series speakers).\n *  Swivel tweeter. The RC80i features a swiveling tweeter so you can aim it toward the listening area for greater accuracy.\n\ntake a look inside this product \n\n\n\ntechnology \n\nDynamic Balance\u00ae and Klippel Optimization Like all Polk speakers, the transducers in the RC80i speakers are products of Dynamic Balance technology and Klippel Optimization. A Dynamic Balance tweeter or driver has been designed using microscopic testing, materials science, and precision-designed interfaces to reduce or eliminate mechanical breakup that adds distortion and colors the sound. Klippel Optimization ensures the speaker will perform well at both low and high volumes levels.\n\nBlue Polymer Woofers with Rubber Surround Provide excellent damping and bass response while resisting deterioration. Your RCi speakers should last longer than your house. Other speakers use flimsy paper cones and foam surrounds that fall apart due to time and exposure.\n\nTimbre Matched The RC80i, like all RCi series speakers, is timbre matched to our freestanding speakers - such as Polk Monitor, TSi and OWM series, just in case you need in-ceiling surround speakers to match your freestanding fronts.\n\nwhy you should consider this product\n\nIf you're looking to fill a room or your home with life-like sound, you should seriously consider the RC80i for its high performance audio, ease of installation, and amazing value.
