      "text": "Buyer beware - It crashed my computer! It's possible that the latest Windows update made it not compatible, but I installed the driver and it crashed my computer. I ended up having to wipe the whole thing and reinstall Windows. Upon further investigation I found several mentions that it does not work with Windows 10 - possibly due to the BIOS. I also found on the AOC website, in their instructions, it includes all kinds of Windows versions, but not Windows 10. I'm not super computer saavy, so I stupidly assumed that they would have made it compatible with Windows 10 by now.",

You can't turn the monitor upside-down in landscape mode, but in portrait you can adjust the angle so it looks good. The side angle doesn't seem to have this problem.",

The monitor worked well the first two days after travel to the location, but by day three it stopped functioning as if it it had been dropped (it wasn't). I plan to cuntsct the manufacturer because I would expect a portable monitor such as this to be tough enough to withstand a short business trip.",
