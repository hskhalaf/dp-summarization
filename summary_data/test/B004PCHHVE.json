Added drinks and large bag of ice; Party started Saturday 3pm, today is Monday 7:30pm, and it's still frozen! There's a large 2\" thick layer of ice and the bricks are still cool. Pretty remarkable with 80 degree weather here in sunny Cal. I also use this as a \"table\" to set cool plates on when I'm grilling.",
