I'm used to 5 ish mile commutes, but now I'm riding 17.5 miles each way and cruising around 15 mph. I bought the single speed because of the price and ruggedness of this type of bike. Really disappointed about the chain though. I just had a link fall apart. I guess I should have done a better job inspecting all the parts. Chains should last more then 300 miles.",

Also why are all the bikes the same size despite being built for people of different heights? Also, the bike is heavy for its size and not that well built overall. It was a disappointing purchase.",

Also, the seat is constantly getting unscrewed even after multiple times of screwing it very tightly. The overall quality seems very cheap. I would chose a different bike to save you the trouble. The only good thing this shit is for is uncomfortably taking you from point A to point B with squeaky brakes.",
