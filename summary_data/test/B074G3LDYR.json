So we took way longer putting it together because we had to figure it out on our own. Tip: notice the tiny knobs sticking out in the middle of the loop pieces, and using the completed photo as a guide, find the holes in the other loop pieces where they go in. Loosen the minuscule screws (8) inside the loop connector pieces (2), then firmly insert each piece of the loop, and tighten screws with little tool included\u2014see photo. When I emailed the company, they did eventually send the correct instructions. I have included them here for your convenience. Welcome. :)",

Then one night, 10 seconds after turning the light on it exploded in flames at the tip of one of the candlesticks; the bulb completely melted.
