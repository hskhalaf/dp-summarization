I've been using it about 8 months, clipped onto my pant waistline under my long tunic, it keeps my hands free and removes the shoulder and back strain from carrying a handbag, along with the unnecessary cost and maintenance of a variety of nice color coordinated hand and shoulder bags. I strongly recommend this card case with money clip from Coach. It seems to be the only brand that. Positions the money. clip so that it can function well as a waist clip without risking dropping the cards.",
