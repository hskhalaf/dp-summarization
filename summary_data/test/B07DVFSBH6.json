Now, if you've got a low pain threshold and you don't like deep tissue massage, that would be my only caution. However, I LOVE the deep tissue massage for my feet and it really irons out the soreness and fatigue after a long day or work out. It costs more than some products but I highly recommend it!",

Instead, it rattles and becomes unpleasantly LOUD because of the broken rollers. All it does is squeeze the feet and calves while hurting your eardrums. Vibration setting is not relaxing; heating does work but only in the feet, and for a calf massage - it squeezes and releases you four times in a cycle. I do not recommend, especially for the price.",

      "text": "Looks like Darth Vader but it is okay with me (Star Wars fan). Two months now using it 20 times a day. Intensity is strong and uncomfortable during the first days of initial use. As the feet have adjusted to the pressure and got used to it after several days of use, it feels so nice, relieving and relaxing. Too bad the price as dropped down since I purchased it in February.",

I wish it did a better job for the price I paid. I don't have room to have a bunch. This has limited functionality for calves and food. The limited modes are also weird because i dont know what mode it is. The color changes blue purple red. The instructions don't state what each color means.",
