      "text": "I was super happy with this at first. It seemed well made, and I loved that I could organize all my teas with the dividers. Then after just sitting on my counter for about 3 weeks I noticed the top had split! As I looked closer, the bottom has also started to pull off and the bottom has partially split. I live in a very dry climate so I can\u2019t imagine the wood has swollen causing the splits, and I didn\u2019t think bamboo would react that much to a change in humidity anyway. I have no idea why this happened, but it is really upsetting to have something break just sitting on the counter. Thankfully I can still return it.",

I finally have one place for my tea collection and it is lovely. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is because I wasn't able to install the little chain on the side that supposed to support the box when opening. The screws that came with the box were too small for the holes. It was not a bit deal for me but when I purchase something new, I expect it to be in perfect shape. I still love and enjoy the box very much!",

Although I didn't end up opening the shrink-wrap from the box, it didn't seem to be particularly sturdy, and I'd trust the reviews (and the photos!) that say this box is easily damaged. Ended up buying a similar tea box from The Bamboo Leaf, which was $10 more, but seemed much more well-made.",
