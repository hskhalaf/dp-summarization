It's pretty heavy so if the tee is hit it shouldn't tip it over. There are several tee positions to practice hitting inside, outside and down the middle at just about every possible height you will need to practice. There's a scan code apparently for drills, but our instructor gives my daughter what to work on. I could easily see this as a durable team practice tee. It was worth the extra money over the less durable tees.",

I've used it just once, but I am certain the tee tubes will last and last. The tubes extend very high in the strike zone for me and I am 6'0. It comes with a drills instruction manual that is very useful. Don't waste your money on the cheap tees. For the price this tee is a great value!",

The only slight concern is that the top pulls up and pushes down very easy, it feels as though it's going to just start slipping on it's own pretty soon. No big deal though, I'll just put a layer of duct tape around it and that will give the resistance to keep it from slipping. BTW, style is great, but that's all pretty clear in the pic so no need for me to give my opinion on that.",
