Just cut off the narrow tip, insert it into the hose. Cut an X shape into the top and push it into your faucet. You need to watch the water pressure but this soulution is easy, cheap and doesn't require plumbing skills.",

It's a wonderful little machine that's incredibly spacious and relatively quiet. It gets out even the toughest stains (my daughter loved yogurt and mac and cheese!) for 100 bucks. I was NOT endorsed for this video and I did NOT receive this item for free or at a discount. I reviewed it because I wanted to and I love spreading the word about good products that work and make women's lives easier! :-)",

Don\u2019t fill either portion too full, especially the spin basket. The spinner is so incredible, how fast it spins and how much water it gets out of the close. This washer gets everything so clean! We purchased this for use in our RV, and it\u2019s easy to just fill the washer by hand with the detachable shower head. We did have a couple issues, but the customer service from this company was so excellent, we would definitely purchase from them again!",

This could be fixed by applying silicon around the top lip of the machine. Would have gotten 5 stars if it came sealed. So far it hasn't been a big problem, as I just wipe up the water after each load, but it is rather annoying. Overall, this thing paid for itself in a couple of months. Highly recommended product.",

The spin cycle really gets the excess water out. If it lasts I will really be in love.",
