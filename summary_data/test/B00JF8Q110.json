The size of the puppets according to this listing was the same as the ones we had at church and they looked pretty similar, so I thought they would be a match, but no. These puppets were smaller and the quality was horrible. the hair (made of yarn) fell out and it was hard even for the kids who were using the puppets to maneuver them. These puppets are not worth $30...Even dolls/stuffed animals/puppets at the local 99 cent stores would have been better quality and cheaper. I'm returning these because of the poor quality.",

Right out of the box, one of the dolls started losing their hair, so these dolls aren't meant to last. Maybe good for a few puppet shows for an audience that's really easy to entertain. For me, I just wanted to do a goofy little video for my daughter, and they served their purpose. Can't imagine what else I can do with them because I can barely fit my hands into them. Maybe I'll donate them to a local day care center or elementary school.",

For the price and how many puppets you get it is a great deal. Buying each one separately would have been extremely more costly. For my purposes, story telling, they work great. Not sure how they would hold up as a toy, but that is not my intended purposes. I saw no imperfections with the puppets so I can only comment on what I actually received. I am happy with the purchase. The instructors were happy with the purchase and the kids were happy with the purchase. I would buy them again.",

I will say that I can see what other reviewers were saying in regards to the hair issues, but for us, it added to the comical appeal of the puppets. The price was awesome. Since the puppeteer we originally planned to hire fell through, it provided a great opportunity for the teens to collaborate, write an age-appropriate skit, and put on a hilarious show that entertained everyone ranging from toddlers to the elderly. Having to unexpectedly put on a last-minute act, the quick delivery was vital and greatly appreciated.",

There are no holes for the arms to put your fingers in and the mouthpieces inside are sewn so crooked that the mouths are inoperable as well (you can't open or close the mouths. The yarn hair is falling out as well. I am very disappointed but not surprised, as they were made in China.",

Not to mention the mouths are also poorly constructed. However, I did keep them and I have used them in quite a few therapy sessions already so they do serve their purpose. I just don't forsee them lasting very long.",

I chose them because they all look like children, and I wanted puppets that could represent peers rather than traditional costumes. I like that they are rather cartoon-like and dressed similarly so that they are not overtly from different countries, just portraying some of the lovely diversity of hair and skin tone in which children are made. My daughter says that,\"They are SOOO cute!\" With their wide, easy-to-manipulate mouths, these are great for teachers to use as well as for children to play with.",
