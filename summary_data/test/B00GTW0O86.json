Previously I wrote a good review, but I was mistaken....bad vacuum cleaner!!! Second review: I finally had to throw this vacuum cleaner away. The handle broke first time it was used, and the belt broke a few months later, had to replace it. Finally the motor burned up and had to throw the whole thing away. Won't but from Dirt Devil again.",

I finally looked and cleaned all clogs and it still isn't working. I do not recommend this product. It's been more hassle than it's worth and now I need to find a new vacuum again so I can stop borrowing my mother in laws!",
