The effect looks stronger in the photo than to the eye, and to me they seem muddled. When backlighted, however, they cast an unusual and surprisingly attractive shadow with highlights and geometrical patterns in it - worth seeing, I'd say. You get a lot of reasonably high quality glasses for your money with this set (though only four of each size). The glass is fairly thick, which, combined with a flaring shape, makes them comfortable in the hand and enjoyable to drink from. And anyhow, who looks at glasses?",

While putting glasses away in my kitchen this morning one of the tall glasses \"exploded\" into thousands of pieces after I placed the glass on the shelf and stepped away. The glassware was at room temperature after air drying overnight so heat and cold were not a factor. The only explanation I can find is that there must have been some flaw in the glass. I've never experienced anything like this before so needless to say I'm a bit worried about continuing to use the remaining glasses in the set.",

Mostly what I've found have been sets with tumblers that would be good for mixed drinks, but are too big for just juice at breakfast but this set is perfect for that. I also like the appearance. They have a nice kind of 'bubble' look to them but the outer glass is actually smooth. I highly recommend this set.",
