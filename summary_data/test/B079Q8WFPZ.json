They're very cute, and one foot was very comfortable while the other foot had this weird spot in the fabric of the heel that was hard and poked out. It was excruciating after 20 minutes and didn't feel like the kind of thing that would ever break in. It was only in the one foot and felt like a defect. Had that not been there I would've kept them for sure and probably given them at least 4 stars. Maybe you'll get more lucky than I did. And yes I paid full price for them!",

I ended up buying a Footpro insert for my Vans and returned these shoes. However, I did have great luck with the Taos Moc Star, and I certainly recommend them.",
