      "text": "I decided to try this to give the dog some variety in his meals. Our dog is allergic to grains, so this was great for him. He seemed to enjoy this topper, but he's a dog so eats most anything.. I liked that small number of natural ingredients. There were no ill effects with the dog's stomach, so we were happy with this product.",
