      "text": "Pros: nice handle Cons: The flexible spout sprayed out liquid every time baby dropped it. You do have to ensure you pull the plastic spout ridges all the way through Or you\u2019ll get leakage too. Definitely better for kids that aren\u2019t teething. Our son bites and pulls everything out of his mouth so this cup lasted less than two weeks before he ripped through the spout, tearing a larger drinking hole than needed.",

Now he plays around with it and drinks water all by himself. He has two cups and I can tell he prefers this one over the other one.",

She also has low muscle tone or hypotonia so her gross motor and fine motor skills are some what delayed and learning how to use a cup is more difficult than it would be for the neurological baby.",

He still dribbles about half of the milk out, but that should improve with practice and at least he\u2019s getting SOMETHING while I\u2019m away.
