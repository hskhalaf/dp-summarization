They weren't made of cheap, light plastic or anything. Very happy with this purchase!",

First off, they were delivered 3 days after the delivery estimate and when I opened the package, the frames were not the same. The bag that the sunglass case came in had the correct serial number but the number on the case was totally different. I am very disappointed especially since this is VERSACE. I am returning the item and will not be purchasing these frames through amazon again since there is NO GUARANTEE you will be getting the frames you were expecting when you make the purchase.",
