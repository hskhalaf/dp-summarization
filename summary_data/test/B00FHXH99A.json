With that being said, I needed a sofa table or something along those lines to place against the wall directly across from my bed. After months of searching I finally took the chance and ordered this table. Glad I did! It is worth it's price, and easy to assemble! It looks far more expensive than it is with a good mixture of pieces (glass and solid pieces), adding variety to the room. Overall, a great addition to the bedroom. ASSEMBLY: Easy to moderate. Will need a helping hand to hold pieces together while another screws. PRICE: Good value! STYLE: Modern, sleek,",
