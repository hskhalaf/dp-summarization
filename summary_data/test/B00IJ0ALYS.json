I would get hours of use out of my old set. For a big project I could go all day on one battery. These last less than an hour on a full charge. Very disappointing. Every project takes twice as long because we have to keep charging the batteries. Two stars because when its fully charged, the tools work fine. If you're looking for something to hang a set of curtains or a picture on the wall, this will work fine. If you are somebody that uses your tools frequently, look elsewhere.",

Lithium batteries have power right up to the end and youll know as midway thru driving a screw it slows to a crawl and dies. No biggie pop the other battery on and go. By the time that one dies the old ones charged. The 1/4\" impact i didnt think id use that much but its so handy once you have it! The LED lights in both make it nice in those dark areas.",
