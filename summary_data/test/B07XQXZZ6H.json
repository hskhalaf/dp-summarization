This is my first Apple Watch and it seems to function ok. But I\u2019m considering buying one direct from Apple and comparing the colors. In the picture I\u2019m holding actual rose gold jewelry next to it and it seems even darker pink. THOUGHTS???",

Even on their official site they call the aluminum case \u201cgold aluminum\u201d... it\u2019s 100% NOT gold or champagne gold. It\u2019s 100% blush gold or rose gold, yet Apple decided not to be accurate in its marketing of this product. The stainless steel gold looks like chrome and is not brushed, and is darker than a champagne gold as I usually like. So, if you like lighter golds, this one, albeit rose gold, is more feminine and lighter than the steel. I also bought a gold mesh band that tricks the eye into thinking the watch case isn\u2019t so blush gold.",

Also, it\u2019s not that great at recognizing when I\u2019ve began vs. ended a workout. Sometimes it\u2019ll ask me if my work out is done just cuz my heart rate is lower or ask me if I want to start a workout when I\u2019m busy at work.
