What you are wondering, of course, is, are all those reviewers who say that it is \"flat,\" correct? Well, the Casper is definitely on the side of \"compressible.\" However, it is also infinitely malleable and provides both cusion and leverage depending on how you fluff and position it. The bottom line is, if you're looking for an inflated, bouncy pillow that will raise your head 11-inches above your shoulders, this is not for you. But for a very comfortable, well-constructed, long-term sleeper...I say this is a terrific choice.",

Moldable but a bit firm. And when it gets a little flat again you just need to fluff it up and you're good to go once more!",
