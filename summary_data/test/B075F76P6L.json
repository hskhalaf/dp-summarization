My large down vest breaks at the waist and is too short to wear over a blazer. I purchased this vest (XL) because it was longer than most down vest made for men. I am very pleased and can wear a wool sweater and blazer without having to wear an overcoat. The fact that it zips on the left side does not annoy me. Over all, I am very pleased with my purchase. The price is also fantastic.",

I think the amount of puffiness for what I was looking for is just right. Time will tell if the quality holds for any length, but for the price I am happy so far; no holes in the pockets or anything of the sort.",
