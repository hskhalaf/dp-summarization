I have always been a fan of the Klipsch headphones, and to see a set that has bass emphasis of this nature is somewhat surprising. But for me, in a very good way. I can eq out the basic I want, and have great and crisp sound. Not to mention, they drown out the loud people in my office, so I can concentrate on work.. I havening but good things to say about them. And they are extremely light and comfortable to boot.",

The only problem is the lack of reinforcement on the wiring. I snagged the wire once and the right ear cup doesn't produce sound making this $100 purchase useless. No wonder. There is virtually nothing keeping the wires on the inside protected against this type of accident.",

Sound: Excellent Bass that makes action sequence come alive, like the boom of the explosion, the zipping of bullets and the clear vocals. I dont need to go and turn on those annoying subtitles to see if im hearing the dialogue correctly. Overall, excellent value for money. Very seldom you can find a headphone for less than $50 with this sound quality. Earpads are comfortable and I can barely feel it while watching movie/tv marathons.",

For the price, it's worth having to replace them when the ear cups start to crumble, which happened on my first headphones after six years. The company's website does not offer a replacement on the foam cups which is unfortunate. I also could not find any size of ear cup that matched on other online markets. So, I had to throw away a perfectly good set of headphones; but I'm willing to buy a second set because of the low price for the great quality of sound.",
