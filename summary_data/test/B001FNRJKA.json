Dream Tint Medium Light is the perfect shade for my skin tone (fair golden tone) and provides exactly the right amount of coverage. I am 71 years old and this product is perfect for me. On rare occasions I may add a light dusting of powder for a more matte look. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a light natural coverage. I might also note that I have had difficulty finding makeup in shades that are not too pink for my skin. If you have pale golden skin, this shade might work perfectly for you too.",

My skin has yellow undertones and pale, with light freckles and strawberry blond red hair. It is not easy finding colors that work with that tricky combination. This gives me color while covering imperfections; it brightens and doesn't look caked on. I use a serum, then apply this over the serum. I don't have to apply anything else beforehand or after as this moisturizes and provides SPF protection. It's quick, easy, and really pretty on the skin.",
