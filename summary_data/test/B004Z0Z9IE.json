I could easily move my full 14\" cast iron skillet (photo) up and down simply by grabbing the chain with one hand (no glove or pot holder needed) and release the pole lock with the other and adjust. Raises and lowers the full height. Also, lift two legs and pivot on the third to rotate the entire assembly, with skillet, away from the fire. Very sturdy. Loved it.",

Easy to put together, good size grill, and the fact that it was adjustable up and down allowed us to cook like pro's. We even got creative with some aluminum foil and turned this thing into a little smoker and and had some great ribs. Cleanup was fairly simple and the fact that this folded up into a small package made it nice and portable. I highly recommend this product.",

      "text": "This thing is actually pretty heavy at ~6lbs. So, this thing is great for campfires where you can conveniently drive your belongings in, than backpacking/bikepacking. Also the 17.5\u201d grill grate can take up room if you\u2019re trying to pack compactly. In theory, you could use a smaller circular grate if you can get your hands on one. All that said, this grill tripod is one of the greatest group-camping products to exist. It\u2019s perfect for campfire cooking since you can adjust the height of the pan/pot over the fire. The instructions are straightforward. The other heads-up is that the metals will gather a lot of campfire soot. So have those hand wipes handy.",

There were layers of clear packing tape on all four edges, crinkled corners, and content pressure impressions visible on the outside, but amazingly it still had all the parts, and they had not been crushed, apparently protected by the hand of God himself!
