Because of her eczema she has to wear socks all day and night and is rather selective about her socks. These appealed to her because they are bright, fit over wraps and she can mix and match. They went straight into the wash on arrival and have been pronounced 'the best socks ever'. In fact, we just ordered a second pack. Great price, cute colors, Hanes quality. Totally recommend.",
