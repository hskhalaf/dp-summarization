I did not even manage to get one pile of poop from the ground to the garbage bag. My confidence in products has forever been shaken lol. In all seriousness, it was waste of money. Not a big one, thankfully, but if you ever need to 100% rely on a poop scoop you're gonna have to spend a but more, this thing couldn't handle it",
