So you literally have to be standing there when it finishes cooking, or it goes to the warm cycle and proceeds to roast to a hard brown rice cake any rice that is touching the surface of the cooking pot (\"patina\" as those who can't bring themselves to level the rice \"burned\" call it).",

My only disappointment is when you try to steam vegetables or cook meat while the rice is cooking the steam tray is fairly shallow. I have a big family (7 of us total) and we make about 3-4 cups to supplement dinners. It is reliable and easy to clean. The inner tray is labeled to help you measure correctly. The scoop is a 3/4 cup so if you ever lose it just remember for the future so your rice to water ratio isn\u2019t wrong. Rice is always moist (doesn\u2019t make a dry rice).",

    "title": "Hamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker & Food Steamer, 14 Cups Cooked (7 Uncooked) With Steam & Rinse Basket, Stainless Steel (37548)",
    "description": "Color:Stainless SteelMaking a complete and balanced meal in the Hamilton Beach Electric Rice Cooker & Food Steamer is as easy as placing the ingredients in the bowl and turning it on. Not only does it cook rice and whole grains perfectly, but an integrated basket can be used to steam seafood, poultry and vegetables even while the rice cooks below. That means with just a few presses of a button, it\u2019s quick and easy to serve salmon with kale and quinoa one night and chicken and broccoli over white rice the next. The 2-in-1 steamer basket can also be used to rinse grains before cooking, which prevents clumping and results in a fresher taste. Clean up is a snap with the dishwasher safe nonstick cooking pot. Its compact size makes for easy storage. Cooking healthy, delicious meals doesn\u2019t get any simpler than that. Do not place on or near a hot gas or an electric burner, or in a heated oven.",
