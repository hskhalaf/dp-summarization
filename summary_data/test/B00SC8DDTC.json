Advice: take some time to truly break-in, wear 2 pair of wool socks (saved me from additional damage), lace for comfort (I'm still learning this), and get blister shields!",

The chart and reviews stating women's sizing was difficult here.I wear a EU 40 or about a 9.5. not in these and my foot is on the wide side. Reordered an 8.5M hope they work! The 8.5 fit well.

They are also waterproof and look great. I spent some time breaking these in before hiking and I got blisters in the process (happens easily for me) but now they are wonderful. The sole doesn't make for good pavement walking, so I always plan on having a different shoe if I have to do that on the same trip. Looking forward to many more adventures in these.",

Inside this box were the orthotic inserts. I put those in, and inserted some Dr. Scholl's active (took out of my tennis shoes) and these are so comfortable and durable on our last 5 mile hike. Love them, and they are made to last a life time. Very cool looking.",
