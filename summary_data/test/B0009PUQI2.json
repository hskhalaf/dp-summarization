Every percolator, I have ever had, the basket stood straight up. The basket is made from aluminum, so thin, I could crush it, in my arthritic hands. Make coffee in a sock. Less hassle and less waste of money, than this junk. 1 star is too high. The stem for the basket was not even made straight. Now ,1 week later the glass on top broke off,dropping glass into the coffee.",

The aluminum percolator assembly is made of a very malleable metal and is easy to bend out of shape when it's hot, so if you bend anything, you can straighten everything out if you heat up the metal by running warm water over it and bending gently back into shape - don't attempt to bend anything while the metal is cold, since it's on the thin side and could be damaged where the tube joins the percolator base.

So, I'm stuck with a coffee maker and no way to make coffee (other than cowboy coffee and that is not an option). For the four times used, the coffee was good.

Only need to let your coffee percolate about 5-10 minutes to get a nice dark brew. Can adjust your time over fire depending on how strong you want your coffee.

My husband loves the taste of coffee made in a percolator more than an electric coffeemaker. This has made him very happy. It makes coffee fast and the coffee has a wonderful taste.",

      "text": "Not going to get too lengthy here. Just look at all of the other one and two star reviews and you can see what I am complaining about. So just to recap - Glass knob broken (not in box), Inside basket stem made from non heat treated tin or lead, bent on arrival and cracked while trying to straighten out. Junk! I think I will ask my dad for his old Coleman gear.",

      "text": "Have not tried to perc coffee - deciding whether to return. The basket and stem (like others have said) is garbage, so flimsy. Plus these parts are bent especially the stem. I gently bent it straight but there is nothing I can do about the dent in the base. Really poor manufacturing and quality control by Coleman. Coleman used to be a brand that you could trust for reliability etc. Now we try to avoid anything from Coleman.",
