The rest of the visible part is also smooth and finish is rich and consistent. No maker's mark on the bottom, and as should be expected, it's raw ceramic so it will need a felt or cork pad under it for most surfaces. It feels thick and solid, very well-made. Very happy with it.

It is fairly heavy for its size and has a sturdy base. It won't tip over. It looks to be well made and the finish is smooth and slightly shiny. It's a very nice addition to my home de\u0301cor.",

Think of it as being the size of an oversized christmas ornament. That limits you to a fairly small display area. We put this on a tall shelf and it looked all wrong. We ended up placing it on an end table next to a picture frame and the scale was a good fit. I really like the pop of color that this adds to the room.",

The blues are waaaay down at the bottom of the vase, and the grey is just well--grey and drab. It's an okay vase...but not great.",
