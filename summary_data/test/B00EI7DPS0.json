You have to manually add coffee grounds and water, and have to wait for the system to brew. After each use, you have to clean the scoop and basket.

What makes this pot different from the Adair is the filtering system. This maker has a 2 tier system. Two stainless filters that eliminate any grounds in the final brew. Also the ability to brew two strengths is significant. This maker is worth the 2X price over the Adair. I will but this again",

Also, I have to wipe of plastic around where it goes before putting back. This has to be done every other time. Really?? I am surprised no one else has committed on this. 3.)

Each time, the coffee tasted bad. then using the same ingredients (freshly ground beans, filtered water), I used my Aeropress where I can control the water temperature. The Aeropress produced a good tasting cup of coffee. Water temperature of the Hamilton Beach topped out at about 158 degrees, vs 175 degrees for the Aeropress. I frankly am going to request a refund and ship it back. Water temperature is a key quality factor and this machine doesn't produce.",

Also I was tired of not being able to use my favorite coffees (primarily Bali Blue Moon from CBTL). I saw this coffee maker while researching something else and just had to try it. I've made a half-dozen cups of coffee so far and I'm very pleased. I docked it one star because there is a dust problem at the bottom of the cup, which I hope I can solve by using the filters that Amazon frequently sells with the machine. All in it's terrific value, well made and it's wonderful to be using my choice of beans again.",

I can go back to enjoying my favorite brands, and even try new coffees, which are more likely to be on sale. The coffee maker is easy to prepare, fast brewing, the right temp, and easy clean up!

I really don't understand how some reviewers said they had grounds get in their cup. If you follow directions it would be impossible for that to happen. It is very stylish on my counter and matches my stainless steel appliances perfectly!",

I like this better than another permanent filter machine I tried because the double filter keeps the sludge in the machine and out of the cup. It is a good looking machine takes about half the space of a regular Kuerig.",

I gave this coffeemaker a 4 star rating because of two reasons.

    "title": "Hamilton Beach Scoop Single Serve Coffee Maker, Fast Brewing, Stainless Steel (49981A)",
    "description": "HAMILTON BEACH THE SCOOP SINGLE-SERVE COFFEEMAKER - 49981\nThe scoop single-serve coffee maker goes where no coffee maker has gone before, brewing hotter, faster and better-tasting coffee than most gourmet machines out there. And, its benefits don't stop there. The scoop coffee maker utilizes the simplicity of ground coffee and brews a customizable cup quickly: an 8 oz. cup in less than 90 seconds or a 14 oz. travel mug in under two-and-a-half minutes.\n\nAside from its versatility in using inexpensive coffee grounds to brew a great-tasting cup, The scoop coffee maker is designed for ultra-simple preparation in three straightforward steps: 1) Scoop 2) Place 3) Brew. It features a steel mesh scoop for filtering freshly ground coffee and comes with a built-in, adjustable stand that flips to accommodate a standard-size cup or a taller travel mug.\n\nAll in all, the scoop single-serve coffee maker offers affordability and no fuss with lots of options. There's no need for extra equipment, high-tech buttons or extra equipment, either.\n\nPRODUCT USES & UNIQUE FEATURES\nALLOWING FOR VARIOUS COFFEE GRIND TYPES\nThe scoop coffee maker doesn't need pre-packaged K-Cup packs or coffee pods, which can get expensive, and not to mention stale, over time. Instead, it comes with a mesh scoop filter that gives users the choice of any flavor (caramel, hazelnut, vanilla, etc.), any brand (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc.) and any strength (Regular or Bold) pleasing to their taste. \n\nDIFFERING BOLDNESS LEVELS\nWith The scoop coffee maker, versatility is key. Whether you decide to go with a mainstream brand coffee or stronger premium-brand coffee, you need a machine that understands and quickly adapts. Use the regular setting for a quick basic, automatic drip coffee, or get an upgrade and choose bold for more fine grinds, decaf or stronger flavors premium-brand coffee like Starbucks or Melitta. Just remember that the finer the grind, the longer it takes to brew. For bolder coffee, the water passes through at a slower rate, but allows more contact time and better flavor extraction for a better-tasting cup when done brewing. \n\nMEASURING PROPORTIONS APPROPRIATELY \nNot sure how much coffee to add when brewing? No worries -- each scoop filter is labeled with two measuring lines for exact serving amounts. And more isn't necessarily better, in this case. Overfilling the scoop doesn't allow room for brewing and water can overflow and spill over, ultimately meaning weaker coffee. \n\nADJUSTING THE CUP SIZE \nBefore brewing, adjust the L-shaped cup rest to make sure your cup is as close to the dispensing nozzle as possible. For travel mugs, fit the cup rest against the coffeemaker and place your mug on top of the drip tray. \n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN \nThe Scoop Coffeemaker was awarded the \"2012 Good Housekeeping Very Innovative Products (VIP) Award\" by Good Housekeeping Research Institute. In addition, the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) gave it high rankings for its ability to use coffee grinds, instead of packs or pods, and simultaneously give users the freedom to choose their own flavor, strength and cup size for their coffee. \n\nPRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS\n * Costs pennies per cup, compared to leading competitors' single-size packs\n * Proportions coffee exactly with single-serve scoop filter \n * Brews an 8 oz. cup of coffee in less than 90 seconds \n * Built-in adjustable stand holds standard-size cup and taller travel mugs \n * One steel mesh scoop filter included; no need for paper filters\n * Wide drip tray on base acts as a spill-resistant drain for excess coffee \n * Settings for regular (automatic drip) and bold coffee \n * Durable, stainless steel features ensure coffeemaker's longevity \n * Automatically shuts off after brewing\n\nTIPS & CARE \nRun one or two cycles through the machine before first use.

When grinding your own coffee beans, remember to purchase beans that were recently roasted (within a week is best), and grind them every time you brew a fresh cup. When brewing, keep ground coffee below the max fill line and do not use more than 14 ounces (410 ml) of water. To stop brewing mid-cycle, press either regular or bold, and the unit will shut off.
