This one seems much more durable, the neck is actually round (and so works with a glass stopper) and it has yet to stain, even though we've been using it for months. Our last decanter started to stain after a month and needed to be cleaned much more often. So far we've been using this for 4-5 months and have yet to see any stains.",

We have been very careful hand washing it, etc. and it seems like one tiny little tap chips the glass on the pouring edge. For \"thick glass\", it does not seem like very good quality in our experience.",

That may be the point, but I'm more excited about being able to pour a whole lot of wine into this fancy glass container and then shake it up vigorously without fear of spilling (it is very difficult, nay, impossible to spill any wine unless you make a serious attempt to do so: that's how well this thing works). 5 stars indeed.",
