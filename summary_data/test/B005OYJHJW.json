I started a two day old abandoned kitten on this and switched about a week later to the KMR formula made by the same company. The kitten had trouble digesting the KMR and got diarrhea. There is no way I can know 100% if it was because of the switch in formula, but it wasn't worth continuing to chance it so I quickly switched back. Over the past two weeks the kitten has been good. There is a difference in ingredients and fat to protein ratios. Petlac was also a few dollars cheaper at the time of purchases.",

It clumps less and produces a more viscous milk so maybe it is heavier but then why not a smaller can? The viscous milk is not great if you are mixing it with wet food but might be a plus if you are bottle feeding. Also my foster kittens shunned it. So i will likely not buy this again.",

One thing to note is that the fat content for Petlac is significantly lower than KMR. If you\u2019re bottle feeding tiny babies, you\u2019re better off feeding KMR.
