Also the pan remains flat in the oven. I actually baked cookies for three days in a row after receiving the pan. However, like all cookie sheets it does have a rust issue under the raised edge, but that's a minor issue. Some day manufacturers will find a way to encapsulate or put a non-rust finish on the steel(?) support structure on bakeware.",

Baked, loosen around edges, turned out on towel and gave whack in middle. Cake with parchment came out, edge with no parchment nor oil broke off. It stuck. My experience says oil entire pan with oil or use parchment to all edges. This pan is not going to bake well with nothing on it. It is heavy and did not bow.",

    "description": "Style Name:Jelly Roll 10\" x 15\"OXO Bakeware combines strong, durable, and precise engineering with the thoughtful touches that are characteristic of all OXO products. This line of Non-Stick Pro Bakeware is made of heavy-grade aluminized steel that ensures durability and promotes even heat distribution for a more reliable bake and is coated with a commercial grade, double-layer, ceramic-reinforced PTFE non-stick coating. This provides powerful non-stick capability, as well as scratch-,stain-,corrosion-, and abrasion resistance. The non-stick line also features a micro-textured pattern that ensures even baking by minimizing your food's surface contact with the pan and promoting airflow. All OXO Good Grips Non-Stick Pro Bakeware pieces feature generous square-rolled edges for reinforcement and a secure grip, and are dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.",
