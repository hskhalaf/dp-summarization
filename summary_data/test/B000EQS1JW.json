Excellent craftsmanship by Citizen. With all of the abuse I gave this watch in my 20's, only some scratches on the Quartz face tell the story. The band is just about disintegrated (after 4 years of full use). Overall, this is definitely a watch I would wear in the field, & in casual environments. I additionally like the option of Spanish days for the day calendar. A sound Timekeeper.",

I will say that that face is a bit small compared to mens watches of today. With my wrists, I wear the strap at the last eyelet, making the watch face appear small on my wrist. Nevertheless, the simplistic design is what draws me to this watch. The price is great and I'll keep this watch in rotation.",

It keeps time well, has a lot of features without being cluttered, and a nice appearance without being flashy. I like that it's not necessary to worry about changing batteries. I've had it for a year now and I really love it. The one thing I might change about this watch is that, although the dials are glow-in-the-dark, the watch can sometimes be hard to read in the dark. So it might not be the best for those who work outdoors at night.",

Note: these don't charge well on the window sill and obviously won't charge in a drawer. Very easy to read. I thought my old one was broken and sent it in. They recharged it and sent it back free. My bad! Has day and date but small, which I prefer. The band is ok but sort of military looking on this watch. Easily exchanged. Eco drive watches cost more but that is offset by no battery replacement. This one is a slightly smaller mans size and very comfortable. Highly recommended!",

What truly makes this watch stand out it\u2019s that it\u2019s solar powered! No need to worry about the battery for 10 plus years. This watch is perfect for work, camping, possibly even military use. It is extremely accurate (never take that for granted) most watches aren\u2019t. A great watch for any type of emergency that requires timekeeping. The downsides are the bands (too stiff, ruff ) and the case is too polished for my taste.",

      "text": "This is a very good watch and it is very lightweight. The second hand aligns to the indices very well. It keeps accurate time to about 10 seconds per month. The band is well made and comfortable. My wrist is six and three-quarter inches in circumference and it looks a little small on me, but I still like it when I\u2019m working in the yard and for activities where a larger watch would get in the way. I still wish this watch was a little larger, but if you are happy with the size, this is a great choice. I notice the price bumps between $89 and $129 pretty frequently, so be sure to watch for that.",

While there are nicer/fancier/more expensive models out there, this one meets all of my needs and exceeded my expectations. I've had it for over a year now, with no worries about charging or swapping batteries. I also have not had to worry about when I do and don't wear it - it works equally well in the office and in the field. I have scratched the face a few times, but only minor scratches have resulted. If you're not looking for a watch to play dress up with or one that can tell you the air pressure in 3 separate time zones, this is an outstanding contender!",

If they made adjustment holes in band to fit a range of wrist sizes like 22mm to 15mm this would be a 5 star review on the band. There just isn't enough band (at 18mm / last hole) left to tuck in, maybe 1/2 inch?. There is a 20mm citizen green canvas band on Amazon but, it is $38.00.",

The band is less adjustable because of the ring hole design. The canvas band is largely waterproof but does retain a slight amount of moisture after surfing. This drys quickly when removed.
