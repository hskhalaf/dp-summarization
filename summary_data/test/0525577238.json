She lists 30 days of food plans, so you are able to choose which recipe you'd like to use for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Knowing her recipes, along with reading through the cookbook, they are all simple to put together. Once you have staples in your house, which she lists, cooking these healthy meals are a breeze!",

On top of it the recipes are not pleasing to look at (the few pictures she has) and flavor wise they are lacking. I found myself having to make many adjustments to make palatable.

The recipes are easy to follow and I feel better serving home cooked meals rather than take out or overly processed foods.",

The beef and broccoli recipe: Amazing!! The vegan Mac and cheese (better than real cheese for me), and the poblano Chili...sooooo good. Brittany has mastered the simple but flavorful recipe. I purchased 3 others as gifts! If it's time to make a change, you'll appreciate this book",

It\u2019s so nice to have ideas for all meals and she even comes up with more on her blog that she shares! I\u2019ve recommended this to several friends especially those with milk allergies.

I also didn\u2019t like that there weren\u2019t more pictures. All in all, it seems way too boring for me but could be helpful to someone who has no idea how to cook basic recipes.
