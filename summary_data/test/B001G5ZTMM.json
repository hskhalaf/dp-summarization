I've trusted their gear since the beginning and won't ever switch. The 5Dmk2 is my latest purchase and I'm impressed. While I could have bought a newer model I invested in better lenses. I've ALWAYS been happy with their glass. Buying a camera is important but a cheaper lens is going to give you acceptable images with a great camera. Red line glass (Canon's best glass) with an ok camera will give you great images.",

This camera is limited and is a little difficult during auto focus, but once you learn its drawbacks you can work around them. Canon quit making this camera when they introduced the Mark III and that is a shame, it's a great all around camera for jumping into finer photography..If you decide on it, don't be afraid to look for a refurbished, or even used.",

    "title": "Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Style:5D Mark II 24-105mm Lens| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Canon 2764B004 EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM Lens includes a the Mark II digital SLR camera that has a stunning 21.1-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor with DIGIC 4 Image Processor, a vast ISO Range of 100-6400, plus EOS technologies like Auto Lighting Optimizer and Peripheral Illumination Correction. It supports Live View shooting, Live View HD videos, and more. It can shoot up to 3.9 fps, has 9 AF points plus 6 AF assist points, a new 98% coverage viewfinder, a 3.0-inch Clear View LCD (920,000 dots/VGA) and a rugged build. The EF 24-105 IS Lens is a standard zoom lens that can cover a large zoom area ranging from 24mm wide-angle to 105mm portrait-length telephoto. And its Image Stabilizer technology steadies camera shake up to three stops.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n Compact, lightweight with environmental protection, EOS 5D successor boasts a newly designed Canon CMOS sensor, with ISO sensitivity up to 25,600 for shooting in near dark conditions. The new DIGIC 4 processor combines with the improved CMOS sensor to deliver medium format territory image quality at 3.9 frames per second, for up to 310 frames. \n\nTriggered from Live View Mode, HD video capture allows users to shoot uninterrupted at full 1080 resolution at 30fps -- for amazing quality footage with outstanding levels of detail and realism. \n\nThe integration of HD movie capability into a high-end 21.1-megapixel camera opens a multitude of new possibilities for photojournalists and news photographers. With its full-frame CMOS sensor and outstanding ISO performance, the EOS 5D Mark II will appeal to any photographer in search of the finest camera equipment available -- from studio and wedding to nature and travel photographers. \n\nOther improvements to the EOS 5D include: \n\n *  Addition of Canon\u2019s EOS Integrated Cleaning System, with a new Fluorine coating on the low-pass filter \n * Larger 3.0-inch Clear View LCD with VGA resolution, a 170-degree angle of view and anti-reflective coatings \n * Improved menu system including Quick Control Screen for more direct access to common settings \n * Automatic peripheral illumination correction, utilizing detailed EF lens information to optimize JPEG images straight out of the camera \n * Magnesium alloy construction with additional environmental protection \n * UDMA memory card compatibility \n\nEOS 5D Mark II Highlights \n\nNew CMOS sensor\nThe EOS 5D Mark II\u2019s newly designed full-frame 21.1-megapixel CMOS sensor features ISO sensitivity from 100-6400, expandable to 50, 12,800 and 25,600. Large 6.4\u00b5m2 pixels have been redesigned to capture more light and yield a better signal to noise ratio to ensure lower noise images throughout the ISO range. The full frame sensor has the same dimensions as a frame of 35mm film. This means that wide-angle lenses stay wide, without the change in angle of view associated with smaller sensor cameras. As well as benefiting from finer control over depth of field, photographers moving up to the EOS 5D Mark II\u2019s full frame format will find the newly designed wide, bright 98 percent coverage viewfinder on a joy to work with. \n\nNew DIGIC 4 processor\nA new DIGIC 4 processor combined with 14-bit analogue to digital conversion provides smooth gradations in mono-tonal areas such as skies, and highly accurate color rendition. As well as HD movie shooting, DIGIC 4\u2019s high speed provides for long uninterrupted continuous bursts of large JPEGs, near-instant start-up times and immediate and fast review after shooting. DIGIC 4 also provides for improved noise reduction algorithms, complementing the already low-noise images from the EOS 5D Mark II\u2019s CMOS sensor. \n\nHD video capture\nThe EOS 5D Mark II is Canon\u2019s first DSLR to incorporate full HD 1920x1080 video capture. Once filming is started from Live View mode, photographers can fire off either single of continuous stills, with video capture continuing after the final frame is captured. \n\nSee everything\nA new 3.0-inch VGA resolution LCD provides a wide 170 degree angle-of-view, providing plenty of clarity for accurate focus checks in playback. The screen brightness can automatically adjust to suit viewing conditions, extending battery life in low light and improving viewing in bright conditions. A new dedicated Live View button switches modes to display a real-time image on the LCD. This allows EOS 5D Mark II photographers to enjoy simplified shooting from awkward angles. Simple connection to a PC provides easy remote shooting. \n\nPrecision focus and metering\nA 9-point auto focus system is supported by 6 additional invisible Assist AF points, located inside the spot-metering circle to optimise subject tracking performance in AI SERVO AF mode. For accurate exposure readings in tricky lighting conditions, the spot metering circle covers just 3.5 percent of the frame. \n\nControl\nThe EOS 5D Mark II\u2019s redesigned menu system includes a new Quick Control screen, for instant access to the most commonly changed settings. A new Creative Auto mode allows photographers to cede control of key settings to the camera, while retaining control over creative variables such background blur, drive mode and image brightness. Custom user settings allow photographers to switch between two completely different camera setups. This is ideal for changing quickly between two different environments, such as switching from working inside a church without flash to outdoors with fill-flash at a wedding. \n\nOptional Accessories\nShooting flexibility is enhanced with a range of new accessories. Shooting capacity can be extended with either the high-capacity 1800mAh lithium-ion Battery Pack LP-E6, or Battery Grip BG-E6. \n\nA new optional Wireless File Transmitter\nThe WFT-E4 offers external HDD and GPS compatibility along with ability to transmit images direct to computer or FTP server, or operate the camera wirelessly. Both the BG-E6 and WFT-E4 feature a vertical orientation shutter release and other key controls for comfortable portraiture work, with a substantial grip to help balance the camera when used with long lenses. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * EOS 5D Mark II Body \n * Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM lens \n * Eyecup Eb \n * Wide Neck Strap EW-EOS5DMKII \n * Stereo Video Cable STV-250N \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-200U \n * Battery Charger LC-E6 \n * Battery Pack LP-E6 \n * EOS Digital Solution Disk \n * Software Instruction Manual \n\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n \n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Canon EOS 5D Mark II Digital SLR: Highly Recommended by dpreview.com \n\nBack in August 2005 Canon 'defined a new DSLR category' (their words) with the EOS 5D. Unlike any previous 'full frame' sensor camera, the 5D was the first with a compact body (i.e. not having an integral vertical grip) and has since then proved to be very popular, perhaps because if you wanted a full frame DSLR to use with your Canon lenses and you didn't want the chunky EOS-1D style body then the EOS 5D has been your only choice. Three years on and two competitors have turned up in the shape of the Nikon D700 and Sony DSLR-A900, and Canon clearly believes it's time for a refresh. \n\nSo here is the 5D Mark II, which punches high in terms of both resolution and features, headlining: 21 megapixels, 1080p video, 3.0-inch VGA LCD, Live view, higher capacity battery. In other words, a camera that aims to leapfrog both its direct rivals, either in terms of resolution (in the case of the D700) or features (in the case of the DSLR-A900). Full detail below. \n\nKey features / improvements  * 21 megapixel CMOS sensor (very similar to the sensor in the EOS-1Ds Mark III) \n * Sensor dust reduction by vibration of filter \n * ISO 100 - 6400 calibrated range, ISO 50 - 25600 expansion (1Ds Mark III & 5D max ISO 3200) \n * Auto ISO (100 - 3200) in all modes except manual \n * 3.9 frames per second continuous shooting \n * DIGIC 4 processor, new menus / interface as per the EOS 50D \n * Image processing features: Highlight tone priority, Auto lighting optimizer (4 levels), High ISO noise reduction (4 levels), Lens peripheral illumination correction (vignetting correction) \n * RAW and SRAW1 (10 MP) / SRAW2 (5 MP) \n * RAW / JPEG selection made separately \n * Permanent display of ISO on both top plate and viewfinder displays \n * AF micro adjustment (up to 20 lenses individually) \n * Three custom modes on command dial, Creative Auto mode \n * Image copyright metadata support \n * 98% coverage viewfinder (0.71x magnification) \n * 3.0\" 920,000 dot LCD monitor with 'Clear View' cover / coatings, 170\u00b0 viewing angle \n * Automatic LCD brightness adjustment (ambient light sensor) \n * Live view with three mode auto-focus (including face detection) \n * No mirror-flip for exposures in Live View if contrast detect AF selected \n * Movie recording in live view (1080p H.264 up to 12 minutes, VGA H.264 up to 24 mins per clip) \n * Two mode silent shooting (in live view) \n * New jump options in play mode \n * HDMI and standard composite (AV) video out \n * Full audio support: built-in mic and speaker, mic-in socket, audio-out over AV (although not HDMI) \n * IrPort (supports IR remote shutter release using optional RC1 / RC5 controllers) \n * UDMA CompactFlash support \n * New 1800 mAh battery with improved battery information / logging \n * New optional WFT-E4 WiFi / LAN / USB vertical grip \n * Water resistance: 10 mm rain in 3 minutes \n\n>Read more at dpreview.com \n\n\n\nSee more",
