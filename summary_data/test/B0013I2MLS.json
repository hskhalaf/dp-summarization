It would open the value but when it was time to shut it off it could not do so. So I returned this. Disappointing.",

Most of the timers I've had you had to schedule by the day of the week, so there was always uneven watering because of a seven day watering cycle. This timer is so easy to change days or durations to fit my garden and trees needs. It lasted well through one season, I hope it lasts many more.",

Turns on the water daily, every other day or every third day and no nagging required.",
