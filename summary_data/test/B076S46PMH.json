Like the high-top HOVR Havoc, these low-top basketball shoes are just killing it with their amazing traction and pretty effective cushioning system. The fact that a pair is sold for just around a hundred bucks seals the deal. This model is really the one to get if you are serious about balling.",

      "text": "Fits true to size. Slightly narrow around the mid foot, but materials do seem to stretch a bit. The shoes do have one huge flaw though, as the plastic heel counter rides up too high and becomes uncomfortable the more you play in it. It actually rides up so high that after about 45 min of light shoot around at my local indoor gym, I started to bleed from my ankle! Something that I have never encountered with other shoes. Greatly upsetting and something to consider when purchasing these shoes.",

The Hovr cushion is very nice making it a very comfortable shoe. When you first put them on they will feel tight, especially in the forefoot area, and very firm but you have to give yourself time to break them in as they are extremely comfortable. If you have a wide foot you may want to go up about half a size. The support is excellent as well. You feel truly locked in while playing basketball. In terms of the materials used it's all premium. I highly recommend these.",

      "text": "These HOVR Havoc Low's run a bit small. I normally wear a 9.5, but had to return for a size 9 due to having too much space in the heel area. Once I had the right fit the shoes fit better, but have needed quite a bit of time before the cushioning felt just right. The herringbone traction is great for indoor & outdoor play and the fuse material seems pretty durable. I've had them for months now and they stay pretty clean aside from the scuffs on the white outsole. I recommend them if you play on hard court surfaces like I do.",

HOWEVER, on the outside of my ankle, underneath my ankle bone the sneaker comes up to high and eats away at your skin. I tried so hard to play through it because I love these sneakers so much but its just too uncomfortable and eventually painful. This has happened to others who have bought these sneakers but some didn\u2019t so I guess it comes down to the shape of your foot. Purchasing this online is a gamble.",
