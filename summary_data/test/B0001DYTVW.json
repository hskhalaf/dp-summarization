      "text": "I purchased my V ED scanner through Amazon about 2 years ago and have been extraordinarily happy with it. While slower than professional-level scanners the quality is sooooo far above the 100$ film scanner that I first attempted to use that I can't imagine getting a better deal. As far as the hardware goes I can think of anything substantial to complain about. The software that is included was ok - though I found it to be really buggy when I tried scanning B&W film. I actually downloaded and purchased a license for VueScan (I use a Mac - not sure if there is a PC version) that really lets me drive the hardware to its full potential.",

      "text": "I know many photographers who have shot hundreds if not thousands of Ektachrome or Kodachrome slides in the past. Face it, the slides are getting older and you need to convert them to digital images. The Coolscan V will do the job beautifully. You can even retouch them with the included software, or any imaging software (Adobe CS). The process does take time (a couple minutes for a typical slide), but anything worth saving takes time. For the price, it totally beats sending your precious slides out to be processed or renting a unit where you're under a deadline to return it. Besides, you have full control over how you want them to look. Quality product, great outcomes!",

It makes noise (though not nearly as much as others I've heard). It's fussy when you try to feed in the film strip. These are not major problems, just things you must accept as part of film scanning.
