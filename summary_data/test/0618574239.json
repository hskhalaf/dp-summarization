(Roger Tory Peterson; National Geographic, etc. ) The book is a perfec size; has maps; photos of the birds rather than drawings; the thing i love MOST is the index at the back. There is an \u201cat a glance page\u201d that allows you to go to each main bird with the page number. So helpful when trying identify a fire FAST. Soon i am going to get another one for me.

Similar species are grouped together, with photos on one page and descriptions on the facing page. There are tips for identifying birds, including their calls, and on choosing and using binoculars. This is a detailed guide for the novice birder. Its compact size makes it easy to take along on birding expeditions.",

      "text": "Ken Kaufman's book is one of the best. It is water resistant, has all info on the same page with photos and is small enough to be comfortable to carry all day. I can identify a bird faster with this book because of its layout. When birding you need more than one guide sometimes to make a decision on a tough to identify bird sighting. But one of them should always be this one.",

There is lots of great information in the front of the guide on identifying birds, choosing binoculars, etc.",
