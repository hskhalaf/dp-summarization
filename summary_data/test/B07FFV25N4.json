      "text": "I've been using the True Glow by Conair a few weeks now and my skin looks better already. It has a glow, looks fresher and my pores are visibly cleaner. I used Clarisonic for 4 years and got tired of spending over $100 for a product that dies every 2 years. I wasn't going to spend another $100 for an unreliable product so I decided to try Conair. The Conair was cheaper, works better, and worth the money. Hopefully it last longer than Clarisonic.",

The cause stems from water getting on the contacts and not draining off adequately, despite the hole in the bottom for that purpose. Contact pins are now green from corrosion. When you use a facial scrubber there is apt to be water on it when you set it back in the charger. This needs to have an inductive charger like those you find on electric toothbrushes.",

Update after 3 months - it had the same issue as my previous one, doesn't charge and keeps beeping. Waste of money",

Would definitely recommend wearing sunscreen (if used in the morning) or using a moisturizer (if using before bedtime), because it does serious exfoliation. It comes with two replacement brush heads, which I found confusing. I thought at first the brush heads were different from each other and then felt really stupid when I realized they weren\u2019t. It\u2019s pretty awkward though because the extra brush heads are loose, unless I want to get a special case or something for them.",

I didnt press all that hard but enough to feel like I was getting a bit of exfoliation. I dont think I'll be using this again. It was nice to have something easy to hold and use to clean my face but I'll be going back to my silicone pad that is gentle but leaves my face feeling clean.",

It's soft, has adjustable speeds, and cleans well. Sometimes your skin just needs a good deep clean and exfoliation, and this brush will get you there. It's probably not great for sensitive skin, or acne. I would use this 2-3x per week on normal, combo, or dry skin. The downside to me is that I didn't see replacement heads for sale. So this is basically good for about 6 months, give or take depending on how often you use it.",
