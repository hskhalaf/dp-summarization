My husband says it was easy to put together. He also advises using a screwdriver and not an electric drill, while taking your time to put the pieces together. He says to check to make sure you have all of your parts and the condition of each part, starting with the glass doors.",

I wanted to store some slightly oversized pieces in there and it's a no go. It is divided in the inside in 12\" cubbies. I was thinking ( okay hoping lol) that the shelves went all the way through which they don't. Just a tiny bit more and it coulda' been a contender lol. I am keeping it though. My husband was able to put it together rather easily and it will be a nice addition to my dining room.",

Cons: It isn't dovetailed in the drawers and there aren't slides on the drawers. I'll apply a little soap wax to the drawers and it should slide a little smoother. But a good value for the price.",
