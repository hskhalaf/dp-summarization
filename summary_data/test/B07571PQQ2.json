      "text": "The UAS works flawlessly, with no scratches or dings or missing pieces. I had an issue with purchasing DJI Care Refresh for my refurbished Mavic Pro after delivery. A quick email to DJI Support through their webform allowed me to attach screen shots of my purchase and delivery date. Within 24 hours the issue had been fully resolved. Ideally there wouldn't be any issues that require customer time, but for an extra 5 minutes of my time I was able to save $200 over purchasing a brand new Mavic Pro. The savings pay for the DJI Care Refresh and leaves $100 on the table to purchase the \"Platinum\" blades and an extra battery or other accessories.",

Everything is like new. Boxed and comes with everything just like new. CAN'T BEAT DJI.",

It says refurbished but you\u2019d never tell from original packaging and box and manuals, to plastic still left on various pieces to protect it against scratching. Only issue with buying refurbished is that it appears this isn\u2019t eligible for DJI Care Refresh which is a year warranty on the drone. It keeps giving me errors when I try to do it (has to be done in first 48 hours of use). So far it\u2019s one of the best drones I\u2019ve ever used. Super stable and all around great.",

Update: seller was awesome refunded the money in under 3 days and overall was very responsive. Will continue to buy from them when the time comes",

The 4K video keep have some thing weird like a waves in the ocean for 1 or 2 seconds then go back to normal. The battery seem to be okay with 22 minutes max with wind <10 mph at the moment.

There was on minor issue with the battery, and the customer service I received at Camrise was outstanding. I'd give more stars if I could both for the Mavic Pro and for Camrise. If you have any doubts about buying a refurbished model from them via Amazon, rest easy and grab this!",

I've flown it for about 4-5 times now with no issue. One thing I've read is that all refurbished drones from DJI is supposed to have an \"R\" at the end of the serial number to indicate that it is a refurbished item but mine doesn't have the \"R\".",
