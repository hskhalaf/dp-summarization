      "text": "I decided to try this chair out to see if it would help improve my posture and relieve some of the pain of sitting at a desk all day. I did immediately feel it benefited my posture. It prevents slouching and encourages engaging your core and straightening out your spine. At the end of the day I don't feel the pain in my low back and hamstrings I used to have. The only downside is it shifts some weight onto your shins which can get bothersome after a while. But that is a worthwhile tradeoff to me, and I can always switch back to a regular office chair for a little while if my shins need a break.",
