I never had this problem with the jam plus that I had before. If the speakers are too far apart and are paired. One will go silent for a few seconds every so often. Not cool. I'd like to return but it's too late, so I'll try to get a refund using my Amex Return protection.",

I love music with bass and this speaker delivers. Now I'm sure it will not compete with a Bose speaker, but at this price, you just can't beat it. We have a few different wireless speakers at home and I think this one ranks right up there.",
