Theyve been demoted to just junk throw-around flashlights able to shine just bright enough for basic tasks. They are great for stashing in small spaces but do not expect too many lumens, even zoomed in all the way. These are no where near a mountable size to put on a shotgun tube or any firearm I can think of. Way better than any freebee Harbor Freight LED light tho. Not great and not horrible, but way different than I expected. Seems like a good build though.",

I'm talking about maybe 10-15 minutes total use. When the battery dies, it give no warning. After a minute or I'm going to purchase a flashlight from some other manufacturer that will verify it's battery usage is respectable.",

On one of the lights the bezel slides very easily which makes keeping the beam focused the way I want somewhat difficult. I've never had lights that focus by sliding; usually it's by screwing clockwise or counter-clockwise, which holds the focus better. Also, one of the lights' switches is screwy; when you turn it on it goes immediately to strobe instead of a steady beam, which is annoying. Four stars because even with these issues they're still a good value for the money.",
