The screen is a real stand out as it is articulated, something I didn't think I needed, also the resolution is much better. I bought the body on its own, and threw on some of my old lenses, now I have ordered a Pentax 16-85mm lens to match the waterproofing of the K-70.

The K-70 is based on the older model and has the weatherproofing and a slightly better stabilisation system plus new pixel-shift. I have found focusing better with the K-70 plus the Wi-Fi helps plus the swing-out monitor and red glow monitor for keeping night-sight when using in low-light conditions. I am currently saving for a second K-70 and will trade in my K-S2",

The pros are endless, but highlights are backward compatibility with all k and M42 (with adaptor) mount lenses, massive creative menu, in camera shake reduction, 24Mb s APS-C sensor and a far better than average weather resistant kit lens. Auto results are fine, but the Program AE and other modes allow tweaking of the Jpegs that can make them better than the default settings. Images look great even on a 4K TV. Mine came with the 18-55 kit lens which is great for everyday use.",
