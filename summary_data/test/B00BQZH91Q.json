Also, the top of the shoe hits the top of my foot as I walk and that's annoying (because I'm already curling my toes to keep the darn things from flopping off my feet). Geez I hate these cute things.",

In 2006 FitFlop founder Marcia Kilgore set her mind on a mission \u2013 to create the most comfortable footwear in the world. Collaborating with two British biomechanists she created a triple-density MICROWOBBLEBOARD midsole, and launched it in our first FitFlop sandal. Over twenty million pairs have been sold since we first started making shoes. (And we\u2019re repeatedly told \u2013 by happy customers \u2013 that we make the most comfortable footwear in the world.) Our patent-pending, original MICROWOBBLEBOARD midsole technology fuses three diagonal sections of multi-density EVA into a single, seamless, underfoot platform to help absorb shock, diffuse underfoot pressure, and make your feet feel amazing!",
