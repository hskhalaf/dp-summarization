It is smaller: it still covers your shoulder enough but it is a little smaller. 2. It does not have the snap buttons so it cannot be used as bibs. 3. It is not as soft as Aden + Anais brand 4. more lint come off when washed but it absorb as well as Aden + Anais. cheaper than Aden brand. hope it helped",

Shoulder width aside, it would be better to have additional width in as ours like to flop his head around side to side, he can have a spitup to the sides too, he's not going to just puke straight down my back!",

While they were soft when I received them, it seems they have only grown softer after several washings. For the price, I think they are a great value and we are already ordering more. 3 is a great starter number, but you will definitely want more.",

We have several burpy bibs as well, so I didn't feel that I needed all of our burp cloths to be dual purpose. And three of these cloths are about the same price as two burpy bibs. I'm glad I purchased a set of these; it's nice to have a good amount of burp cloths on hand! Otherwise I would be doing a lot more laundry.",

Size really matters because it's the worst when you're dressed and ready to walk out the door and then the baby spits up just beyond reach of a little burp cloth. That won't (well, shouldn't!) happen with these.",
