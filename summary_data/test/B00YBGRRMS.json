      "text": "I typically wear a 7.5 or 8 in shoes, and have other Merrells in an 8 that fit a bit large. However, these ran a little small, but stretched out nicely with wear. I got them specifically for hiking the Narrows in Zion National Park and they performed beautifully. The bottom had stellar grip for scrambling over wet rocks, and they dried quickly. After several hours of water hiking and climbing, I had no blisters or sore spots. They also worked great for land hikes in the extreme heat, as they have great ventilation and grip. I highly recommend these!",

They almost wear like a light tennis shoe and had great traction for the rock hopping I was doing all day. Can't say enough good about them!",

I bought expensive waterproof shoes that, in the end, only retained water instead of repelling it & water sandals that blistered my feet no matter how long I wore them. These shoes are perfect for my specific needs, except that I only get a year\u2019s wear out of them. The picture shows the flaws after a years worth of wear, hence the 4 stars. I guess my point is...c\u2019mon Merrell. There are tons of gardeners & landscapers that are dedicated to your high priced shoe. Why not make one that lasts a little longer?",

It felt like maybe at one point it was meant to be a closed shoe with padding (a waterproof and not a mesh) and then they just took it out and called it a new shoe. They are very roomy but I have small feet. I would have had to lace them very tight to get a snug feel like other shoes. They just felt unfinished. What was there was a great Merrell quality, just didn't seem finished on the inside.",

Sad! Still, I gave it a four star rating because I love my first pair so much - comfy and awesome as a water shoe or warm weather hiking/outdoor shoe.",

First, the arch support is inadequate for me, so I do supplement with other insoles.

This shoe works for all kinds of terrain, but the shoe seems wider than the others I have. So I wear heavier socks, which isn't what I intended for a breathable WP shoe. Still very happy with this pair which I will bring to Europe in the near future (cobblestone streets and lengthy walks).",

About to leave for a backpacking tomorrow and these are the only shes I'm bringing.",

They are great water shoes but tiny rocks kept falling into the shoe and ultimately the stitching at the bottom near my arches are what caused the blisters. I think these shoes would be good for shorter water hikes but were definitely not ideal for the narrows. Wouldn't recommend :(",

I've also worn them running with socks. It's the perfect do-it-all active travel shoe.",

After extended, rugged use, wash with mild soap and warm water. Be sure to rinse all soap off as it is hydrophilic. Drying: open footwear fully, remove the insole and laces and dry at room temperature. Never expose to heat! Conditioning: recommended treatment depends on construction and materials of the footwear (most treatments do alter color and appearance).",
