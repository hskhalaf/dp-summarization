The clarity of the controls and how they operate is already giving me a much improved insight into the photographic process. The leaf shutter and integrated flash work particularly well together. A valuable supplement to a quality DSLR with zoom lenses rather than an alternative.",

I ended up returning it and getting a Ricoh gr for \u00a3400. Same results and you get used to the slower auto focus. Save some money and get a gr",

      "text": "Absolutely delighted with this compact camera. Did a lot of research before buying and everything from build quality, user interface, controls and image quality is outstanding. Yes, it has a fixed lens and this maybe a constraint for some. Personally I think it\u2019s a strength and bear in mind that there is a teleconverter at 50mm and 70mm within the menu interface. Love the film simulation options and the 1:1 format, if you decide to shoot at this ratio. Also got the Fuji lenshood and adapter ring to add protection along with a UV filter to protect the excellent lens. I could go on and on about this camera..... I love it!!!!!!",

      "text": "So much potential but for me didn\u2019t quite make it. Daft as it sounds the Q menu button is in the wrong place just where your thumb rests so I kept turning on the menu which was annoying. I believe you can disable the button, but what\u2019s the point? On a positive note it\u2019s got a great wheel for adjusting functions. The image quality of the two Fuji\u2019s I have had are for me questionable, I can\u2019t say I hate them but there\u2019s always something I am not too happy with. Hard to put a finger on. I think it needs another iteration, the 100 G or whatever with a few changes and it could become really good.",
