I could not figure out this was the culprit the first time when my puppy had diarrhea. After weeks of bland diet, shedding and weight loss finally got him back on healthy condition. Used this as a training treat second time and he had no other treats other than this and his regular kibble. Triggered diarrhea again.",

At one treat a day, the bag could easily last 2 to 3 months. I decided to take some treats to work, I am an Animal Control Officer. So far dogs of all breeds, sizes, and temperments seem to enjoy them. I can give them to other people's dogs with confidence because all of the indredients are easy to read and are identifiable.",

They only last her a few minutes, but they're great for trying to catch the naughty little thing when she doesn't want to be caught. I walk over to the closet where they're kept and she's instantly on my heels. These have saved me when my very intelligent, difficult-to-train pet tries to outmaneuver me and can easily outrun me. For this price, they're a great deal. Highly recommend!",

The air bubble packing, was just lauded on top of the whole order. Worst part is there was a book in my order that was to be a gift, the cover is ripped, and the crumbs from the dog treats were all through the book, leaving greasy spots. So disgusted with Amazon at this point, Poor packing has become the norm.",
