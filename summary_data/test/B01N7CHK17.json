I actually prefer it as it has this fabulous flat end that works great for blending and really applying foundation smoothly. Save your money and get this, its a wonderful set!!!",

I was it regularly with the black Beauty Blender solid cleanser, and it came clean every time. This time, I went back for the 2-in-1 box, since it came with a smaller, Beauty Blender-sized one. I will be ordering again. In case you are curious, I have this in a rotation with my black Beauty Blender, and I plan on reordering both since I use each of them for different products.",

    "title": "EcoTools Perfecting Blender Duo, 2 Beauty Sponges for Flawless Foundation Coverage",
    "description": "Style Name:Perfecting Blender DuoThe Perfecting Blender Duo is designed with EcoFoam Technology in two sizes and densities to create a camera ready look. The Large Base Blender is soft and flexible to create light, buildable makeup application. The Mini Detail Blender is firmer for more precise and detailed coverage. We've always believed in the power of beauty. At EcoTools we encourage you to embrace your own individual meaning of beauty and share it with the world, whether it is makeup tutorials, an inspirational story or giving back to the community. Because when you feel truly beautiful, you will make the world and everyone around you feel beautiful! Armed with a mission to make women look beautiful on the outside and feel just as good on the inside, sisters Jen and Stacey set out to create a brush collection that was not only nature friendly, but chic, high-quality, and affordable too. After sourcing recycled materials, renewable bamboo and better manufacturing processes, in 2007, EcoTools was born. This year, we\u2019re celebrating EcoTools\u2019 10th anniversary by introducing a fresh new look, brushes that feel even better in your hands, and packaging with detailed tutorials that make it easier than ever to create a beautiful look from hair to toe. We\u2019re also marking a decade of living beautifully by making a $100,000 donation to Glamour\u2019s The Girl Project via our #MyTrueBeauty campaign that supports women\u2019s empowerment and encourages women to become the best version of themselves. We believe in giving a new purpose to old things. That\u2019s why our products are made from recycled aluminum and plastic. Our packaging is made of 100% Tree-Free paper. HOW? With 20% cotton and 80% bamboo fibers! The handles on our products are made of renewable bamboo, one of the fastest growing plants on the planet!",
