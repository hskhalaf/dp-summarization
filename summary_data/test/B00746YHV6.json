I multitask like crazy including multiple browsers and video/photo editing, this handles it with no problems ever. Extensive traveling the whole time and not a scratch. I'll be upgrading to the newest version from Apple with 8gb ram and the core i7 purely for video editing reasons, otherwise this laptop would easily last another 2 years as is. Fan only comes on after editing video for a while otherwise it's completely silent. I would give this laptop 6 stars if I could because it's worth every penny.",

The back-lit keyboard really takes a crap on the battery life so try to keep it off when not using it. There is a button for turning back-lit keyboard on and off do this shouldn't be an issue. You can also adjust the settings in mavericks to only turn on the back-lit keyboard when typing.",

With DVD and CD's on the way out there seems no call to lug the added bulk an optical drive adds. Note: I bought a Square Trade Warrantee this time around instead of Applecare; hopefully I won't need it, but Applecare is overpriced in my view. It's been helpful for my Mac Pro's, but for a portable product, the Square Trade deal covers possible disasters Applecare omits.",

One thing that should be noted is the compatibility between MS Office and Apples productivity suite. It leaves something to be desired, if transitioning from MS Office the purchase of Office for Mac seems a necessity to me. Another thing to note when purchasing and considering price is the number of thunderbolt adapters and/or a superdrive that you may need to purchase. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.",

The size, quality, & price point make this a great buy for anyone looking for a smaller laptop and I would highly recommend.",

Not recommended for gaming, or running heavy load.",

    "title": "Apple MacBook Air MD711LL/A 11.6-Inch Laptop (OLD VERSION)",
    "description": "TheApple 11.6 In. MacBook Air Notebook Computer is an ultra light weight notebook computer. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68 inches -- it tapers down to 0.11 In. at its thinnest.The system has 128GB of flash storage instead of old-fashioned hard drive. That gives impressive battery life -- up to 9 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light made from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means.The 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency.Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 4th-gen, low-voltage Haswell 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of onboard 1600MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi(also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers.The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you wont lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no centra\n\nAMAZON.COM",
