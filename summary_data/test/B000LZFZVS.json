The aspirator is crap. You can't even squeeze it. I'm not sure what the purpose of the rattle is. If I wanted to distract my kid I would have something much more interesting- even a mirror would work better. You probably won't even need the two toothbrushes that are included- I got a training toothbrush and it's a lot better. Overall, I would say definitely order the pieces separately and make a gift basket that way.",
