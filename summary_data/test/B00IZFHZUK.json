Problem here is that changing speeds on most drill presses is a PITA with the pulleys and all. so i went to a variable speed hand drill & it worked just fine. Slower speeds seem to be best. Also don't be fooled by some of the videos saying running these bits in reverse gives you a clean cut....it doesn't.",
