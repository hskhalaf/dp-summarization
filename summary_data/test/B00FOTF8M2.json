      "text": "Excellent full frame camera. Upgraded from the nikon d5200. All my photos are taken now with this camera and the nikon 50mm 1.8 lens (prime lens). Could be better in low light as you seem to get a little noise when you crank the iso up, but if you are planing to shoot when there is plenty of light you will get great images. If your planning on shooting in low light situations, like lots of weddings you should probably bump up to the d750. This camera fit my budget and was a wonderful buy, stepped up my game big time. 5 stars would recommend to others.",

I would argue the best value full frame camera. If you're looking to upgrade from your crop sensor, look no further.",

    "title": "Nikon D610 24.3 MP CMOS FX-Format Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)",
    "description": "Style:Body Only| Configuration:BaseThe Nikon D610 Digital SLR Camera has the power of a 24.3 MP Nikon FX-format CMOS sensor in a compact, streamlined HD-SLR body. Create brilliant full frame images and 1080p videos. Capture every detail in stunning clarity with Nikon's superior 39 point AF system with Scene Recognition. Additional features include: 6 FPS burst shooting, 3.2-inch LCD, ISO expandable to 25,600, plus much more. Focus lock: Focus can be locked by pressing shutter-release button halfway (single-servo AF) or by pressing AE-L/AF-L button.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nFeel the power of a 24.3 MP Nikon FX-format CMOS sensor in a compact, HD-SLR body. Create dazzling full-frame images rivaled only by Nikon's D800 series D-SLR and 1080p Full HD videos. Nikon's superior 39-point AF system and Scene Recognition System means details will be clear and crisp\u2014for static or moving subjects. HD video quality rivals more expensive dedicated video cameras. Nikon FX-format quality has never been more attainable.\n\nEXPERIENCE THE PASSION OF NIKON FULL-FRAME PHOTOGRAPHY.\nThe power of a pro-level Nikon FX-format camera\u2014dazzling full-frame images, broadcast-quality 1080p video at your fingertips, superior low-light performance, faster frame rate up to 6 frames-per-second (fps), tack sharp autofocus with 39 focus points, built-in flash with Commander Mode, wireless photo sharing and much more\u2014is attainable in a compact, lightweight full-frame HD-SLR body. A new continuous quiet mode lets you capture a sequence of shots without the noise associated with the raising and lowering of the D-SLR's mirror. Optimized for full-frame shooting, streamlined for compactness and value, the D610 will fuel your photographic passion like never before.\n\n\n\nNIKON'S FULL-FRAME SENSOR RAISES THE BAR ON IMAGE QUALITY\nSTUNNING DETAIL AND NIKKOR LENSES\nPassionate photographers who seek uncompromised full-frame, high-resolution performance rely on Nikon FX-format HD-SLRs. With a level of performance only bested by Nikon's own D800 series D-SLRs, D610's 24.3 megapixel FX-format CMOS sensor, wide dynamic range and high S/N (signal-to-noise) ratio captures every detail with lifelike sharpness and low noise throughout its wide ISO range. Low-light performance is synonymous with Nikon\u2014shoot crystal clear images from ISO 100 to 6400, expandable down to 50 and up to 25,600 for extreme situations. EXPEED 3 processing system manages all that data with remarkable speed and accuracy, enabling up to 6 fps continuous shooting at full resolution in both FX and DX formats. Whether shooting people, landscapes or close-ups\u2014you'll marvel at D610's faithful color reproduction. Add Nikon's newest selection of affordable fast f/1.8 primes, compact wide ratio zooms with VR image stabilization or tele- and supertelephoto lenses and you'll see the full potential that the D610 offers.\n\nREMARKABLE AF PERFORMANCE WITH COMPATIBILITY UP TO F/8\nF/8 SENSITIVITY BENEFITS ACTION AND WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY\nOne of the keys to capturing razor-sharp images is a fast, precise autofocus system, and the D610 has one of the best. 39 tightly packed focus points with wide-area AF coverage offer endless compositional possibilities. Nine cross-type sensors in the center offer superior accuracy even when light and contrast are scarce. Seven center focus points work all the way down to f/8 for extended AF functionality with teleconverters and long-reach lenses. Switch between 9, 21 or 39 point AF, allowing for compositional freedom. D610's Scene Recognition System's subject identification and tracking information means enhanced performance by 3D Tracking and Auto Area AF. When shooting photos or HD video in Live View, Nikon\u2019s responsive contrast-detect AF activates for accurate fulltime autofocusing.\n\nEXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY\nFLAWLESS METERING AND ONBOARD INTELLIGENCE\nThe D610 delivers consistently beautiful images, thanks to Nikon's intelligent Scene Recognition System with 3D Color Matrix Metering II. Its 2,016 pixel RGB sensor evaluates every scene, taking into account brightness, contrast, subject distance and the scene colors, all within the time it takes to press the shutter release button. That data is then referenced against an onboard image database for consistently accurate exposures, auto white balance, i-TTL flash and subject-tracking autofocus performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBROADCAST-QUALITY FULL HD VIDEO AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\nTWO VIDEO FORMATS IN ONE CAMERA\nNikon is committed to developing HD-SLRs that empower and inspire filmmakers and video enthusiasts, and the D610 is proof of that. Shoot 1080p HD videos with selectable frame rates of 30p, 25p or 24p and MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 compression. Bend time with 720p HD at 60p, 50p or 30p for ultra-smooth video playback of fast moving subjects, or create slow-motion footage during post processing. Manually adjust ISO, shutter speed and aperture, activate Live View shooting's fulltime AF with face-priority and subject tracking or manually focus. Experience dedicated inputs for an optional stereo mic and headphones for monitoring sound, still image exporting, uncompressed recording of video via HDMI out to an external recorder, simultaneous live view on external monitors and much more. Multi-area mode Full HD D-Movie gives you compositional freedom using FX or DX movie formats. Enhance your video with the dramatic perspectives and depth-of-field control of Nikon's full line of NIKKOR interchangeable lenses, and you'll dazzle with every video project.\n\nWI-FI CAMERA CONTROL AND MOBILE SHARING\nOPTIONAL WU-1B WIRELESS MOBILE ADAPTER\nWith Wi-Fi compatibility, sharing photos is easier than ever. Connect the optional WU-1b Wireless Mobile Adapter and wirelessly transfer photos to your smartphone, tablet or any compatible Wi-Fi enabled device. Use your smartphone to instantly upload your shots to the web or email them to a friend. Install Nikon's free Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility and remotely control the D610\u2014and shoot from your smartphone or tablet!\n\nLIGHTING STUDIO OPTIONAL\nThe D610's built-in pop-up flash offers up new shooting possibilities that other cameras simply can't match\u2014and not just in low-light situations. Even well lit subjects can benefit from a balanced fill flash for extra depth and dimension. And since the D610's flash integrates with Nikon's i-TTL system, it can act as a Commander and communicate crucial exposure information to two groups of remote flashes across three channels for accurate lighting and exceptional results. When you need the extra power, add an optional accessory Nikon Speedlight for more lighting possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPLIED ACCESSORIES\n *  EN-EL15 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery\n *  MH-25 Quick Charger\n *  UC-E15 USB Cable\n *  BM-14 LCD Monitor Cover\n *  DK-21 Rubber Eyecup\n *  AN-DC10 Strap\n *  DK-5 Eyepiece Cap\n *  BF-1B Body Cap\n *  BS-1 Accessory Shoe Cap\n *  NikonView NX2 CD ROM",
