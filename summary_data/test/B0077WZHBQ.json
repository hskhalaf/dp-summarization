Also the single screw pin which is supposed to keep the umbrella from moving in the stand is not strong enough to hold it tight. Had to downgrade to four stars.",

They are rusting so bad that there are now rust spots on my pool deck. So, now I have to treat the rust and repaint the stands. I would have given these stands 5 stars if the paint held up.",
