      "text": "I have only had this for two days but, so far, I'm really disappointed. It moves in such a random pattern that 70% of the room gets vacuumed while 30% doesn't. It goes over and over and over the same areas while totally neglecting the other un-vacuumed areas. Even on a hallway, where I would expect it to travel in a straight line up and back, it just goes its zig-zag merry way. I am going to have to get my vacuum cleaner out and do all the areas this missed. I might as well just do the vacuuming myself. If it improves, I'll update this post.",
