However, the documentation that came with it isn't very specific about which way the races and spacers go. I don't work on bicycles for a living and this is the first headset I replaced. I had to do a bit of internet searching before I could find a picture detailed enough to show how everything fit together. Experienced mechanics might laugh at me, but other do-it-yourselfers might have the same problem. A good picture or diagram in the enclosed documentation would have saved me a lot of time.",

Recommend having a bike mechanic \"chase and face\" the head tube and fork crown to make sure the surfaces are flat and parallel before installation, and don't forget to use antiseize when installing the cups and crown race.",

To avoid damage to the crown race and cups, you should have access to a crown race setting tool and cup press. These are available on Amazon as Park Tool CRS-1 and Park Tool HHP-2. With these two tools, installation is straight forward. When I inquired at my Local Bike Shops about the price of installation of a headset, it was an easy decision to purchase the two tools (especially since I had a headset to install on a second bike). Quality and performance of the headset is excellent.",
