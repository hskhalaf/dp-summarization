I would work on the basics with the gel pad and perhaps try on a banana due to its thick skin. As for ththe instruments, they're not no OR german stainless steel. But they work for ththe most part. Just wish the mayo scissors were better and the kit had a adsin added to it. I over all recommend it to beginners",

The forceps, have huge teeth, the needle holder is of poor quality and doesn\u2019t hold or control the grip on the needle, the needle spins on the needle holder. The suture needles are rather small. The Pad, most important, rips very easily and the precut incisions, are not deep enough to do a deep tissue layer, like you would do in an ortho closure. Waste of money.",
