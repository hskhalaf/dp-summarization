He could eat a whole package at once, in fact he stole a whole package and I didnt figure out until our room smelled like shrimp from the leftover packaging he didnt eat. It's very smelly but my kitty loves them, and they are healthy so I give him a hand full at a time. Now side note, other treats as $1-2 these are 3 sometimes 4 dollars. Also the value pack is the same size as a regular you can buy at walmart cheaper. Would recommend them lower the price here on amazon. Other than that I love the product!",

The little shrimps are weirdly puffed up and look artificial. The Purebites shrimps are real little shrimps dried. These look like they are made from some manufacturing process. I would have given 1 star but my cats like them just fine. So the flavor must be fine. I just don't like that they don't seem like real shrimp",
