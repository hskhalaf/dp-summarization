      "title": "Fits boots AND helmet!",
      "text": "Ordered this two days before a trip when I realized my plan to cram my boots and helmet in my board bag was a non-starter - it's great! I was able to juuuuuust barely fit my helmet in on top of my boots if I pushed down on the helmet while slowly securing the zipper. A little bit of dead space in the toe area is perfect for a beanie and my neck gaiter, and there's a little pocket in the front for headphones, handwarmers, etc. The fabric is thick and sturdy - it feels very nice for an inexpensive bag,. Great purchase!",

This bag is very well made and has held up well (he's been using it for a little over 1 month and skis with his school ski club and well as family trips). We are very happy with the quality of this bag. The adjustable straps are nice for him, there is also plenty of additional room in side the bag for accessories (gloves, socks, neck gaitors, etc).",

Seems like it would fit a larger size boot. I can fit an extra shirt, towel, goggles in the bag (smaller items). Strong material and stylish. Three holes for venting located at the bottom with a tarp like plastic on the bottom that feels a tad thin. I could see that ripping at some point after many uses or getting caught on something sharp. Yet to test that theory out though, it could be stronger than I think. Great bag for the price!",
