The only thing we don't like is the loud beeping noise--especially when riding at the park, the ground is less smooth and the hoverboard will beep loudly often. Please make this product with low volume of beeping sound... We really like the functionality of this product.",

It gains speed fairly quickly, and rides smooth at fast speeds on even surfaces while battery is fully charged. Going fast at 1/3 battery life shows some restraint(which is normal) when hitting an upward slope so I would recommend keeping the battery charged 2/3 or more if you want a high speed, smooth ride.. Do not go full speed with low battery life, it will throw you forward if you push it and hit a slight incline.",
