I had two extra monitors hooked up to my laptop and was wizzing away and being all productive and stuff. ... and then it stopped working. =( About 2 months after I started using it, the displays would no longer register. I could still power my laptop through the USB-C, but NO other functionality worked. No displays, no headphone jack, no extra USB-C slot. I LOVED this thing while it was working. But I don't think it's realistic to buy it every two months =(",
