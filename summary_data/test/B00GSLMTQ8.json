Trying to hub a printer, a USB cable for charging a phone, and 2 to 4 Solid State external drives . . . only the printer and cable worked . . . no connection with SSDs. To make matters worse, Sally (CS Support MANAGER) offered me a measly 20% refund and told me that my \"normal\" devices were exceeded the hub's capacity . . . ridiculous! I solved the issue by returning the hub to Amazon for a FULL refund, then ordering a competing hub, which works flawlessly with the same devices.",

      "text": "I bought this hub to use with my Apple MacBook Pro. It has 13 ports plus a charging port which I love. It charges my devices super fast. I have about half of the ports occupied and I have not had any issues with it at all. It transfers data very quickly. It has a built in surge protector. All my devices work simultaneously. Its small and does not take up much room. I have it Velcro'd on to the back of my Apple monitor out of site. It can also be turned off with a button.",
