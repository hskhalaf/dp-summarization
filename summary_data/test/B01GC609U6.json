I reached out to Victorinox regarding the issue and their warranty requires sending the item in for repair to MO ($50 shipping) and providing a credit card so they can charge for the repair if they deem it's not covered under warranty. Futhermore, there's some additional \"processing\" fees involved. This is the last time I'll purchase anything from this company. The carry-on is NOT well made and overpriced. The \"warranty\" is a joke. Lesson learned.",

I carried to my condo in Crested Butte where it remained for 5 days in conditioned space. I picked it up and carried it to the car for a trip home. When I reached the airport in Gunnison there was this huge crack in one corner. All the protocol was followed with the standard response this was \"normal wear and tear and not covered by warranty\", which is bunk. These folks are not honest and do not stand behind their product. Caveat Emptor",

It IS a great roller and even though the casing itself is flexible, it is REALLY strong. It's definitely a sturdy suitcase and having four rollers is fantastic. It's functionality for packing leaves a lot to be desired, though. Seriously; get packing cubes to go with this case and you'll be a lot happier with it.",

There is a $50.00 in house transaction fee plus my cost for shipping the total of $278.00 for a suit case I paid on sale for $280.00 The suit case needs to be replaced the wheel on one side is broken off the case is cracked on one side and the other side was bad lee dented So my opinion the warranty is worthless SO by cheep and replace when needed",
