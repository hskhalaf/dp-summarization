      "text": "We have a number of Cuisinart small appliances as we've always found the brand to have excellent products...until now. The HM-70 hand mixer has a design flaw in which the beater attachment will not securely lock and hold into place. In reading other Amazon reviews of this product, I see other customers experienced the same issue. Would not recommend purchasing this mixer due to the issue as I now can't use it. Shouldn't have upgraded my old (and cheaper) hand mixer without all the extras as it never had issues or stopped working after years of use............... Attempted contacting Cuisinart via their website, but their product inquiry forms will not go through. Not helpful!",

Mixing gobs (whoopie pies) is not an especially demanding task. The descriptions says this will mix cookie dough which is much denser and requires more torque.

      "text": "I read several reviews and shopped around before settling on this mixer. It feels sturdy and the beaters come in and out easily. It stores nicely and is very responsive to adjustments in speed. The problem is that the motor just doesn't stand-up to use in thicker batters. I read others saying they made double batches of cookies with ease, but that certainly wasn't my experience. Even single batches of a thick dough or large batches of thin items like brownies left a burning odor in the air.",

Standard beaters and a whisk attachment were included with my mixer. Also, I would recommend purchasing the dough hook attachments if you work with thicker or heavier batters. The dough hooks are great for mixing cookies (I'll use the standard beaters for creaming the butter and sugar, and then switch to the dough hooks when it is time to incorporate the flour).",

Really convenient for one-hand operation while turning the bowl. Haven't used it yet for whipping up egg whites for a stiff meringue. If it does that as well, I will rate it a 5.",

      "text": "Just got this yesterday and was so excited that I had to bake a cake to try it out! I have a BIG KitchenAid stand mixer, but wanted something handier. I was blown away by the Cuisinart 7 Speed! In a couple seconds the oil/eggs/water was completely blended, and then the batter was soft and smooth in no time at all! LOVE the slow start feature! And I like that I can turn it OFF without going back down all the speeds. I love this so much, I'm thinking about giving one as a Christmas gift!",

      "text": "This mixer was recommended by \"America's Test Kitchen\" and since their testing and recommendations have yet to disappoint I followed their recommendation. Mixer is easy to handle, the speed control very simple to operate, and it does a beautiful job if you follow the speed and attachment recommendations in the accompanying recipe book. Also comes with the whisk attachment, which I have not used, and a plastic spatula that looks as though it will be useless. The beaters are a dream to clean after a lifetime of dealing with beaters that have a center post. All in all an excellent purchase that I highly recommend.",

The power advantage works great for chocolate chip cookies and mashed potatoes.",
