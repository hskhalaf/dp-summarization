A cable I then ordered from Canons did not work and my IT advisor found it was not compatable with Windows XP which I use. The only way then I can transfer from this camera to computor is via a card reader. Very inconvenient. None of this was explained in the instructions.",

Bought the same camera at the airport for the same price as I paid for it here. Camera takes some getting used to but has some great modes. The only negative I have to say about it is that if the battery dies on you, all pictures are deleted on the memory card. This was to my lesson as I lost the first 4 days of a 2 week trip to Sri Lanka.",

The engine inside is the same as last year's G7X but in a smaller more convenient body. The pictures come out well in auto. The manual mode is quite complex so I haven't really bothered but this is the best pocked sized camera out there - great for snaps on the fly!",
