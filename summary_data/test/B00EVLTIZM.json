Slight elasticity is snug but does not restrict. Size is definitely off. I read other reviews and bought large instead of medium. Usually, I'm a 36B and had bought medium before. No way. Sooo tight.

      "text": "Well, after reading glowing reviews from blessed ladies I decided to try these. I'm a 40F generally and the XL size was in no way a good fit. The band was too big and the cup too small. The problem with these types of bras is that there is not enough room for the ladies to stay in the right spot, and no side support to keep them out of your armpit. I would not recommend unless you have very shapely assest already.",

I do wish that the chest band could be lined or lightly padded with a material even more soothing than the very nice cotton in the rest of the bra. However, if you do not have super sensitive skin, these are wonderful bras. Breathable and absorbing as only cotton can do.",

This cotton blend is the answer. It's also well made and still supports in the right places. Going to order more colors.",
