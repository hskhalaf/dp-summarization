My hammers have the blue rubber molded handles and usually come loose after a few years of heavy use. I am impressed and she likes the smaller size.",

To be honest, I mainly purchased it because I thought it looked cool but as time has gone on, the handle has softened up and it's my go-to hammer. The grip does start off slippery compared to your everyday hammer but it will \"break-in\" and not only look better, it starts to have a better grip. The head of the hammer is still nice and rounded after thousands of hammering blows. This will probably be one of those tools I get to hand off to my boys when they get older, as long as I don't lose it!",

Its a bad business decision that one of the top two home improvement big box stores took these off their shelf in place of a brand of hammers of lower quality. This hammer is perfect for small to medium size jobs and even suitable for nailing picture frame mounts.",

If i bought it again i would probably go with the rubber handle.
