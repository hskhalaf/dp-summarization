My Dunlops lasted around 2k miles before they were worn out to the point of needing replaced. I'm not doing burnouts or riding that hard either so idk what to say about dunlop.

I commute 30+ miles each way to and from work, and have been for the last 6 months and the tires appear to be near new! I'm shocked as I am used to replacing tires every 6 months on my R6.

Plenty of grip and no bouncing, excessive noise, or air loss. I do not ride my Honda VT1100C in the rain so can't speak to how the Kenda handles the wet surfaces.

I near the Appalachians in VA, so I ride mainly windy mountain roads. I've leaned the bike far enough over to scrape the lower fairings of my Ninja 500R without loosing grip. I wouldn't want to try that in colder weather or on even slightly wet roads. Pros: Grip fairly well Decent life Cheap!!!! Cons: Sketchy wet grip",
