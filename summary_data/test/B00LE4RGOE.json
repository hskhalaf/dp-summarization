I had to give seedlings away, and even composted some that never found a home. So far, I\u2019ve had carrots, radishes, cucumber, zucchini, beans, peas and a variety of leafy green harvested. All tasted delicious. Best of all, I still have A LOT of seeds left to continue to plant with.",

Looking forward to the next round with different veggies. Great selection and amazing amount of seeds too.",

I wanted to get this as it offered Non-GMO variety options of 32 different products. He has planted and started growing seedlings to plant when Spring comes around. So far, each of the seeds have sprouted and are going well. The seeds are in individual, labeled packages that come in a larger vacuumed sealed pack. I appreciated the instructions and growing guide as I am not as experienced as my brother and I'm also growing seedlings. Great gift.",

I figured it would be a while before I saw activity, but these beans sprouted after just 5 days. Also, I started various seeds on a south facing window sill and the germination rate is not to be underestimated. I plan to sow less seeds to avoid having to thin so many out next time. I'm new to this and these seeds made it so easy. My garden brings me a lot of joy in these hard times, so thank you.",

I wasn\u2019t sure these would germinate, so I only planted a few seeds of the beets, broccoli, okra, eggplant and butternut squash. I germinated outside in partial sun and initially covered. As you can see from the picture the seeds sprouted in only 4 days. (Still waiting on the eggplant to germinate, but to be fair the germination time is usually 7 to 14 days). So, I practically have 100% germination. I live in a tropical climate (which is currently 80-90 degree Fahrenheit currently). I\u2019m happy I invested in these seeds. I will now plant more seeds. :-)",
