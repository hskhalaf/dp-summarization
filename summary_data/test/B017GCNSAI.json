Summer Infants with flashlight was very bulky and hard to use, Summer Infant without flashlight (part of 1st aid kit) broke after a few uses. Frida baby nail clippers makes baby's nail fray and hard to make smooth ends (makes baby's nails jagged) & the curved end makes it so you can't clip nails front all directions. This nail clipper is relatively easy to hold & use. It hasn't broken yet after a few months of use",

My old ones were so small and slippery that I'd finally get him to stay still and then they would slip so I'd jump back to avoid getting his fingers. These are sharp, so only one try clips the nail easily. Perfect size, and so easy to hold! No slip!! They seem like decent quality, but honestly I'd be willing to but a new one every few weeks to keep his little hands safe. I feel so much more comfortable now!",

They also did relatively nothing to trim down the newborn paper-like long nails...not matter what angle I tried, they would NOT clip anything. These may work ok for older babies, but wish I had gone with the nail scissors for my needs instead of purchasing these.",

I received numourous emails from Rhoost basically begging for a review. 1 email is a big turn off for me to review in the first place, but 4 in the last week and they started coming once a day! While I love this product in fact I have 2 the amount of harassing emails after purchasing is enough to turn me off from purchasing from this company again. If you don't like tons of emails begging for reviews don't order these.",
