We thought the costume was fluffy enough that she wouldn't be able to squeeze thru.... we were wrong \ud83e\udd23. My daughter had to call her neighbor and ask him to go in his backyard and catch her Hot Dog and bring it back to her house. The costume was well worth the money for all the hilarity. Also Lady Bird LOVES wearing her Hot Dog!",

Nothing fits him right! Especially if it is only to be worn for a couple times a year, it is worth the price.",

The item is bulky, but light weight. I live in the deep South so I only kept my pooch in it for the 30 minute event. It would be perfect for Halloween night where it gets a bit chilly. Great fit.
