      "text": "Very solid and comfortable. It looks like a lot of thought was put into it. I love the smooth swivel feature, the padded seat & arms, and also the movable arms feature to allow easy side loading/unloading. This is probably the safest transfer bench as the other benches I have seen on amazon have cheap slippery hard plastic seats, where one can slide off. Comes with a seatbelt for even more security. The chair locks into place at either end. A feature I would have liked to have is adjustable sliding rods. I would have liked to adjust the length for a little more sliding room. Overall, a very high quality product and worth the investment.",

Easy to assemble - the concept is good, but the seat is not deep enough (even as little as she is), she slides forward and the arm handles need to be taller as she leans from side to side and she could fall off from the side. Unless there are two of us positioning her on the chair, it would easily topple over as there is no way to firmly stabilize it. For the money, it could be sturdier -",

While he's still adapting, he feels more secure, a bit more independent and is able to bathe without the fear of falling,",

This allows me to keep him safe without having to replace the tub with a shower because it allows me to slide him across the tub edge and use the wand shower.

      "- PROFESSIONAL GRADE sliding transfer bench, bath and shower chair. Effortless sliding and pivoting for safe, easy transfers in and out of the tub. Platinum Health products are used in thousands of hospitals, nursing homes and in private homes by customers who value quality, safety, convenience and comfort over price. Note: OPTIONAL LEG EXTENSION KITS AND HORIZONTAL TRAVEL EXTENSION KITS ALSO AVAILABLE.",
      "-PADDED SEAT, BACK AND ARMRESTS. No more cold, slippery, hard plastic parts like old-style bath chairs; the Carousel provides warm to the touch, comfortable, slip resistant padding on all main components. The medical-grade, closed-cell molded polyurethane padding will not absorb any water and is easy to clean and disinfect. Quick TOOLS-LESS assembly in less than 5 minutes.",
      "-SWIVEL-SEAT SPACE SAVING DESIGN. Not only is the swivel seat safer, easier to use and more comfortable than a standard fixed seat, this design means that the chair protrudes into the room much less than a traditional transfer bench. More convenient for the user, and more convenient for others that don\u2019t require use of the chair since the free space in the bathroom is much greater.",
      "-ROBUST, PIVOTING ARM RESTS. The padded arm rests can be raised and lowered and locked into place. Unlike standard chairs with no armrests, the robust armrests on the Carousel can be used as leverage points to help the user into and out of the chair. They also provide important additional physical and psychological support against slips and falls and fear of slips and falls.",
      "-HI CONTRAST COLOR FOR SAFETY. Our unique HI-VIEW BLUE color makes the key parts of the chair much easier to see by vision impaired and/or dementia afflicted users. Rather than blending in with the background like old-style white benches, the blue contrast color helps users distinguish the chair from its surroundings and significantly reduces slips, trips and falls- the leading cause of death by injury in people over 65."
