The R and L buttons on the joycons (the bumpers) are constantly being pressed inside the case because it's too tight ( which is why I had to store the switch upside down to avoid this problem) I think what people have been giving 4 or 5 starts was a different version, because this is garbage and shouldn't be recommended by Amazon or certified by Nintendo. This is in my opinion a blatant bait and switch (no pun intended)",

The pouch isn't shown on the product pictures except for the mario and zelda cases but a black case with the zipper can be seen in the product description picture that compares this case to other cases and it can be seen in other customer posted pictures.",
