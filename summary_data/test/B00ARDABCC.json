Microsoft support suggested (it was a free support, but that the only good thing about the support - it's free, but that's all it is) and guided me to upgrade to Windows 8.1, as a results youtube video become choppy and bluetooth stop recognizing devices. So I was not able to give more than 3 stars for this product.",

The entire unit went flying off the desk and now we're stuck with a $1000 doorstop, as I'm sure a screen repair would be half the cost of the unit. If you buy it, stop at babies r us and get a dresser wall mount to attach to the back so it won't take a dive.",
