It certainly looks like it's made better than the previous generation of the T-fal wok. The hard anodized layer seems to be all around the wok now whereas the older model had only the nonstick coating on the inner cooking side. I'm cautiously optimistic.",

Yes, it's dishwasher safe, but cleaning by hand is a snap too. If you love to cook Mongolian BBQ, stir-fry, and the like, 10/10, would definitely recommend! Also, because it's non-stick...I would strongly recommend using wood or bamboo utensils so you don't damage the non-stick coating.",

Also, I found this a bit too big and heavy for a regular home-sized stove, especially for an electric one. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this pan unless you cook Wok food on one of those Chinese-style fire stove.",
