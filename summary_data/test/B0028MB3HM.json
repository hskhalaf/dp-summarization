      "text": "I love my Shark steam mop-did an awesome job on my tile!!!! I've owned 2 Shark steam mops in the past-loved them, but they quit after using them for about a year. However, I used tap water and Arizona has hard water, so I'm sure it's the minerals that eventually clogged the machine and contributed to it's failure-my fault. In the interim, I used another brand of steam mop, which was far inferior to the job the Shark did. I re-ordered this Shark steam mop after the last brand died, and I'm so impressed...again! Way more steam, bigger water tank, longer cord, and love that you can flip the head over for double cleaning with 1 cloth.",

Most spots require no additional scrubbing if allowed to be saturated in the steam for just a few seconds. As for the mop pad, just throw it in the washer, air dry, and voila!

      "text": "The only reason I am not \"in love\" with the steam mop is because the action to produce steam is odd and leads to inconsistent results. You have to pump the handle to produce steam, and continue pumping throughout the whole process. Not a very useful mechanic, and makes it seem like more work to actually mop. I was hoping it would function similar to the canister steamers: it would just produce steam the whole time. RECOMMENDATION: Get a steam-mop that actually produces steam without pumping or get a dedicated canister steamer.",

I have a microfiber mist mop for easy clean up but after a mess or two the microfiber mop just smells and spreads pee smell everywhere. I switched to a large duster and this shark steam mop for clean up. Has been a lifesaver and keeps our floors squeeky clean. Just make sure and protect your investment and use distilled water",

The water container doesnt come off but it comes with a little spout thing to make it easier to pour into the confainer which was no problem. The best part about this mop is that as you push and pull your mop it activates the steam so as your mopping its pretty much steaming. Not like some of the other ones where you have tonpress a button as you go. Overall this is a really good product that I would recommend to anyone with any floors other than carpet.",

There was some kind of loud POP from the mop. As you can imagine, I threw the mop down and unplugged it. Everything was okay, but I won't be using this mop anymore--not taking any chances. It did a decent job while it lasted.Now I have all these extra pads that are useless!",
