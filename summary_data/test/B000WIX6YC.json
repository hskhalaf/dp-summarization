I've owned enough of these to know it comes very tight and close but this one was way too small. Contacted GB, they basically want to take zero responsibility. This is the part where you have to ask yourself, do you want to spend double on a nice axe but backed by a company with very poor customer support? Not impressed with GB trying to blame the consumer for their QC issues.",

I bought mine for spoon carving because it's significantly less expensive than the carving hatchet. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy the carving hatchet because the bit is wider. When squaring a block of wood, mine doesn't cut the width of a block with one chop. I have to make multiple cuts to cover the width of a block. That's the only reason though.",

Truly a functional piece of art that I would not hesitate to take backpacking; a word to the wise, however: do your best to keep the steel dry as it can rust along the cutting edge. Speaking of which, this hatchet came out shaving sharp. Hope to pass this down in my family!",

    "description": "The Gransfors Wildlife Hatchet is a traditional scouting and camping axe, with the same head as the Hand Hatchet but on a longer handle. This longer handle lends the axe more power, not least when felling trees. Practical for carrying in your rucksack when you need a small axe with plenty of power. The axe is capable of lopping off quite large branches or splitting small logs for the campfire. The shape of the sheath, which covers the edge and the top part of the poll, stops the axe head cutting into your rucksack. The Axe Book comes with every axe purchased from Gransfors Bruk, Made in Sweden.",
