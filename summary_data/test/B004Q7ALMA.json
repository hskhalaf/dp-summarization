The photo is very misleading. For the price I expected a MUCH higher quality product in tearms of quality and finish. Extremely disappointed in the purchase. Strongly recommend looking at another manufacturer and a different bed frame. Still regretting not returning it as soon as I opened the box to see the poor craftmanship and packaging.",
