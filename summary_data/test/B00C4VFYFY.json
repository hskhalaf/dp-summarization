The sound is really good they sit in that in between area not quite Senn HD but better than the momentum 2.0 in a different way where practically every thing you listen to sounds good, natural, sound stage is wide for closed backs. They even take to amplification we\u2019ll hook it up to he amp / computer and they sound even better. Well any way this is my option and for under 200 when got these great buy.",

So, high quality sound for enjoying music, which is it's intended purpose! Pros: Well-built, sturdy, comfortable, natural sounding (recommended to be used with a hi-fi sound device of course!). Cons: none. (Maybe, just maybe, a slight lack on the bass response, but I prefer the bass to be less than ideal than more than ideal, which would be quite a nuisance).",

However, I kept reading reviews about the incredible sound of the H6's and just decided, if I was going to pull the trigger, I'd better get some good ones. Bottom line, I now look for excuses to use these because it's like entering a different world and all my music has become new again. I'm happy.",

The lambskin-memory foam cups are softer than described and provide a nice sound barrier. The fold-flat storage and bag works great in a backpack. Two months in and I still get excited to use them!",

The Vamp Verza does a great job of bringing detailed clean music to the H6 phones. The problem is th H6 are the most harsh sounding headphones on the planet. Sorry but to me B&O was always the Eurpopean Bose and they still are. Take my advise and avoid these headphones.",
