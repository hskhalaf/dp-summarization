With the depth only 6 inches and the small pull-out draw only 4 inches (see pictures) there are limits to what you can keep inside but nonetheless this is the perfect solution for those who need a writing desk but are limited on space. Love it! NOTE: when lifting up the drop-down desk to close, don\u2019t forget to secure the latch to avoid potential hazard of falling open unexpectedly.",

In the older houses like my mine have thicker less processed sheet rock so the anchors provided just tear up the wall and the screws are a little short to make it to the stud.",
