We looked at several tubs and this one is the same quality for 1/3 the price you will find at Ferguson\u2019s or any of the box stores. Their customer service is incredible. I accidentally broke the bottom drain flange and Woodbridge sent me a replacement part at no cost. Unbelievable customer service! I would strongly recommend any Woodbridge products.",

I was very apprehensive to purchase a bathtub from Amazon but after reading reviews and pricing local stores for this type of tub I decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised!!!!! I would highly recommend this tub to anyone who is in the market for a great produce at a great price. We added spray foam insulation to the inside walls of this tub to insulate it and keep the water warm longer, it worked great!!!!!",
