I mean it stretches out no longer than a foot and on top of that they quit using the curly cord because it always gets tangled up. Then you made it so that it can\u2019t be replaced with something more usable. Send everyone out replacement cords with instructions, or at least improve any others before you ship them. If I wasn\u2019t yanking the base up every time I answered I would be very pleased with this product. Everything else about the product is top shelf.",

Does anyone know how to program them ? Thanks,",

I ordered only three to test, and want to order more, but they seems to no longer be available which is a real shame, its an outstanding product.
