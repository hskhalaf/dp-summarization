Switched to another lessor known brand in a duck and sweet pea flour formula, she doesn't like that a whole lot better but at least she eats a little.

I'm giving the slightly higher end Wellness a try (Core), so fingers crossed. If that doesn't work I'll try Blue- or get some nose plugs for the next 6-months!",
