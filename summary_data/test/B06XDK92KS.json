I love the design: new touch screen key pad is effortless, I'm impressed by how super fast the new kindle refreshes and updates from my earlier models. I really like the asymmetrical shape which works ambidextrously. All in all I am more than impressed. The battery life - as mentioned by other reviewers is not an issue for me - I think I can read 18 -24 hours solidly before battery needs a top up. Pretty good. I am very happy and not missing my old kindles one bit.",

I read other reviews regarding battery life and to be honest I don't notice much of a difference from my previous paperwhite battery life. Thoroughly recommend this. Its the Bentley of e readers.",

Otherwise a costly alternative when maybe I had expected better. Battery life is pretty crucial and paying more for less is annoying.",

And with airplane mode on and in a normal indoor room it seems to last 5-7 hours before the battery dies. Waterproof is theoretically nice but single raindrops can cause the page to turn and a couple of raindrops seemed to stop the page turn buttons from working properly. But I do like the big screen and shape. Overall a nice experience. Other odd issue is that the thicker area seems highly magnetic - which gives me cause for concern. I try to avoid holding that thick magnetic side of the kindle.",

The zoom options work very well, and while the interface took me a little while to get used to compared to my old kindle (the one with the keyboard below the screen) it works exceptionally well. If you are in the market for an e-reader then this device is great, despite the pricetag.",

      "text": "Because my eyesight is deteriorating I bought this model in the hope that it would include the text to speech function of the original kindle with different voices . Sadly it did not and voiceview is temperamental and quite difficult to use. Providing good text to speech functionality would make the oasis perfect although I suspect this would make audible less desirable and, less profitable . Very good, clear display, good Bluetooth connectivity but it does eat battery life. Never having had good eyesight the kindles helped me to enjoy reading books again, and over the years the improvements in the kindles kept up with the worsening of my eyesight!",

One small criticism, a protective sleeve wouldn't go amiss. After spending a considerable amount of money I had to buy a sleeve as well.",

One of the worst features is the slippery plastic of the reader body, making it very difficult to hold (just about impossible with one hand and very easy to let it slip).Every time I try to use it I find myself going back to my paperwhite.",

      "text": "I orginally got the oasis when it was first released but there was a bug in the software not showing all books in my library, amazon had no clear date when it would be fixed so I sent it back for a refund. Fast forward to a year later I purchased it again hoping the bug would finally be fixed, and it was! What I like about the oasis is the premium feel, page turn buttons, audible, additional storage. If you want a premium e-reader this is the one to buy.",
