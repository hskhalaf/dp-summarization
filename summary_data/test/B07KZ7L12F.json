The start up is a bit sluggish, but the operation after that picks up speed. The power button on the side, near the front, is awkward; I have accidentally clicked the computer to sleep just by moving the machine.",

I do have a wish list of things I would like to redesign about it: - I wish it was a little faster - There are *NO* LED indicators. For example to indicate power or charging. Seriously. I've never seen a laptop that didn't have such indicators! - The power button is too easy to press by accident, especially when opening the display more than 180\u00b0 Update: the speed is really an issue at times but maybe it's partly because it's loaded with Windoze. I have a Linux desktop at home but want to keep at least one Windows machine because of the driver/software for my printer.",

I returned it to Sams and they credit me with no questions asked. By that time, the model was priced over $200 more. When I ordered the 11in 3000 series, the speed and performance were immediately noticeable. Unfortunately, I need the speed of the 7000 with the size of the 3000. I will keep this one for a few years and hope that the technology allows for my preference. Both units are great little portables.",
