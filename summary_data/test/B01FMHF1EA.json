After looking through various reviews I decided to go for these ones as the reviews seemed promising. The first pillow I took out was nice and plump and fitted snug in my pillow case. However the second one I took out was a bit more flat and didn't feel as filled so when it's in the pillow case it's a bit limp looking. I thought both pillows would be nice and plump so am a bit disappointed that the quality of the pillows are not consistent.",
