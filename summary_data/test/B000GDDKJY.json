My experience is that at least 50% of the bottles I purchase from third-party sellers - not just here, but other stores -- have sprayers that won't work. Since the bottle can't be opened to pour the liquid into another bottle, you're basically out $40 bucks or more. So be forewarned. Maybe Murad dumps their defective products for others to re-sell, I don't know.",

The spray bottle is super easy to use on yourself and though this doesn't smell like roses obviously, I totally recommend. Wish there was a bit more in the bottle (you can't exactly feel once it's empty and obviously this isn't cheap) but I definitely recommed using it!",

I've tried prescription topicals, medicated body washes, and oral treatments and this is by far the most effective product out of all of them. Also, the 360 spray is helpful in reaching my back. Definitely worth the money!",
