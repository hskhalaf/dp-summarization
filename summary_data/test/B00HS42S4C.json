When I ski (snowboard, actually), this had been a real problem. No longer. These warmers keep me warm all day, and if I crank them all the way up it gets TOO hot. I had tried a million different solutions before this, but none of the other warmers had helped. These WORK, and the installation is pretty easy. You can find many YouTube videos to help you. It takes about an hour.",

I wouldn't say your feet are toasty--but they aren't freezing...so that's a plus. After one season, the wires that connect from your boots to the battery packs are all fraying. It seems like at this price the wires should be sturdy enough to last more than one season. I'm hoping to get through this season without them breaking completely. Hoping there's some sort of warranty.",
