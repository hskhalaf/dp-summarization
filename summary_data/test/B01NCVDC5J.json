One full tank can last at least 24 hours of use, and the mist is fine enough that even if I accidentally toss something near it or have a body part pass over the spout I won't feel the spray or have whatever is near it get wet. There is also a pleasant burbling sound that's reminiscent of of gentle rain, which is really great for lulling me to sleep. The burbling sound isn't aggressive enough to make me want to go pee.",

He LOVES the nightlight (what a great addition to a humidifier)! It is simple to use and keep clean. The amount of mist that comes out is perfect for an average size bedroom. Our son loves to turn settings on humidifiers, but we don't run into that problem with this humidifier since there isn't that option (perfect for a kids room, especially for a 2 year old!). I also love the timer option, so that it doesn't run all night.",

The on/off button is VERY sensitive and sometimes I inadvertently turn it on, but that's not a big deal because I just turn it right off. I love the pretty night light and the adjustable mist direction as well. All around A+++",

However, we realized we had lost the little cap. I contacted AnyPro to see if it was possible to purchase a replacement cap, and they informed be about their 1-year warranty. They send me a whole new humidifier, which arrived about a week later. This was all settled with a few quick emails. 5 stars for great customer service :]",
