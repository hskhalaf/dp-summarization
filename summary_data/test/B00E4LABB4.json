I don't use these headphones too often, and when I do it's at a desk, not doing anything active. I took them apart and saw why the left channel stopped working - one of the wires soldered to the speaker came out of the solder. The wires are insanely thin and I don't even see the solder chunk anywhere. There are 4 terminals, two of which are already occupied, and I can't figure out which of the two I resolder back on to :-/",

It has a universal volume control which will silence the noise coming into the headphones but won't lower the volume on your phone (i.e. iPhone earbuds). Good microphone as well. Well worth the small amount of money. Get these headphones.",

However while I'm writing this review these headphones began to show their flaws, meaning that the sound quality dropped significantly. I attempted to use different connectors, from the one in the package, hoping it was the wire and not the headphones that caused the issue. Unfortunately it wasn't and I couldn't be more disappointed. I was hoping to avoid purchasing new headphones by investing in something more expensive however these were not worth it and I feel like I wasted my money. I purchased these on August 19 and now it's September 9. I've had cheap $5 earphones last longer than these, I cannot recommend these to anyone.",

If you are intending to use these headphones for public use or for DJing, I would not recommend them. The sound is not isolated enough for that purpose. Casually wearing them and listening to them is fine and enjoyable. DJ Suspence",

My wife uses hers every night and whilst the foam padding is wearing out, and one cable developed a fault (easily replaced), they are otherwise in perfect working order.

The chord remote control is nice; although I wish the volume was controlled by button press as opposed to a slider, but that's just personal preference for me.

The only reason why I won't give this a five star review is because after an hour or so of continuous use, your ears start to have a little discomfort. Now, by no means would I not recommend these headphones it was just something I wanted to let people know if they plan on wearing these headphones for a long period of time over and over again. Still a great pair for a fair price. Also, the design and color on the Atlas Carbon are very nice.",

Very noticeable difference from standard headphones included with smart devices and all that jazz. For $40 it would be crazy not to get these if you are in the market.
