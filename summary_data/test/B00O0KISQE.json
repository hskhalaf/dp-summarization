I use Astro A40 headphones which require a USB port, so I plugged them into this item, as well as my controller charging cable and plugged the hard drive into the 2nd port on the playstation. This worked perfectly. I have noticed a couple times my playstation says that my headphones lost connection, however they actually didn't and sound was audible the entire time. Anyhow, for anyone looking to use this with PS4, it works perfectly.",

Packaging is pretty good too. Cord is about 1.5 feet long, which isn't that long. If you like hiding all your cables like I do then find one with a longer cable.
