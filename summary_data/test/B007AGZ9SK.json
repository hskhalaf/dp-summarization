Samsonite has done a good job of marketing its warranty but the truth is, activating warranty protection is very cumbersome (you need to physically bring it into a service center) and therefore gives the consumer a false sense of security. Unless you're spending hundreds of dollars, don't be fooled that this warranty will give you peace of mind.",

I took these photos in the airport where I had to buy another bag as I wasn't confident it would survive the flight. I'll be getting a refund and never buying Samsonite again.",

I love rolling duffels, not only because of the amount of space they provide, but because they are lighter than bulkier models and thus allow you to take more things with you! That being said, I even bought my hubby the same model last year. I hope Samsonite continues to make this particular model because it will be my go-to suitcase for as long as I live!",

This works perfectly thanks to the 2 divided sections of the bag - I put the heavy goods in the bottom, zip that up, then the lighter soft items on top. Well constructed. I've checked it at 50+ lbs with Southwest Airlines several times and it came thru with no problems at all.",

It has multiple attached straps on the outside to tighten the bag and keep things from shifting. (This is a must as items shift more in a duffel than in a regular suitcase.) No extra luggage strap is needed. This duffel held up through multiple flights and rough handling. You can easily go over the 50# weight limit as this duffel has a very large capacity. I was very happy with this purchase.",

Samson also means strong man which I don't know made me want to purchase it even more. Recommend and easy to travel with does not always stand on it's own but really for the size, it is awesome. Get a travel scale and make sure does not go over as packs so well and fits so much, we have several times but just a heads up.",
