And no matter where I am at in the house, I can ask Alex to turn them on or off remotely. My first switch worked great, however the ring or circle never lit up. I informed the seller and they promptly sent out a replacement. I especially like the blue glow from the switch. It definitely \"smarts\" up the house.",

If that happens, go into the Ottim app and 'forget' the device that doesn't respond to touch, then 'add new' and reattach it. Takes like 30 seconds, and then it will work again just as before. I have 5 of these in my house, had them for about 9 months now, and I've had to forget and reattach two of them. Easy fix. Other than that, they are awesome, so I didn't downgrade their rating any.
