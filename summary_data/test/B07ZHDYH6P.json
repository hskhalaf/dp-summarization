Positive: excellent sound for music. Very clear microphones (but you only have time to say 'hello' before connection drops). Good fit in my ears and elegant design. Conclusion: if there was ANY way to make them work as intended, I'd keep them. I'd buy again from Anker if they solve the connection drop issue. I also bought same day a big over-the-ear Q20 - very happy with those.",

They work on cellular calls and WhatsApp mobile calls. They charge up via USB-C and have wireless charging too. The touch controls work with a beep to acknowledge your press. The actions are fully customisable via the app. For the money, I don't think you can get better balance of features and quality.",

Brought mainly for use while exercising, but find no matter which bud I use, they just don't stay in ear, even with mild jogging. Fine if sat down or walking, maybe I just have weird ears??

The app is good telling you battery life, letting you customize EQ and update the earphones. Our first pair wouldnt update firmware, we got in touch with the MF and they arranged a replacement which when we got we were then able to update the firmware on the new model they provided. All in all happy with this product for the price.",

I've never tried them for exercise hence the 3*, that's not meant to indicate that they failed, just that I didn't try them. They're not actively noise cancelling, just a good fit in the ear, hence the 4* for that..",

      "text": "These earbuds are huge! I'm a female and even with the smallest tip this didn't sit in my ear properly and kept falling out. I returned these and got the Huawei Freebuds 3 instead and they're so much better in terms of fit! I had reservations anyway about inear buds because they never quite fit properly and I was right this time! If anyone has the same reservations and contemplating between the two different earbud designs, and is an Android bbay, go for the Huawei Freebuds 3! Can't comment on the rest of the features unfortunately.",
