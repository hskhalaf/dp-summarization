After doing some research, I found that this particular product is loaded with industrial toxins (see the clean label project, where this was one of the worst scoring products on there). I'll be throwing this out, and certainly not buying again (and I'll be steering clear of this brand in the future since their other products have variable results wrt contamination).",

If you throw the powder first then the water/milk, it has a tendency for a good portion to solidify in the bottom of the cup/shaker.

I mixed it with water, Almond Milk, and Lactose Free Milk. Almond Milk was the best tasting mix of the three to me.

Over all its manageable, and helps me as a late night shake to help put on weight/bulk. If you shake it hard in a good blender bottle it will work other than that you need some sort of blender.",

It might seem pricey but it\u2019s around $50 for 55 serving which is around a buck per shake not including the milk. In reality it\u2019s a great bang for your buck since buying these shakes at your local gym could run you around 9 bucks. Cookies n\u2019 Cream is great, would highly recommend.",

It's alot thicker than whey proteins, and when mixed with water it has a significant chalky flavor where most proteins usually have a very slight flavor if at all. It is great when mixed in a blender with milk/ yogurt and some ice. It won't hurt to add a little chocolate syrup or a spoonful of peanut butter for some flavor.
