I own many, many hand-blown authentic glass ornaments and never have I seen a glued seem in an ornament before. The pickle itself looks cheap, like a dollar-store knock-off. The gifting box proudly presents a product label which cannot be removed, therefore for gifting purposes this is nothing but trash. I'm beyond disappointed. I will repackage the ornament and still gift it, but will never buy from Old World Christmas again, and strongly recommend you don't either.",

I looked on Amazon & found a few actually, but this one, is the exact same one. Thank you-",
