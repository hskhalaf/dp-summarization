      "text": "I have mixed feelings about this product. It does work in that it is large enough to cover the jumbo litter pan that I have, it's sturdy enough to hold the litter when I'm lifting it to discard. The problem I've had with a few of the bags is that my cat was able to (or there was a problem with those particular bags) split the bags right through its center. She still has her claws, so she can poke holes in the bags as well. The bags do hold up when I clean her litter, and they're study as well for lifting. But I may need something a bit thicker, especially since she still has her claws.",

I tried them in 2016 and although the materials was durable and did not rip, the seams were splitting on the bottom before the bag was in place on the box. Now that the seam issue is resolved, these are the best bags I have yet to find, and still such a good price. They fit fine on our extra deep cat box, and I knot the plastic tie under the edge of the box to prevent our cat from pulling the edge of the bag up and into the box. These bags turn little box clean up into an easy job.",
