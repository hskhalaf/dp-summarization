The cat had scabs and most of them r healed..ive heard other reports that the fleas are killed pretty much instantly, so im left wondering if this diatomaceous earth is as potent as it should be.. Either way it was WAY CHEAPER than buying a $60 pack of Advantage II. i think the flee eggs keep hatching. then they die. so once the cycle is done im hoping that they will stay away..",

We rubbed it on all four of our cats and worked it into all of the soft surfaces. We did this for about two weeks before becoming more and more frustrated with the situation. All this stuff wound up doing was leaving dust everywhere and drying out our skin if we came in contact with it. Despite following all recommendations, we still have fleas so this didn't work for us. I don't know about the quality of diatomaceous earth so.I suppose this is of adequate quality, just didn't work for us.",
