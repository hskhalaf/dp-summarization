The seat is not the culprit since it used to be on a better post and never squeaked. The post is holding up fine so far, but its on a bike that is not my daily driver. Update, still hasn't worsened nor improved, still works fine several months later and I'm riding on it more often as well.",

This one is definitely more length than I need but that\u2019s what I wanted . Got it today and installed it with pliers and Allen key in 10 minutes. Took it for a ride ....awesome. It deserves 6 stars . It won\u2019t go all the way down into the bike because it\u2019s so long , so if you are not the only rider of the bike it might pose a problem for the shorter rider who wants to adjust it to their height",
