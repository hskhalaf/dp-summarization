      "text": "I brought this computer last year, hoping to find something I can use for gaming and for college. After about two weeks, it began having issues, and started to freeze after about 30 minutes of using it. I won't lie - for a week, it worked perfectly, and it was a great computer. The speaker was great, the specs were fantastic for being an older model, and it was a good computer for the price. However, because of the overheating issue, it is unusable now.",

It's got loads of video processing power and speed, and a fine CPU for whatever the CPU is supposed to do, I suppose, though all ours is ever called on to do is Starcraft. In other words, the vendor delivered what he promised: a powerful notebook computer aimed at the video game market.",

I would not recommend this to a gamer who plays religiously but some one who enjoys some games in their free time. If you wanted a better laptop i would suggest a razor or Alienware",

They are very shifty and try all that they can to not let you ship it back for repair/replacement. I still don't know if they will fix my problem, but I will try some more. It's still under warranty. Do not buy from this company unless somehow what you bought runs fine. Very frustrating.",

It still gets the job done for many games now, but I feel it starting to age now as it slowly becomes more and more outdated and games become more intensive to run. I'd suggest you look else-where.",
