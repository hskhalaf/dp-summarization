The drive is not plug and play and it has poorly made applications that make it complicated to just use. The drive will back up 1 time and then it will fail every time after that and not automatically back up the computer. You can't eject it from Finder as it says some application (probably one of those unnecessary utilities they install) so you have to Force Quit just to unplug it. This drive does NOT play nice with Macs. Definitely going to return it and buy a different brand.",
