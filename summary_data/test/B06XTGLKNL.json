It fits me great and it's very well made. I'm very surprised as I usually have to pay more given the extra material for this size especially compared to my wife's I bought at the same time for the same price. She loves hers to by the way and is very much smaller than me. So, if you're a big guy buy with confidence and if not you'll still love the fit and solid quality you'll get here.",

The arms were 5\" too short and the shoulders were too tight. I am 6 feet tall and weigh 162 pounds. I would suggest the manufacturer rethink the cut of the robe to fit more normal body types. Regretfully I sent it back as the robe was warm and snug.",

I'm going to have it shortened a couple inches because it is very warm and comfortable. The static electricity from the fleece could probably power a small town but doesn't bother me. If you have light colored pets forget fleece. Between the static and the way fleece collects fur you'll be looking like your pets big sibling in short order. But I like it.",

The 1st one was purchased over a year ago and has held up really well through multiple washings and a lot of wear. The plush is still plush, it's still warm and comfortable. I'd have given it 5 stars except that I prefer fuller sleeves, like the monk's robe type. That's really a minor gripe. Fit on the robe is great, also. A lot of online clothing (such as from DressLilly) is much smaller than the size chart would indicate. I'm 5' 8\" and a large is perfect.",

Although my cousin has mentioned I look like Santa Claus while wearing it, I would prefer to just walk around with this if it were socially acceptable to do so. LOL. Either way, this thing is great!

I was wanting something that\u2019s go to his ankles. Secondly, it\u2019s very wide, plenty of space that way, but the sleeves don\u2019t even reach his wrists either. So the robe itself if shorter than expected and the sleeves are very short unless you have short arms. We\u2019re keeping it because he opened it for Christmas and we\u2019ll just deal with it.

Still very comfortable. The hood is a super bonus.",

It also looks great with vibrant colors (I got the red one with black trim). Also the sleeves are folded back in a way that it never gets in the way of your hands (might be a bit short if you have extremely long arms). I am 5'10, 200lbs and this is perfect for me.
