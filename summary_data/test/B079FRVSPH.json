      "text": "Despite the item description, this is really designed for electric guitars, not acoustic. That said, my auditorium (000) acoustic fits--snugly, but it fits. (My Seagull S6 barely fits; I'd suggest something bigger for a standard dreadnought.) Very little padding/cushioning. I would recommend something sturdier for travel, but this will be fine for at-home storage. I like the fairly plain design (I don't like providing free advertising for bag brands). I wish the zipper opened farther (i.e., around the bottom of the body). Materials/construction seem quite decent for this price. If you mainly need a dust-cover for a medium-body guitar, this will do just fine.",

Bag feels sturdy, zipper and handles are strong. You can ScotchGuard waterproof spray it if you think you might get caught in rain. I like it.",

After a few weeks using it I could rise it a full 5 stars, with the following improovement suggestions: - I miss some soft stuffing in the bag that would make me feel more confident in leaving my guitar inside it without worrying light bumps. - The straps should have another sewing solution. The metal part close to bag body keeps turning. - The straps are too narrow and get frequently twisted. - The accesory pouch is a perfect fit to my cables and tuner, unfortunatelly it is too small to fit my home printed songbook (A4 size)",

A couple pockets. Sturdy enough zipper. If I had a quibble it would be that the little pocket on the front is too narrow and deep for picks. And they should have put a small pouch on the inside for a Snark tuner. But other than that, it's a super bargain. Highly recommend...",

If you are in a band or are playing regularly, invest in real hard case that is durable. This is a lightweight case that has some padding to protect from minor damages and small bumps and and hits. It is also water resistant, but not water proof. With that being said, for the price, this case is excellent and it will protect your guitar while you transport it and prevent it from getting scratches. I also enjoy the spacious pockets for my sheet music, capos, picks and extra strings and tuners.",

The old case provided good protection for my guitar, but it was bulky and difficult to pack into a loaded car. This new case is light, yet provides good protection and padding for the instrument. It's much easier to carry and I appreciate the carrying straps that allow use as a backpack. The fit is a bit snug for a full-sized guitar, and I do like the large storage pocket for music. On the other hand, I wish there was at least one more smaller, compartmentalized storage pocket for smaller gear (picks, capos, etc.)",

Pocket looks big enough for music folders iPads. Chrome book or small laptop. Handles are durable and shoulder straps plenty big. Snug for my grand auditorium may be too tight for dread. Headstock of my 12 just fits. I\u2019d prefer the zipper went all the way around the body.",

It's not thick enough in my opinion to take a nice guitar outside or on the road. The negatives of the case, it has a strong smell which is quite annoying when taking it out of the case. I'm suspicious that this product might have an odor chemical in the proper 65 category. Just beware when you buy it, if you can find a better case for a little more, I would do it.",
