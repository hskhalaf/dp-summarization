      "title": "Espresso never tasted better!",
      "text": "I recently ordered my first Nespresso machine and I knew I needed the \"proper glassware\" to enjoy my espresso. The machine came equipped to serve both espresso and lungo sizes. That made these two cups the perfect match at 5.40z. The double-insulation never gets hot on the outside, and the handle is easy to hold anyway. I prefer clear cups because I can see the rich, boldness of the espresso and the foam on top. Yummy! Super fast shipping, and would highly recommend for such great value too!",

They have worked perfectly for me at home. They hold warmth well and do not make the outside hot at all. You have to be cautious while handling as they feel very fragile. The first set arrived shattered and Amazon was quick to assist with sending a replacement.",

You can hold it by the handle or as a cup and both deliver a great morning, wakeful experience with the espresso inside of course. I should have saved my gas and just bought on Amazon versus venturing out. Highly recommend.",
