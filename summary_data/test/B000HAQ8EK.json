I purchased a Canon Powershot S400 that I am very happy with, unfortuneately it now throws a memory card error. I could have it serviced but I figured it was time to upgrade it. The new Canon SD 900 is so much faster, less time on start up and auto focus. The larger screen is nice too but getting a grip on this camera is a bit odd as suggested by other reviewers. Physically the same size and weight of the old one, just more refined controls.",

I don't know if it's the titanium, or just the internal construction, but this is a tough camera. I dropped it onto a parking lot from waist level (ahh!), and picked it up with no problems. I also dropped it from about 12 feet (in a case) onto a grass field, and that didn't cause any problems either. Some of these other reviews have complained about image blurriness and clarity, but taking pictures of anything that is moving is difficult, with any camera. I think this camera works great, and was definitely worth the money. The battery lasts a long time as well.",

    "description": "Style:SD900The PowerShot SD900 features a 10-million-pixel CCD sensor. This high-resolution imager ensures every picture will have excellent detail, even when printed large or cropped.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe PowerShot SD900 features a 10-million-pixel CCD sensor. This high-resolution imager ensures every picture will have excellent detail, even when printed large or cropped. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor\nThe brand new DIGIC III Imaging Processor developed exclusively by Canon plays an integral role in producing superior images, it speeds up in-camera operations, and improves image quality and functionality. It also maximizes battery consumption for solid performance. \n\nFace Detection\nThe use of the new DIGIC III processor includes the new face priority function for detecting human faces in a scene for both autofocus and autoexposure. This optimizes both focus and exposure of an image for your subject's face. \n\nHigh ISO Sensitivity\nISO range up to ISO 1600 for less blur in low light while hand-holding. With the Image Stabilized lens, and exclusive DIGIC II Image Processor, images shot at higher ISO speeds are sharp, and noise is minimal.\n\n 2.5-Inch High-Resolution LCD Monitor\nEnjoy composing and reviewing images with the big 2.5-inch LCD monitor. With this size LCD screen with 230,000 pixels (twice the resolution of its predecessor), it is quite easy to navigate through the menu and utilize the direct printing features as well. \n\nEnhanced Digital Zoom\nThe SD900 features two new ways to maximize digital zoom performance: Safety Zoom and Digital Teleconverter. With Safety Zoom enabled the lens will go beyond its optical limit while maintaining acceptable image quality; with lower resolutions additional digital zoom becomes available. The Digital Teleconverter emulates the use of a 1.4x and 2.3x teleconversion lens with impressive image quality. \n\n3x Optical Zoom\nAs found in previous Digital Elph cameras, the SD900 utilizes a 3x optical zoom lens. This zoom range has proven to be a perfect combination of compact size and incredible usability (35mm equivalent: 37-111). Along with its great zoom range, the SD900's lens is equipped with two aspherical lens elements to ensure high image quality. \n\nWaterproof Case\nExpand creative photo opportunities with the waterproof case WP-DC7. Take up to 130 feet underwater and still utilize all of the controls the camera has to offer. (This case is not included. It must be purchased separately.)",
