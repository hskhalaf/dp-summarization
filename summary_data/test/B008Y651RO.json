It is just under 16\" deep including spigot, under 10\" high, and 2 3/4\" wide. As mentioned by some other buyers, a vacuum is created when the lid is screwed on tight, but my husband drilled a tiny hole in the lid and water flows perfectly! It is very good quality and we are completely satisfied with the purchase.",
