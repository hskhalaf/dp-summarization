I only had it about two weeks before this happened. It was pretty devastating. **Update: I'm revising my rating from 1 star to 4 stars due to great customer service. I was contacted and offered a full refund, which doesn't begin to cover my bike, but it's a great gesture and I really appreciate the kindness. Looking back on it, it was a very convenient lock to use, it just didn't actually stop my bike from being stolen.",

The guys must have stolen it fast enough to not alert anyone walking in. They just left my cut cord on the ground.",
