      "text": "THESE are by far\"THE BEST GLOW STICK\" have ever used. Lasted 28 hrs, granted, by last 12 hrs very faint light...but if in situation WITH NO LIGHTS, still very helpful. Otherwise, normal brightness is about 12-18 hrs! Than hours down to 40% & finally 5-8% at the last 5-8 hrs....Again that's normal. Using these in emergency situations, making location in cave exploring, camping, etc... Best ever used, & comes with wire to tie around neck, on objects, etc as well as end has a hook. Well definitely keep ordering. I order the white light! Cheers, LiteKid",
