If this bowl was solid steel it'd be a bit clunky - it'd definitely be a toe smasher in the shower if it was solid steel! So the double wall construction is a good thing. Also steel is strong, so you don't need it to be a heavy clunky piece to get the job done. The inside is polished smooth which is excellent for lathering. The middle part of the exterior is brushed giving it some texture so it's less slippy than if it was polished. And as advertised, it's bigger than most shaving bowls allowing folks like myself more room to work the lather.",

A slightly heavier bowl would help the impression of quality. . I will update this as i use the bowl",

      "DURABLE: Metal shaving bowl is much sturdier than a ceramic shaving bowl and withstands being dropped from the counter; make your steel shaving bowl stainless and you can enjoy beauty and durability with a combined chrome-like mirror finish the interiors and rim of the shave bowl",
      "USE WITH CLASSIC SHAVING MUG SOAP OF ANY KIND: Just add your favorite shaving soap refill to this shaving soap dish and use your shaving brush to work your lather. The mirror-finish stands up equally to glycerine shave soap or triple milled or castile shaving soaps",
      "COMBINE WITH OTHER WET SHAVING PRODUCTS: A shaving brush and bowl are the foundation of any wet shave set, whether used as a straight razor shaving bowl or you add a safety razor and a shaving stand for a complete classic shaving set, this stainless shave bowl will mix and match with any color or style (razors, brushes, and stands are not included)",
      "LARGER BOWL: Many shave bowls are just too small and there is no room to effectively use a shave brush to work a lather or they are flat and don't hold curved-bottom soaps well; this bowl has large interior dimensions of 1-7/8\" x 4-3/8\" and a curved interior bottom perfect for many refill shapes",
      "GENDER NEUTRAL: Used as a women's or mens shaving soap bowl or as a shaving cream bowl for a man or woman; this large metal shaver's bowl is a versatile tool whether shaving your face or shaving your legs!"
