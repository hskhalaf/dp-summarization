Very handy for an extra table for any reason. Some reviews say that the rack is flimsy. I don\u2019t agree. It is well made and even has plugs for the screw holes to dress it up. Nicely designed and easy to manage. This would have been 5 Stars except one tray has a 4\u201d crack in it. Doesn\u2019t hurt performance but should be fixed. Will contact mfg and change to 5 stars if they make good. Nevertheless versatile and highly recommended.",

They are a super money saver, but make sure you have a charged drill, bits and a selection of screw lengths available.

The assembly was, otherwise, quite straight-forward following the more than adequate provided directions. All in all, our adult kids will use these frequently and no doubt be glad to have them. Winsome should be a bit more certain of where the rack holes are drilled for user assembly.",
