Also, the floor of the dolly is covered with a thin piece of black plastic which tears easily. Underneath is metal. It would have been better to have the floor covered with thick black rubber.

We were able to load several boxes at a time and also place some of the bigger, heavier items on it like an armoire and really heavy display cabinet.
