I added a USB keyboard which makes it even nicer. Don't need my ROKU any longer due to the wide selection of apps. The web browser is just a little slow on a hardwired connection, but very acceptable. I haven't tried the 3D yet, but the 4k pictures are just ridiculously beautiful. Even 'regular' HD is MUCH better than my old Panasonic plasma. Setup was a breeze and it communicates with my Denon AVR so switching between sources, volume, and on/off are all taken care of on both with the Samsung remote.",

It's Samsung customer service/Smart Hub and how horrible they are. If I'm spending a good chunk of my money on a high ticket item, I expect fast response. It took Samsung 24 - 48 hours to call me and often times when I'm not home. I always believe that customer service is as important as the product the company sells.

I know you're not supposed to iuse the enhanced black setting but it looks really washed out without it. Overall I like it, but it's still not OLED and there is a little bleed in the corners. 4K streaming looks the same as Bluray and is pretty much worthless. I'm glad I bought it, but I won't buy again until OLED is perfected and they fix the aging problems",
