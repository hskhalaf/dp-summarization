I don't much like the static rollers as they feel wobbly and I feel like I'm damaging my carpet. This roller has a much more natural and smooth feel to it. This is similar in form and function as the perfect ab carver, except the wheel feels like it's larger in diameter and your hands are closer on this roller. Angling seems even on both rollers. Between the two coil-return rollers, I prefer this one since it's not as bulky or heavy.",

It also provides some assistance on the rollback process because a spring winds up when you roll forward. Overall great idea, but the locking mechanism in mine broke so now it doesn't lock at the starting point. The rolling forward process now \"ker-chunks\" as well now and isn't a smooth roll. The thing still kinda works, I guess, but I'm definitely going to return it due to it's short lifespan.",

I don\u2019t recommend abs rollers without spring, in fact, after using one with the spring I actually feel it takes away half the effort that really helps your abs to work hard. I do normal sit-ups often so this roller did not put any stress on my abs at all, but mainly just shoulders and back and I think the spring that causes the retrieving is the reason.
