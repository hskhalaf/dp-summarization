      "text": "I purchased two of these, one for mom and one for the wife. Both love it! Keep in mind that you get what you pay for: these are inexpensive things with very cheap rechargeable batteries inside (300mAH instead of my normal 2,100mAH batteries). I'd recommend replacing the batteries as soon as you can so you've got some turtles that light up all night long. One thing I wasn't 100% sure of when purchasing these: what actually lights up? If anyone else has the same question, know that all three turtle shells light up at night.",

Solar powered so you put it out during the day and they charge up with the sun and then turn on when it gets dark. The shells light up a nice yellow light and look so cute outside. Automatically turns on and off after you turn on the on/off button. You need one battery. It is sturdy and looks high quality. Will last outside in the elements. Such a great piece both daytime and nighttime. I highly recommend!!",

It's okay if you're going to sit it on a patio or somewhere that is it readily visible, but don't expect the solar lights to be a drawing feature!",
