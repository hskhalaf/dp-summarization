My hair is a different texture and is very dry now. I use this stuff after every shampoo & conditioning & leave it on for 10 minutes then rinse out & my hair feels like silk. Does not weigh it down at all. This stuff is amazing. I've never used anything like it & I will never go without it. I don't do many reviews but this one I had to because this product is superb!! Oh yeah, the smell is amazing too!!",

I washed it the next morning and noticed that my dry, brittle ends were softened. I have naturally wavy hair, I even noticed my waves starting to regain their structure and shape. I'm very excited to keep using this product and watching my hair improve. Highly, recommend try it!",
