The reverse numbering system seems good, but when you are tired from running off two hours sleep it just confuses you. 2. Impossible to read in the dark. Doesn't glow in a way that's helpful for actually reading your azimuth. Also the fact that the north seeking arrow is red makes red lense flashlights unhelpful for a quick compass check. All in all: meh. Save your money and get a basic NSEW, wrist compass that attaches to your wristwatch. It's more helpful.",

Also, I road in my bike, run and many other activities and in the mountain the compass work without any detectable problem. Only one thing: I changed the wrist band and now have it a NATO watch strap.",

Well, a better rotating bezel for starters, and more clearance between the needle arms and the plastic cover (unless you hold it perfectly level, the needle has a habit of resting against the clear plastic cover and not moving). On the plus side it was cheap and has minimal bulk. I wish I'd gone for a more expensive, easier to use compass.",
