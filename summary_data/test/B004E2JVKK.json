Putting it together was a nightmare. It took three of us to get it to line up and put together. I never could have done it myself. Once it is together it is nice. However the corners never did line up, so even though they are together, they are not flush. In of the screws already worked its way out. The concept is great, but I would prefer to see them put it together then ship it. I would order the larger one only if it was preassembled.",

This pays for itself in the long run. Tried the Coolaroo ones also. Save yourself time and money, get this one. These are sturdier, currently chew proof, perfect on hard wood floors, and the dogs love them. Typically they sleep on the bath or kitchen tile in summertime. They will sleep on these now.

All other beds we have bought in the past would have added up to well over the price of this one bed.
