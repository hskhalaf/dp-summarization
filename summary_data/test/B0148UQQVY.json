      "text": "Mats seem heavy duty, however the chemical odor (rubber off-gassing) make the mats unusable. The entire interior of the vehicle smelled of chemicals for 2 days after removing the mats! Not to mention, breathing rubber off-gas is usually unsafe. I've had them out in the sun for 2 weeks now, but the chemical odor still remains. The odd thing is that the rear mats (sold separately) aren't nearly as bad. Having the rears in the sun for a few days removed the odor. Unfortunately, the front mats seem to be made of a different type of rubber (looks slightly different).",
