There have been cases where these cause great injury to people if the plastic cap breaks while under full pressure. This one has a full metal construction in the cap threads so we tossed out the old plastic one we had. No issues since we bought this months ago, other than now we have a much higher grocery bill with all the organic cream we have to source ;-)",

You do have to refrigerate the canister for several hours before use, and purchase the cartridges separately. The canister also comes with a few different dispenser tips, a cleaning brush and an extra gasket/seal.",

It also makes a real fun way to spoil my grand kids. I tell them to open up and squirt this in their mouth and they love it! Several different recipes (I still have yet to try) can be used. This a very well built product that should last for years, and judging from how much volume you get from a small amount of cream I'm sure it will pay for itself by the end of this holiday season. It's a guilty pleasure for sure but I just love kitchen gadgets.",

I had my last whipped cream dispenser for 10 years and only lost one or two N2O cartridges to blowouts before I finally replaced it due to a failing seal. So, I expected better results!",

This is tremendously easy and I love that it is always ready in the refrigerator. I did give this unit 4 stars (instead of five) in Material Quality and Durability for only one reason - there is a threaded stainless steel knob that you put one of 3 plastic spray tips onto (for different whipped designs). The plastic just doesn't thread onto the steel portion very well at all. It does work just fine... but it feels sort of fragile, or like the threads aren't connecting well. But other than that, it's solid as a rock!",
