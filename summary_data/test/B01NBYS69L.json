I will update after several months of use. **Update** I purchased these gloves in August 2018...by December 2018 these gloves are falling apart where there is only single stitching. I only use them 3 times per week for my heavy lifting. Any chance the manufacturer will replace them? I will post after I contact the manufacturer and seller.",

My only chief complaint is that the length of the finger with the padding makes it more difficult to grip a barbell when doing heavy deadlifts (215lb+) because there is actually too much material for my fingers to secure a tighter grip. If you want a something more specific to power lifting I would recommend Harbinger that lacks the padding these have. Other than that, I love these gloves and recommend them to very active lifters.",

The extra wide wrist wraps give great support for my wrists when doing resistance exercises and the lush padding really helps protect my fingers, which are prone to arthritic pain if lifting without these gloves. And the finger extenders that assist in taking the gloves off are very helpful. That has been a complaint with other lifting gloves, which were hard to pull off my hands when finishing a session. These extenders make taking the gloves off much easier. A very clever and convenient addition to a well designed lifting glove. I would highly recommend these gloves!",

      "text": "I used to be a fan of Harbinger gloves until I was running through a pair every 3 months. Quality has just really gone down hill. I picked these gloves up over a year ago and they are still going strong. No pads tearing out, no stitching unraveling, and no Velcro giving up the ghost. I have found my new favorite gloves. When these eventually give out (which may be another year or more at this rate) I will be happy to pick up another pair and support this company.",

They make lifting heavy weights easier. I was annoyed at first by the small loops they put on the gloves to help get them off, but they have been useful after a hard workout. When the gloves arrived they fit a little tight, but after a week of wearing them they are loosening up a bit and a lot easier to get on and off. I will never buy another type of gloves again. These put Harbinger gloves to shame! Looking forward to my next pair already!",

The quality is perfect. it is a combination of strength and comfort. I strongly recommend these Gloves because quite thickly padded which can make the grip quite different to bare hands.
