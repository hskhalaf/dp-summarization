I mainly use this in my bread, dough, and sauce recipes. A favorite is mixing in with barbeque sauce and a good squeeze of Sriracha hot sauce to use on baked chicken or as a dipping sauce. This comes in a good size 32 Oz. bottle, and the price is decent.",

Believe me when I tell you..I searched hours on Amazon for honey. You will get lost in all the flavors and if you should buy clover honey or wildflower honey. You just have to make a decision.
