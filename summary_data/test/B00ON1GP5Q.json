I should have read other reviews, this is for BODY and if you have sensitive skin you may have redness and a reaction as I and others did. I was so confused after only two uses until I read a few other reviews. May work for body but I\u2019m not changing it due to skin reaction. And seems sketchy to me that the only picture of item doesn\u2019t have the front. Maybe it\u2019s a fake not sure but buyer beware",
