Finally, looking at the 3 blades, I discovered one of them broken. There was a drip of metal underneath that blade that was not cleaned up after the roller head was created. This should not have passed inspection, and the person installing the blades would have noticed because attaching a blade that needs to sit flat would have been very difficult. Delta owes me for ruining a beautiful piece of wood! After planing, my 3/4\" thick walnut is only 1/2\", doesn't work for my project.",

I don't trust the cut depth crank... When you lower it, the knob gets very loose. I think it's causing inconsistent cuts due to the blade vibrations wiggling that knob.",
