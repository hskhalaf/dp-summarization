One month in, I am really happy I pulled the trigger on this coffee maker. The pre-infusion step is a really nice feature, and I prefer the flat-bottom brewing basket to the conical one on our old brewer. If you want a really solid coffee maker, but you still don\u2019t want to drop the coin on a Technivorm, pick up this Bonavita.",

Now, it is close to the original brewing speed and the coffee is tasting better so I may try more regular deep cleanings (maybe monthly). For the price, I had hoped for more. However, it is a much better coffee maker than the Mr. Coffee I had used for years and the coffee tastes better.",

The 40 minute warmer plate is not an issue with me since keeping coffee heated for too long dramatically alters the flavor. There was a double beep when brewing stopped and almost immediately the coffee stopped dripping. I would recommend this coffee maker to friends and will buy again.",

The carafe does not sit flat on the warmer so it is inefficient. The filter basket is easy to dislodge when pulling the carafe out which spills hot grinds on the counter.

      "text": "Well I'm returning this coffee maker tomorrow, what a bummer! I wanted to replace my old Mr Coffee and get something that would make really hot coffee and a more flavorful one as well. This was no better than my Mr. Coffee that I payed $15 for, using a coupon. This maker also off gassed a lot of plastic smell. All I can say good about it is the carafe is nice, but looks like one little bump and it's a goner. I'm not a coffee snob, I'd just like a good \"hot\" cup of coffee. Are there any coffee makers that can do that and not cost $300? Back to my old Mr. Coffee for now....",

      "text": "We liked the stainless steel-carafe version so much that we bought this less-expensive model for our second home. Big mistake. For any amount more than 4 cups the basket overflows, letting grounds spill into the carafe and creating a mess on the shower head. How this design flaw managed to slip though is a mystery. Using coffee that is ground coarser-than-normal helps some, but then of course more coffee is needed and the taste is not the same. My advice is to avoid this model, no matter the price.",

Not sure if this is reason enough to pass but keep in mind that a replacement carafe costs close to $30, which is approaching half the cost of the entire unit. I find that quite ridiculous. I am now using an old carafe from a Mr Coffee which does t fit nicely in the warming tray until I decide what to do about this.",

Terrible design! I bought this to replace my old bonavita. this thing is getting donated and I bought a $20 coffee machine, the wife is much happier..... advise, buy a different unit!",
