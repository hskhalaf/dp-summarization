These are super tough and hard, you can't break them with scissors, I'm thinking lawn clippers. These are long too, so I don't break them. He has had one he keeps gnawing on in his crate and the smell goes away after a few hours. I can't find these at any local pet stores, so glad to find healthy treats with Amazon Prime.",

My dog had no stomach aches after use. Definitely still have to watch your pup carefully as it starts to become a choking hazard if the piece is really wide towards the end (Length and Width vary in the bag) I\u2019d say my 6 month old frenchie got through half a large size piece in about two hours then took a long nap from working at it so hard. All in all will buy again.",
