Features inside pockets and very well-positioned padding along with a large, sturdy zipper the length of the bag and a well-positioned shoulder strap. This bag is perfect for my new William Optics ZenithStar 126; it seems to be made for this scope! Nice freebies too -- a couple of zip bags and a smartphone positioner for the eyepiece of any telescope. Can't praise this bag enough!",
