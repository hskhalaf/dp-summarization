That was an important feature and primarily why I selected this product - and it isn\u2019t available separately on Amazon. I had to order from another vendor and disappoint the kids that are waiting to ski - instead we will wait for an additional shipment. Thank you Amazon for covering the cost. Triple thumbs down to the vendor\u2019s incorrect description.",

The bottom is contoured differently than skis I used years ago but the kids looked rock-solid behind the boat and, in fact, my daughter popped right out of the water on a deep start after a crash on her first try--made us proud!",
