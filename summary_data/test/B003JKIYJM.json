This made it unwieldy to use on either side. I really doubt this is dropped forged steel, otherwise they need to check their temperatures or have QC inspect these better because the material is just too soft. At the rate the tip flattened, I would probably go through this in 1-2 years after having to resharpen the pick constantly. Am sending it back and will likely save up for an estwing..",

The bottom of the head and pick have casting marks that form a ridge down the middle. also with exposure to water, my hammer started to show little rust spots everywhere the metal is pitted. Neither of these issues impede function however and it still does its job well.",

It's lightweight, but is tough and gets the job done. For the price, I had questioned whether it would be of high enough quality to withstand use, but after a weekend of ripping through soils, picking rocks out of solid walls, and other general use, it came out without a scratch. And this is not a functional comment, but it just looks nice too! Highly pleased with this order and would purchase another one.",

For a serial hobbiest like myself, this may be a good tool to use to find out if you really want to get serious about rocks. It's fairly well balanced although a bit heavy. It's also pretty soft; I found that the pick portion dulled very fast. After using it a few times, I found myself wishing that I had just spent the extra money and purchased a higher end hammer. This would probably be a good hammer for kids who are beginning to explore rock hounding or for someone who just wants one for a single outing. I would not recommend this for serious long term use.",
