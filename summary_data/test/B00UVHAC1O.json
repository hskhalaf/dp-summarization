That could only be possible if the light was set to the dimmest setting, which practically you probably wouldnt do. So I keep it plugged in most of the time. When its plugged in it doesnt sit up all that well, in which case its just pointing straight up. I love Philips Hue products, but this was a disappointment.",

HERE'S A GREAT TIP IF YOU ARE USING HUE WITH AMAZON ECHO (ALEXA): put the candle setting on by tapping the back of the hue go, and then tell alexa to raise the light to 100%. now you have a bright and flickering candle instead of a dim one. if you try to raise the brightness in the hue app, it will just raise the brightness and keep it solid color :-)",

Unfortunately it does require a Philips Hub to take advantages of wireless control and color changing. If you don't have a hub you can still change the colors by using the button on the back of the light. I have read numerous reviews saying the light won't sit on it's side plugged it. Those are false. Rotate the power cord and the light actually uses the plug as a stand. Note, it is a little snug so be careful when unplugging it. 1st generation Amazon Echos require a Hub to use voice control. The Echo Plus (2nd gen) has a built in hub.",
