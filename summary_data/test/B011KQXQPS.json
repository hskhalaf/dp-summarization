It will actually lift the tires off the ground if you jack it up that high. The work light puts off a good amount of light. Installation was pretty easy. Took about 30 minutes. I had just enough amount of wire to reach my battery so it worked out great. Before you hook it up though, go to auto zone and get a copper battery terminal, it's not supplied with the kit. Other than that, very easy install. Definitely recommend!",
