I used the drive as an expansion to my xbox one, so luckily i didn't exactly lose any data.

Yes I do rotate these for daily backups, so they are constantly in use, but I don't think that daily use, or every other day, should be too much work for these drives. I'm disappointed that they only came with a one year warranty, whereas the Western Digital (4TB My Passport WDBYFT0040BBK-WESN) drives come with a two year warranty. That says to me that Western Digital puts more faith in their drives, than Seagate has with theirs. I guess I will be replacing these with the Western Digital 4TB drives.......",

      "text": "A friend recommended this hard drive to me, after having good results with his. I eventually purchased 3, all of which are still running strong as of May 2019, even under heavy daily use (including 2 accidental drops). These provide all the room my family needed. After formatting, HD space averaged around 960GB. I don't buy things to baby them; whether it's a fishing pole, work boots, or a hard drive like this one, I intend to get good use out of what I spend my money on. I have recommended these to others, and they have had nothing but positive results as well. I definitely recommend this product.",

The cable started to malfunction early on, refusing to stay seated in the enclosure but one day when plugged in nothing happened at all. I have another Seagate drive with the same cable and adapter and switched them all out to make sure it was the enclosure. Really disappointed by both of these larger Seagate enclosures as my other 4TB one also has a cable that won't stay seated.",

This is my lesson learned-- the drive is now dead literally one month after going out of warranty. The irony is that I found this out because I accessed this drive specifically to burn a backup of what's on it. Instead, I'm trying to figure out which local data-retrieval service is going to get a few hundred dollars of my money. TAKE THE ONE-STAR REVIEWS SERIOUSLY AND BUY ANOTHER BRAND",

Only thing is make sure your console is somewhere the USB connection won't get bumped. It's very sensitive to movement and will automatically shut down the console if accidentally disconnected. Also make sure you've got a surge protector between the wall and your console, because a surge or brown-out will mess with this thing.",

I alternate back and forth between this hard drive and another for backing up my Mac laptop, and this drive accomplishes its backups faster than my older drive--indicating excellent design in how it stores and retrieves data. I have not used this for anything other than backups, so I can't address how it is for other purposes, but I imagine it will prove exceptional in other areas, as well.",
