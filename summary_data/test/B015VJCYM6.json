There has been a few warm summer evenings that I have laid on it myself to relax and swing. :) We keep it in the garage when not in use and its put up for winter. We had no problems with it.",

I have no complaints, but I would offer the manufacturer the following suggestion. While the ropes are sturdy and smooth to the touch for the most part, it would be a lot more comfortable for young chilldren if there was some kind of padding or foam on the ropes. After a while it seems to bother the hands from holding on so tight. I'll probably end up wrapping them with some type of foam tape.",

A swivel might work if hanging from a tree. My daughter and her friend love swinging together on this swing. The biggest downside for me is that they always want someone to push them. That is my reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5.",
