I put romaine in one and it stayed fresh almost indefinitely. Amazing! Same for green onions ! I don't like the way the flavor on green onions changes in just a few days, but in the tupperware, it maintains its freshness. I've also tried strawberries and yellow squash. I'm a believer !! The other benefit is that the pictures on the containers and on the instructions have educated me. For instance, carrots can be left in any seal container, so now I know when to use products I already had. I am a very happy customer.",

I bought the set of four, and despite that, I had to break in half the carrots and parsnips; turnips and beets took up an entire container, no room left for other veggies; and salad left no room for other greens, despite I followed your recommendations. These small containers require going to the market every 3rd day to restock. Please make larger ones, for which I'd be willing to pay.",
