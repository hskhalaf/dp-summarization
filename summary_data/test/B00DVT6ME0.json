After wasting time with Dyson customer service to no avail, I was told to take a leaf blower to it! Can you imagine that?! To design a product that causes such frustration to maintain, for a big company like Dyson, is inexcusable. When making a big purchase, you count on the reputation of the manufacturer, I\u2019m greatly disappointed with their fake guarantee & extremely poor customer service. No wonder there are so many bad reviews for the \u201cfamous\u201d Dyson.",

In order to verify if it worked well, and to make sure i understood how to use it, i assembled the parts (which was so intuitive!), and i used in the apartment. I was surprised to see how much dust it picked up and in my mind the apartment was already clean. The best performance was observed in the carpet/rugs area! best buy ever overall for someone like me who has to deal with asthma!",

    "title": "Dyson DC40 Origin Upright Vacuum Cleaner",
    "description": "Color:YellowAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\n\nDC40 Origin is a Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaner for every floor type. The machine\u2019s cleaner head has an active base place, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear off the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet, the base plate rises and the brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration- removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no awkward dials and you don\u2019t need to bend down to make adjustments. \n\nDyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Origin has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodeled airflows to maximize suction power. DC40 Multi floor also has patented Ball technology. It turns on the spot, which allows you to maneuver more easily around obstacles and into awkward spaces. And because the motor and other key components are located inside the ball, the machine has a lower center of gravity- making it even easier to steer. \n\nPATENTED DYSON TECHNOLOGY\nDyson engineers are constantly testing and inventing, trying to find new ways to make their technology better. As they work, they file patent applications to protect their inventions from copycat manufacturers. That\u2019s why the only place you\u2019ll find Dyson technology is inside a Dyson machine. \n\nRadial Root Cyclone technology: Ordinary vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. As you use them, the tiny holes in the bag clog up with particles of dust. This restricts the flow of air, so the vacuum cleaner loses suction. Dyson vacuum cleaners don\u2019t rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. They use cyclone technology, which spins the air at incredibly high speeds. The cyclones inside a Dyson vacuum cleaner generate centrifugal forces many thousands of times the force of gravity. Dust, dirt and pet hair are flung out of the airflow and straight into the bin. No bag. No loss of suction. Dyson has been continually refining cyclone technology since inventing it more than 20 years ago. DC40 Origin has Radial Root Cyclone technology. Reconfigured air channels and improved flow efficiency reduce turbulence and preserve air pressure, so that the inner cyclones can extract more microscopic particles. These refinements help remove more dirt, dust, allergens and pet hair for the airflow. \n\nBall technology to help you steer with ease: Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaners use patented Ball technology to overcome the steering limitations of fixed wheels. They ride on a ball, which turns on the spot so you can steer with ease, changing direction with just a turn of the wrist. The ball itself is made of glass-reinforced polypropylene- the same material used in the manufacture of car dashboards. It combines high impact strength with the resistance to distortion. The ball also holds the heaviest component, (the motor), positioned towards the base for a lower center of gravity and greater stability. \n\nFEATURES\nSelf-adjusting cleaner head: Many upright vacuum cleaners use fixed settings and their cleaner heads don\u2019t self-adjust to different floor types. And the bigger the gap between the cleaner head and floor, the more suction power is wasted. DC40 Origin has an active base plate. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining suction power on all floor types- wood, carpet, vinyl and tile. \n\nInstant release wand: DC40 Origin has an instant release, long reach wand for cleaning stairs and awkward areas- it stretches up to 5 times in length. There are no separate parts to assemble. \n\nExtra tools: DC40 Origin comes with a Combination tool and a Stair tool. The Combination tool has a debris nozzle that converts to a brush tool for dusting. The Stair tool removes dirt and dust from corners and against vertical edges of stairs. \n\nCaptures allergens, expels cleaner air: The Dyson DC40 Origin has HEPA filtration and a lifetime washable filter. Dyson cyclones capture microscopic particles down to 0.5 microns in size, including pollen, mold and bacteria.\n\nHygienic bin emptying with push button release: The bin on a Dyson vacuum cleaner is transparent so you can see when it needs emptying- and just how much dust, dirt and pet hair your new Dyson machine has picked up.\n\nNo extra costs: Other vacuum cleaners are still designed to need replacement bags and filters- and the cost soon adds up. Dyson vacuums don\u2019t have bags and have lifetime washable filters, so there are no extra costs to worry about.\n\n5 year parts and labor warranty: Your Dyson vacuum cleaner is likely to take a few knocks and bashes during everyday use- but that\u2019s nothing compared to what Dyson puts its machines through during testing and development. All Dyson vacuum cleaners undergo a lengthy and rigorous testing program. That\u2019s why DC40 Origin comes with a 5 year warranty- parts and labor guaranteed by Dyson.\n\n DYSON AUTHORIZED RESELLERS ON AMAZON.COM \nOnly Dyson vacuums and fans purchased from an Authorized Reseller satisfy the quality assurance standards of Dyson and include a valid Dyson parts and labor warranty.
