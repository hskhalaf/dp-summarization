Not as fast or customizable as a RPi3 but definitely as cool and usable. I have 3 SD cards set up with this already... 1. Raspi Debian Pixel (Jessie) for file serving and DLNA media server. 2. Retropie (with BT support for controller). 3. Kali (Re4S0n Image) for tech support / protesting. Also get an otg cable or hub for usb support. It's GREAT!!!",

(If you need just a PiZeroW, this runs the price up a bit...fair warning) Filled a need for a project in-progress waiting for a bit more sophistication (An AdaFruit display hat) and the case was actually wanted/needed to protect the little board. The ZeroW makes things like wireless cameras, print servers, etc. VERY possible and if you're looking for a bit of maker magic, this is a good fit.",

Mine came with multiple lids for a variety of applications, so you could access the GPIO pins, the camera connector with the included camera cable (but not the camera), and other pin access.
