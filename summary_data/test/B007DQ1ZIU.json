I am one of those who was flooded 10 months ago in Texas by Harvey and my whole hose had to be reconstructed from sheet rocked to new floors. So I had ordered the 33 inch by mistake but my cabinet was built for a 36 inch and I returned the 33 for the 36 and the company went out of their way to please us. Everyone that comes to our home loves the sink and all the accessories. Buy it will not be disappointed.",

The sink literally has a soft bag around it once I took it out of the number layers of packaging. Anyways, you won't be disappointed with this sink. I compared sinks to Lowe's. One, they didn't offer 16 gauge and two, they didn't have the accessories that Ruvati gives with the sink. Lowe's sink were 18 gauge and up and cost $399 and up. Love this sink and love the accessories. Good job Ruvati!!!",

The sink looks great alongside the newly installed concrete countertops. I would highly recommend this sink to others.",

The accessories are genius, fit perfectly in the recessed track and basin and are a value you can not compare to any of the competition. If a stainless steel farmsink is what you are surfing for; I suggest you pause and give Ruvati a second, third or fourth look. I did and really could not be more pleased with my purchase.

One minor snag: The first one arrived damaged, bent and scratched (outer box was fine though). Amazon was quick on replacement and return of the first one.",

The only thing I've noticed is if I'm dumping hot water when draining pasta that the bottom of the sink crinkles for a brief few seconds then stops, I'm sure it's just due to excessively hot water onto the cold metal. Otherwise, it's been a great purchase.",

We found out through installation the the sink should only stick out 1 1/2\u201d where I had it set at 2 1/2\u201d so after setting it back another 1\u201d the counter tops will fit perfect with a custom look. I though this sink would not be wide enough but it is perfect in size and you don\u2019t need anything bigger, if you do it\u2019s just for looks. AMAZING SINK, A STEAL for the price.",

The sink I returned looked the same but was only 1/4 of the weight of this sink and made real flimsy. This is a solid sink, with weight to it, and the coating underneath absorbs the sound of using daily.",
