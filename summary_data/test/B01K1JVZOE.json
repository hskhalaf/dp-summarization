The app directions are clear and concise, easy to understand. The plug has worked perfectly. No issues, flaws or cons at this point (I've been using it for over 3 months). When I talk to Alexa and ask her to turn on or off whatever device is plugged into it, she responds quickly and boom! Ask and it shall be done. Life made simpler. I would definitely recommend this smart plug!",

I can also operate through my Alexa. The Kasas were very easy to install and they do not take up much space on the outlets. I plan to order another for a light I forgot.",
