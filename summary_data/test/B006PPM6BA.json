Not only does it provide a perfect (and much needed) third step on my Nissan Armada, the other day it saved me from a whole hell of a lot of damage when I was rear ended in a 3 car pile up. A Honda hit a Dodge truck which hit me. The Honda had to be towed away. Today I replaced the hitch as it was pretty well damaged. I had the hitch on this vehicle for about 2 years and a Nissan Parhfinder for about 4 years (so they last!). For $50 this little bit of insurance paid for itself X 100. Happy motoring.",

I am returning this and buying a new one - will update once that comes in ( we'll see if I don't have to return the next one...)",
