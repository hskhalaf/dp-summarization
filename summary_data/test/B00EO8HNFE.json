In reading some reviews pertaining to this watch however I am little concerned about the day/ date to stop working but so far so good. My only complaint is that this watch has two loops to hold the watch strap in place but the 2nd loop seems unnecessary and i've contemplated cutting it off. Because the loop thingy is mobile, i find myself constantly placing the strap back in the loop and its not always easy. But other than this minor complaint its a good watch.",

However in reality this isn't really the case. If you manage to angle it just right it looks blue, but most of the time the watch face looks completely black and the dials look more yellowish. It's still a really nice watch though, but I would have liked the blue tinge to be a bit more pronounced.",
