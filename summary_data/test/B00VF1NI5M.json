It appears the brush will last as the bristles stay on the brush use after use. There are so many shaving brushes to choose from but I recommend trying this brush first and see what you think. The price is right and excellent quality.",

He suggested an Escali brush which I purchased on Amazon. It was a really bad suggestion as It was a terrible brush. It began shedding on the 1st day out of the box which I have learned is normal. It continued losing the bristles until a few weeks after purchase it was losing a couple of dozen each shave. So being fed up I pitched the Escali and bought this perfecto brush. I could not be happier. Its a great brush for the money.",

With the Perfecto shaving brush I haven't had this problem. In the time I've been using it, It hasn't shed a hair. I would suggest that to extend the life of your brush, when drying it you should hang the brush on a stand allowing the brush to air dry (as opposed to laying it on it's side). I would definitely recommend buying a Perfecto brush.",

It leaves hair in my shaving soaps, the sink and after shaking it clean I need to comb through it grabbing bristles that have come free of the knot. This has become my backup brush because I am fairly confident if I used it every day, it would be bald by now.",

However, after several weeks of usage, the bristles and the handle separated. I have repaired the brush myself with Sugru, and while I'm unsurprised, I felt obligated to share my experience.",

It is completely unsatisfactory and has no value. I have been shaving with a straight razor for more than 50 years and have used shaving brushes the entire time. I can no longer use this brush as it leaves bristles all over my face",
