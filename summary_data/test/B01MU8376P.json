      "text": "The cushions for the couch were nice and comfortable. The color is exactly as pictured. It was very easy to assemble. The size of the couch seats are fairly small. It is not a couch that a person can comfortably lounge on or sleep on due to the seat size. The couch is also not very durable. The arm rest has cracked and the seat cushions have lost shape working 9 months of purchasing. Considering the cost of the couch, it was a fair deal, however, I would go for a higher quality option if I had the money to spend again",

      "text": "We bought this couch because of the reviews that said it was good for a small space and very comfortable. We just unpacked and assembled everything and I am a little disappointed. The assembly did not take very long at all but you can tell from the start that the construction is flimsy and it is not going to last a long time. It is small, which is a plus, but I cannot vouch for the confines. Hopefully it will break in. Ugh, so sad. I wish I had paid attention to the more negative reviews. We will see how it holds up, though.",

      "text": "I really like the look of this couch, and it was fairly straightforward to put together, however just as a few others have said it becomes worn very quickly after just 6 months of use, and it is no longer as comfortable to lounge on. Since the cushions are attached to the frame and there are no zippers, you also can't restuff the cushions. Its a good basic couch but you won't get a lot of mileage out of it.",

Love that you can arrange the pieces however you want. Only thing is I wish the pieces that keep it together kept it from sliding back (see video) I got the light grey which had a bluish tint which I was not expecting. But I still like it.",

This one was nearly half the price, delivered to my door in 2-5 days, easy to set up, and it fits perfectly in my space. I couldn\u2019t be happier.",
