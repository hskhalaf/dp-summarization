I have included 2 pics of difference nozzle design for comparison",

It does get hot on the handle, you need a potholder. You can't walk away either, it will just start spewing water out the spout onto your stove. The lid will start to \"jump\" a little if it starts boiling but other than that you can't really hear it. My only big complaint is the spout is so low, you can't fill it very full. It's enough for two cups-ish.",

When this happens, the spout of the kettle shoots out water. I've found I can avoid this by tilting the lid, but something like this shouldn't be an issue to begin with.",

I'm so happy I found an all glass teapot! It is a simple and great design and just fun to use. Good quality wood and hardware. It holds 2-3 cups :)",

Second, it seems to take quite some time for water to boil in this. Now...I'm comparing to a metal pot so that might not be a fair criticism. It does look pretty on the stove, however, so I have kept it but will probably look for something else to be the real \"workhorse\" I need.",

Make sure you secure the top when you pour as well or it will fall and could break. This thing works on my gas stove with no issue.",

The vent is too small to allow enough steam to come out. I tilt the lid slightly to allow it to have better ventilation.",

I read a few reviews that said the steam coming from the kettle would burn their hands, just keep an eye on it so it doesn't go into a rapid boil. This is not a set and forget whistling kettle, it does require keeping an eye on it, but I suppose that's why it's made of glass in the first place. I got one with a natural wood colored handle, I'm glad I didn't get the red shown in the picture.",
