I live in NYC and wore it in 30 degree weather with just a t-shirt, and was still toasty warm all through my Central Park walk. I wear a 36D bra size and bought a Large, and it fits perfectly, with room for a bulky sweater underneath if I so choose. Buy now; you won't regret it.",

I wanted room for layers underneath and it fits well. The back just covers my butt and the sleeves are the right length. If you\u2019re tall, this might not be the coat for you. I took off one star because the Northface emblem is a cheap looking sticker. It used to be embroidered. Also, the jacket smells like someone else\u2019s perfume. It was definitely worn before. I even washed it and it still smells. Hope it fades by late fall.",
