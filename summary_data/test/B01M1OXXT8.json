I have compared it to three other GPS watches and because it can never find my location it underestimates how far I have run. Similarly once I got Spotify connected to the watch (which was difficult to begin with) it wouldn't stop playing, so I can't use that feature either. I guess it kind of tracks calories and I do like the sleep analysis but honestly, if you're using this for fitness you're better off just getting a Garmin or Apple watch.",

It gives me updates about the weather in the morning, my sleep pattern, walking time etc. Also, I get to choose from so many watch faces- which is nice when you want a different watch (face) for special occasions. The only downside is that it doesn't have a camera remote control. That feature would have been useful to take timed photos. Overall, Pretty good for the deal I got.",
