First off, you get what you pay for. The handles are comfortable and grippy with decent knurling and the resistance on each level allows consistent progression. The feature that I was looking forward to the most falls flat. The handle nuts at the top of the handle are very difficult to break loose the first time and have never tightened properly since, leaving the handle to move freely while using them. Don't buy these expecting perfection, or even a midrange piece of equipment. These are cheap but will suffice in a pinch.",

But for tough training, I suggest higher quality. One of the problems I did face with this is that when you adjust the tension, one side does not tighten very easily. So if you have pliers handy then it should be no problem.",
