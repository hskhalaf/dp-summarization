The handles are a little flimsy and the lid, difficult to open without a handle, does not fit perfectly... however, it performed very well and delivered excellent espresso! The silicone wrapping the stainless mug had a peculiar smell... a minor point since I used a different double-walled stainless mug and subjected my daughter to the mug that comes with this pot. Not perfect, but still worth the cost!",

I use it with my own collapsible stove (not the nCamp stove), and there were no issues as I expected. I really, really love the nested cup - it pretty much sealed the deal. The only real concern I have is that the handles feel flimsy and I worry how long they'll last in the long haul, but I hope that with regular care and attention I shouldn't have any issues.",

Only negative, the silicone on the handles, I don't believe it is silicone. Starting to melt, and I was very cautious to keep handles out of harms way. But when the plastic tool coating all melts off the handles, it won't change function, so not a concern.",

I tried this and it makes good coffee. It works like a regular stove top coffee maker. Coffee was good and I like the streamlined design. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that it took about 10 minutes to brew on the camp stove.",
