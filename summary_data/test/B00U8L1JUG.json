The only problem, and it wasn't anything AT ALL to do with the product, was that I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present. When she opened up the huge box that it came in and saw what it was, she was not pleased...to say the least. She was totally expecting a puppy, a TV, a robot, or something completely non-practical. Again no fault of the product, in fact if/when my wife leaves me for being a bonehead, and I need a set of mats, I'll buy these for myself and be very pleased with them.",
