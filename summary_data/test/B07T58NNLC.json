It\u2019s lightweight and breathable enough to use alone in summer, and in the colder months I just add a grey plush blanket underneath and it keeps it so warm! And it\u2019s so so so beautiful. I got the oyster grey with little white and yellow flowers. The grey is such a calming soft color, not dark at all, and the pattern is so harmonious. The pillowcases add to the harmony, they don\u2019t over do the pattern. I was looking for a simple, relaxed, comfy comforter and I\u2019m so pleased with what I got!",

We use it more as a \"bedspread\" than a comforter as, during the winter, it's a bit too light to provide much warmth. On the other hand, during the fall and spring it's more than adequate. Hey, it's not goose down, which the product description makes very clear, so don't expect a premium product at a bargain price.",

The pillow shams fit my standard size pillows perfectly, and the comforter fits my full size bed quite amply, going nearly to the floor on the corners. It is not terribly heavy, but very fluffy, and I'm very happy with the purchase.",

The comforter is soft, comfortable, and quickly sheds all wrinkles from shipment packing if you follow the instructions (sent separately by email) and allow a few days once placed on the bed. While the pillow shams are adequate, the light weight of the fabric means that the edges don't stand up/out well. All things considered, this is a very nice comforter set.",
