The original Dot had terrible sound quality, but it was handy to have in out bedroom hooked up to a clock speaker. So this is a great replacement, the sound quality is close to the clock speaker we have probably because the driver size is similar. The actual microphone array is also way more responsive. This is probably the best nightstand option you can find. I wish there was a way to customize the lighting since the adaptive lighting is not the greatest.",

However, there is a glitch in the app. If you try to adjust brightness or put on auto-brightness, the clock totally disappears and the app won't allow you to change anything until you completely shut down the app and reopen it.

The treble is decreased in attempt to boost the bass. Even adjusting the audio quality to decrease bass and increase treble in the Alexa settings does nothing to improve sound quality. If listening to music with someone singing, the actual words are barely understandable. You have to blast the volume just to make out anything a person is singing or saying.",

I didn't realize how much my kids would love it. It's very user friendly. My 10 year old paired his voice to it, created a username, and changed Alexa to computer. So instead of saying, Alexa what time is it. He says, computer what time is it. I have a Google speaker and I honestly believe that Alexa is hands down better. I will be purchasing more because the one that I do have my kids are fighting over.",

I thought it would be a great addition to my existing Echo Dot family, and I'm very pleased with it. One of its key features, that's probably accessible on my other Echo Dot's, is that, Alexa and I recite \"The Lord's Prayer,\" each night before I go to bed. I'm so impressed by this Echo Dot that I plan on purchasing another one, sometime soon. I've always appreciated the sound quality, and various additions that Alexa can provide; including her jokes. However, the LED clock and weather display is a great feature to utilize on Echo Dot's, in my opinion.",

I have to admit that the sound quality improvement is significant, no doubt the product on increased size allowing for enhanced internal components. The clock display is first rate while responding to ambient light conditions. This was a good buy. I\u2019d recommend this as a great bedside clock and alarm system.",

This woke me up. I saw this new dot with a clock in it and jumped on it. We needed a dot in the guest room anyway, so I got this one to replace our room's dot. He loves it!

I'm yet to connect to other Alexa compatible devices. I bought & installed a Outlet Shelf by Echogear from Amazon that was used to dock my Echo dot (see video). Voice commands are taken easily once dot hears the word Alexa. The 3rd gen looks very elegant. Only the Greystone color has the clock/temp display. Hope this initial review was helpful.",

I really enjoy the clock feature. The only device I'm using it with now is a powerstrip for my studio lighting in my office for game streaming. Works wonderfully with that. I've owned 4 previous version echo's and this is by far my favorite.",

(It wasn't broadcasting its wifi network.) The hard reboot forced it to update its software. It actually auto set up (because I had other devices on set up on my network.) It was a bit frustrating that it didn't come out of the box and just work, but I really appreciated the Chat Tech Support getting it up and running with me!",

Very impressed with my purchase! I plan on purchasing another one for my mom for Christmas as she liked mine so much.",

      "text": "Functions are just \"Ok\". Certainly NOT worth the price paid. I have 3 devices. Alexa cannot distinguish between them when giving commands to play music in a particular room NOR play \"Everywhere\", same music on all 3 devices. I have Googled and implemented the solutions I found, only for the problems to continue. Alexa's functionality is oversold and at the rate of improvements, still has another 3 to 4 years of development to go before Alexa performs as advertised today. The need to remember specific phrase makes this item a PIA to use. No Bluetooth music streaming to all Echos. This is too expensive what what it does.",

      "text": "Regular Dot but with a clock and additional alarm features. Still frequently misunderstands commands, sometimes comically, always frustratingly. Still HORRIBLE sound quality and using the EQ has little effect. The voice responses are always muddy and a detriment to anyone with less than perfect hearing. The only way to compensate is to turn the volume up to an uncomfortable level. I\u2019m heavily invested in the Echo system and it\u2019s too late to turn back but if I were starting over I\u2019d check into the sound quality of Google first before choosing.",

      "text": "We've had a Dot forever but decided to upgrade to one with a clock. I love this little Dot. The sound quality is so improved and the Alexa App includes sound adjustments of the bass, treble, etc. The light on the clock can be adjusted and there is a feature which allows the light to adjust automatically according to the ambient light. When we ask for the current temperature, it is shown on the dial. When our alarm goes off, we can either tell Alexa to snooze or stop or we can tap the top of the Dot. This is a great unit. We love it!",
