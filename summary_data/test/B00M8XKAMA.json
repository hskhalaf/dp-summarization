      "text": "I run several tech-related conferences each year. I bought several of these projectors to use for presentations. So far, they have worked very well. They pair up well with modern laptops and project an adequate picture in a 150 - 200 person conference space. They also work well when tied together with a VGA splitter. When I'm running a conference, a good projector is a projector that I don't have to think about at all. So far, these projectors have fit that description. So, I'm happy.",

      "text": "This projector worked nice when I first got it. The image quality is great for presentations and other things. The lighting is super bright making it ideal for classroom or presentation settings. It was also smaller than I thought and super portable with the included carrying case! I was impressed. I was not a fan of the wifi feature at all. It's not really wifi. The app you must download only lets you stay within it to mirror your phone and it downsizes the image on the screen it tremendously to look like a little rectangle which is your phone screen. I would stick to the basics with this projector for its quality and brightness!",

The Wifi feature does not allow you to project a Powerpoint or a Movie from your iPhone. Well, it is possible to project a Powerpoint, but it first must be saved as a pdf. If all you want to do is project photos from your iPhone, then it's fine, but otherwise...pass. As for the projector, it is very nice and the picture is crisp and clear. It looks good in a lighted room, but really good in a dark room. We use it in a room that seats about 100 people.",

The main problem with this projector it there is no audio out that I could find other than the internal speaker.

I currently have it connected to an HDMI transmitter which eliminates running cables across the room. The colors are very nice and the picture still looks impressive even with the lights on. By the way, this refurbished unit is covered by factory warranty. :)",

      "text": "I looked online for quite sometime before choosing the Epson EX7230 Refurbished projector. I wanted to find a decent projector that I would not regret buying. So far I have been very pleased with the purchase. Saved a little by purchasing a refurbished. I was not sure if the projector would be ok since it was refurbished. My biggest concern was the bulb and the brightness. It looks brand new and brightness is just dandy.",

      "text": "at first I thought the picture quality was horrible because I couldn't seem to get the image (used for satellite TV) to come in good but after messing with the settings for a while, because I am too stubborn to read instructions, the picture quality is amazing. No I have a 100 inch \"TV\" for less than $500. No need to buy the more expensive one's when this one gives you 1080p picture quality. Added with my awesome surround system I literally have my own theater right in my home. Thanks Epson for making such a great product affordable",
