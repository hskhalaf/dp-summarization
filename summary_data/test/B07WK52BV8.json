      "text": "Those are extremly good headphoses, and i would keep them over px7, but once on my head they pressing continualisly top of my head! Cannot stand it. I would describe my head as roung mid sice. Sound quality very good, on some songs more expensive px7 sounds a bit better, Noise cancelation i found slightly better than on px7, which is strange, as px7 ane over ear, and much more expensive. Honestly, like them better than px7 and will stick with them, but not comfortable.",

The controls are very discreet and I had to download a manual my old eyes could read. Now I've learned the controls they are easy to use and commendably versatile, clever stuff! The build is solid and elegant. Good old Bowers and Wilkins, you get what you pay for and they ain't cheap!",

Sound is excellent and very very compact. You really cannot go wrong with Bowers & Wilkins",

      "text": "Excellent headphones. Great sound and elegant design. Comfortable to wear. ANC doesn\u2019t have any noticeable impact on sound quality. What\u2019s good is that there are 3 levels of ANC, high, low and auto. High was good enough to allow you to enjoy music in a noisy underground train. Low is useful in a quiet commuter train and you can still hear the announcement. The only criticism is that the arms could have been allowed to extend a bit more to suit people with larger heads/lower ears.",

The leather on the headband started to untuck at the end. This was very disappointing and has caused me to reduce by one star. The headphones were kept in the supplied case and were never worn out and about or carried in a bag, ever. Luckily Amazon have replaced them for me. Maybe just unlucky with a slight fault on a pair. Will update with a review of the replacements. 5* service from Amazon.",

As a result I contacted the manufacturer who has no record of the serial number in question. I can only conclude this are fake headphones and maybe Amazon as the seller would care to comment..",
