The MIG 130 welder that I received works great! Plugged it into the dedicated 30A line I ran to the workshop for heavy duty tools and it welded like a champ! Tested it on some 1/2\" steel plate and it tackled it with no issues (a caveat: I did grind a chamfer first). Setting the power to Min-2 and wire feed backed off to 5 was just right for welding back together a crack in the base plate of an old office chair too.",

I did buy a separate MIG wire because of other reviews saying that the wire it comes with does not work perfect. Unfortunately, being it was shipped with FedEx, the mask it came with was completely shattered. Luckily, I already have a mask. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",

Way better than anything I would have expected for such a low cost welder. 4 stars because of the \"mask\" they include-- it's a complete toy and has to be held with your free hand. If they didn't include it and just said you need to buy a decent mask separately (you can get a great one for $20), I probably would have given it 5 stars.",

On MAX & II we have 39.6v with no ark , but when hold the ark the voltage drops to 24v !!!!!! & the amps go over 35 amps....Used Flux 0.03. Is anyone truly satisfied with the job from this welder?

My feeder wheel was on upside down and the feeder tube wasn't pushed through to the feeder. Avoid 20 amp outlets. Put it on a 30 amp plug and 'if' you dare use an extension cord make sure it is at least a 12 gauge, For the hobbyist this welder is perfect.",
