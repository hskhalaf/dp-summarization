Picture included to make it easier to understand. As I was using the product I hit a major pothole and I could of sworn it wasn't going to hold up... But it did.

The phone with cover, I just kept the magnet inside the cover and it stick pretty well with this Mount. So pretty good use for this phone. The phone without cover, I tried to stick the magnetic tile behind the phone and try to put it on top of the mount. Worked well at that time. When I tried to remove, the tile got stuck at mount only. The adhesion is not good compare to the magnetic power.",

      "text": "This package contains two magnetic air-vent mounts with strong magnets (probably neodymium/ rare earth) and four adhesive metal plates, for under $10 (actually, under $8). These magnetic mounts can hold even through relatively thick covers, such as the ones have a layer of liquid and glitter sandwiched between two pieces of plastic. The mounts hold securely to the vents of my husband's and my cars (a 2016 Corolla and a 2017 Prius), but are easy to move in search of an optimum position. I think it would be easy to take one with us while traveling, to use in the rental car. The mounts are inexpensive enough that one could buy another set specifically for traveling.",

The only downside that I have found is that when it is 100 degrees outside, I prefer to have my air conditioning vent unobstructed. If you move the magnet on your phone to the bottom this helps but it gives it less of a grip on the phone. If you place it in the middle where intended, it blocks the vent. So I am working on this and trying to figure it out.",

From some reviews, it sounds like the rubber surface can dry out, get hard, and lose grip over time given the extremes of heat and cold inside a car.

It holds phones well except for one very large phone with a thick rubber case (which will occassionally fall loose when going through excessive potholes). The phone we tried with a thinner case held through the potholes. The magnet is unobtrusive especially if you attatch it to the case of the phone. It can also be used as a phone holder outside of the car which is a nice plus.",
