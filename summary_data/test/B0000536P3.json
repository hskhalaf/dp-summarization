      "text": "Olay and their sellers need to be more clear about the differences between the many variations of this \"Total Effects\" moisturizer. This original formula does not state anywhere that it contains SPF or fragrance, both of which are extremely irritating to sensitive skin. They do make a fragrance free formula, but it is almost identical to the other versions. A more obvious difference in the packaging/presentation of the different formulas would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to spend $20 on a tiny bottle of lotion that is completely unusable due to the unmentioned and unnecessary \"fragrance\"",

      "text": "works great!!! I am hooked and will continue to use. So rich and I can see the difference in my skin. Its hard when you have oily skin but are getting wrinkles too. I need something to nourish my skin but its hard to find anything with really deep moisture when the product has to be oil free. i still break out and even the smallest hint of oil! I love this product and would HIGHLY recommend it!!",
