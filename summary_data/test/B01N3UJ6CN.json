      "text": "When I was purchasing this I knew that it might be cheaply made since it's priced well for five dinosaurs plus a carrying pouch....I was SO wrong! This is the cutest toy! The dinosaurs are very well made as is the volcano. They are so cute and I can't stop playing with them!!! This came as is with no packaging at all but I tied some curling ribbon on the top loop and it was all ready for gift giving! If you have a tiny dinosaur lover to buy for, this is an awesome choice!",
