I slather it all over my face at night and put it around my eyes in the morning, before my sunscreen. It keeps my face moist and, while I still have eczema flare ups, on most days this cream helps keep it at bay. I've tried plenty of other moisturizers, of all price range, and this is my favorite so far.",

I originally tried a sample and knew I had to get more. The contents of the jar is just a really thick ointment almost like wax. Because of the color, texture and smell, I say it\u2019s like Carmex for skin. This may not appeal to some people but it\u2019s also great on elbows, hands, feet, cuticles, etc.",

The 2.2 ounces will probably last me a while since it works so well, but when I re-order I'll probably order YuskinA, which apparently is the same product but sold for the Japanese market.
