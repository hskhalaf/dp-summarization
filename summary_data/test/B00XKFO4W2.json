In our case, the horizontal seam between the upper shower extrusion and the outer shower glass wall. This prevents the upper bracket from firmly holding the vertical stem of the Caddy.",

The design of our fiberglass shower wall prevents the suction cups to stay attached. When we upgrade and replace this with tile that will change the problem. It's easier for him to take items off without everything falling down compared to the other one he had. He likes the soap holder, a great organizing station for him.",

It has not moved an inch since we put it up! I love that the shelves are adjustable and can be put at different heights. This shower caddy is worth the price! A must buy",

I purchased this to use in my shower because I have a Moen handheld slide bar shower head in addition to my regular shower head and needed a shower rack that was adjustable so it would clear the slide bar components. This fit the bill perfectly. I can adjust the racks up and down, and side to side so I can fit the shelves in around the slide bar hardware. Its been up a few months and so far no issues with the finish, and all the shelves are holding tight. We don't load it with heavy bottles, just small to medium size stuff.",

There was a LOT of stuff... The only dislikes are that the shelves aren't completely movable (ie, can't move the soap dish to the top), and the suction cups don't work to stabilize it when it's fully loaded - just not enough grip. Other than that - perfect. Maybe they'll learn to clean properly in time, but this will keep the mold and biofilm from swallowing them whole until then.",

That said, I'm shocked at the engineering and quality. This unit is work every penny. One item that was not mentioned in the reviews is that the pipe hole is lined in rubber which mitigates the chance of the unit sliding down the shower head. The adjustable shelves accommodate my wife's large bottles. Now if I can just get her to put them on the shelf vs. the edge of the tub. *sigh*",
