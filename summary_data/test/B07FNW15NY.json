NOT what I had in mind at all.",

They shipped three more and when hanging, I realized two of the windows were not the same size. This was my error, not theirs. They were just starting Chinese New Years celebration and did advise of delay as factory shuts down during this holiday. I was fine with that and did receive the blinds very quickly considering. Wish i had more windows to cover. The blinds were very easy to install and the quality was even better than I expected.",
