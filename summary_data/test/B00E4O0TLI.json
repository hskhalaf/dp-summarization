My came bent and I'm still giving five stars, because I love it so much. The bent part can't be seen with how it's currently positioned and installed. Anyway, this has some serious sucking power. Plus, the lighting is terrific. I read other reviewers say its not, but in my opinion it has great lighting. If you don't have under cabinet lighting, I guess I could see how they might think the lighting was insufficient. I hope it lasts. Been using it for 2 months.",

By subpar construction I mean: the rear is weakly spot welded; the rear panel that faces the wall is warped and had to be slightly hammered flat.

Had to pop rivet the bracket back in it's position in order to hold the entire front at 90 degree angle. I guess \"you get what you pay for\".....",
