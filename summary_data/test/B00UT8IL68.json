He was leaving half of his pate cat food in the bowl so I now stir a couple tablespoons of Cat Sip into his food and he eats it all right up. Regular milk upset his stomach (most cats can't tolerate regular milk) but this stuff is gentle on my old guy and he loves it. A container will last him 3 or 4 days as I only feed him 2-3 Tbsps at a time. I have also used this to feed very young kittens that have been newly weaned from their mother. Regular milk is much to hard on their stomach.",

The only thing I'm not happy about is that received product is usually really close to expiration date. It's kind of pushing me to use it sooner than anticipated and not buy more than 2 cartons at the time.",
