They are much calmer with noise in the background and don't bark at everything and anything going on outside. Seller was excellent and shipping was quick! Highly recommend this TV and Seller.",

But I didn't buy it for gizmos. 5 stars for pic quality because there isn't 4 1/2 stars. It really is as good as the best budget TV's in this size range that I have/had(TCL, Emerson). One Star for the remote, they really don't get any more boring or unfriendly that this lump. The pic quality/cost ratio makes it a solid 4 star unit. Note; The feet are way out on the ends, so you better have a wide surface for it to stand on.",
