      "text": "I bought this for my grandson on his 9 year old birthday. He absolutely loves this scooter. It lights up when the power is on, making it extra cool. It moves at a great speed for a 9 year old, fast enough to be thrilling, but not outrageous or scary fast. We took it up to the local destination KOA and he road it up and down the gravel road. The one downside (why not a 5 star) is it takes up to 12 hours to fully charge when depleted. It says it will provide 45 minutes of continuous operation. Practically, he can run the scooter for a couple of hours.",
