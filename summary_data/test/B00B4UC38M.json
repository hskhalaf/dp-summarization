Towel warmer did not disappoint, looks great on the wall and heats up well. My husband took it to a whole new level for me and added a timer so we can preset it and have it come on a couple of hours before I get up for work to ensure my towel us nice a toasty by the time I need it. :) high quality piece for not that much money.

      "text": "This is working great, nice and hot. Not too hot to touch, but too hot to hold onto. Mechanically it is well designed and easy to put together. My one suggestion is to do what I did not do, and make up a paper or cardboard template with the holes to be drilled, and tape it to the wall before marking and drilling to get everything spot-on. There is very little tolerance for having drilled holes just a little bit off, and correcting any mistakes will involve filling and painting holes and starting over. Would be nice for the manufacturer to include a flimsy thin paper drilling template -- it would cost them pennies and save a lot of headache.",

It looks very nice on my wall and matches the chrome bathroom fixtures I bought. It does stick our from the wall a bit so be careful where you place it. The space between the poles it narrower than it looks in the picture and when I have my towel folder like in the picture it is a very tight fit, I have had to separate the 2 sides. Overall I like the device very much.",

The install was pretty easy. If you are handy and have done some basic wiring, getting this model (which requires a wall box installed for the wiring) instead of a plug-in version is MUCH better. Wasn't too had to do. I installed it with a little timer switch which costs a few extra bucks but is worth it.",

Installation is pretty straightforward; you have to get the four mounting posts and cover plate correctly positioned which is key and you have to set up the switch circuit and wiring. I finished installation and turned it on today for the first time. Wow! This heats up quick, gets hot and really cooks your towel.

I ended up buying a plug in style and it is designed to have the plug cut off and then be wired direct into a power source without the large plug cover. See my other reviews in a couple weeks for a full review of the unit I ended up buying.",

The rail and towel heats up quickly. I love the hot towel for drying myself it is so decadent",

Contrary to description of \"Used, Like New\" there were no installation instructions included. I finally found instructions on-line from Amba. Once installed the product did not work. I love the way it looks, but for the money I spent, I need something that actually warms the towels, not just hangs them.",
