If you only do port butts, fine, but no way you can do a full pork belly or spatchcock turkey or big rib rack on the 14. I did not even take this unit out of box. I could tell the grates were too small for pretty much anything I want to cook. I\u2019m sure it works great but it\u2019s pretty limited due to the size. Draw a 14\u201d circle on a piece of paper and if you first reaction is \u201cthat\u2019s too small\u201d, like me, get the 18 or 22.",

Easy to assemble although the manual only gives you an exploded view. A quick google search and you'll find 20 videos on WSM assembly. It's big enough for a smaller turkey or a full rack of ribs. My only real gripe is the door on the side is a turn style open/close that sometimes doesn't catch the lip to shut properly. I really like the cover it comes with, it has elastic straps to keep it snug. Overall good bang for your buck.",

Even with that, I often have to finish a pork butt off in the oven. Once outdoor temp gets to 45 or better, then no problem. The 18\" grill will easily handle good sized pork butts, turkeys and about 4 racks of ribs.",

Lots of good support groups on FB with ideas, recipes, etc. A 15lb bag of charcoal will last and entire brisket cook (12-15 hrs). Water pan helps regulate temps and add moisture or remove it if it's not your thing. A great smoker if you don't have access to lots of wood like what's needed in an offset smokers. Keep in mind that people compete using this smokers and win competitions. If you looking a set it and forgot it smoker and want real bbq favor ( i.e. not electric or pellet) this is the great solution.",

You can buy a really nice & bigger gas grill for that much. You can only fit 2 racks of ribs on the 14\" barely. Would recommend getting a 'ThermoPro TP03 Digital Thermometer' to stick in the side probe port since it's more accurate than the dome thermometer.",

It will read accurately until you get past 275F, then it can have a temperature discrepancy of up to 50F. I compared temps against 2 instant read digital thermometers. Because of these issues, temp swings can be large and coal burning efficiency is extremely low. I will be investing in gaskets and a aftermarket door.",

I had the smaller model before and upgraded to the 18\" because it was tricky to figure out how to arrange certain cuts of meat into the other one. As other people have commented, the hatch is the weak point of the design; you loose heat and smoke through there. But you can improve that a bit by bending it to fit a little more snugly. And once you get a grease/smoke \"seasoning\" on the inside of the kettle, the hatch seems to seal a bit better too.",

This smoker includes this weird aluminum plate to catch ash which melts/catches on fire/somehow gets a big hole in it.
