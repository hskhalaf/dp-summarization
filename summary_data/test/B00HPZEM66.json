This is the only food my dog can eat without any digestive issues so I was willing to give them another chance. We recieved the package and two of the cans were open and there were tiny worms over the open cans. Also the whole package had a terrible smell. Not very happy with this. I buy from this supplier ever two months. I\u2019m going to have to look for another supplier.",

Dogs stomachs can get trouble if their food is the gulping down kind if its dry like this, their stomachs can contort like colic in a horse. Dont know what it's called but sometimes surgery can save them. Otherwise... anyway if you add water that makes it more economical anyway , especially if your dog is a bit overweight like mine.",

Granted, the food doesn't have much water it it so it's going to be thick. But the inside of the can is rippled (part of the can design, I assume) so the food sticks more to the inside.
