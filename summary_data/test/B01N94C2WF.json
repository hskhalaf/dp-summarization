The tan looks natural. I didn\u2019t have any lines or splotchiness and I\u2019m not an experienced self tanner by any means. I\u2019ve had it in for about 4 days now and the color hasn\u2019t faded. I even got an exfoliating pedicure today and was worried that from the knees down I\u2019d look terrible afterwards and of course the color is lighter but it doesn\u2019t look bad at all. In fact I will probably wait a few more days to reapply. Highly recommend!",

Get yourself a good tanning mitt and be sure to put some lotion on knees, elbows, feet and hands before applying. There is very little scent to this and no orange color at all. I have tried many self tanners and even get sprayed at beach bum now and then. I will get this product again. The picture shows just one coat.",

So that night I went ahead and put lotion on and that redistributed the cosmetic bronzer and allowed me to see that the color is actually pretty even and smooth. To me, it does seem a little orange but not offensively so. Overall I\u2019m happy and think it\u2019s well worth the price.",

I apply it every few days or so, and a bottle will last me maybe a few weeks. Definitely a great product! Highly recommend!",

It was very easy to apply ( i did purchase the gloves) and did not streak at all. It dried very quickly with no odor. I received tons of comments and no one thought it was a tanning product they just thought i had gone to the beach. It leaves you with a gorgeous glow and my tan lasted at least 6 days with daily workouts. I would recommend this product to everyone because face it even living in Miami there is not always time to go out and tan.",

I have used a lot of different sunless tanners in my life and this one is by far my favorite. This will be a staple in my beauty routine. I feel like you could get 3 full body applications out of this bottle. Which is way cheaper then your weekly spray tan.",

      "text": "My issue with self tanners has always been the smell. Even products marketed with a \"new and improved\" smell are still terrible - they just have more fragrance added as a sad attempt to mask the stink. Not this beauty of a product! I couldn't be happier with this COMPLETELY ODORLESS product. (Oh, and the tan is great too.) I've never used a foam / mousse before, but it applied easily, dried quickly, and left my previously pale, supersad legs with a nice bit of color. Winner winner!",

Will definitely buy again. I do exfoliate and shave then apply light layer of plain lotion all over since my skin is dry. I use a mitt and gently buff it in like cake icing, not deep rub in. I repeat all over (2x total). Wear a loose t shirt to bed and wake up so tan! No bad odor. It lasts about 4-5 days and evenly fades. It truly is a gem. Well worth the $.",

I'm pretty pale during the winter--like a ghost--and this tanner helped me reach my typical peak-summer tan within a few hours. I should add that I bought a mitt to help apply it, which I really think made a big difference. My only complaint is that it collected in the creases of my face by the end of the day, like my smile lines and very faintly around my eyes, which of course made me look older. So I'd suggest maybe not using it on your face and find another method.",
