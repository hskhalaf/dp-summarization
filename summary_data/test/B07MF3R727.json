      "text": "I like it so far - remote is simple to use - lets you choose between red, blue, or combined lighting. I know blue is good for vegetative growth, red is for flowering, and both together make a more powerful full spectrum light. The combined light appears a pink-ish tone. even with both on, the light is not all that bright - im sure it will help my small succulents and delicate indoor plants. The adustable arms are easily placed, and don't feel too flimsy. the clip is plastic, and is not quite as strong as I'd hope, but gets the job done. This light would work great for african violets.",

I bought a few of these lights in hopes that I could change my dying plant situation. I am excited to say that I think there is a noticeable difference in the condition of my plants!

    "description": "Size:Two Adjustable HeadsLove plants, but don\u2019t necessarily have the time to keep chasing after the sun for them?\n\nHouseplants improve our focus and indoor air quality. However, they\u2019re not always the easiest to keep alive. As most plants need sunlight to survive, owners are tasked with constantly looking for the best window to give them the most light. Not always the easiest, given each plant\u2019s individual needs.\n\nAnd when winter comes, many have to cycle plants between periods of staying inside and in the garden. These high maintenance costs can be off-putting, especially for us who love flora but are also stacked with work or kids.\n\nNow you can finally go green effortlessly with the Plant Light by Dwelling with Pride.\n\nGrowing lights for indoor plants allow you to grow plants year round. From germination to maturation and flowering, our UV light for plants supports healthy growth.\n\nThe blue light drives photosynthesis, and helps the plant properly regulate water and carbon dioxide. Blue light is what helps the plant grow strong stems and leaves. Red light helps chlorophyll maximize yield and grow nutritious fruits or flowers by helping the plant metabolize the light it receives into sugars and carbons.\n\nHowever, overexposure is a real problem with some grow lights for indoor plants. Too much blue light can stunt growth. Too much red light can lead to overly long leaves and stems. Dimmable settings and an auto timer ensure that your plant gets light at the exact wavelength it needs.\n\nNot convinced yet? Here are more benefits you get with our plant lights for indoor plants:\n\nQuality adapter for reliable power supply.\nMetal clamp with sturdy grip.\nMax power at 30w.\nEach light good for two plants.\nNip your lighting problems in the bud. Grow the vibrant plants you\u2019ve always wanted with Dwelling with Pride\u2019s Plant Light TODAY!",
