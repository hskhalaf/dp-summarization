The replacement, at no cost to me, had no lights that shed enough light and brightness to use effectively. I will say the remote...genius.

      "text": "The light pucks are very easy to setup - you just remove the back, then remove the little plastic battery blocker, replace the back. The included double-sided tape circles work really well to stick the pucks on the under side of cabinets. The included remote works nicely, too, and is quite intuitive to use. As far as brightness is concerned, they are plenty bright for what I am doing with them (under cabinet lighting in the kitchen). I have three of them on the underside of one cabinet that is about 4 feet above the counter. Those three work nicely to illuminate that area. I have one under a typical cabinet, and it is plenty bright.",
