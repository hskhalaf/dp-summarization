      "text": "It works just like it says. If you follow all the instructions exactly you should have no problem perfect for the kids learning to cook. Kids always walk away and forget they are cooking this is perfect you don't have to worry about burnt pots or burnt rice. It turns to warming as soon as its finished. Uses less water than the stove top directions. Clean up is easy. I recommend this for every parent trying to teach their young ones cooking or even college kids dorm rooms, doesn't take up much room and you can set the function and walk away while you are studying and in 2 hours your dinner is done. Hope this review helps.",

Different breeds or brands of rice can require radically different amounts of water, and it can take some trial and error to find the right ratio of water to rice for your specific case. However, once you find the sweet spot, this cooker gets it right every time. I don't get any variance in quality between uses, and the huge capacity is a plus in a household like mine.",
