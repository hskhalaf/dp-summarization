I also own a Janome but it is very heavy and I can't go to different classes with the machine. This one was purchased because it's lightweight although it is limited, it is sufficient for what I want. I wanted a lightweight embroidery machine and not a dual embroidery and sewing machine.",

Delivery was quicker than expected and i'm in Cape Town, South Africa. The total price (machine & shipping) was cheaper than if i had bought it here by few hundred $ and that time $1=R17.
