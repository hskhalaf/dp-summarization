Apparently I'm just finding out now that this thing is actually meant for water sports. I have no idea how it works for that but it is extremely versatile as a snow body board since you can kneel on it, sit on it, or lie belly down on it. The trick is that you do have to find an extremely slick hill because it will not transfer enough body heat like a cheap plastic sled to melt a small film to create a slippery slop on its own.",
