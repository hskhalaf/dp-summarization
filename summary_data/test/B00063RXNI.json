In fact, just hand tightening made it tight enough that there was no movement in the handle. I did however, tighten it with the screw driver and pliers as suggested in the instructions (which are found on the package when the item is removed). No problem with rust (seasoned it as suggested). The handle is black and not chrome as pictured. The press works perfectly and is just the right size. I love it",

Purchased this mainly for making smashburgers at home, and for keeping bacon from curling up. Once I got this assembled, it feels pretty solid. I used a 3/8\" combination wrench and a beefy flathead screwdriver, along with a couple of small locking washers (recommended) We'll see how it holds up.

In short, it might be advisable to keep a thick oven-mitt handy whenever using this product on a grill or in a skillet.",

I have screwed the handle back on many times as tight as i can but i don't know if it is because of the oil/grease or from the grill, i just can't figure it out! Maybe i just got a lemon...:/ Everything else is great about it and works fine..It gets the job done! Mixed feelings so i guess it would depend if i would recommend it or not.",

    "title": "Lodge Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Grill Press With Cool-grip Spiral Handle, 4.5 inch X 6.75 inch, Black",
    "description": "On the stovetop or grill, the Lodge Cast Iron Grill Press keeps bacon from curling and presses out unwanted grease from burgers. When preheated, the press also significantly speeds up cooking time. The heavy-duty cast iron base with a rustic hammered finish provides excellent heat retention for consistent, even cooking, and the spiral handle allows for a safe, comfortable grip. This grill press is safe to use in the oven, on the stove or grill, and over a campfire. The Lodge Cast Iron Grill Press is made for decades of cooking and comes pre-seasoned for an easy-release finish that improves with use. Assembly requires a flathead screwdriver and an adjustable wrench or pliers. Includes one Lodge Cast Iron Grill Press, 6.75 Inch x 4.5 Inch. Made in America. Care instructions for cast iron: 1. Wash with warm water. Add a mild soap, if desired. 2. Dry thoroughly with a lint-free cloth or paper towel. 3. Oil the surface of the pan with a very light layer of cooking oil while warm. Hang or store the cookware in a dry place.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFor the stovetop or the grill, this press pushes out the excess fat in burgers or chicken, eliminates the curl in bacon or ham, and retains the heat in grilled sandwiches. Made of heavy cast iron and weighing about 3 pounds, the grill press uses its heft to do the work. The press measures 6-3/4 by 4-1/2 inches and has a unique hammered finish. A cool-grip spiral handle keeps hands comfortable when working over a hot grill.--Cristina Vaamonde",
