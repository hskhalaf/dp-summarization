Love the fact that the beaters (all 5 of them - okay one is a whisk) are stainless steel. For getting the beater clicked on the box all you need to do is bring it in at an angle and it will go right into place for you. It does take a bit more energy to free for use but nothing that difficult. I am over 65 and I can do it, so i am sure you can too. Great beater would buy again.",

A year or two into ownership I opened up the mixer and cleaned everything out with compressed air. At that time you could tell the gears appeared to be warn. Wear could possibly be excelerated due to the powdered food that was mixed and sucked in through the vent. Seemed like a nice mixer. Didn't last long.",

The power switch is glitchy on mine. Don't know if it's a design flaw, but when I push the power button up it sometimes turns off instead of going faster. It's like there are dead zones in between the different speeds. It's odd but the appliance starts right back up with you reposition the power button. Considering how inexpensive it was, I'm not inclined to be terribly picky, but if little stuff like that drives you batty, you might want to consider a different item.",

It works fine but if you're mixing something for a while (like whipping cream), you'll probably get tired due to it's weight. I'll probably just get rid of the storage bin and store the attachments in a drawer. I'm disappointed that I can't find a smaller, lighter one.",

I need a little one to do the small jobs. This one is great. I do like the self contained mixer attachments and it is a little heartier than the basic model. Some of my other ones started so sound like they were run on squirrel power. This one seems strong and has worked great so far. I would consider using it for heavier jobs.",

It's slightly bulky, but between its thoughtful design and tremendous power, it's worth a little girth. The attachments are terrific. Two traditional mixing blades, two with round edges (for mixing without hacking), and one attachable whisk.",
