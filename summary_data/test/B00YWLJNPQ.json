This happens with any and all of the devices that it was paired with and was originally successfully working with: an iPad, an iPhone, an Android tablet, and a Windows phone.

While it is in the normal position for the button, it is much smaller than the |\\ which makes it a bit awkward.

After a while sitting in a drawer, the keys stuck down - no good. This bi-fold design is much better; it doesn't depress any keys and holds closed with a magnet. My only criticism is that it can't really be used on a lap - unless your legs are closed tight, it will fold up the keyboard!",

If you are a decent typist (and presumably you are since you are looking to purchase a portable keyboard), you will quickly notice that the shift key on the right hand side is way too small. In fact, the \"up\" key is in the place where the right shift key should be, therefore, it takes a lot of getting used to and causes frequent annoying mistakes.",

When open, the keyboard is about the size one would've found on a netbook of about eight years ago; so, while it's small, it's not cramped. I'm pleased with how sturdily constructed it is, and the hinges don't really bend up unless you're trying to type on a very soft surface indeed. This was my only Prime Day buy... and as of now, September 25th, I haven't needed to charge the battery yet. I absolutely love it - I can now officially do everything except gaming that I'd use a desktop computer for on my phone!",
