I don't like having all sorts of scents around, and these do a great job of wiping off dirt, mulch and leaves.",

I immediately grab a wipe and it picks up everything. They don\u2019t cause skin irritation (at least for us). I do wish they cost a little less. I\u2019ve tried cheaper and you get what you pay for. I also find that sometimes the wipes stick together and don\u2019t come out one at a time. Putting them in a wipe dispenser controls the issue.",
