The interior chest pocket is handy for a phone instead of keeping it in your pants. I love the snow skirt and underarm zippers as well. Unlike other reviewers, I don't find the zippers uncomfortable at all but since I bought the coat, I've been wearing it with a baselayer and a fleece so I don't feel them at all. Coming from someone who hates wearing coats and especially puffy coats, I love this jacket.",

First off, it is a very pretty canvas and \"slim\" fitting so you don't look like a giant marshmallow like typical ski jackets ( and why the other one had to be returned). I was able to fit a base layer, thin fleece and vest and did not feel constricted in any way. I also wore a medium weight sweater on another cold night and fit perfectly. I live in New England so I justified the price but even talking with friends who ski, they said it is a great price especially for Burton.",
