However the reason I DO NOT recommend is because the paper often jammed. It happened so much that the unit broke itself. I cannot longer use it and now I'm stuck with expensive proprietary cartridges that I cannot use on other printers. So there you go, fun product but it breaks easy, it didn't last a single year and I experienced a lot of paper jams problems resulting in a total malfunction... Very sad",

It\u2019s not a 5 star print by any means ... it tends to crush the shadows and blow the highlights, but the colors are truer and for a portable 2x3 print solution, it\u2019s a great choice.",
