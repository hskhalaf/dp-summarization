It comes boxed in the same red Spode box that Spode has been using for decades. It's also perfect for gifting. However, if you are gifting this item, be aware that there is a MSRP ($63) sticker on the outside of the box BUT also a second sticker on the back of the platter itself.",

My starts are not for the quality but for the people who sent it out knowingly with it broken. A ladle to replace it currently can cost equal to the set or more on Ebay. I am ashamed of Amazon for still selling this set.",
