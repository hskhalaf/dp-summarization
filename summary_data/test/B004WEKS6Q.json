I've had others installed that required you to turn as you put the plug in and it was recessed so it was hard to use any plugs larger than just a standard plug. These ones are great! You can use any size of plug that would work in a standard cover and the sliding rather than turning makes it easier to get your plug in while still making it hard for little fingers to play with them. They are sleek and not bulky. I love them!",

Center screw fit our typical outlet. The problem is, as you can see in the picture, the cover sticks out so far that things won't stay plugged in. Can't push plugs in far enough to get a current. Hubby was able to bend the prongs on our lamp so it'd stay plugged in, but we don't want to be bending all our plugs. 3-pronged plugs seem to work better too. Gave it two stars because it does keep outlets closed, so keeps kiddo safe, but not effective for us.",
