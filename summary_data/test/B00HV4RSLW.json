I chose the latter and got a little over 5 bucks back. Next time I'm just going to get black from TNF official website.",

The sleeves are a tiny bit long, maybe an inch or so, but the elastic at the end keeps the sleeves from hanging over my hands. I have wanted this for a long time but I was a bit hesitant about spending so much. Well, I'm glad I finally treated myself. I just love it.",
