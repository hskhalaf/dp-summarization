This 'sweeper' at 130 sounded worth a try. Since I have no way of measuring its flow, I can't call the rating an outright lie. There's also the possibility that it's a 'flow vs pressure' thing. If so, the rating is still misleading because most people don't understand these dynamics. I gave it to my wife who uses it for the porches and deck and asked her to rate it. Thus, the three stars. It's pretty much useless for any serious leaf or after mowing work.",

      "text": "I got caught up again with buying a lesser expensive blower to replace my previous battery powered blower. I'm done with battery powered blowers. If you use it to blow some dust or small leaves around occasionally, then it will be fine. But I recommend a small gas blower instead. I can't recommend which brand, but I am pretty sure that a gas blower will be a much better choice in the long run. The battery blowers are just modified toys.",
