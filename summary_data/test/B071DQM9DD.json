I have plantar fascitis and toes-up and heels-down helps keep my arch support and Achilles heel stretched and relieves some pain. I spend a lot of time at my desk and most of that time my toes have been pointed downward. I like that this support is heavy, moderately adjustable, and stays firmly where I want it to be. It came with no instructions but it probably doesn't need any (ok, maybe a warranty). I'm comfortable using it with shoes on as well as barefoot.",

The Eureka unit is made of metal, and while it lacks height adjustment it looks like it will last a very long time. It swivels forward and backward and at the center setting it keeps your feet 3\" off the ground. If that is enough height, buy this one and avoid the ones made of plastic.",
