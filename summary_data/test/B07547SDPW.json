Thank you for the fast reply. We also ordered the green and orange set which had the hooks and charging cords. The dual sound is much better. Gave the initial green one to my daughter for her pool. Blue tooth distance on these is not great but the card slot option takes care of that. A must have part of our pool! Love it.... :)",

My initial reaction was that it was battery drained and I had to charge it.. That wasnt the case because now it is not charging. I dont think its that waterproof, just keep it and use in the tub or shower.. It doesnt float that good anyway..",

      "text": "I have tried several bluetooth speakers and I am always disappointed with the sound quality. This one is quite good. It is also durable. I wouldn't worry about dropping it. And of course it is waterproof. The first thing my son did after we connected the bluetooth was drop it in a bowl of water just to see. I am happy to report no problem with the water! I already took it with me on one trip. Easy to connect on the first try. am looking forward to taking it to the beach this summer.",

Even better is the sound quality. It sounds really good for its size. I've purchase similar speakers and have not been very impressed. Haven't tried it in my pool yet but have run around with it on my backpack and used it for workouts. Worth every penny.",
