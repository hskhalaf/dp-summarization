Awesome for children with dyslexia because it has video\u2019s and steps that help with letter reversal. Otherwise this workbook is just another handwriting notebook. Might as well print off free pages of copy work on the internet! The teacher manual is also useless if you don\u2019t have the online program. Happy handwriting!",
