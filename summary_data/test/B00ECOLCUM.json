The nutritional value was horrible. I'd previously made most of food by hand, supplementing with an organic kibble. I did a lot of research before trying this, and it is wonderful. This is his main food. I do cook up organic chicken livers with a mix of organic pumpkin, organic ginger, and he gets a BIT of that on top of his Canidae, but if he begins to act sick,he gets only Canidae. It's keeping him not just alive, but healthy and happy.",

She no longer scratches and her coat is thicker and shinier. As a matter of fact, the house is now much cleaner because she does not shed hair.
