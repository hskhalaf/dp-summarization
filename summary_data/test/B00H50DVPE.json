It is clear when making phone calls, but best of all it is super durable. I have dropped it on concrete many times and even sat on it. I splashed water on it and it just keeps on going. I charge it at night and run it all day long. I put a holster case on it for wearing when outside, which made it more durable I am sure, but it is also a good size to put in a front jean pocket in a pinch.",

Pros: + Little/Nice/Light decent phone for basic tasks + Good quality display Cons: + Quad-core + 1GB RAM but quite slow + Buggy software: phone freezes sometimes, gets heated up often when using GPS + No software update (4.2.2 for tmobile version) + Apps cannot be moved to SD card + Small battery that doesn't last.",

It isn't so great and at times it is difficult for her to hear me. It is not that big a deal since she does not use it often and had a landline at home.

Not only is the price very reasonable but the features are the same as on the more expensive Samsung G3 replacement, but is slightly smaller, has a newer OS and seems faster too. I also purchased the Eagle Cell Protective Cover for Samsung Galaxy Light/T399 - Retail Packaging - Black ($11.57) which has already protected the phone from a drop onto our tile floor in the kitchen. I would highly recommend this phone and protective cover to anyone looking for an upgraded Android phone.",

I mostly use it for texting, checking email, mapping directions and idling on Facebook. Sometimes doing a simple Google search takes a while. This may seem silly to some, but the thing I like most about the Samsung Galaxy Light is that it fits comfortably in my hand and takes up minimal space in my purse.",

The Samsung Galaxy Light is fantastic on all of the dimensions. Very fast and responsive with excellent battery life. LTE connectivity, which the Exhibit II didn't have, is an great plus. All for $60 less than the old phone. At $120, you can't find a better deal. I've had this for about a week now and am very happy.",

      "title": "Perfect phone",
      "text": "I got tired of using expensive phones on an expensive service (Nexus/Rezound on Verizon) and decided to try T-Mobile and the Light out. This phone (while not a Nexus) is awesome. It's cheap enough to be \"disposable\" in case it breaks, it runs smooth, the battery lasts me all day with regular use w/ wifi on all day (some days 54% by end of day), and it's the perfect size. I'm also what you'd consider an \"expert\" user, considering I write android apps. The only con with the phone is the camera... it's decent, but not awesome. Do yourself a favor and save a ton of money. I'm sure you'll love this phone like I have.",

      "text": "Great purchase so far. I wanted an affordable unlocked phone that would fit my needs, and it has exceeded my expectations. It does everything a smartphone should, at a very affordable price. I looked at older (used) versions of other phones that were top of the line (or close to it) a couple or so years back, but decided to get something with more current technology. I think I made the right choice, as it won't age as quickly over time (in a relative sense). I don't need or want the extra bells and whistles that come with a more costly phone, and this has been just right for me.",

Of you keep ot aynchronizing and with the wifi and blietootj, I have to charge every night and at noon at work, but its not a problem for me. Moght have to get an extea nattery & charhwr for when im out of charge areas.",
