It doesn\u2019t move fast enough for the entertaining \u201ccatapult technique\u201d. Instead, this cat removal system relies on stealth and confusion. There is something about quietly changing elevation and position that is highly unsettling to the feline constitution. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who needs to remove a feline overlord from the bed!",

We were a little anxious about the mattress fitting well, but we got it set up and it fits perfectly. The mattress and topper work just fine with this frame. The box came and the frame was very easy to set up. Now we spend more time in our bed than on the couch. We absolutely love the ability to adjust the height of the head and feet. It's been a great purchase and has provided the best sleep we've had. We are 100% happy with our purchase and would recommend this to anyone.",

She also needs her feet elevated for medical reasons and all I have to do is push a button. I unpacked and set up this bed by myself but I would recommend that you get someone to help you. It's easily assembled but the frame is heavy. This bed is honestly one of the wisest buys of our lifetime!",

To go with these bases we got two twin xl 10\" lucid hybrid mattresses. Comfy!",

      "text": "One lift motor arrived separated from the bed frame and had to be reassembled. I was fortunate to have the skill set to reassemble the motor or a return would have been in order. Because of the weight of the item, handling by the delivery firm was poor and obviously rough which showed with scrapes and tears in the card board exterior packaging. Delivery is the biggest problem that Amazon needs to solve. Bed, itself is excellent, lift motors work well and my sleep is much improved! Apart from the damage to the lift motor, the assembly is simple and can be done easily with two people because of the relative weight. Great price for the quality.",

The other came later the same day UPS and had been drop on one corner and slightly bent a part of the frame.{ it had no bearing on how it worked } I'm hard pressed as to why they do not respect other peoples goods and never have.",

All-in-all, it took about 45 minutes for two adults (one strong and not so strong) to remove the old mattress and bed slats, then put together and drop in the new platform and roll out the new bed.
