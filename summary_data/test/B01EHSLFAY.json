I can easily carry it in a pocket of my jeans because of the size and weight (it is VERY light), and the size of the keys are almost as big as my Macbook Air's. It took me a while to get used to the layout of the keyboard because of its unique angle. After some practice with brief texts to my family and friends, I got the hang of it and this little thing has become an indispensable gadget to go with my iPhone.",

With this keyboard, the ergonomic design does not put a strain on my hands and the battery lasts even while working on a lengthy essay. I haven't had to re-pair the device after being idle for a while and that's definitely handy. Plus, the fact that the keyboard folds up neatly makes it really portable.",

It is compact, easy to use, and the buttons have a nice feel to them. I used it only about 6 times and now the \"L\" button seems to not work at all when I press it. Quite the disappointment!",
