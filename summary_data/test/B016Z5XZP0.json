Also, the color guide (I don't know what to call it...where you match up your result to the percentage of ketosis that your body is in), printed on the side of the container, is large, and easy to read.

      "text": "Great strips, comes with a lot of them and the customer service (emails educating before and after) is top notch. I will stick with this brand and I have tried four brands total. The only thing I would change is that it would come with a urine cup to dip the stick in so I didn\u2019t have to find something to use for my pee. Not a huge deal but would make this product 100% everything you could ever ask for in keto strips",

The results come within 30 seconds. 3. The results are accurate. I tested these to see if the results were accurate. I used a strip when I was very strict and limiting my carbs to 20 a day and it read moderate ketones. Then I tried it after having upwards of 70 carbs the day prior and it read trace to no amount of ketones. All in all i am pleased with these strips. The results come quickly and accurately. The directions are easy to follow and interpret.",

I would not say anything bad about the 3 that I have, but I prefer Nurse Hatty Ketone strips. Smackfast has a Facebook page and website that encourages you to stay low carb. So, buy either, whichever is on sale. GOOD LUCK!",

Once again, they'll say it'll contaminate etc and not be accurate. It makes orders take twice as long, losing money for the company, but it's worked fine for me.

      "text": "I purchased this product for my husband, whose physician recommended he try a keto diet. We wanted to be sure that the changes he made were effective, and these strips help him keep track of where he's at, so he's aware of any necessary adjustments. So far he's had no issues with them, and feels they're an effective tool on his fat-burning journey.",

Indicated a high level of ketones... i also had a day where I ate a little more carbs than usual and the strips showed a difference... lower ketone levels, which is what I would expect. Pretty happy having confirmation that my diet is working and my body is using up fat! Strips themselves are good length for testing, sturdy and well made, don\u2019t disintegrate when wet as they are plastic not paper.",

The bonus 50 strips for the same price as a pack of 100 allows me to test more often (because I need to know if that new dish I tried has affected me).
