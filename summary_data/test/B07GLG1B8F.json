I\u2019ve tested to make sure it works by setting it off to the side while on and it gives a loud alert for breathing if it doesn\u2019t detect any motion. It also does a gentler alert for being on belly. I haven\u2019t tried much with temperature. Def make sure the baby is wearing snug clothes or swaddled tightly to prevent false alarms but I highly recommend this!",

I slept much better now knowing I will be notified if anything happens to my son. The app works throughout the house without a problem. The price is right and as an investment in peace of mind and safety for your baby, it worth the money! I recommend for all new parents.",

      "text": "The item would get 5 stars from me if the app didnt have occasional issues with disconnecting and reconnecting. I'm a first time mom and the stress of everything that can go wrong when my loved one is sleeping was keeping me up all night. It made for an extremely exhausted mom. Once I'm sure the device will stay connected it gives me peace of mind that it will go off if my loved one is having any issues. This is also financially more realistic then the owlet.",

I love how fast it updates information based on what she is doing, it seems like seconds after she rolls it is alerting me. Update. I accidentally washed my sensor and was so upset. I let it dry out amd changed the battery and the thing still worked!!!!! Definitely will buy it again for kids in the future.",

I have an iPhone11 and haven't had any issues with the syncing, and it works throughout my whole house without disconnecting. Definitely recommend for peace of mind and much better than more expensive options!!",

I took it off my baby placed it on the table...it sent me an alarm 30 min after no breathing....My baby would be dead by then. Don\u2019t buy.",

      "text": "My 3 month old decides to roll over onto her tummy and sleep like that which scares me because I can't see her face I can't tell if she's able to breathe without constantly going to check but with the sense u monitor I have been able to sleep knowing it tracks her breathing and will alarm if breathing is too fast or to slow . The only downfall is the connection it's 50ft but in an open space so it tends to not connect unless I'm next to the wall her bed is at which is fine since I'm sleeping in the room next to her bedroom . Other than that I'm still happy about purchasing it",

Just frustrated becuase I really wanted this to work. I think I'm going to return and try something different.",

I did my reviews on the Sense-U and felt comfortable with it as opposed to other ones, such as the OwletCare baby monitor which we read heated/burned the foot. We tried the Sense-U on a newborn after the stump fell and we are hooked on it! Gives us a bigger peace of mind. And it was easy to set up. The only problem is that only 1 device can be connected to the Sense-U. Hopefully future improvements/firmware can allow for multiple users to connect to the Sense-U, so that both parents or caretakers can monitor. We would definitely recommend this to others!",
