Go with an electric candle. I\u2019m hoping to have the slot replaced vs returning the entire caddy.",

It holds everything from a book or iPad to your cell phone, glass of wine \ud83c\udf77, even a bud vase if you want flowers. It holds quite a bit without appearing crowded or cluttered. What\u2019s great is that it\u2019s expandable and could probably fit almost any tub. This works well with one of our tubs that\u2019s attached to the wall. The tray grips the lip/side of the tub just fine and stays in place; doesn\u2019t slide. This is definitely a great gift! I recommend this tray!",

It slides on both side so you can put it as it fits on the bathtub. I use all the parts to feel comfortable, I use the middle part to hold my phone or tablet it is secured on there do the it has three ridges to put your device on. Also there is a spot to put your drink, snacks and even a soap holder. Needless to say that I love it.",

The adjustable panel for supporting a book or tablet works well, too.
