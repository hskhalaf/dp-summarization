      "verdict": "The Adidas Ultraboost 19 is considered to be a successful reinvigoration of the famed series of neutral running shoes. Those who have tried it were happy with the reactive midsole design, the form-fitting upper and the durable configurations of the components. Moreover, the people were glad because this road companion was versatile enough to be used for activities other than running. On the other hand, some individuals were unhappy with the color schemes while others were disappointed with the apparently not-so-secure in-shoe coverage.",
      "pros": [
        "Many testers believed that the cushioning system that\u2019s present in the Adidas Ultraboost 19 is more responsive than the ones in the previous iterations",
        "The Primeknit upper felt comfortable and non-irritating to the skin, some people commented",
        "Several consumers claimed that the underfoot platform was reactive enough to handle long-distance running events and speed training sessions",
        "The general durability of this running shoe was lauded as it didn\u2019t break down on people, even after multiple runs",
        "Runners observed the noticeably spacious toe box that permitted natural toe-splay and averted skin chafing",
        "The versatility of this product was appreciated because people were able to use it for exercising and urban adventures"

        "A couple of runners claimed that the sidewalls of the shoe didn\u2019t hug the foot properly, thus resulting in some in-shoe wobbling"

I like the look more than the Adidas Ultra boost 20, they come up quite well in the washing machine on a low heat wash, I would recommend any adidas ultraboost 19 and any colour you will not regret them very very good.",
