He has short straight hair. My dog certainly enjoys the massage he gets from the gloves. While it grabbed some hair, the hair did not stick to the gloves as well as it does with longer haired dogs.

Unfortunately, these gloves were no better. While the nubs are softer, in order to actually get to her undercoat I had to apply a painful amount of pressure, which completely defeats the purpose. I am guessing these work better for cats. I am disappointed that these did not work, because I loved the idea of giving my pup some love, while also getting rid of some fur.",

Unfortunately, these gloves just don't pick up the cat fur - they are stiff and the bristles are hard, and the fur just doesn't stick to the bristles very well. Since they just don't do very well what they are advertised to do, two stars is the best I can do. I would NOT buy this product again.",

We have a shepherd mix who sheds like there's no tomorrow. We have a furminator but he HATES being brushed which means a session won't last more than 5 minutes. With the gloves he thinks he's just getting a very vigorous scratch session and LOVES it. He'll roll over and beg for you to rub his belly with the gloves and it's made the whole experience of deshedding much easier",

But the problem was only that it was a single right-hand version, and I had always hoped that I could find a glove for my left hand so that I could use both to \"scrub\" my long haired cat - with one hand moving in the opposite direction of the other. So when this pair became available I bought them, and they work as well as the original. Plenty of hair is pulled from her and it's easy to peel it off the glove faces.",

The gloves work well at removing loose fur and they're not too difficult to clean, but the velcro wrist bands are not very comfortable. They are stiff and difficult to unfasten For the money and the joy they bring to my kitty, I do recommend these grooming gloves. In fact, I bought a set for a neighbor's cat, too.",

Picking it out for a few minutes but it's worth it instead of following him around with a brush he's not fond of. The gloves also fit perfectly for my kind of medium sized hands. Bigger hands will have issue so beware that.",
