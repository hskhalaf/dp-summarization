Easiest way to attach the mixer to the storage container is to put the storage container on the table and place the hand mixer on the storage container, line it up and press down until it locks into place. Don't try to do it on your lap otherwise you will have a very hard time trying to get it on.",

It isn't a huge deal, but the selling point was a snap on bottom to carry and hold the tools.",
