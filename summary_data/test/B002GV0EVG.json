Checking with McAfee's website before my renewal showed a renewal price of $69.99 for this product. By purchasing from Amazon, I saved half the money at a cost of reinstalling my software. No brainer there. From a technical standpoint, the program does what I expect it to do. I also do not have to modify the settings to be able to access some of my favorite websites as I have had to do with other software. All in all, worth the money.",

The amount that they are willing to store is probably about half my hard drive, not very helpful. You can pay more money to get more storage, but it wasn't worth it for me.",

McAfee won't even talk about refunding, so my choices are to either reinstall a program that messed up my computer or eat the subscription charge. I might consider reinstalling if tech support were more responsive, but they're not, so that's where they've left me. My tech recommended Bit Defender, guess I'll try that next.",

Customer Service said I had a window from May 10 until May 31 and I missed the deadline.
