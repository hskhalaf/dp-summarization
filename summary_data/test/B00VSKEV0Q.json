The style, the traction, and the fit were touted as agreeable assets of the trainer. However, the Pump technology was unhelpful in achieving the right fit for some users. Other gripes included the tight opening and inconsistent sizing scheme. Overall, CrossFit aficionadoes were pretty satisfied with this trainer.",
      "pros": [
        "The Reebok CrossFit Nano Pump Fusion held up well for various CrossFit WODs, cardio training, short runs, and gym sessions, as stated by most testers",

        "A light, yet sturdy material of the upper unit gained the favor of many users",
        "The Pump technology was welcomed by some athletes",
        "apparently, it allowed them to customize the fit precisely to their preference",
        "A handful of reviewers took note of the excellent grip of the outsole",
        "Some buyers found the style of the shoe to be clean and modern"

      "cons": [
        "A considerable number of wearers complained that the tight cleatie construction of the upper required a lot of effort to put on the shoe",

        "Some users found the Pump technology to be a gimmick",
        "apparently, they didn\u2019t even need to use it to get the right fit",
        "A few athletes reported that the Pump deflated during the workout",
        "moreover, it flattened to a different extent in each shoe, making the fit uncomfortably uneven",

I have \"pumped\" them up multiple times and not much changes. I even went to the reebok website and watched a video on how the \"pump\" works. I was doing it correctly. Not only are they huge....they are HOT. Not only do I sweat profusely, but now my feet do too. That makes for an awful wet shoe that takes days to dry. Since I work out everyday, this is a constant problem. On a positive....they look really cool. Probably won't purchase again.",
