I do think that after working with it one can be quick and efficient with it. It is what I've seen as the best design in appearance. and not ugly or bulky looking. I own the Canon rebel T5 with a Tamron 70-300 and this shell fits great. This lens is the max size I would go with on this size shell.",

Most of what I have tried is too bulky, and too slow to deploy camera. This Peak Design cover was exactly want I was looking for.",
