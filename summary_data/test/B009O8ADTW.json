      "text": "Unbelievable value for the money. Dollar for dollar, you cannot beat the value! I purchased this sink for a major kitchen remodel. Was intending to purchase a Franke at first, but glad I saved that money and bought this sink. I have it undermounted to a Caesarstone quartz countertop (purchased through IKEA). Absolutely love it! 16 gauge 18/10 stainless steel (i.e., thick and non-magnetic). Deep bowls (9\") which are deeper when when undermounted due to the countertop thickness. I clean the sink with BKF Liquid Soft Cleanser and a Jet-Scrubz sponge. Sink come packaged very well, with all of the necessary mounting hardware.",

      "text": "Just awesome so far. Amazed at how much difference the extra 4\" depth is over the old sink. The extra gauge thickness means the disposal doesn not shake the sink - of course as it is undermount, much more rigid installation. HOPEFULLY there will be no issue because it is an undermount with a $1500 granite slab installed on top! Saved $400 over the \"wholesale\" price of the identical one the granite fabricator tried to sell me. When I told him what I paid, he said it was $110 BELOW his cost.",
