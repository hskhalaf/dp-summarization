The camera was well taken care of and used about once every few months. A few weeks ago I noticed while taking still shots the image was distorted with lines going through them. I wiped the storage disk clean and reformatted it and I also reformatted the camera to factory settings. None of this helped. The camera is capable of taking panoramic photos, and video but not still shots. It's very strange. It was a decent little point and shoot for the cost but didn't hold up even with minimal use.",

Yes, the files are in fact 20 megapixels, but they are so blurry that what you really have is an 8 megapixel image. I tried every setting, lighting, tripod, time delay, etc. Nothing works, and in fact my iPhone still took a better image, in-hand, than the camera on a tripod.",

I do also wish, as constructive criticism, that there was an intermediate setting between VGA and 5 MP. The pictures are either too small (150k) or too large (3 GB).

This camera meets most of the expectations, except one- the speed. I've got many not focused pictures and some, which are just late. There is no manual included (I found it at manualslib.com) and there is many adjustments, which is time consuming to try. So, the camera is just little slow for now, but works right otherwise.",

The resolution of the picture is better than what you see on the viewfinder, although the viewfinder is good quality too. They are also very reasonably priced for the quality of product you get. When we are out and about, I tend to leave my camera out of the case in my bag so I can pull it out quickly and take pictures. It has been durable despite the abuse, and we've had no problem whatsoever with them.",

It occasionally takes accidental pictures of the inside of my pocket, the ceiling, or the floor, but I chalk that up to my own random pressing of the button.",

    "description": "Color:Silver| Style:Only CameraIt's the amazingly easy-to-use camera that slips right in your pocket-with an 8x optical zoom 20 1MP photos and beautifully-detailed HD videos And pics stay clearer even with shaky hands thanks to optical steady shot image stabilization You can also enhance your images with built-in effects that adjust skin tone and texture or even whiten teeth\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCYBER-SHOT DIGITAL CAMERA W830\nIt\u2019s the amazingly easy-to-use camera that slips right in your pocket\u2014with an 8x optical zoom, 20.1MP photos and beautifully-detailed HD videos. And pics stay clearer, even with shaky hands thanks to Optical SteadyShot image stabilization. You can also enhance your images with built-in effects that adjust skin tone and texture or even whiten teeth.\n\n20.1 MEGAPIXEL PLUS 8X ZOOM\nA powerful 20.1 megapixel CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 20.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19\u201d) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. The 8x zoom Carl Zeiss Vario Tessar lens helps you get much closer to your subjects.\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT IMAGE STABILIZATION WITH 2-WAY ACTIVE MODE\nSony's Active Mode image stabilization gives you the freedom to shoot movies even while walking or running. 2-way Active Mode corrects for both vertical and horizontal motion.\n\n720P MP4 HD MOVIE MODE\nIn 720p MP4 movie mode the camera shoots 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps, a standard format when working with a PC.\u00b9 Create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac computer. Once transferred to your computer and connected to the internet, you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube.\n\nCREATIVE SHOOTING WITH PICTURE AND BEAUTY EFFECTS\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Beauty Effects allows edits to skin tones, skin smoothing, shine removal, eye widening, and teeth whitening. Beauty Effects can be combined to further enhance the image.\n\nADVANCED FLASH ILLUMINATES DISTANT SUBJECTS\nAdvanced Flash allows you to shoot bright, beautifully lit photos. The built in flash reaches farther resulting in brighter subjects in dimly lit rooms or outdoors in the evening.\n\nINTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground, landscape shots, a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode.\n\nSWEEP PANORAMA MODE (UP TO 360\u00b0)\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360\u00b0 full circle, the camera can take a variety of panoramic shots. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.\n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\n\n2.7\u201d (230K DOTS) CLEAR PHOTO LCD DISPLAY\nGenerous 2.7\u201d (230K dots) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight.\n\nPRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS\n * Camera Type:Compact zoom digital camera\n * Imaging Sensor:1/2.3\" Super HAD CCD Sensor\n * Processor:BIONZ\n * Pixel Gross:20.5MP\n * Effective Picture Resolution:20.1MP\n * Color Filter System:RGB primary color mosaic filters\n * Media Type:Memory Stick Duo; Memory Stick PRO Duo; Memory Stick PRO Duo(High Speed); Memory Stick PROHG Duo; Memory Stick Micro*6 ; Memory Stick Micro (Mark2)*6 ; SD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card; microSD Memory Card*6; microSDHC Memory Card*6; Memory Stick XC-HG Duo; microSDXC Memory Card*6\n * Still Image Mode:JPEG\n * Still Image Max Effective Resolution:Approx. 20.1 Megapixels\n * Still Image Size 16:9:15M (5,152 x 2,896)/ 2M(1,920 x 1,080)\n * Still Image Size 4:3:20M (5,152 x 3,864)/ 10M(3,648 x 2,736) / 5M(2,592 x 1,944) /VGA\n * Panorama Still Image Size:360 (11,520\u00d71,080) / Wide(7,152 x 1,080 / 4,912 x 1,920) / Standard (4,912 x 1,080 / 3,424 x 1,920)\n * Video Format:MP4 (AVC/H.264)\n * Video Mode:MP4:9M Fine(1,280\u00d7720/30fps)\n   /6M STD(1,280\u00d7720/30fps)\n   /3M VGA(640\u00d7480/30fps)\n * Audio Format:MP3\n * Microphone/Speaker:Mono / mono\n * Lens Type:Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar\n * Aperture:f 3.3-6.3\n * Optical Zoom:8x\n * Digital Zoom:32x\n * Smart Zoom Technology:Precision Digital Zoom Approx.32x\n   / Smart Zoom ( 10M Approx.11x\n   / 5M Approx.15x\n   / VGA Approx.64x\n   / 2M(16:9) Approx.21x)\n * Focal Length (35mm equivalent):Still 4:3: 25-200mm / Movie 4:3: 34-272mm (SteadyShot Standard) 34-381 (SteadyShot Active) / Still 16:9: 28-224mm / Movie 16:9: 28-224mm (SteadyShot Standard) 28-314mm (SteadyShot Active)\n * Lens Construction:8 elements in 7 groups (including 5 aspheric elements)\n * Minimum Focus Distance:iAuto: AF (W: Approx. 5cm (0.16 ft.) to Infinity, T: Approx. 150cm (4.92 ft.) to Infinity) / Program Auto: AF (W: Approx. 5cm (0.16 ft.) to Infinity, T: Approx. 150cm (4.92 ft.) to Infinity)\n * Aspheric Elements:5\n * Steady Shot Mode:Active:Yes\n * LCD Type:2.7\" Clear Photo LCD (230K dots)\n * Brightness Control:5 (Bright) / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 (Dark)\n * Grid Display:Yes (Off / On)\n * AF Modes:Multi Point AF / Center Weighted AF / Spot AF / Tracking Focus / Face Tracking Focus\n * AF Illuminator:Auto / Off\n * Metering Modes:Multi Pattern / Center Weighted / Spot\n * Exposure Compensation:Plus / Minus 2.0EV, 1 / 3EV step\n * Scene Mode(s):High Sensitivity / Soft snap / Soft Skin / Landscape / Night Portrait / Night Scene / Gourmet / Beach / Snow / Fireworks / Pet mode\n * D-Range Optimizer:Standard / Plus / Off\n * ISO:Auto / 80 / 100 / 200 / 400 / 800 / 1600 / 3200\n * White Balance Mode:Auto / Daylight / Cloudy / Fluorescent 1 (White Fluorescent Lighting) / Fluorescent 2 (Natural White Fluorescent Lighting) / Fluorescent 3 (Day White Fluorescent Lighting) / Incandescent / Flash / One Push, One Push Set\n * Self-timer:Off / 10sec. / 2sec. / portrait1 / portrait2\n * Shutter Speeds:iAuto (2\" - 1/1,600) / Program Auto (1\" - 1/1,600)\n * Burst Mode:Approx 1 fps at 16.1MP (Maximum 100 shots)\n * Flash Modes:Auto / Flash On / Slow Synchro / Flash Off / Advanced Flash\n * Flash Coverage:ISO Auto: Approx. 0.3m to 2.8m (11 7/8 in. to 9 ft. 2 1/4 in.)(W) / Approx. 1.5m to 2 m (4 ft. 11 1/8 in. to 6 ft. 6 3/4 in.)(T), ISO3200: up to Approx. 5.3 m (17 ft. 4 3/4 in.)(W) / Approx. 3.3 m (11 ft. 10 in.)(T)\n * Erase/Protect:Erase: Single / Select / Date / Folder, Protect: Single / Select / Date / Folder\n * Power Save Mode:Standard / Max / Off\n * Face Detection:8 Faces\n * Smile Shutter technology:Yes\n * Image Stabilization:Optical SteadyShot Image Stabilization with Active Mode\n * In-Camera Editing:Trimming / Unsharp Masking / Beauty Effect / Date view\n * Intelligent Auto:Yes\n * Shooting Tips:Yes\n * Blink Detection:Yes\n * Priority Setting (for Face Detection):(Auto / Off / Child Priority / Adult Priority)\n * Memory Card Slot:MS Duo and SD/SDHC/SDXC compatible\n * SD Output:Composite\n * USB Port(s):Multi (AV/USB), Hi-Speed USB (USB2.0)\n * Dimensions (Approx.):W x H x D: 3 3/4\" x 2 1/8\" x 29/32\" (93.1mm x 52.3mm x 22.5mm)\n * Weight (Approx.):4.3 oz.
