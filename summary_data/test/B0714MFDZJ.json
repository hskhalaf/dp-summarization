But issue is, the auger that fits into the chute, has lost its function of fruit pulp-propulsion through its rotatory motion... The machine (motor part) itself is working fine and other parts are ok. But the fruit pulp and juice just starts churning in the chute and the juice never dribbles down although the juice opening is just down there on the bottom. So is the pulp that never makes its way out of the pulp opening. Hopefully I get a solution on this issue.",

Having a juice extractor at home makes it easy to prepare delicious, wholesome juices using your favorite fruits and vegetables with no added ingredients or preservatives. And the low-speed, quiet motor is perfect for extracting all the goodness from vegetables, fruits, leafy greens, and wheatgrass. This juicer assembles very quickly with a few twists. When you are ready to juice, simply plug it in, set up the juice and pulp cups, turn it on, and begin adding fruit or vegetables to the chute. The slow juicer\u2019s masticating action crushes and squeezes produce to extract the maximum amount of juice. Once your juice is ready to serve, a separator keeps the foam from pouring out with the juice. All the parts are dishwasher safe and cleaning up is easier than most juice extractors because the strainer rinses clean with running water. Follow a recipe from the included booklet, or create your own flavor combinations. Make fresh juice with minimal effort and easy cleanup. ..now that\u2019s Good Thinking.",
