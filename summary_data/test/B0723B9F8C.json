The battery life has dropped quite a bit and the fingerprint recognition has stopped working which is a nuisance as every time I stop using it I have to enter the code again. Not good. The fingerprint recognition is poorly designed compared with my Huawei phone, this is a great one from Huawei. Shame they did not use the same one as the phone!",

The picture is excellent and the processing speed is as quick as the higher end brands. The sound is good and (having left Apple iOS for android in 2015) found the operating system easy to use.",
