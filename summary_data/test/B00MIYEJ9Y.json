It came with one of the most comprehensive and easy to understand owner's manual I've seen in a long time. I set it up in about 2 hours including programing my TV remote, setting up the woofer Bluetooth and setting up the Bluetooth with my Android phone. Everything worked on the first try as I read & followed all of the instructions carefully. The woofer 'woofs' just right and the sound from the sound bar is incredible! Good job Yamaha for a great product! I've had several sound bars before but, this one is a keeper..",

Plenty of power to rattle your windows if you need it to. On the more realistic side, it provides crisp clear believable surround sounds and both the soundbar and sub-woofers levels can be adjusted.",

Pros: Easy no-brainer setup (even a caveman can do it), inputs for optical, coaxial, bluetooth, RCA analog. Cons: stereo and surround modes not much different...I actually prefer the stereo mode for crisper dialogues and music listening.",

Subwoofer/speaker outperforms the Samsung but a mile. Not sure why people don't like the phone app; I find it quite simple to use and convenient.

I read a CNET review and decided to to purchase this sound bar. For its price and features, it's absolutely excellent. Yamaha's repeater feature should be standard on every sound bar.",

After unpacking the item, it was really easy to get setup, including getting my existing TV remote to adjust power (on/off) and adjust volume (up/down). The sound and volume on this product is really quite good for a small to medium sized room. I am really quite pleased with this purchase.",

I also have a JBL SB350 connected to my old TV Samsung 55\" curved and comparing both Yamaha is much more clearer, louder and has heavy bass. The remote of Yamaha is also cool and easy to get any sound you prefer. Very impressed.",
