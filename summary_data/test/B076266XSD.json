    "description": "Pure Origins Funny \u201cKeep Calm and\u201d Stress Balls (4 Pack)\n\nLife is too short not to have some humour in it! Brighten up your day with these colourful cute light-hearted stress balls that will never fail to put a smile on your face : ). \n\nStay Motivated!\n\n- Motivation is a complex phenomenon which occurs in our brains. \n- Staying motivated can prove extremely challenge when we face barriers of stress. It involves biological, emotional, social and cognitive forces that activate behaviour. \n- We can adopt simple measures to help us get through the roughest of days and maintain our motivation through understanding what processes our brains to cause us to feel stressed. \n\nDid you know?\n\n- The feelings from stress are directed through our sensory channels. \n- When our sensory channels are blocked or occupied from an external activity, our experiences aren\u2019t as intense or vivid. \n- In other words, when we\u2019re physically occupied our minds aren\u2019t focused or concentrated on whatever is stressing us. \n- This is why some of the best stress reducers are physical activities. That\u2019s what makes stress balls and Baoding balls so effective. \n\nSqueeze your problems away!\n\n- Research has shown that our brains take in and process a lot of information that comes through our hands. \n- When squeezing a stress ball, your brain has to use a lot of its resources to process the sensation and activity coming in through your hand. \n- This means it has less resources to dedicate to your stress. \n\nAdd some vibrancy and humor into your life!\n\nSo the next time you are feeling the blues, reach out for a Pure Origins Funny Humor Stress Ball to brighten your day with a smile. Uplift your spirit visually from our amusing handpicked quotes and designs. Perfect for those days when we are feeling low and need some motivation to keep our chin up!",
