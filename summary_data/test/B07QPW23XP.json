      "text": "I bought these with a little bit of trepidation - trainers, half a size up, not tried on and off the internet! I needn't have worried - I'm usually an 8 but went for an 8.5 and they were absolutely perfect. I wore them that night for a run - no wearing in required. They are super comfortable, cushioned and supportive and despite running upwards of 15-20km a week (I'm a new runner) for the last 3 weeks, they've been brilliant. Would have no hesitation in recommending them and the half size up was perfect for my wider-than-average feet.",

I am cautious when running because I am scared to fall which is having a knock on effect to my running style and will probably end up creating an injury. I now need to buy a different pair when I only just brought these.",
