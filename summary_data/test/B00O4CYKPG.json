Packaging was overdone if anything -- there were both an outer and inner box and the frame and all shelves were individually bubble wrapped. Setup is easy and requires no tools, and it should be easy to break down for moving or storage. Nice, unobtrusive design. Shelves are just wide enough for magnum bottles or Champagne. Overall a great choice for a small wine collection.",

This is the problem with amazon.. looks good in the pic... bought this in April with a 1 month return window(that I was unaware of). You cant tell in a month this thing is going to fall apart, although it came with a few broken welds. I feel taken advantage of. This was NOT an inexpensive purchase but when I first had it put together, I knew it was going to be trouble. I am very unhappy with the AMAZON experience lately. Broken items, items that never arrive, return inconvienience. I cant return this now and feel ive been taken for $100 or more.",

It arrived quickly and I could not be happier, I highly recommend this",

This one shelf was so curved (yet in no way could have been damaged in shipping) that there's no way the packer wouldn't see that it wasn't square. Poor quality control I wouldn't recommend this product.",

A few month later we go into the room the wine rack is in to find that one of the hooks holding a shelf up had broken loose at the welding and the four wine bottles we had on that rack had crashed onto our tile floor. Two of the bottles broke open releasing red wine all over the tile and grout. The grout is now stained. We are still using the other shelves but do not trust it to hold more than 3 bottles on a shelf vs the 6 it is designed to hold. I would not recommend this item.",

That said, I am very happy with this, it's functional and sturdy with a simple design. Rack holds nearly all bottle types including pinot noir. I have one bottle that is slimmer and longer than standard bottles and it sticks out a bit, otherwise all my bottles sit nestled in the sections. I have two rows full or pinot noir bottles and no issues with fit. Excellent purchase.",
