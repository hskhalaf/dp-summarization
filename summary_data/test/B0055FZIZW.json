My first one was a refurbished unit that ended up with a blown speaker within 90 days. Amazon was great about taking it back for a refund. My second now doesn't work due on the optical digital input which basically is the only input from my TV. So other than rare situational BlueRay's in my bedroom TV I'll never use it. I have a home theater in my livingroom so this was supposed to support regular TV watching when we didn't want to blow the roof off the house. When it worked the sound quality was great.",

Lots of adjust-ability with 3 pre-set modes, bass and treble adjustment, a dialogue enhancement feature and volume leveling. We purchased the unit because of less than desired sound quality, especially for dialogue, from our flat screen TV, which is not wall mounted. This unit is definitely an improvement, although we still miss some dialogue in situations where there is a lot of background music. The first unit that was shipped had a problem of turning off after about an hour, but Amazon was great about handling a replacement, which is functioning just fine.",

Powerful, great bass, treble all adjustable and super installation. No need to disconnect any hook ups on your T.V. We love it in our house, never regretted buying it from the moment we turned it on. Found it online for $149.00 and the best it is made in the good ole USA!!!!!!!!!! Better get one if you're considering a purchase..",

It does everything the manufacture says that it does... How refreshing! I bought one for a 55\" LG TV in the game room and couldn't be more pleased. Now I am going to buy one for the TV in the den.

It allows you to control, base, treble , play different surround modes, and emphasize voice quality when dialog is difficult to understand. Music sounds really very good when played thtough the Zvox 555. Having mutiple inputs add to the versatility of how you can use it. Finally the size of the unit makes it very easy to locate and set up. It doesn't take up much space and is very easy to set up! Highly recommend it!",

Several friends have heard the system and they also made a purchase for their home. Is it perfect no, but is it a great value? Yes!",

Every other remote I have ever used will operate the equipment from across the room.",

      "text": "I had a ZVOX 550 and just replaced it with a 555. What a difference; well worth the extra $100!! My primary problem with the 550 was that there was no display so you never knew what your settings were. Also, the remote was very finicky. The 555 solves those problems. Voice clarity, my primary issue with my TV (Samsung HD UN46B8500) is great and the design of the ZVOX to serve as a TV base is practical and is easy to set up. I'm sure there are better speaker systems out there but for $400, you can't beat this product. Nice job ZVOX!",

Like some of the comments doesn't have deep bass but it does a descent job for the type of system it is. Great sound quality and I recommend it for anyone that just wants to hear a movie with a much better sound without it rumbling the room.",

    "title": "ZVOX 555 Low-Profile Single-Cabinet Surround Sound System with Optical and Coaxial Digital Inputs",
    "description": "Only 3.5 high, the ZVOX Z-Base 555 home theater system can be placed beneath your flat-panel TV - so you can have surround sound without adding a lot of clutter to your room. It requires no external speakers, subwoofer or speaker wires. The 555 reproduces TV shows, music and movie soundtracks with lifelike accuracy - including crystal-clear vocals and thunderous bass. And the ZVOX Phase Cue virtual surround system delivers remarkable three-dimensional sound. The entire system-speakers, amplifier, virtual surround technology and powered subwoofer-fits into the super-slim cabinet. With only one connecting cord and a one-page owner's manual, it is truly \"plug and play.\" The cabinet is robustly constructed using fully-braced MDF (medium density fiberboard) - not molded plastic. Beautiful hand-lacquered high-gloss ebony end panels create a stylish look.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nZVOX SOUNDBASE 555 SINGLE CABINET SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM\nOnly 3.5\" high, the ZVOX SoundBase 555 home theater system can be placed beneath your flat-panel TV so you can have surround sound without adding a lot of clutter to your room. It requires no external speakers, subwoofer or speaker wires. The 555 reproduces TV shows, music and movie soundtracks with lifelike accuracy, including crystal-clear vocals and thunderous bass. And the ZVOX PhaseCue virtual surround system delivers remarkable three-dimensional sound. The entire sound bar system, including speakers, amplifier, virtual surround technology and powered subwoofer, fits into the super-slim cabinet. With only one connecting cord and a one-page owner's manual, it is truly \"plug and play.\" The cabinet is robustly constructed using fully-braced MDF (medium density fiberboard), not molded plastic. Beautiful hand-lacquered high-gloss ebony end panels create a stylish look.\n\nPlace the 3.5\" high ZVOX 555 beneath your flat-panel TV for surround sound without the clutter. View larger\nEven playing at loud volumes, the 555 usually uses less than 10 watts of total power. View larger\nFeaturing a behind the grill, disappearing 4-digit display for settings and features GREAT SOUND\nThe most important feature for any home theater system is high quality sound. The 555 uses five high-performance speakers, a built-in powered subwoofer, a real wood (MDF) cabinet and a 70-watt Class D digital amplifier to create warm, natural sound and surprisingly powerful bass.\n\nPHASECUE VIRTUAL SURROUND SOUND\nWith ZVOX you don't need a room full of speakers for home theater sound. The 555 uses the proprietary PhaseCue virtual surround system to give you rich, three-dimensional sound with movies or music. With music, PhaseCue creates a very wide soundstage--it literally sounds like you are listening to speakers eight feet apart from each other. When listening to a good movie, the soundtrack will envelop you, putting you in the middle of the action.\n\nThe benefits of PhaseCue vary greatly based on program material. Live music and well-recorded modern movie soundtracks will deliver rich, three-dimensional sound, pulling the sound out from the speakers and into the room to literally surround the listener. While no virtual surround system will give you the exact surround effects of a good 5.1 system, the ZVOX 555 does a remarkable job.\n\nPhaseCue virtual surround system gives you rich, three-dimensional sound with movies or music. View larger\nFront controls include power, volume, mute and input selection, plus a 3.5mm stereo input for easy attachment of your smartphone or MP3 player. View larger\nFeaturing inputs for analog stereo, optical, and coaxial digital. View larger GREEN DESIGN\nThe 555 uses a highly-efficient Class D digital amplifier. Even playing at quite loud volumes, it usually uses less than 10 watts of total power. And standby power usage tends to hover around 0.1 watts, making it one of the \"greenest\" audio systems ever made. The 555 is Energy Star qualified.\n\nSETTING A NEW STANDARD FOR VOCAL CLARITY\nZVOX systems are known for their remarkable vocal clarity. The 555 adds a stunning new feature: Dialog Emphasis (DE). When you push the \"DE\" button on the remote control you engage a circuit that mimics the functions of a hearing aid. The frequencies used by human voices are emphasized and compressed, while other frequencies are minimized. No other speaker system provides such an easy-to-use and effective method for improving the intelligibility of television dialog.\n\nUSES YOUR REMOTE CONTROL\nThe new Z-Base systems can be programmed to respond to your remote control. The illuminated display walks you through a less-than-a-minute programming cycle. Then your TV remote...or cable box remote...or satellite receiver remote...or ANY remote...can control volume, mute, power and input functions of the ZVOX system.\n\nTAMING COMMERCIALS THAT ARE TOO LOUD\nIf you've ever been blasted out of your chair by a too-loud commercial, or by a cable channel that's twice as loud as another channel, you'll love the new Output Leveling (OL) feature on the ZVOX 555. Just push the \"OL\" button and a sophisticated compression system takes over, making soft sounds louder and loud sounds softer, so there are fewer jarring moments when switching channels or when commercials come on.\n\nDISAPPEARING DISPLAY\nThe 555 features a four-digit display located behind the speaker grille that shows the current setting for volume, bass, treble and PhaseCue (virtual surround)--and also shows when you have engaged the Mute, Output Leveling (OL) or Dialog Emphasis (DE) features. A few seconds after you stop using your remote (or front panel) controls, the display disappears completely.\n\nCONNECT YOUR IPOD AND OTHER DEVICES\nThe 555 has two analog audio inputs, one optical digital input, and one coaxial digital input, plus a front-panel 3.5mm analog stereo input for convenient connection of your iPod or other portable audio device. Any specific input can be selected using either the remote control or the slim-line module below the speaker grille.\n\nWOOD (MDF) CABINET WITH HAND-LACQUERED SIDE PANELS\nThe 555 features a hand-built cabinet of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard) with beautiful hand-lacquered high-gloss end panels. Its low-profile design blends perfectly with flat-panel TVs. Most people don't even notice the ZVOX 555 until they hear it.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nZVOX Z-base 555, 1 stereo RCA to stereo RCA connecting cable, multifunction remote control with programming instruction sheet, power cord, one-sheet safety instructions, operations manual, Quick Start guide.\n\nZVOX SOUNDBASE SYSTEM COMPARISON CHART\nZVOX 220ZVOX 320ZVOX 420ZVOX 555ZVOX 580 Dolby Digital Support1 Advanced Processor for enhanced virtual surround and musical fidelity Output Leveling to tame loud commercials Dialog Emphasis for super-clear vocals Built-in Powered Subwoofer Wood (MDF) Cabinet Switching between multiple A/V devices Can learn to respond to other remotes Front connection for iPod or other devices Volume and power controls on sound system Bass Adjustment Control Treble Adjustment Control PhaseCue II Virtual Surround Sound Multiple Virtual Surround Settings Main Speakers(3) 2\"(3) 2\"(5) 2\"(5) 2\"(5) 3.25\" Subwoofer(1) 5.25\"(1) 5.25\"(1) 5.25\"(1) 5.25\"(2) 6.5\" Dimensions (Height x Width x Depth)3.4\" x 17\" x 12.5\"3.5\" x 24\" x 11.5\"3.5\" x 28\" x 14.5\"3.5\" x 28\" x 14.55\" x 36\" x 16.5\" Recommended for use under TVs2 sized...37\" or smaller27\" - 42\"32\" - 50\"37\" - 55\"42\" - 70\" TV Base Maximum Depth11\"10\"14\"14\"16\" TV Base Maximum Width16\"22\"26\"26\"34\" TV Weight Limit (lbs)405070125165 AC Power Requirement100-240V, 50/60 Hz100-240V, 50/60 Hz100-240V, 50/60 Hz120 Volts only120 Volts only  1. If a TV is connected to an off-air HDTV antenna or to an HD cable TV feed without a cable box, a sound system connected to the TV's digital audio output may require a Dolby Labs license. The analog audio output of a TV will always work, if present.\n 2. These are guidelines. Confirm your TV base fits within the width and depth of the top of the ZVOX Audio system. It is not necessary to place a TV on top of a ZVOX Audio system. A ZVOX Audio system sounds excellent placed near a TV. Allow for a 1.75\" space behind the ZVOX system for rear panel connections.",
