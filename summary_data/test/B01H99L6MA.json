      "text": "I have had this product for about two weeks. Overall, it performs better than my previous two amplifiers from other manufacturers, particularly in restaurants and other somewhat noisy environments. In truly noisy situations, the amplification is not selective but such is the situation with expensive prescription hearing aids also. I will probably purchase another one for my other ear just to better balance reception. My only complaint, as such, is that replacement hearing tubes (needed every 4-6 months) are rather expensive at about $13 each - not a deal breaker but unfortunate.",

He is enjoying being able to hear conversations again and I think it's really helping him. I noticed when I tried them that they didn't feel like you are putting something loud in your ear but more like sound enhancement if that makes sense. So these, while expensive, are a heck of a lot cheaper than standard hearing aids and seem to be very high quality.",

      "text": "The Hearing Amplifier is working great at this time. It took a few weeks to get used to size of the amplifier behind her ear, as it was a bit wider in width than her normal hearing aid. She quickly figured out how to adjust the amplifier for her needs, and now that she has gotten used to it, she is very pleased with it. Her hearing has improved significantly in her right ear, and she is now planning to get a Otofonix for her left ear. You can't beat the price and Otofonix provides excellent instructions for adjusting for optimum performance.",

I have learned to use the different environment settings and this helps between talking, movie watching and such. Batteries are cheap. Have to keep your ears clean, a little wax in the end stops them from working until you clean the tip.",

Its owner, Luke, is a stand-up person in all regards. he has gone to extreme lengths to make me satisfied with my hearing aid. I have experienced many bad products and companys and thought that it was better not to hear well than be taken by snake-oil sales of very expensive aids that had reviews of horrible problems. Luke's hearing aid attributes are; inexpensive, small and lightweight, great sound, comfortable, almost invisible, great support. I highly recommend this product.",
