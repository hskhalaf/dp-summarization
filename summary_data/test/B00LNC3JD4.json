This is the perfect product to use, as it's not too heavy on your face and has the right amount of coverage. I haven't found another product that works as well as this one.",

I tried the light-medium corrector, but it makes my skin orange. I reached out to the seller and told them of these things prior to posting this review, however, the declined to reply. On to the next product, I suppose.",
