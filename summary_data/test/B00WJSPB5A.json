I dinged one star due to experience with hard plastic end-connections that have become brittle and cracked. It will take years to know how Belkin's plastic connections will hold-up under temperature in the semi-enclosed audio rack. The cable is somewhat stiff, but hopefully this is due to better shielding compared to thin/flexible. Seller: price swings? I paid more than it is now a couple months later.",
