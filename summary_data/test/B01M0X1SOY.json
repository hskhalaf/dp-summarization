Just this morning... a whole lot of clanging goes on. A piece broke off on the inside and now it doesn't work. Why was the second fan so shoddy? Really disappointed. I've included photos.",

We have vaulted ceilings and I use this to mix the air when our AC is on in the hot summer months as we have no ceiling fans. It singlehandedly keeps the upstairs cool. Very impressive.",
