I keep a water bottle on the outside. Very stylish, too.",

I even found a laptop case (link below )that matches the backpack exactly and fits in the location meant for the laptop. It's perfect if you want to add more protection for a new laptop. The bottom of the backpack beneath the spot for the laptop does not have that much padding either, so keep that in mind if you tend to drop you backpack a lot from waist height. Other than that, I love it and I highly recommend it! Laptop case link:",

The straps are very well sewn and durable. The material is a thick canvas that is very durable and stands up against regular wear and tear and the elements. There are tons of pockets for keeping everything organized and safe. The zippers all run well and stay zipped. The back and straps are nicely padded and there's an additional pocket on the back to keep valuables such as a phone safe and secure. Overall, this is an attractive, durable, and roomy bag and I certainly recommend it.",

      "text": "Even if the main zipper wasn't already broken before the 1 month mark, I still wouldn't continue using this backpack because of how uncomfortable it is. The HORRIBLE straps, which are only adjustable in 1 place, unlike literally every other backpack, are abrasive, stiff, and wide on the deltoids and chest. This backpack literally cuts off circulation to my arms if it's tight because of the strap shape. This backpack shifts all the weight into your lower/middle back, making for the most painful walking experience of your life. Even if you just have a couple lbs in the bag, it will strain your back because of the awkward weight distribution.",
