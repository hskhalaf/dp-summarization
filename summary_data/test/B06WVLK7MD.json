Ribs, brisket, chicken, are all done without hitting 300+ degrees. It really likes to keep 225 degrees (60-70 F outside temp) and can easily do lower if that is want you want. People that have tried the meat that have come off of it have been impressed. I looked at several others but this one caught me eye. I especially like being able to remove the ashes/coals when done to prevent rusting. Putting it together was easy over a couple of cold beverages.",

The slide out firebox grate is a plus making the unit a good deal for the price. Durability, of course, is yet to be determined but in this capacity a lot can be cooked at one time.",
