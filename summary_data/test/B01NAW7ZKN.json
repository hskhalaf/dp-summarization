Yes, it is a smoker but, from what I can figure it is only a smoker if you sit beside it and press the SMOKE button every twenty minutes. The product did indeed cook the meat but the smoke flavor was definitely not part of the taste. Maybe it's just me but I don't see how to change the settings for the cook time and / or temp.",

Our mobile app allows you to operate your smoker from any smart device. The 40\" cabinet has dual elements which allows for faster smoking and more even cooking. Smoke Tronix is the first smoker to offer a \"cold smoking\" setting, which allows you to smoke fish and cheeses without overcooking. The \"fast smoke\" setting will get your wood chips smoking in fifteen minutes, rather than waiting and waiting for the chips to smolder. The Smoke Tronix was designed by smokers, with the smoker in mind. Check out our app on iOS or Google Play and see the difference.",
