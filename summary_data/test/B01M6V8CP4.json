My brother, a contractor, introduced me to the way the \"pros\" drive deck fasteners and I'll never use a drill to drive screws again. The ratchet action coupled with the torx-type screw head prevents slippage and even driving very long fasteners is fairly easy. Do your self a favor and also invest in a set of driver bits if you order this tool.",

This thing is an absolute beast of an impact. It's impressively fast for a cordless. It's also incredibly durable (par for the course with Makita), feels great in your hand, and gets the job done with ease. I also use 4.0Ah batteries with mine, which makes this great drill even better. If you're looking into buying an impact, this is the one to buy. You most definitely will not be disappointed.",

The only bad thing i can say is that something about the motor spin feels cheap i can't quite describe however it's my first brushless tool so maybe this is how it should feel. Bottom line for the price paid it seems like a very good deal.",

First time with a Brushless tool in my shop and makes a lot of difference. The drill is powerful and run cool most of the time plus is comfortable and light. I just finish to set up a cedar fence around the house with 2 1/2 screws and is great. I got the bare tool without case and battery and together with the drill get the thing done around the house.",
