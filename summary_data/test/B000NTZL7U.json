Both of my kids (7 and 5) really responded to the incentive of being able to show what they've done each day. However, it's not ideal for tracking two children. I'm almost wondering if I need to get a second one. There's not enough space to put two smiley faces on each day for the same task. (ex. only the older child has homework, but they both have to brush their teeth.) I store the unused magnets elsewhere and use a dry erase marker and a ruler to extend the chart onto the second white board.",

      "text": "I like this board. It's a fun and self explanatory way of teaching kids how to follow directions and responsibilities. My little boy looks forward to filling the little widgets as well as getting new responsibilities. The only things is that the magnet can be a little slippery and fall. It would be nice of the designers find a way to incorporate a small storage space to save the magnet. But overall, I am very happy with the concept and product and this will be a staple tool for teaching our kids well in our household.",

And I can add my younger son when he is old enough. This chart helped him do things on his own, without me telling him, and that must give him some confidence that he can do things on his own.

I just wish there were more blank blocks to write your own stuff on and you can seperate the two boards (too much to play with). Melissa and Doug have great products.
