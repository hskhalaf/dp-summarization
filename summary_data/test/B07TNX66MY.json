I ordered these hoping these were going to fit the same and continue to live up to the legend the brand has been to me for so many years. Once again, not an ounce of disappointment in my purchase. The fit it is true, they are very lightweight and only time will tell how well they hold up. But I have to be honest, these bad boys are getting worn a LOT so if they don't hold up I'll know in short order! I absolutely love how great they feel on my feet!",
