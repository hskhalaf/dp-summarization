The tongs came with a gouge in the metal and the handle of the brush was missing a large piece of the wood (which they just ignored and stained over). Check the pictures to see what I mean. Other than those quality control issues, the tools are good. The metal is higher quality than expected, after a half a dozen or so uses there is no rust and only minimal wear visible.",

The metal parts are heavy duty; they are advertised as stainless, which they may well be, but they are magnetic, so not the highest quality stainless. All-in-all, these feel solid when I use them and they look nice. I expect to get several years good use out of these and recommend them to others.",

The grill cleaner is completely wrecked after one use, nearly every wire is completely bent over, no stiffness to them whatsoever.

But if you have to flip or move anything larger, the metal bends easily and grips poorly. I rarely use them. The brush - the bristled of the brush are made out of cheap, light material that quickly bends and loses it\u2019s brushing capabilities. Imagine using an animal hairbrush on your grill. The fork and spatula are just fine, but I was really hoping for a better complete set.",
