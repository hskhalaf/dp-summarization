I was a little concerned because from the measurements, it showed that this tire would fit our needs, but from the picture, the shape at the edges of the tire look squared as opposed to a much more rounded fit on our old tire. Not a big deal for most bikes, but we were replacing a tire on a beach cruiser bike that had a fender. Our worries were unfounded however. The tire fit perfectly and doesn't rub against the fender. The tire is thick, high quality, and should last us a very long time and help prevent punctures from thorns etc. Highly recommended.",

Two observations to note after about 60 miles of street riding,,,, reduced rolling resistance compared to the original's and they are very quiet. The rolling resistance has been reduced to the point I have kicked my 'general' riding gear selection up one step. Hopefully their wear rate is commensurate with my other impressions. One thing to keep in mind is that they are not easy to mount. There is a youtube video on \"Mount A Kevlar Bead Folding Tyre\". Would recommend watching it if you purchase these.",

      "text": "Tires seem to be decent quality. I was replacing 20\" x 1.95\" tires on a child's bike. I am an avid cyclist and have gone through countless tires through the years. No initial negative warning signs with these. They came packaged well and had no issues mounting on rim. Have been on my daughter's bike for approx. a month an holding air just fine. Only thing to note is that the tires although advertised as Schwinn have Innova branding on both the box and sidewall. Not a big deal for me because it was going on a child's bike but would normally be a little irritated that it wasn't the brand that I ordered.",

I had no such problem, and find the handling intuitive on my big and heavy cruiser. The tread is a deep, aggressive design that collects pebbles and debris like you wouldn't believe. They ride very quiet. I've had little road noise while riding on them.",

The ones I bought were admittedly much more expensive.",
