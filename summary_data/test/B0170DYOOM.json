      "text": "Love it . Knurling is passive I have to chalk up, but my hands sweat easily. It's good for all the 3 main lifts. For deadlifts it has some flex/whip to it but nothing too crazy like the Texas deadlift bar. If you like using a stiff bar I think they're coming out with a 29mm stiff power bar. Still good to deadlift with pulled 410 with it like I mentioned flex is very little . If you want to do olympic lifts the recommend light weight with this due to the center knurl. They do offer a black oxide bar with no center knurl for I think 10 or 20 dollars more .",

I don't have 1000 lbs. so I can't test its rated limit, and I bought this for my wife who probably won't exceed 185 lbs. (weight on bar, not wife's weight). But its construction is similar to other bars I use, and those get abused with 300+ lb. power lifting/olympic movements.",

Olympic size ends that are a just a little shorter. I can now change weight without putting holes in the wall or smashing my knuckles. FYI~ It does have a noticeable thinner diameter. I wasn't sure I would notice the thinner diameter but, yes it is noticeable. The thinner diameter is not to god or bad in my opinion, just noticeable. That was my trade-off for a much needed shorter bar.",
