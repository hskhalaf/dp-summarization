The only way to obtain a replacement is to mail back the entire lamp system at my cost. Not worth it for a cheap timer. Buyer beware. UPDATE - I contacted the seller directly and they mailed me a replacement timer at no cost. Let's hope the replacement timer lasts longer than the original. I've bumped my review rating from 1 to 4 stars given the prompt customer service.",
