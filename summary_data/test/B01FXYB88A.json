      "text": "I purchased this, needing an end table to go with an accent chair in my office. I also wanted one with rustic hardwood. This turned out to be an excellent choice, since it matches the Acacia wood in my Erina desk and bookshelf, both also provided through SimpliHome. Again, this item arrived in excellent condition, due to the thorough packing, was easy to assemble, and looks great. Based on three different items, I would definitely recommend and purchase again from SimpliHome. It is a plus that they sell through Amazon, since that alleviates any concerns about returns, should that ever be necessary.",

They should have screws that actually recessed in the slide. The screws sat too high and would catch and keep the drawer from opening. Such a simple fix that I shouldn't have to be doing right put of the box. Good price tho",
