I had to return the first pair due to poor quality, and I've now used the replacement pair several times while sitting in my tree stand. They are very sloppy fitting (ordered my size correctly) and the pocket for the warmer is only stitched on the sides and not towards the toe end. As a result the holder is very loose when you put your boot or shoe on the warmer packet is pushed, often balled up and forced back of the foot away from the toes. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money on these.",

If this is something you care about you should be aware that this may be out of date. The pair I received is clearly marked Made in China. As this was to be a gift for someone who prefers not to buy things made in China I was pretty disappointed. I can't speak to the quality of the product itself since they weren't for me and I haven't worn them.",

You can get them with stickies that adhere to your socks, which works just fine.",

They did NOTHING. I am not saying they were inadequately warm, I'm saying they produced no heat at all! I just got back from four hours of freezing my feet off at the stadium watching my team lose, and as soon as my feet flaw out, I'd like to put one of them right up this company's...! You want nice, thick socks? Fine, buy them. Just don't think the stupid chemical packets will help. If you want extra heat on a cold day, set fire to the socks.",

The percentage of wool in the pair was lower than I wanted. I don't yet know how they worked, as they were a gift for an oil worker & he's out of town. The heat feature also was important, and these socks do have that. Be sure to select what you really want, as the order may go through!",
