PROBLEM is- after 2 days, the tea pot is leaking where the spout comes together with the pot. Completely unacceptable and very disappointing to see my grand-daughter upset because she can't use it anymore.Of course all packaging etc. has been thrown away, so I feel returning is not an option. I guess she can still play with the other items, but I would recommend, if your child actually wants to use the tea pot with liquid, DON'T BUY THIS SET! :(",

I washed it before she 1st used it and so far no rusting so I hope that stays true. The set is a little smaller than I expected but still great for my 4 yr old. Definitely recommend this and cheers to many fun tea parties ahead.",

The reason for only 4 stars is that the box has a flimsy piece of cardboard that holds the plates, cups, and teapot in place inside the suitcase. You could take it out, but everything will just clang around inside. We left it in, but from very little use, the slots for the plates are already torn. An insert of the quality of the outside of the suitcase would make this a solid 5 stars.",

We got it when she was 2, now at 3 she is much more dexterous with it and makes less of a mess. But all the parts being made from metal really helps contain messes, and keep them from being smashed when stepped on, and even nice for use in the tub. The box or \"picnic basket\" is made of carboard though, and definitely does not hold up as well.",

She loves it, she calls it her picnic basket and it is large enough for her to fit some pretend food into along with the tea set. So far has been very durable, we have only had it a couple months, but it is played with often and they can be pretty rough with it at times. I am going to be getting one for my niece, who is 4, for her birthday because she loved it so much too!",

The only downside is that the little cups leak when you put liquid in them. I know it's a pretend tea set but she really loves to play tea party with water and snacks.",
