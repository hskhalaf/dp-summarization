      "text": "I wanted the slip on fabric type shoe for casual walking, option to go sockless freedom. These fit the bill. Most brands I'm an 8.5 but for Reebok and Nike I had to go 9 because they usually run narrow. I've never tried on UA before so no idea how their sizing skewed. Luckily, 8.5 is fine. This kind of shoe, wanted a snug fit, wearing a sock feeling. I would not run in there or play sports. I don't think it gives you the confidence you need for quick lateral movements or heavy pounding on pavement. Strictly relaxing shoes.",

If I do the same workout with other shoes like Nike, my feet doesn\u2019t hurt. I totally am disappointed with the performance of these shoes.",
