The keyboard is not expensive. The Bad: The keys were an odd size and I found it hard to get comfortable typing. It was also very loud. The key layout is not particularly ergonomic. Its like a straight keyboard was split in half and the two halves rotated a few degrees. The Ugly: The left shift key failed within a day and I had to return it. On this alone, I might have re-ordered but I didn't like the keyboard itself.",
