Just call from your old device that your sim card is in and you're good to go. Thank me later.",

      "text": "The first one I received had an artifact in the camera lens and I wasn't able to remove it. I was not happy. The customer service was very helpful and I received a replacement within 48 hours, so I was very happy about that. The replacement is what I expected and the camera is great. This phone was an upgrade from a Galaxy S4. Needless to say, it is much faster and the battery life is much longer neither of which really surprised me. The technology is, after all, quite a bit more advanced than the S4. Getting it setup for my account was a breeze.",

      "text": "The phone has great features and wonderful to behold. However, I noticed that when I make calls, the receiver on the other end of the communication line cannot hear me speak. We later learnt that it was the phone's mouthpiece that had a problem. The unfortunate thing though was that, this phone was bought a a gift for my wife in Sierra Leone and there was nothing we could have done to return it. She is left with no choice but to use the phone with an earpiece. I really hope that next time these devices are properly checked before they are sold out as not everyone will have the opportunity of returning it afterwards. Joegay.",

I understand that it is a re-newed phone so there would be some possible scratches, but I received a phone that has the very bottom left corner of the screen is cracked, this is not real noticeable when the screen is on, but you can see it when off and feel it when you finger runs over it. For the price, I expected no cracks but some wear would have been okay.",

My unit had no scratches, blemishes, or marks on it and comparing it to a brand new one that I had (since returned new one since this was 200 cheaper and virtually identical) I could find no differences. I have been using it without issue on Tmobile for a few months now and would highly reccomend it to save money over a new one.",

T-Mobile's customer service handled everything over the phone (another phone) with us. So, yes, it was unlocked. Sadly, cell phones are expensive. This Seller had the best price and information available online for what we were looking for. Now we just need to get the phone physically protected from scratches and wear & tear.
