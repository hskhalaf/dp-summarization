I did file the edges as suggested by another reviewer before using them to prevent the casings from tearing, which works fine, but I just don't feel that I can get plastic as clean as stainless steel. LEM should provide stainless steel tubes instead. Other than that, it really is a fabulous piece of equipment.",

The entire column will lean forward as you are pressing the sausage causing the plunger and cylinder to be come misaligned. When they are misaligned, your chances of a blowout dramatically increase. The misalignment also causes more wastage at the bottom of the cylinder. If the cylinder leans far enough forward, the feet on the cylinder will slip out of their stays on the vertical column. For the same price, you can get a much higher quality 7lb 2speed stuffer from Watson's Inc.",
