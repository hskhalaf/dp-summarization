      "text": "Love the design, but the 18\" pink butterfly hopper size is a bit too small already for my just turned 6 y.o. 45\" (3\" 9\") niece. Would buy a size larger if purchasing again. Has stood up well with daily (often multiple times a day) use since receiving it for Christmas two months ago. Update: She began asking for a larger hopper at around 6 1/2 yrs old and this one was passed down to her brother (average height) on his 4th birthday. It's slightly too large for him but he prefers this one over his smaller hopper. The hopper has held up well despite daily use for 11 months and is only used inside the house.",

The ball comes deflated with air pump adapter and sealing plug with an instruction leaflet included. Inflating is straight forward. Use the pump adapter if using car pump and inflate. I used air compressor and was done in 20 seconds. Once filled, you can seal it with the provided plug and press it till flush with surface. The inflated ball is sturdy and has been working well for the kids. Would recommend !",

Was perfect for my average height 4 yr old, and worked fine with a little extra air for the bigger 5 yr old. These were a HUGE hit at Christmas. The girls bounced around for hours everyday. Exercise when it's too cold to be outside. Other than needing a little air on occasion, we have had no issues. We've not used one outside yet, so I can't speak to the durability for that.",

It is high quality though, holds air and is brightly colored with rich looking monster graphics. He loves it but it disappoints him that he can't do anything with it yet. We bought a little horse hopper for him for now to play with. I'm sure eventually we'll get a lot of use out of our Hedstrom ball.",

Our daughter is above average height and will be six soon. Her feet are on their tippy toes when she first sits on it (we have it at the recommended circumference) so it will still fit her for quite a while yet.",
