A lot of runners and athletes praised its design, its cushioning and its grip on multiple types of topography. A polarizing user review criticized the outsole\u2019s performance on wet surfaces but didn\u2019t seem to be the case for a great majority of those who tried this neutral trail shoe.",

        "The general feedback for the Adidas Kanadia 7 was positive and many said that it was very comfortable and agreeable to their performance on the trails",
        "An athlete wrote that they had no issue with this model when they used it for off-road racing competitions",
        "The trail-ready outsole was lauded by testers because it was able to hold onto the trail surfaces with ease",
        "Rocks, grass, dirt and mud weren\u2019t much of a problem for this model, as observed by a majority of users",
        "A purchaser stated that they would recommend the Adidas Kanadia 7 to a friend because it was long-lasting, and that it had perfect quality",
        "The upper unit felt snug but not too tight, noted some runners",
        "A lot of testers wrote that they had a good price for such a quality trail running shoe"

        "One tester noted that the outsole grip wasn\u2019t as strong on wet surfaces because they slipped and fell under such conditions"

      "text": "This is my 5th pair of kanadias and I love them. I've tried other more expensive shoes but keep coming back to them. I mainly run in slippery muddy conditions and so the grippy sole is a great feature. In the dry of summer they also provide sufficient cushioning on dry paths. It is a fortunate coincidence that they are also very reasonably priced. Sizing seems to have changed a bit recently - I ordered size 8.5 last time and they were too small so I upsized to 9. This time around size 9 seems a bit too large but not enough to be a problem. Adidas also seem to suit those with a narrower foot.",

      "text": "I bought these shoes as a trail equivalent of the Supernova road shoe. They are an excellent match in size, feel, comfort. But I have one word of caution. I am training for a trail run in the summer but have been doing a lot of my winter training on the road. Whilst the grip on these shoes is excellent on the trails (as you would hope), on smooth, damp tarmac they are actually quite slippy, and on occasion I have almost ended up on the floor.",

Also a bit too over-formed in the heel cup so that the rear lip digs into the achilles. Got blisters until they'd been broken in. Never had a single blister with Brooks.",

Ready to take on any trail with a TRAXIONTM outsole, waterproofing implements strategically located help keep rain at bay. Constructed with an air mesh upper for maximum ventilation, this is achieved through the process of allowing air to permeate the exterior, incurring airflow within the interior. A waterproof mudguard situated at the bottom of the shoes helps to keep water and mud from seeping through. A textile lining enhances comfort from the inside, whilst an engineered 3-stripe panel provides optimum linear and lateral support. Finished with a TRAXIONTM outsole, maximum grip in a multitude of directions is granted to the wearer.",
