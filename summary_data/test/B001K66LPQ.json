In comes this coffee maker to completely resurrect us from the dulldrums left by our former, caffeine-wielding friend. The setup was super quick and easy and off we were. The lack of coffee urn is a HUGE plus and the fact that water reservoir is removable makes the clean freak in me jump for joy. How was the first pot of coffee, you ask? Fan-freaking-tastic!!

I usually empty the tank within 2 hours and then rinse the tank and wipe the inside of the lid - no problems with liquid pooling on counter.

You certainly get HOT coffee though, which is necessary for a good cup. I keep purchasing these because I don't like the glass carafe, and the coffee doesn't get that burned, overcooked taste.

Two design challenges: 1. you serve the coffee by pressing the rim of your cup against a bar that requires a medium amount of pressure and sometimes the whole machine slides or tips backwards from the pressure. 2. The bar is up under the holding tank enough that the lighting angle in our kitchen does not get light into the serving area, so you can't really see how full the cup is while you are serving. A small light source up under the tank would be a great improvement.",

There's a small filter at the bottom of the coffee maker that can't be removed or replaced & that causes the coffee to dispense very slowly.

      "text": "We purchased this because we liked the idea of not having a traditional coffee pot. We really did like it at first until we noticed that it continually drips causing coffee to leak all over our counters. The customer support is a joke. I have tried several times to get a hold of them being on for 45 minutes or longer each time. I also left messages for as prompted for a return call to no avail. We would not mind a replacement for our current one because as I stated we did really like it before it started continuously dripping. We have done the proper maintenance as suggested in the book.",

We get this type without a carafe because of my hands I always drop and break even when not glass I do something to them. The last Hamilton Brewer I bought at Frye's lasted us years Maybe this route was not the right one. To last only 90 days!",

Contrary to some reviews this device is not \"easy to clean\"; you can't put the reservoir in the dishwasher and after making a \"pot\" of coffee there is condensation everywhere with water dripping down to the heating element area when you lift up the coffee reservoir. The biggest issue is the low yield of coffee relative to the amount of water in the water reservoir. Six cups in yields five cups out, the difference amounting to a combination of condensation, wet grounds and inaccessible coffee.",

I am not sure how long this will last, but for now I love how I can dispense as much coffee as I like and it has no carafe to break. I programmed it to stay hot 3 hours in case I forget to turn it off. Also later in the day if there is still coffee left, I can use the dispenser button and fill an iced filled cup with the leftover coffee for iced coffee. I never waste coffee now. So easy to use and it looks nice as well. Also BPA free.",

One of the little pins that keeps the lid on the reservoir also popped off with no fix for that - so another reason not to like it.",

    "description": "Color:BlackNo matter how much you try, it\u2019s impossible to get freshly brewed flavor from coffee that\u2019s been sitting on a hot plate too long. That\u2019s why we created the Hamilton Beach BrewStation, the only coffeemaker that keeps coffee tasting fresh for up to four hours. This best-selling coffee maker works just like a traditional, automatic drip brewer, but with a notable difference: it brews into an internal tank instead of a carafe. This innovation in brewing technology is what will make your last cup taste just as fresh as the first. An internal heater keeps coffee at the perfect temperature for up to four hours, so you can refuel with a fresh, hot cup throughout your morning. And with no glass carafe, you have nothing fragile to break and replace. Instead, you can easily pour a cup with the one-handed simplicity of a dispensing bar. The BrewStation lets you customize your cup with brewing options like bold, regular, small batches and even iced coffee. The internal tank and brew basket both remove for easy fill-up and cleaning.",
