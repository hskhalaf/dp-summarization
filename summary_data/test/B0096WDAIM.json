What an eye opener! Near dsl IQ, fast focus, touch screen magic, lightweight but jewel-like quality, innovative options...can you tell I'm having fun? Only drawback is seeing screen in bright sun. But then I literally \"point n shoot\"; and usually come up with decent results. So, I have found a new avenue to pursue my hobby.",

The control is also fast, with touch screen to select focus area or point, and super-manual to quickly adjust some parameters and user customed function button, the speed is comparable to professional DSLR. The body is light but well-made. With a pancake lens (like Pannasonic 20mm 1.7) you can easily take it with you all day. When travelling, weight really matters so much. With this light but powerful m43 camera, you will both enjoy the trip with taking amazing photos!!",

With our limited experience, it takes fantastic pictures and we are extremely pleased.

It was too heavy to hang on the neck. Enter the M43 solution. I am very impressed with the auto focus performance, drive speed, and image quality from this little gem. My only knock against the camera is it's a little too menu-driven for my tastes. I can still exert full control over the exposure if I want to, but it's nice to have physical controls to do so. For the price point however, I'll deal. It's wonderful.",

Other than that, it has a good zoom, excellent focusing, and is relatively light to carry considering its lens, and makes every photo look far more professional than my own skill deserves.",
