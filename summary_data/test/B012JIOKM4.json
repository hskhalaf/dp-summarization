The nice thing is that when the time expires it doesn't keep billing you so if you put the game down for a few weeks/months (as I often do) then you don't pay for a ton of time you never use. It has been a while since I had a subscription but if I recall correctly these are cheaper because you don't pay tax on them but you do have to pay tax if you do the subscription where they bill you monthly. I could be wrong though....",
