I\u2019m back here looking for another no-name cheapo knock-off. They\u2019re not as pretty, not as well put together but they are way more useful. Better tool selection, softer steel means sharper and needle nose pliers can actually grip something harder than a wad of gum. There make nice gifts. They stick as a tool.",

      "text": "This multi-tool is a nice combination of size, function and quality for this price point. The pliers are quite good, knife blades are very sharp right out of the box, and I even like the saw blade,which cuts on the pull stroke. No scissors included, but I have never found tiny scissors in a multi-tool to be very useful. There aren't so many tools built in that this becomes unwieldy, but it does have some heft. Only one minor complaint-- unless you have narrow fingers, accessing the file, wire-stripping blade and bottle opener tools is a bit tight. Overall, I am very satisfied.",

I've had this for over a year now and the knife is still very sharp, and everything's in good condition. The only downside is just that some of the tools are hard to use because of their positioning in the casing of the multi-tool but this is a very good tool, and has become one of the best-loved and most useful parts of my everyday carry setup.",
