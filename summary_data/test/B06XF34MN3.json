Reasonably warm - thus isn't an Arctic or high Alpine jacket by itself, but it's great at SoCal and NorCal slopes. If you're going somewhere colder, you'll want to layer. Not bulky, I've got good freedom of movement in this thing. But hey, I'm wearing this with a long-sleeved T at Snow Summit, and it's perfect. Plus, it was at a seriously good price.",

It honestly seems like it could tear from a serious fall, or that it wouldn't serve as an impenetrable shield from the deep winter winds on the chairlifts. If you board/ski in milder climates and are not hardcore (willing to take hard crashes), this is for you. If you're in New England or the Rockies, I'd suggest a different purchase.",
