      "text": "Installed these for 2010 Toyota Rav4 and they look incredible! It was like channeling the sun through my headlights at night. I did have to adjust my headlights down to keep from blinding other drivers, but the lights themselves look great. While driving, I can't hear the fans going at all even though they are huge fans. With other LED headlights I've used, the fan housing seemed crap with restrictions in air flow to vent the heat, these had a huge opening in the back for the fan to circulate the air so I'm not worried about these lights at all. Installation took literally 5 minutes, they fit easily and feel snug and tight. Awesome lights and well worth it.",

I read that some people had to do a little trimming for the headlight to fit and that was true for me as well. I used my dremel to cut some plastic away for the headlight to fit properly on the drivers side. It was easy and doesn't effect how anything else fits. The passenger side fit perfectly without having to do any modifications.",

It rivals that of an iPhone packaging. \u2022The construction of the LEDS leaves you feeling very confident. (Cons) \u2022The Amazon website advertised them as a 60Watt LED, where as on the box they are actually a 30Watt LED. \u2022 It has the spot for colored sleeves but they were not in the boxing. It would be nice if they were supplied. Installation/Actual Use (Pros) \u2022The LEDs are a huge improvement over the stock halogen bulbs. (Cons) \u2022The LEDs were a little rough to get them into the assembly but after some persuasion they fit without any mods to the headlamp assembly.",

These may claim to have many more lumens than a halogen lamp but the issue is how many of these lumens get into the beam where it\u2019s needed. The LED unit is very bulky and reflector design is very critical , so a lot of lumens get sprayed everywhere- illuminating trees , night sky etc , instead of being accurately directed onto the road ahead. Also the after market stainless steel clips required to fit the LED unit into the reflector are woefully inadequate and much too flimsy- contributing further to the imprecise position of the LED \u201cfilaments.
