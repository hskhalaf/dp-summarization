I was replacing my former one that my husband broke the little knob off the lid. They changed the design of the set, the bowl no longer has handles, or a spoon. I've collected many of these and I've seen a decline in the way things are being made. I'm really disappointed.",

The lid nicely sits on the sugar dish and there isn't a slot for a spoon, which I like because I wouldn't want ants to be able to get in. LOVE IT.",
