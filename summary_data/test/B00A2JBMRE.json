Luckily, my toddler can't complain but I often turn the baby monitor's sound off when I'm working during naptime and have to keep checking thru the video.

      "text": "My grandson (now 20 months old) received this as a birth gift from my cousin. What a WONDERFUL gift this has been!!! Everything about it is good. Our baby loves to sleep each night with the rain and thunder choice; it soothes him to sleep. The unit is small and light ---- easy to take along when he and family are spending the night away from home. I just bought one for our pastor who is expecting her first child in January. I let her know about all of the great features this product includes and how much our baby loves it. Thank you!!!",

Now, I have to play around with it to get it to work--I turn the knob, push the knob, sometimes turn in off again and back on, etc... It's frustrating that it stopped working properly. I am giving this a 3-star rating. I would like to think for the money, the machine would work longer than it did. I have yet to find a replacement that I like, though.",

I think it is called white noise but they used to call it waterfall a few years ago.",

In addition, the power cord gets very hot sometimes... and now I'm looking to replace this model with something else. This product is OK as a starter noise machine, to see if this type of tool will help you stay sleep better, but it's not a long-term option for something you'll need to play every night.",

I was also happy to know after a bit of research that the maximum volume level of this machine is below that which researchers say would damage baby's ears- but it is still loud enough to do the trick and keep baby from waking from household noise and loud city noise outside our windows.",

I actually think this one is better than the dohm! You can modify the volume much more than the dohm and it is more pleasing to look at. I\u2019ll definitely buy this again in the future! Highly recommend!",

I think it is a defect. My daughter prefers the summer cricket noises. I also like the pattern is varied enough that you cannot easily pinpoint the repeat spot. I have a different sound machine that began to keep me awake because I would hear the pattern and begin to predict it.",
