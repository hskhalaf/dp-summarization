I have an Olympus EM5 MK II, Olympus 17mm f1.8, Olympus 45mm f1.8, Olympus 60mm f2.8 macro, a Rode VideoMicro, a hard SD card case, a couple filters, and a Thinktank battery holder (fits 2 batteries), and this bag is a bit too much for me. I returned mine, but I highly recommend it to someone who has a DSLR or larger mirrorless camera. For me, the Retrospective 5 is enough.",

This bag is heavier than the City Walkers and near the same as the Urban Disguise bags but somewhat 'stylish' if you are tired of the same old black colored bags. The straps are about the most robust of Think Tanks line. Yes I am a Think Tank Fanboy. Have had Tamrac, Lowepro and others and tend to stay with what currently works for me and my equipment.",

Packs up great, perfect for around town or a vacation. Handled my D700 with Nikon 28-70mm f. 2.8 (should handle the 24-70 well also). Only real concern: if you pack it up with photo gear, it gets mighty heavy for one shoulder. Best performance for weight bearing was strapping around shoulder/neck, bag on back/rump, which doesn't exactly give the low-profile one would like. Should probably have a backpack style bag for the weight of gear that I carry.",

Tons of pockets and areas for my extra batteries, cardt, etc. I can also fit a portable usb charger on the side pocket that is on the outside. I absolutely love the sound silencer for the velcro if you don't want it to make that sound every time you open it. I did tons of research before buying, as I do with everything. Just get it, you'll love it.",

The exterior design is very simple & has has enough compartments & dividers to separate out the accessories of my DJI Mavic Pro. Highly recommended.",

Easy, comfortable, roomy, durable and protected my gear well. I'd recommend this to anybody. The only \"downside\" was that the outside pocket really are too small for a water bottle and I don't like keeping one inside the bag in case the bottle leaks (but it would fit).

Plenty of pocket space for miscellaneous stuff. Bag offers a fair amount of padding, but not a lot. I doubled up some of the padding and used it on the bottom of the case. Always carry this bag across my chest to distribute weight. I'm a pretty small person, so this bag works well for me. It's a good looking, sturdy shoulder bag that doesn't scream camera bag.",

It also doesn't really fit a 13\" macbook air. You can get it into the laptop pocket but its too long and you cannot zip the pocket closed.",
