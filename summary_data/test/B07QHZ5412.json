Getting the 4 uprights perfectly level and all the same height is critical. this requires digging! and more digging. 3 people is best for this whole job. the wall is heavy as crap and can be a pain to unroll. also, have fun with the liner! did it twice before it was correct. Overall quality product. the liner could have been a little bit bigger though. Im a contractor and it took myself and 2 others around 8 hrs to install. granted, ive never installed a pool before.",

Great value and the ability to walk out on our deck and have this sparkling blue water to cool off in is amazing. The company was great to deal with and quick to respond. Shipping was fast and very responsive. Thank you and will recommend to everyone I know!!",

My husband owns transit, backhoes etc Horrible design whomever designed this product . Plastic is extremely cheap made. Wall aluminum cheap made. Tin we feel more then metal but whatever. Expect to have more then 10.people help with the wall. Video sent \ud83d\ude44 absolutely worthless, no way to maximize this small video, I did print instructions of similar pool 40+ pages. Hopefully it lasts a couple yrs for our grandchildren, but I highly doubt it. I highly recommend bot to purchase this product.",

The bad....this thing is horrible to install and most of this is because of the horrible instructions. They are basically useless. Many times while installing my wife would ask me what the directions said and I would just get angry. I really don\u2019t understand why these have not been improved. I would consider myself fairly handy and read the reviews before buying and thought how hard can it be. Fairly difficult! But pool and deck are now finished and we\u2019re enjoying it!",

Liner and skimmer come separate and pool comes on small pallet. I was sceptical if everything was actually in there but it was. Pool comes with a CD that has instructions and a video on how to install. However the pool guy I used installed differently that made more sense. I am certain if I followed the video as I planned I would have messed up the liner. All in all good product. Pools for less is great to work with. Suggest googling them to find number.
