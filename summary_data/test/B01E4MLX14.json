Slides into and out of window easy. Nice design. Nothing to complain about if you pick the right one for your car. Now about the size- this is the MEDIUM. Some people with full size trucks are ticked off and putting low reviews because \"this isn't quite big enough\". No. Don't blame the product and leave a bad review.
