Checking frequently avoids 'browning' carefully chosen flowers etc. This thing works exactly as advertised and I'm glad I bought it, in fact I'm going to buy two more, so I can do a lot of drying at the same time.",

      "text": "The product was what I was looking for, but is over priced. It is easy to use and leaves the microwaved plants in great shape and color. The only real criticism is on the four side clamps that holds the press together. The material is a little flimsy and the quality is not up to par with the rest of the press. After a few times using the press, the clamps do not hold as tight as I would like and I'm afraid after using it awhile they will become more loose.",

      "title": "works well",
      "text": "This has been used for leaves only so far, and worked well. Do be careful and paitent, as things can \"cook\" if you microwave them for too long. The felt pads benefit from a little airing out between bursts in the microwave so the moisture can evaporate, as they do get a bit damp. Wiping down the plastic press after each use helps, as it too had some beads of moisture. Great product and time saver if you are pressing a lot of material.",
