If you've ever heard your family members or friends say, \"Now which wine glass is mine?\" before, then this gift is a great way to remedy that problem! Would definintely recommend, and may even buy another set for another family member!",

So unless you have a really thin stem i would avoid these particular ones... Awesome gift for my wife! She loves these things. We have cat ones, walrus, now these.
