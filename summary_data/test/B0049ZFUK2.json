Also, it would of been nice if the quick release handles were properly tightened at the factory so that the depth didn't change on me the first time I used it.

I love the soft-start feature and that it seems much more powerful than one would imagine. It's so easy to handle that it improves accuracy in many situations. Changing to the plunge base takes seconds and is as sturdy and accurate as Dewalt's bigger plunge bases. It also takes standard router bushings. What's not to love!",

All the controls and adjustments are easy to use and feel very precise and secure. Swapping between fixed and plunge bases is super easy. Overall, the tool feels very solidly built. Soft start motor is very nice touch, plus its variable speed. I've been very impressed with the performance of the tool on a number tasks including: routing inlay, hinge mortises, profiling with a small round-over bit and cutting mortises. Great tool. If your on the fence about it, get it, its a totally worthwhile purchase.",

Got it with the Plunge base and edge guide. Doesn't like my 3/4 rabbit bit (too much bite, material removal for one deep pass - maybe that's too much for any but this has the most hp in its class) does edges Very nicely. Smooth operation. I built it into a table for bits without bearings. Not recommended for large material takeout.",

I just wanted everyone to know that this is very easy on the hands and not tiring to use like some of the others. I have some bigger ones, but this does what it is intended to do. So, if you need a smaller router, don't hesitate to get this one.",

Visibility of the bit is good and the bright LED allows a pattern line to be clearly seen while routing. Bit changes are done with a collet lock and one wrench. And the depth of cut can be finely controlled by rotating a collar. The soft start is also a nice feature. Overall this router has a nice feel in use and I would buy it again. I have not used the plunge base yet.",

An excellent palm router combination. Get one, and you will not be disappointed.",
