      "text": "My review is mostly for the quality construction of the harness. However I did not purchase it for climbing or zipline use. I wanted a belt with durable loops for a disabled patient. The patient goes into a rage and needs temporary restraints that would be quick to engage. Using wrist bracelets with carabiners it works fast with the harness keeping the patient from injuries. There are some medical product available but cost 10 to 12 times more than this harness. It easily supports the patients weight of 140 lbs and I'm no worries about the loops breaking. Then leg straps keep the belt from slipping up the waist so the harness fits this application better that other medical restraints.",

My climbing partner can adjust them.with minimal effort, I just can't do it myself. It is also great because it can be tightened on both sides so that it can be center comfortably on my hips.",
