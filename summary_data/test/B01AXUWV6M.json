I do wish the side pockets had 2 adjoining zippers (so I could put my curling iron that is too long) and secure it from falling out but otherwise it serves its purpose for my large perfume. The color is vibrant and it folds up nicely. Also doesnt weigh as much as other ones Ive had.",

Held makeup brushes, travel hair dryer, travel straightener, travel-sized toiletries & all other basics. I have been traveling with 3 large pouches for toiletries&makeup stuff and this helped me consolidate it all. The color is more of a denim-ish look than the \u201cmetallic\u201d description but other than that, great buy and will purchase again if needed. Zippers are good quality. Many smaller netting slots inside to hold various sized items. Thanks for helping me stay organized and streamline all my travel stuff!",
