      "text": "I have used Thymes for years (emphasis!), specifically the Eucalyptus line, and even more specifically, the Eucalyptus body lotion. This latest bottle I bought smells different than all the other bottles I have used. There's not much of the Eucalyptus fragrance and the lingering smell is not that pleasant, super musky. I am thinking that this may be a fake bottle. The only difference I can see from my previous bottle (I still have the bottle) and the new one is that the leaves print on the new bottle is darker in color. I hope someone can get back to me about this. I may have to start shopping at Thymes website directly, rather than buying it here. Really upsetting.",

I'd guess nobody could distinguish between the smells. So while the packaging is very nice and the moisturization seems fine, the scent will make you smell like a clean bathroom. I originally gave this 3 stars, but later changed to 1 star because the smell won't go away, hours after applying it and trying to wash it off.",
