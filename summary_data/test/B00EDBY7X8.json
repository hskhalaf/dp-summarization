Not sure how this could happen since the game had obviously not been opened previously and was completely wrapped in plastic. Considering it has all been opened before realizing this, I'm unable to return it.",

Instructions are easy to understand even for my six and three year old. The four characters are cute and perfect for kids. I do think the dice should be a littler bigger. They can be a choking hazard being smaller then standard dice. I also wish they had one other type of money then just one dollar bills. Like a five or ten would be nice. Overall my kids love this game and have blast playing it. Read the rules because it's different then regular Monopoly.",

We have spent many hours on that game. Worth a little more in my opinion :)",

I guess that means monopoly dollars--but for fun we have been calling them $1million dollar bills. Makes the math easier so the kids can focus on the fun.",
