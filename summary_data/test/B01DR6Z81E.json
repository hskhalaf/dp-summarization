I used my own cookie recipe instead of the one in the box. My only complain is the six slots. It's very time consuming making six cookie shots at a time. A 12 or 18 slot pan would be great. There's a lot of delicious possibilities with this pan. I coated the inside with chocolate & filled them with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, ice cream, & milk. Each one was heavenly.",

To bake, I followed the cookie shot instructions to put 2 heaping tablespoons of cookie dough into each cavity. Guess what happened? I got chocolate chip muffins as the dough violently expanded from the cavities. There was essentially not enough space to hold milk after removing my beautiful monstrosities from the mold. I\u2019ll try again with the official cookie recipe later and will update my review.",

I made the recipe specified in the directions, the consistency was a little different than cookies I would normally make (plus it was pretty sticky so I added a handful of flour at the end). It made 3 batches. I sprayed the pan and inserts very thoroughly each batch and pushed the insert back down a little after 8 min (cooked for another 8 after) Out of the 18 shots only one did not work becuase it was just too thin on one part. Good product, does exactly what I hoped",

I assume that's in effort to make sure the cookie cups hold their shape. They were still tasty, but I want to try it with a standard dough recipe and see how it works\u2014it might be enough just to bake them a little longer so they're stiffer.",

      "text": "This Sweet Shooters Cookie Shot Glass Pan Set was a creative idea. The pans work well, they are nonstick and easy to use. The only drawbacks are, the recipe that comes with the set results in somewhat cardboard-y, tasteless shot glasses. No alternate recipes are given, and no filling recipes are given. I realize that one can be creative, and ideas for fillings are given-- ice cream, milk, mousse-- but still, I always appreciate recipes that are specifically designed for the cookware, especially something as unusual as this. And alternate recipes for the cups themselves was really a must. So, 5 stars for the functionality of the set, 3 stars for the recipe, 4 stars all told.",

Other recipes have not worked as well yet, but I believe recipes with more butter will work better. We fill these with fruit, whip cream. To keep liquids inside, you have to coat the inside with a candy coating, otherwise expect leaks. We have found that whip cream and fruit are fine without the coating. An excellent product that has lots of possibilities.",

But you do have to work with the dough to get it centered and it does take some elbow grease. After I put them in the oven I pushed the inserts back down after 8 minutes. Once they were finished baking I removed the inserts, let the cookies cool and they came out easily. Pic of the finished product added.",

Use the included recipe as it's drier than regular chocolate chip cookies - and use mini chips! My first batch was about half usable. The inserts have to be centered and not pushed down too far/hard, then weighted in the oven with a heavier cookie sheet to keep them from rising out. I did better with the second batch and can't wait to try them again. They were the first dessert to disappear at an event I took them to. Some even disappeared before dinner!",
