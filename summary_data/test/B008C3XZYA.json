Though they arrived on time and as long as they full they look and feel nice.",

Even after refilling, it 'deflates' again rather quickly. The fabric used to make it is pretty durable and is water resistant, but there are two panels on the bottom that are of softer, flimsier fabric that picks up a lot of dirt. All in all not a bad chair as long as there are extra beans on hand",

I was hoping these Big Joes could survive, be cleanable, and look a little neater than bean bags. They are everything I hoped for! The guys have been using them for 4 months, and they look like new, and love them. Mom & Dad got the living room back. It's a good thing.",
