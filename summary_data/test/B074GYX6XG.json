First, the torque is lower than I expected considering the wondrous reviews others have given Bosch's 12V power tools. Second, the 90\u00b0 adapter seems only to be able to click in at three angles, e.g., 120\u00b0, 240\u00b0 and 0\u00b0/360\u00b0, but offset such that you'll never be able to hold the handle of the drill perpendicular to your work.",

Anyway, there are so many great reviews, so no need to belabor. Power is appropriate to 12v tool class. However, just figured something out by accident (read a manual?). The right angle head seemed to go in only at odd angels, which was really annoying (and major flaw), until I realized that the head can turn freely, until you pull the locking collar into the body. Take a look at photos. It's why I wrote this review. Overall, very useful for those tight corners. Also, as an added bonus, it holds Festool centrotec bits.",

The head changes are super easy and the unit is small, but solid. I bought this over any other unit for two reasons: 1) the removable heads, which allow you to leave your drill chucked and your driver chucked and just change heads. It also is easier to store. 2) I ESPECIALLY liked the offset drive, which allows much better access to screws crowded next to something. Mine came with two batteries, which is great for pretty lengthy use. Lastly, the size and weight mean my wife can use comfortably, which\u2019s means less work for me! ;)",
