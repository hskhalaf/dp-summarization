I can say with certainty that this is the BEST flashlight I\u2019ve ever had. I love the strobe effect (its just me and my 80 yr. old mother in the house, so anything with a safety feature is appreciated), and the option to choose high, low or medium illumination. It looks and feels like a high-quality product and I feel sure it will last a long time. I\u2019m plan buy a few more so I can give them to family members. I highly recommend this product.",
