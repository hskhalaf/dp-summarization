I figured that out pretty quick and called in some professionals. Smart move. These doors must weigh 150 lbs a each. Installing them requires special equipment and the appropriate skillset. A handy guy with a toolbox is not going to be able to install these doors. Now that they are in I couldn't be happier. Super thick and super smooth. Exactly the right door for my newly-remodeled, custom shower.",

The glass is heavy and if you are a DIY buyer I suggest you either rent some suction cups to hold the glass or have two to three pair of very strong hands. It doesn't take much to break a panel since it is tempered glass. besides that these doors save a customer nearly triple that of having a custom glass door installed by a local company. Also make sure you follow the directions, we have installed many but always check of each step that we've completed.",

My shower walls are very crooked. almost 2\u201d from floor to ceiling. It all went in much more smoothly then I expected. I am a single female and installed in by myself. It took me a full day on my own. It would have been a LOT easer with some help. The panels are VERY heavy and awkward. Heavy duty suction cups as well as using the styrofoam it was shipped in to rest the panels on and slide them around was helpful. I would recommend this to anyone looking. And it saved me over a thousand dollars!!!",
