Each \"reset\", which involves taking the device our of the spa and waiting for it to drain, gives you about 10 seconds of vacuuming. So, cleaning a small 7' spa will therefore take about 10-15 repeats of the above as 10 seconds of vacuuming cleans about 2-3 feet of spa surface. So if the spa is in a dirty area or isn't covered, cleaning could be very tedious and time consuming.",

Without this functioning cap, it sends a good portion of the debris back in the water as you raise up the vacuum. Also, asthetically, the plastic yellows under the Texas sun. It is also a little slower to use than I had hoped. You're allowed about three seconds of suction before you have to lift it up, let it drain and repeat the process.

I've been returning the water to a bucket now with a pantyhose as an extra filter and sure enough, the pantyhose gets full of sand. It might be o.k. for leaves, but does nothing for the fine Arizona desert sand.",

The suction lasts for about 3 seconds and then you have to take out of water and do this again. It is not strong enough to pick up small debris. This is total garbage, have no idea how it has the reviews that it has.",

I have a D-1 Jacuzzi that seats 7 people and needed something that could get the small leaves from the bottom. This works perfectly.
