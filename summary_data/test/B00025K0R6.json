She said she had to double check his age because they are so white and don\u2019t show his age. A few side notes: I brush both of my dogs\u2019 teeth 6 days/week. I give them 1 Greenies dental treat each, every day. I *do* alternate with another brand of paste but they do seem to prefer this one.",

It has partially reversed the problems he had and while not returning him to his youth, it has made a huge difference and completely stopped the progression of the problem. I have not tried brushing alone (no paste) as a comparison. Even if it is just because he likes the flavor and tolerates the brushing, the result is excellent.",

Our dog L O V E S the taste, so much so that I have to really get toothpaste in between the bristles of the toothbrush and not just on the top otherwise he'll just lick it all off before I can brush his teeth at all.",
