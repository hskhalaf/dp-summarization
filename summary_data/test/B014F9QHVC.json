My son plays a lot of fast gaming and it copes very well. I use it with surfing the web and orders etc and it\u2019s perfect for me as I\u2019m sight impaired and the clarity and size is great. Well worth the purchase price..",

Any dark areas will blur when moving your mouse horizontally, also feels like the screen stutters/tears due to the curve. This happens on my Gtx 1070 with i5-4690k. Very expensive and doesn't have the clearest resolution using dp, would expect full hd but films and games are very pixelated and will hurt your eyes/brain in a few weeks of use. Would not recommend this to anyone. X34 or tripple monitor setup",

No noticeable input lag, nice colours especially compared to an old school tn panel. But make sure you have a pc and graphics card which can use this screen to is full potential.",
