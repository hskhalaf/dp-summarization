I followed the instructions included and was extremely disappointed with this product! During the first use, I closed the cover and pressed down gently, as instructed, and the top of the Quesadilla maker collapsed! Shards of broken plastic cut my hand and fell into the machine. The top should not be hollow and so thin, as to break when pressed lightly. I do not recommend this product; especially for kids that want to experiment. Very dangerous!",

This George Foreman brand will take a sprinkle of ingredients and nothing more. Should have called it is quesadilla cracker grill because that is how much filling you can accomplish. Wasted money on ingredients and lost the complete chance at making a meal which is what my family loved. Save your money unless all you want is a cracker quesadilla.

After just a few uses, the latch snapped off completely and I could no longer use the item. Aside from that, the oil from the cheese pools around the edge and isn't the easiest to clean. Other quesadilla makers have a drainage hold that allows grease to pour into a cup. That would have been a much better design. Not satisfied with this product in the slightest. I'll just go back to making quesadillas the old fashioned way.",

There is no \"pad\" on top to push on to close. I think it is dangerous and could be made much safer for such a simple product. I got a new version of my old Santa Fe on Ebay. That's what I would suggest.",

However, unless you're making the thinnest/most boring quesadilla you're going to have to push down on the lid to get it to cook the tortilla all the way.

Overall, I like it. Just be careful when pushing down the lid. I used a roll of paper towels to make sure there's even pressure so the lid doesn't break.",

One recipe is to put a 1/4 inch slice of cream cheese in each pocket area. Thinly slice an apple and distribute over the cream cheese. Sprinkle with cinnamon and cook. I try to eat low sugar, but you might want to sprinkle some brown sugar too. It is way more versatile than just quesadillas.",

Easier to clean than our first one (literally wipes clean with a wet rag) and the heating time is quick so dinner is ready in a snap. Definitely recommend.",

My biggest complaint is this must have the worlds shortest power cord in the word. I am completely limited to where I can use it due to this and it makes me honestly want to return the item.",

The only negative and it's not that bad, is that when adding chicken the tortilla is so thick the lid won't shut. It still cooks but one side is cooked a little more than the other.",

After I used the tortilla maker I used a napkin to clean off the plates. It was very easy to clean. I do not recommend putting any sauce inside the quesadilla has it will become very messy. Hope this helps with your decision.",
