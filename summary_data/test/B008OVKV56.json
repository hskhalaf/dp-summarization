Generally in my experience Vasque's quality has been high but these things are absolutely pathetic. I wouldn't recommend buying these boots. I tried working with Amazon and Vasque on a return/exchange. Vasque/RedWing wants me to mail the boots back to them on my dime, which I feel is unwarranted since this is clearly a defect in their rubber, and Amazon indicates the boots are beyond their return window. Don't waste your money on these.",

After 80 miles on a very rocky part of the AT my feet felt great, the best I've ever experienced! They are very water resistant and light weight too. I love them!",

The previous 4 pairs started to fall apart at about 2 1/2 to 3 years of use (Estimate 800 miles). The sole starts to come apart. We'll see how long this 5th pair last.

Prolonged exposure to water, especially above the toe box will lead to damp feet. They will however keep your feet from becoming drenched. These are best for short stream crossings not walking through a stream. This is mostly a Gore-Tex problem and not a Vasque problem. Secondly, they are SLIPPERY on wet rocks. These boots are just good enough to not warrant the hassle of returning them and trying something else. I will keep them but will look elsewhere for the next pair.",

The gore-tex and lining makes them completely waterproof up to the ankle which is great for walking through all sorts of terrain. The color is great too. I like the black/gray instead of the brown because with jeans it looks more like a shoe and less like a dorky hiking boot. It makes this hiking boot a little more versatile for my outdoor-loving hubby. The price on these was amazing especially compared to other hiking boots and they shipped quickly.

I am starting to hike again after a long hiatus, so I thought that would be ok, but in retrospect my previous hiking experience and weight (220 lb, 5'10\" male) was enough that I should have looked more seriously at heavier weight boots.

We just completed an 18 mile trek through Dolly Sods in West Virginia; every trail looked more like a stream bed. My feet never got wet.",
