It\u2019s very fast, has a nice suite of features and is perfect for everyday use. Lightweight, decent battery, good audio video quality etc. My only complaint is that the screen has some bleeding of backlight around the edges but this is minor and only visible when the background is very dark/Black... it\u2019d drive me insane but the missus doesn\u2019t mind it. I recommend this laptop as a solid choice you\u2019ll struggle to go wrong with.",

I was most impressed by the battery life, the battery gets me through a full day of work without any need to charge. It does go down faster when you're running more demanding programs but still not bad at all. It looks nice and sleek, it's pretty thin too but also a good screen size.",
