PS: It took me like 30 minutes just to find how to redeem the purchase code. Amazon's instructions are terrible. It would be fine for current gamers, but for someone who thought this game would be cool and bought it to check it out, it was a nightmare.",

If not for my good search skills I would not have found the path through download (this is absurd and abusive, Amazon should offer direct download to their Customers as the Electronic Arts website is utter garbage).",
