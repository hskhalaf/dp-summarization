      "text": "My floor guy spent the entire day professionally cleaning my kitchen tile floor. After, he recommended I maintain it by using this Rubbermaid Commercial Hygen along with boiling hot water (with or without a tablespoon of white vinegar), poured carefully onto the tile. I mop the tile with this every two weeks and so far it works. Afterwards, I easily remove the cover from the mop and throw it in the wash machine and let it air dry. I'm very satisfied with the product. It's easy to use and does the job perfectly!",

It goes behind and around the toilet great. It goes under furniture because it lays flat and gets right up to the corners. I'm very pleased with this mop purchase. I got the Rubbermaid Commercial Quick-Connect Straight Extension Handle, Yellow (FGQ75500YL00) to go with it and it fits perfect. I'm using these mop pads: 18\" Microfiber Wet and Dry Mop Pads Fit 15 to 18 Inch Bona or Libman Hook Washable Replacement Refills for Floor (6-Pack with 1 Plastic Clean Scraper)",

      "text": "We use these in our cleaning business and have transitioned almost fully to flat mops over the old mop and bucket method. These heads work great with a smooth swivel action and loop and hoop strips are plenty strong enough to hold the mop heads in place. TIPS: Take care when removing the mop head, had one head where the loop and hook strip came off with the mop head making it unusable. That why I only gave 4 stars and not 5. Make sure to use a handle long enough to make it comfortable for the operator. I like the yellow extension handles 48\" - 72\". Make sure the handle has the correct connection for these heads.",

These always break, and the bottle limits mobility. Just take a squirt bottle with you and you are good to go.

      "text": "My dad was in the hospital and the cleaning staff was using these. Got one and some of the Hygen washable pads and this works AMAZING for cleaning up household spills and accidents from my elderly corgi. This handle is industrial, so it is very stout, which is a sharp contrast to the flimsy, crappy Swiffer-type light mops I have used in the past. The head is perfect for getting into tight corners and up against baseboards. Length is adjustable, which is great because I am tall, and at maximum length, it gives you leverage to clean up tough spills on tile, laminate, or wood. Also works great dry to get pet hair cleaned up in a flash.",

I should have done this in the first place since I had two vacuums when I had carpet, and these are much cheaper!",

I use it to clean my hardwood floor, and it works well. I love that the microfiber attachments are so easy to attach - just slap on with velcro. As mentioned in other reviews, this is the head only so be sure to purchase compatible handle and microfiber attachments.",
