Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Bare Minerals primer, but this particular bottle and the bottle of brightener I ordered are, for a lack of better words, old. The product is so thick that it will not pump out of the bottle. I have to open the lid and scrape it out on my palm. I use Bare Minerals primer every morning, but my local shop closed and I was forced to order it from here. Never again!!",

I've used bare minerals mineral foundation for years and one problem I had was that no matter how much moisturizer I applied prior, sometimes I'd get dry spots after application or a few hours later. This helps so much! A little goes a long way. Highly recommend it for use with their other products. Wish you got more for your money, but otherwise it's wonderful.",
