All of the kids (and adults) love it from 5yr - 9yr in our family. Our 9yr +7yr olds work together building and reading the directions and it's wonderful to see them work together. We tried another cheaper (1/3 price) marble set from another company and it's horrible compared to the Hape sets. Also, we purchased a basic wood block set and then we could make even crazier marble runs (see picture).",

For the block parts I use a plastic shoe bin and used a Sterilite Divided Case to organize the smaller parts and that works great!",

Warning, the adults may end up playing after the kids are in bed. :-) Also, you'll probably end up wanting more sets.

The only complaint would be that once you make a set they do get very easily knocked over.
