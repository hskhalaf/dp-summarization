I use 3 scoops instead of the recommended 2 and add a little almond butter and a few fresh berries for flavor. That works out to about $3.50 per serving, so it's economical too relative to most fast meals to go. I really highly recommend this.",

I'm assuming that the extremely high cost is due to the use of Whey Protein Isolate as the main component, something which most other companies don't do, instead opting for less-efficient Whey Protein Concentrate. One slight issue: the product never fully dissolves or mixes well but that doesn't affect the taste negatively.",

In my mind that makes this protein powder seem more like food than other brands. I like that it has probiotics and there is no overwhelming artificial sweetener flavor. I would recommend this product. I add a scoop of cacao for the days i want a more choclately flavor without the guilt.",
