Contacted Hamilton since it was over 30 days, and they will ship us a replacement assembly if we pay another $6 shipping. Was expecting them to just send us a couple c-clips. Going to have to pay the cost (risk of burns if the tray falls apart while using the cooker) but will think twice about purchasing Hamilton Beach products in the future.",

Do not push down the lid or the egg will start to oose out of the side. Just did English muffin ones this morning and tasted like McDonalds.

Everything goes into the \"sandwich Maker\" and out come two wonderful McMuffin's in about 6 minutes (1 minute preheat).

Putting an un-toasted english muffin right on an uncooked egg concerned me, but not anymore. I've used regular English muffins, small bagels, Ezekiel english muffins, regular bacon, Canadian bacon, tomatoes.....you name it...it produces a very crunchy outside, and well cooked inside. Clean up is a breeze. I was hoping my 10 yr. old would make their own, and I still might let her try, but for now it seems like too many hot/moving parts for my comfort. Very well made product, and takes up less space than I expected.",

Possibly too simple. There is no on and off switch. You want to turn it on, plug it in. You want to turn it off, unplug it. In this day and age I consider this a serious omission. Not only should it have a switch, it should shut it self off automatically after a period of time if you forget. In my opinion this device represents a serious safety hazard.",

Use a tooth pick to \"scramble\" the egg right in the egg holder. It doesn't get any easier then this, takes 30 seconds to put everything in, let the timer do its thing, and you can grab and go!

Put a little syrup on the bread while it continues to cook, then I put them altogether and it's better than McD's.

The only problem I can see people having with this product is that the way the machine is designed (small circular inserts) you can only use an English muffin, roll, or small bagel to make sandwiches. Might be able to use bread that is round, I haven\u2019t tried it yet. Otherwise, a great product!!",

      "text": "Works awesome, churns out perfect breakfast sandwiches everytime. Once you get used to it! The first couple times, I didn't consider the muffin thickness or egg size and ended up with some spillover. Just remember the unit doesn't cook meat properly, so you cant put in raw bacon/etc. Any meat you add has to already be cooked to be safe. My go-tos for ingredients (besides the eggs and english muffins) were Trader Joes smoked Gouda slices and the Canadian bacon circles. Both fit perfectly into the unit and make for a tasty breakfast sandwich! I also added a little spice to the eggs to give the sandwich a kick.",

Easy to clean anything that's left on the skillet just comes right off with a quick wipe. My only suggestion is to close it wait a couple minutes for the egg part of the machine to heat back up after using it for your first round of bfast wiches, otherwise the eggs will not cook all the way through the second round. Other than that, an excellent buy and I'm so happy I found this ingenious little machine!",

It was operator error (didn't know how it articulated) when I first opened it, so not a fault of the manufacturer. Once i'm done cooking I just unplug it, wait a couple minutes and wipe it clean gently. Using a small amount of cooking spray seems to help with ease of cleaning. Overall would highly recommend!",

After setting it up by cleaning the plates and wiped down the hot plates with soap and warm water, I was able to wip up two egg cheese turkey and spinach English muffin sandwiches. Yay! Yummy and quick 5 minutes. I used to do this separate and took 15-30 minutes depending on kids and what not. This is great if you eat breakfast sandwiches at mcds etc. Just stop now and invest in this. I love it already. Just hoping it lasts. This item shipped fast with two day shipping.",

If adding any meat in addition to the egg, you will likely need to precook it to make sure it is done. The biggest selling point is that it is an egg mold for the sandwich, but you could probably find a cheaper one of those elsewhere. Overall, it does as advertised but I wish it were more.",
