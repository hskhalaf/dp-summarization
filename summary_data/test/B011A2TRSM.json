      "text": "I purchased this in May 2016. It is now nearly October 2017. The bottom cushions have proven to last just past any 1 year warranty period and now have almost no fluff left to them. They've become uncomfortable. When I bought this in 2016, it was $360. I would argue I got ripped off then and didn't know it. Now showing a price of $512 as of this writing, you'd be a fool to buy this couch. I, now stuck with mine, will be buying a 5\" thick furniture foam sheet and refilling these myself...at a cost of about $130.",

I'm 5'8\", and cannot sit on the chaise comfortably, I'm too tall and my feet dangle off. Also, I've had the couch a month and a half, and it's already wearing and breaking down. The seat cushions have started to lose shape and have become concave where people are sitting. This couch seems meant for very little use. My recommendation is to spend a little more, this couch was a waste.",
