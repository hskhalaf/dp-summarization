With all the money you would spend upgrading these, you might be better off spending a little more money to get a mid pair mid priced skates.",

If you\u2019re looking to use these outside, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting you some softer wheels. Only flaw and complaint I have with mine is the leather in the right boot cans with a 1/2 inch long, deep scuff on the top toe area.
