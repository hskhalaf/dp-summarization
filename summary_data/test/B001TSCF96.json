What we really liked about the tent was that the zippers seemed well made, and the room inside was great. Plenty of room to stand and to put our Queen air mattress and 2 cots. Just very bummed about the lack of ease setting up and the materials breaking or ripping.",

Additionally, angled windows, which you can keep open in the rain, help keep the water out while allowing for extra air circulation. Setup is simple with snag-free, continuous pole sleeves and the patented pin-and-ring system. A hinged door makes for easy comings and goings. Inside, there's enough room to stretch out on three queen-sized airbeds, and storage pockets help to keep small items organized.
