This headset will work wirelessly using the 2.4ghz usb stick on PC and PS4 ONLY.

Mic quality is not the best for its price but adequate for online gaming. Synapse 3 software was great with enough customization. Finally the battery is disappointing and it will need changing almost every day.",

I contacted Razer support, wondering if its possible I have the wrong cushions as they also sell non gel-cushion ones. They said they aren't actually supposed to cool you down and its not real Gel Cuishons (not the type in gel pillows).",

For gaming, the bass is too strong and you can only hear the gun fire, the bomb. Footstep are definite be heard but it doesn't have a strong direction feeling. For gaming and music, it is hard to recommend this headset. But if you are looking for the comfy and the nice rgb lights, go for it and mute all the negative reviews.",

Personally i would not buys these for gamers who are going to use them for long periods of time due them being uncomfortable, something a little less heavy .",

Honestly I don't think I can ever use any other pair of headphones again. Don't buy the essential or the plain nari it's pointless. I understand they are expensive but the feedback is a must have thing. I feel like I'm at a concert or in the game. It's actually crazy. Five stars!",
