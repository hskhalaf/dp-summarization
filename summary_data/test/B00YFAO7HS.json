I like the femininity of the pointy toe. However, the configuration of the cut-outs would make it very uncomfortable for anyone with wide feet or bunion issues because they start right at the junction where the foot bends, so it will dig into those areas. They fit true to size and the top band fits comfortably and is great for keeing the shoe from slipping off the heel.",
