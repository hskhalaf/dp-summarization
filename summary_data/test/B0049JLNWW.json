It\u2019s large enough to fit 3 sets of my Medela freestyle pump parts and a few nipples. I do have to remember to remove everything onto a drying rack though or all of the condensation will remain on the parts/nipples as long as they sit in there. So I do wish there was some sort of drying option for the nights that I have forgotten to remove everything",

It has a large capacity so it can fit many items, from bottles and nipples to pumping parts and pacifiers and small gumming items. The lid doubles as a sterile work surface or \"catch-all\" since it sterilizes with each cycle. The cycle itself runs fairly quickly also so you're not waiting around too long. The only \"minus\" I can see is that it leaves droplets inside the bottles and nipples which do not evaporate easily and you have to dry with a paper towel.",

    "description": "The heat plate can be affected by limescale. We recommend that the steriliser is descaled often, if the unit is not descaled then it can have an effect on the cycle times. To remedy we would recommend the consumer follows the descaling instructions. Note: Descaling steriliser- Always unplug the appliance and wait until it has cooled down completely before descaling. 1. Empty the steriliser and wipe inside with a sponge or damp cloth 2. Pour in 1 cup (250ml) of white vinegar and leave for between 30 mins and 24 hours, depending on the extent of limescale 3. Pour any remaining liquid down the sink and rinse with cool water. Use a sponge or cloth to remove any loose bits of limescale 4. Plug your steriliser back in, adding the regular volume of water for a normal cycle. 5. Turn on and run for 5-minutes then give a final rinse.\n\nMANUFACTURER CONTACT INFORMATION\n1-877-248-6922",
