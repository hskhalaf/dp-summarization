What no one mentions is that the handle is longer, and that's a big deal to me, because I tend to buy these super gigantic grapefruits, so I can really DIG IN and get ALL the fruit in one nice scoop, so I am extra HAPPY!

The serrated edges seem to cut faster with this spoon with others that I have tried, but they are placed in the spoon in a way that doesn't scratch your lip. The feel is solid and does not bend or feel flimsy like other grapefruit spoons. Highly recommended.",
