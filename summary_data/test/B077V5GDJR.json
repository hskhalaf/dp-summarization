      "text": "Super fast shipping and great customer service! Product works great for smaller text found on things like ingredients on packaging, newspapers, etc. However, the viewfinder is fairly small with a min 4x zoom, so if the text is very big to start with you won\u2019t be able to see a lot on the screen at a time. You have to place the product flat on the surface you are trying to enlarge in order for it to work properly. Overall a great product if you need something enlarged as it can lessen eye strain.",
