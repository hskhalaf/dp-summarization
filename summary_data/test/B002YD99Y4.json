Instant read thermometer may not be perfectly accurate, but when pancakes are completely dried on top and won't brown the heat is obviously too low.",

It heats up great, with even browning over the sandwich. There is one other issue. After heating, if you have a thick sandwich, you have to touch the hot lid to release it's hinge so it will lay flat instead of on an angle. This is a little dangerous, you need a pot holder, Look at the product photo and you can see the lid is normally angled but it has a release lever so it can move and float on its axles. But it's stiff, maybe over time, it will loosen.",

Super easy to clean because you just pop the plates off. The handle is nice, too. Our last two sandwich presses just had a little notch you lifted. Easy to burn yourself!

I'm finding it a bit low powered, having to cook most everything on high or sear. But it gets the job done. One thing that I'm less pleased with is the distribution of heat. The heat is spotty on each side and the bottom is far and away more powerful than the top. Like the bottom can burn before the top starts getting colour, which is very unfortunate. I'm having to flip things over to get them cooked evenly, which kind of defeats the purpose of a griddler. If that was fixed this would be a good product.",

The problem is that the quality of the plates is not high - they gradually started sticking about three years after the purchase. Since Cuisinart's warranty is three years, they won't offer a replacement, and each plate costs $50 - it's cheaper to buy a new unit! It's a complete ripoff. It's especially disappointing because a much cheaper Foreman grill I once owned never had this problem, and while it was not easy to clean, the surface remained non-stick for many years. Not a unit I would recommend purchasing, and Cuisinart has lost a lot of trust from me.",

Separate grease catchers are not required since the new design makes the grease-catching unit integral to the grill.

It looks like it would work until I tried closing the lid on a nice loaded sandwich. It would push my sandwich out and since the top was so hot I would have to open the lid and get a fork to push the sandwiches back into place. Also, the second or third time I used this as a Panini maker, the top would not brown so I would have to flip the sandwich to get the other side brown. This defeats the purpose of a Panini.

It heats up quickly and evenly, the plates come out for easy cleaning, and the stainless is handsome and durable. Chicken, pork, hamburgers, steak, sandwiches, bacon, eggs - well I don't need to ramble; it does it all. I put it easily away rather than clutter my counters. I have learned that it does spit a bit of fat droplets on the counter, So I use a paper towel or two. Tasty, healthy, fast, and reliable. If it boiled my broccoli too I'd give my pots to Goodwill. Get one - you'll love it too.",

This is very sturdy, heats well and there\u2019s enough versatility to make this purchase worth it. I find a lot of the time I\u2019m cranking the heat past the recommended setting but it\u2019s still very effective at grilling sandwiches or anything else.

The lid does not stay secure. Especially hazardous since it gets very hot. The whole appliance gets very hot...not just the plates. It is not worth the pricey amount I paid for it.
