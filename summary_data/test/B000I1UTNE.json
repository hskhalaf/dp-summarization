These \"glasses\" are lots of fun to bring out for parties and when they get dropped on the floor (they will get dropped, people are clumsy) it is not a hard or worrisome clean up... no real glass! Great product, I really like it and do not regret my purchase!",

If they are out of the freezer for too long, they will start to melt and drip. You can't hold on to them very long because... they are ice. So, pretty narrow focus, but really, really cool.

Also because the space in between all 4 of the glass molds doesnt cool as quickly, you can get small bumps in the glass. Its hard to explain but it makes getting them out of the mold a real chore. Once out however, they are really awesome, nice and thick, hold an oz of liquid without issue and are super fun at parties. We spent 2 weeks making them and filled an ice chest that we took to a party with them and they were a huge hit. Great party item!",

A thinner bottom results in a quicker 'melt through.' So if you 'sip' rather than 'knock it back' it COULD pose an issue for you.",

In order to get these out of the mold, you have to temporarily run hot water over the silicon side in order to get the shot glasses to slide out easier. Great idea for a party. If you know of a college party girl, this will be right up her alley.",

Easy to use and get great ice shot glasses - I've even found that using the ice shot glass makes taking shots of less expensive liquor smoother and more enjoyable. Can't say I've had any issues to date and, in fact, I liked this item so much I bought one for my friend. I make about a dozen glasses over the course of a day and just leave them in my freezer for the right occasion. If you are thinking about getting it - go for it - there are no drawbacks whatsoever and it is a great party item. Highly recommend.",

For a couple of days prior to a party I typically freeze them overnight, take them out of the molds in the morning, fill up the molds again, repeat as necessary. I normally form about 8 shot glasses a day, that I just store in the freezer ready for use. More work than a typical shot glass, but I like the easy clean up and novelty effect - plus who doesn't love an ice cold shot.",

Not terribly displeased only because we all got a good laugh at the absurdity of trying to take a shot together with such a small and pointless product. At least it didnt cost much.",
