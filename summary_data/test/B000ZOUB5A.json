This typically requires 2 hands and is, in my opinion, an unnecessary step when all you want to do is lock it scrambled anyway.",

      "text": "so far working great. I saw a few reviews on the setup, but it was easy enough to setup. The writing on the package is REALLY small so that may have been the issue. So much easier to use than traditional combination locks. I also noticed as others that it's a Little awkward to close and lock at the same time, but I can still close and move the dial with one hand so not a big issue. My only complaint with getting it was it was a different color than what I chose.",

I ended up with a yellow and a blue lock. To set my own combination, I had to go through a few steps. That is good, so others do not reset to another combination by accident.",

From what I've read any brand of combination lock is easy to open if a thief knows what he's doing. That being said we couldn't crack each others locks after reading directions. Like others it won't lock unless it's set on the code. I now use it at the gym.",

I wish Amazon they would let you select the color, as we both ended up with Red ones so I had to mark our initial on them so we knew whose was whose. They are very easy to setup and select your personal combination, they are not to clunky. I noticed some folks said they don't fit on their gym lockers but we have no problem at ours. If your looking for an easy to use combination lock that you can set your own combination, this is one is great, especially for the price.",

I'm sharing a locker with my boyfriend so we set it to our anniversary - something easy to remember. - Sturdy and not TOO large Cons : - Turning the numbers isn't as smooth as a typical dial combination lock - it isn't as easy to do with one hand - The numbers are on the side so you kind of have to turn it towards you to set",

I also like how I can set my own code. For its size, I would have expected it to be a bit heavier; this initially had me concerned that the craftsmanship was lacking, but have found no reason to support this notion after several months of use. Note: You cannot choose your color. This was not important to me, but it is a notable shortfall.",
