I measured my wrists to make sure it was recommended and my wrist size was the smallest recommended. It works, but barely. Some days I end up needing to put in my password numerous times because the watch lost contact with my wrist. Other days it doesn\u2019t happen at all. If the design was changed so that the decorative side links weren\u2019t so long, it would probably work better for people like me. If it fit my dinky wrist better, it would get 5 stars.",

Amazing thing is that people with Apple watches don't really look at getting a different band, but they notice that mine is different and like it a lot. Its attractive and makes me feel a little more like a regular women's watch instead of a square phone alternative on my wrist. Quality is decent for what I paid (its lasted this long with a few scratches). With the design, you can adjust to the length you want. My wrist was kind of between two linkages in size, but I got used to it slightly big. Its just different than the velcro super adjustable band in that way.",

However, when mine arrived, the color was slightly different than my gold-tone watch...just a shade too pink. It was confusing to me to try to figure out which of the golds to choose to go with which of the watch models. I still wear it but I\u2019m not as happy with it as I\u2019d hoped to be.",
