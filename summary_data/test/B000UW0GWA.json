I averaged 10 42 gallon trash bags (sometimes up to 14bags) a week and the town limit is 5 bags. My option was to pay $4 per extra bag or get a trash compactor. I got the Gladiator and what a terrific investment! Now my trash is average 3 bags, tops 4 bags. I am very pleased. Easy to use and it works.",

Only reason I give it 4 starts and not 5 is because I do not like the drawer when changing the bag. My wife was like really... do we need that and now she loves it :)",

We bought cinch bags that work well with this unit which makes changing bags a lot easier then the bags that came with the unit.Very happy so far with the Gladiator and it is used daily.What we used to put in 4 garbage cans will now fit in 2 or less....",

This has reduced our trash bulk by more than half! No more bulging trash containers or runs to find trash bins to dump overloading trash bags. This has literally been a game changer. Quietest.....no. Most attractive.......no. Best functioning for our large family. YES!!!",
