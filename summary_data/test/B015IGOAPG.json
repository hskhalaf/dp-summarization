At one point the earlier printer wouldn't print at all, but it is printing normally now despite the warning messages. I bought this printer as a backup because it appears Brother is discontinuing all the printers that use those particular ink cartridges. The earlier printer worked fine attached to a Windows laptop via USB and also connected over the Google cloud for use by a Chromebook. That all works fine and was pretty easy to set up.",

Installation was super easy and it connects wirelessly quickly to my WiFi router & ISP. In order to receive the free shipping I had to wait about two weeks but it was well worth the wait. I highly recommend this printer and Brother's online support.",
