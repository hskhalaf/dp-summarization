I decided to buy one for myself, but the price went up from the sale price of $49.95 to almost a hundred dollars. I'll just keep my eye on this product and hope for another sale! I can hardly wait.",

This means the speaker is unmountable with the provided hardware, or any other common mounting options. The sound quality is good and the battery life is good.

The only thing I dont like about the speaker is that if you do NOT unpair your phone with this speaker, it WILL NOT pair with another phone.

In other words there is no way to separately adjust the volume to get a finer adjustment. My son has the smaller Altec Lansing speaker which does not have the controls tied in this manner so you turn volume down on speaker which allows your phone volume control more latitude.

Cons: - ... but the NFC pairing rarely works - Customer support is abysmal - Got a new phone and suddenly the bluetooth speaker won't connect to the new phone. Bummer Go get a similar speaker from a more reputable company if you want to have a good speaker for longer than two years",
