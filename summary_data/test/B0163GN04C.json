This gym bag is a little more discreet and doesn't look as out of place in the office. I carry in it my laptop with cables/mouse, shoes, gym clothes, wrist wraps, shaker bottle, and my lunch. It is a little annoying going through so many steps to open it but it's not a big deal. The straps are comfortable and it looks stylish. There is a mesh pocket on the outside that is perfect for holding an umbrella.",

However after a year of irregular use at the gym, the vinyl-like material on the lower half of the bag has suffered a lot of wear and the logo has rubbed off. It looks crinkled and water-damaged, which is a shame because the rest is holding up well. The velcro opening is also more problematic than I had initially realized: it catches on clothing when putting stuff in and taking out.",

One gripe is the outer pocket with zipper doesn't stay secure all the way and is prone to unzipping. Second issue is that it doesn't seem like it will hold up as well as other bags in this price point, the seams near the bottom are already kind of sagging. It will fit a 15.6 laptop, but not larger (in the laptop pouch)",
