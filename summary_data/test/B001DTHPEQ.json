Smooth sole plate and easy to fill with water as well. Very happy with this purchase wish I found out about it earlier. It makes it so easy to put next to my sewing machine and use on my quilters cut and press pad.",

It would turn for a few seconds and get a little hot, but then as soon I would go to use it it would grow cold. So a very big dud. The makers of this iron need to do more with quality control.",
