Yes she can \"Flinstone\" it, but at her age, that's not what she wants to do. Bummer.",

Does well on hardwood floors, tile floors, carpets, and sidewalks/street. Struggles a bit on grass, of course. Recommended - but make sure your kid is big enough. Still plenty of room for my toddler to grow into.",

My twins are 2 and of average height/size and are having a hard time reaching the pedals, even with the extenders on. I wouldn't necessarily say this is a bad thing, they use their feet to move around and I hope this means the trikes will last longer/grow with them longer. They work great in our house on the carpet and hard wood floors however, outside on the sidewalk/driveway the plastic wheels tend to not grip as well and then don't turn smoothly all the time. All in all, my kids love these bikes so it is a great buy!",
