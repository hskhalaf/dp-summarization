For the average person I would say, spend the money on a decent amp, cables (very important) and get this system. One thing I noted is that the SW can at times take a few seconds to kick in, but I think that may be related to my setup and the frequency I have setup.",

The included speaker mounts was an added bonus that allows easy walk mounting, however, the center channel speaker does not include wall mounts. The only thing I cannot speak for is the subwoofer as I already had a 12in subwoofer from Monoprice so I never even hooked it up.

I normally buy nice speakers like Bose or Polk. The sound was very comparable, but her space was a little smaller, so the sound was great for the space she was in.

    "description": "Style:5.1 Channel| Size:W/8in Sub| Configuration:SingleGet everything you need for a great sounding home theater speaker setup in a single box! You get four satellite speakers and a center channel speaker for the mid- and high-range audio signals, plus an 8-Inch powered subwoofer to handle the low frequencies. All the speakers come with an attractive black finish and convenient spring-loaded signal connectors. The center speakers use two 3-Inch shielded mid-range cones, while the satellites employ one 3-Inch cone and a 1/2-Inch dome tweeter. However, don't let the small size fool you! These 8 ohm speakers will handle up to 125 watts of power from your home theater receiver at frequencies from 150 Hz to 20 kHz. The subwoofer is powered by a 60 watt (RMS) amplifier, driving a downward firing 8-Inch cone. It can take either line or speaker-level inputs, so can be used with any amplifier, even older amps without dedicated subwoofer outputs. The subwoofer handles frequencies between 50 Hz to 250 Hz and includes adjustable crossover frequency and volume balance controls. Also included in the box are four C brackets for mounting the satellite speakers to the wall and the necessary hardware for mounting the speakers to the brackets. A pair of plastic feet to properly orient the face of the center speaker is also included. Note that you will need to provide your own hardware for mounting the C brackets to the wall or other vertical surface. Don't let the low price fool you! This speaker system sounds great and will fill your room with high-quality, full-spectrum sound! Note: The speaker wire connectors on each unit comfortably accept a maximum 16 gauge speaker wire. For best results use pin-type speaker plugs to make the speaker connections and banana or pin-type plugs to connect the wires to your amplifier.",
