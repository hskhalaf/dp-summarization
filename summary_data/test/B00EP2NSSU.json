Its very weird that the liquid keeps evaporating out of the sealed glass cylinder, like its gone down at least an inch and a half. I really got suckered into giving away my money for this. Hate so much. Feel so cheated.",

Its \"accuracy\" is +/- 2 degrees, since that's the interval between bulbs. Each bulb, which has an attached metal dangling label indicating temperature, maintains the same weight within a fixed volume. The liquid in which they are suspended however, gets less dense as it expands with higher temperature, causing the balls to sink. The lowest floating ball is the current temperature.",
