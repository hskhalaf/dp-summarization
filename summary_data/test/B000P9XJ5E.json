Since I've started using the Signature Pro, I've had more milk output, it's a bit quieter than the Medela and I really like the time feature. I would definitely recommend this breast pump.

I've been using it for about 2 months and I'm glad I got it instead of purchasing the more costly medela pump (Saved me about $120 bucks). If you're having any issues with suction, it's quite easy to troubleshoot. I highly recommend this product to all breastfeeding moms.",

My manual avent pump, has a soft silicon piece which you place in the cone, so your breast aren't vacumed against that hard plastic. 3. It would've been nice to have a carrying case. It's fairly small, and a carrying case to keep all the components together would've been a nice touch. Other than that, a very good purchase for the money.",

This one was a little more than i wanted to pay but has been very worth it. I can pump what I need in a manner of minutes, its pain free and very easy to take a part to wash. The only con I found was that i needed to find adapter rings for my Avent bottles because the pump did not fit them but they were found here on Amazon!!",

If you buy Lansinoh nursing pads it comes with 2 samples of breastmilk storage bags and I've been collecting them, so there would be no need to go out and buy them.",
