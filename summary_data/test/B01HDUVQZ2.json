Over the next month, started to happen more frequently, until it was multiple times a day. Customer service insisted it was a heat issue, though problems continued after removing from the cabinet and placing it out in the open. Finally, securifi sent a replacement of one unit. Which only lasted another few months before the same problems presented themselves. Now is practically unusable after a little over a year from original purchase. I'm moving away from mesh networks until someone gets the technology down pat.",

They are now working perfectly! And the free Almond app gives you the ability to control access to the network from anywhere. Especially like the schedule feature which allows you to set access hours for the children's devices. All in all, this is an excellent product and I highly recommend it!",

The Wifi Analyzer app provides a ping signal and strength meter. I walked around my home and found the weakest area to set my Securifi.

They were easy to reach, took all the time required to be sure all questions were answered, software was updated as needed and that the Almond was working as required by the user. They even called me and emailed me to check on my satisfaction with its operation. Outstanding! Do not hesitate to purchase this item.",

Really like being able to acces it from my phone. It lets me know when someone new joins the network and I can restart it without having to go to the base. Reason I only gave it a 4 is cause I had an issue trying to get my receiver to connect by hard line but it connects wirelessly just fine. Thought it was maybe the receiver but my other router didn't have an issue.",

Anyone using a password protected Almond extended wifi network will have to enter the password at least once.

    "description": "Style:Almond 3 (1 Pack)| Color:White&nbsp; Introducing the new Almond 3 Smart Home Wi-Fi System. &nbsp; Makes every room in the house worth visiting. &nbsp; Wi-Fi everywhere you want it. And we mean everywhere. Meet the Almond 3, our latest innovation that easily and quickly establishes a single, secure Home Wi-Fi System in minutes. To create a Home Wi-Fi Network, simply setup two or more Almond 3 units. It's easy with our innovative easy touchscreen access and Wizard. &nbsp; Almond makes Wi-Fi easy. Plug the first Almond 3 into your ISP's modem. The other units just need power and will communicate with the first Almond 3 to create a single Wi-Fi network across your entire home. &nbsp; Different homes, different Wi-Fi needs. One easy solution.How a family's yells can make it through any wall is an accepted fact. Wi-Fi signals on the other hand can struggle traveling from room to room. Sometimes concrete, glass and chicken wire (found inside historic home walls) diffuses or outright blocks a Wi-Fi signal. Other times it's the layout of a home that makes it difficult to get a signal everywhere. This is exactly why we created the best Smart Home Wi-Fi System.
