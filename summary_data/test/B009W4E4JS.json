      "text": "Nikon and Canon seem like they want to make a camera for every budget, skill level, and niche in the field. But, this falls short on so many levels. It is functionally irritating for the professional with many features that should be easy to change end up buried through cumbersome menus. It\u2019s also expensive and tedious for the beginner. The image quality is average at best and the flexibility of its functions are limited. Anything other than an already perfectly lit room is going to be a struggle. Avoid this model and find another that is more useful.",
