Maybe they need to turn on their cold water main to max instead of a few turns. Anyways, my water tastes great and nolonger smells like mold or algae. Did a lot of research on this, and this has amazing specs and reviews. 0.5um (microns) filtration for drinking water is crazy!!! I really don't think you can do better unless you get into those crazy 3+ step filtration systems with UV filter that only semiconductor plants should use. Believe me, I use to be a Micro Contaminate Engineer at Hynix/ Hyundai Semiconductor.",

That would help keep the pressure up and I imagine the filter life would be the same--just buy two replacement filters at double the single filter interval.... The pressure did seem to increase when I replaced the filter recently. Maybe it's just in my head.",

      "text": "I bought this because I could not find a 3M A1 replacement cartridge. Apparently that product has been discontinued. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this cartridge worked as an exact replacement for the A1 cartridge so it was not necessary to use the included fittings and hoses. I just unscrewed the A1 cartridge and screwed this one back in its place. It is a couple of inches longer than the A1 cartridge so make sure that you have room for it under the cabinet.",

      "text": "Installed easily, but one caveat - I was replacing an existing filter of another brand, so I didn't have to tap into the cold water line directly, so I can't rate how easy it was to install that part. The only problem I had dealt with re-using a coupling from the old installation, which leaked. All the couplings on the Filtrete product were solid, but did take a little more force than you'd expect. One coupling seemed like it was in firmly, but wasn't - you need a solid push until the tubing will really go no father. If you do it right, you push on it, feel the resistance give way, then the tubing will seat in the coupling.",

The AF left an \"old\" odor in our drinking water frequently, and after a few hours what looked like aeration bubbles. The PF-01 seems to work much better, with no detectable odor or other negatives. For us, it works better and is worth the extra $$. Previously, we had a drinking water only dispenser from GE, which we actually preferred, but decided to get the 3M cold water filtering system.
