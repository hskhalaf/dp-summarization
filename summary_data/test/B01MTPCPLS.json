I have a lot of health issues though and take meds that cause constipation. If it weren\u2019t for Miralax I would not beable to take pain medication.

When I opened this bottle, and mixed as usual, the taste was so caustic that I had to discard. I later tried again, after shaking the bottle a bit. It was the same bitter taste. MiraLax has basically no taste, and certainly is not caustic feeling and bitter. I get many knock offs from Amazon, and have gone to other sources, however , it did not occur to me that medicines for internal consumption would lack quality control. I purchased a new bottle from a local pharmacy, and it was the real MiraLax. Buyer beware.....",

The water flavoring isn't completely necessary, but without it, the water will have a very slight chemical flavor. I suggest waiting about ten minutes, shaking every two minutes for best results. It is also easy on your body, and is safer to use over longer periods of time because it is not a stimulate laxative, rather works osmotically. - 4/5 Stars because of the slight chemical taste alone, and slightly pricey. $5 less would be nice for the same size.",

We were about to buy a new toilet and get out sewer lines checked out, so this saves us a bunch of money.",

A big quantity pack is more economical to purchase and would suggest this one. Since her GYN recommended her this so we can confidently say that these are good during pregnancy. The powder is literally odor and tasteless so you can use this in anything you drink or eat. Gives great relief from constipation.",
