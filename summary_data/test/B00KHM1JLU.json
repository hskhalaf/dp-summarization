We like how the arms go up so they can go under tables of differing heights, or when the chair has been adjusted too high to slide under.",

It feels secure, but does move around a bit more than I would like. Easy assembly, decent instructions and nuts, bolts, and Allen wrench included. Currently, I'm very satisfied with the purchase.

      "text": "This chair is horrific to put together. I did it by myself, but could have used a second person. Its just awkward to handle. The bottom ring absolutely will not stay where I put it. It continuously falls down. The description leads you to believe the arms are much more maneuverable than they actually are. They swing back, that's it. No height or width adjustments at all. If you are a heavier person, just keep in mind the arms do not go out to accommodate. You can lift them up and out of your way, but wouldn't be able to use them then.",

The downside is that the piston collapses as soon as you sit so you lose few inches immediatly after sitting. I wasn't expecting a lot from this given the price but there's no back setting and if you have some kind of back pain this might not help you. It's complicated to return so I'll just keep it for some time but I have the feeling this thing will soon appreciate the view from my dumpster.",

The only reason I purchased this chair was because I switched to a standing desk. It adjusts perfectly to my standing desk height and the foot rest is adjustable as well.
