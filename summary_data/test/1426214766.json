Color photos of each species on every page. Good quick source of information (habitat, range and food.) Cons: Many photos show just the head of the critter, not the whole body. Illustrations on each page show the entire critter, but not much detail. Habitat descriptions don't include range map, just text. Suggested improvements: Put a code on each page that when scanned, provides a link to more photos and information. For someone who is advanced with knowledge of reptiles and amphibians, this won't be of much help.",

The book contains a lot of pictures and is easy to understand. It is small and concise, making it easy to carry the book around in the field. However, it does not include all of the species found in North America and does not include range maps. Because of this, I would not recommend using this book to identify reptile and amphibian species.",
