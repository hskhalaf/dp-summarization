I got the new one, put in two frozen waffels and had it set on the highest number ( 6 ) and it barely got one side a little tan. Now I grab some bread and put it in and what do I get? Lightly browned on one side, white on the other. afar as I'm concerned this is pure JUNK. Find another toaster to spend $50.00 on.",

At first I thought it was just the \"newness\" of the product, but we've had it for a while and use it almost every day and the smell is still there. I've checked to make sure nothing is stuck inside, the outside of the toaster does not get extremely hot and the \"toast\" that comes out of the toaster is just fine...I've cleaned it out, wiped it down, etc...still the smell remains.",

Its not really Black & Deckers fault its just that the toaster I had before this one was really great and they no long make it so this was the one that had to replace the GREAT toaster... I put bread in and it comes out crunchy. It does take up a lot of space but you are getting 4 pieces of toast at the same time.",

I love the tray to catch the crumbs so they don't go on the floor if you move the toaster. I've always had a 2 slice toaster and from now on I would only have a 4 slice toaster, it just so much more convenient. And Black and Decker products are always top notch!!",
