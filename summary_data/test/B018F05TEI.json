I'm a civilian contractor and weigh 220lbs and this thing still moves pretty good. it was larger than i expected and the battery lasts only slightly less that the advertised 45mins but I'm sure this due to my size. It handles the rough terrain well and has been ridden by just about everyone i work with even a guy that weighs 280 so if your looking for a little fun i would defiantly recommend this bike.",

They sent replacement for the controller and acceleration grip. It's better now that the parts was replaced and I adjusted the brakes but it still pop a fuse one time. I will call support and see why.",

There's no suspension, not good for going off jumps, and if you're going through very heavy brush, things get jammed up pretty quick, but it wasn't built for those things. Fixing it is very easy as there's very few moving parts with this electric motor. It was built to go a zippy 17mph off roading, on relatively flat surfaces in such an easy way to drive that no motorcycle experience is necessary. My wife jumped on it and while never riding a motorcycle or scooter of any kind, immediately got comfortable and loved it within 2 minutes of riding it.",

After replacing the chain and going through a few more charge cycles and rides, it suddenly stopped short in the middle of a short ride. Plug it in to charge and it doesn't charge. Lights up and stuff but when you pull the charger, it dies immediately. Bad battery already? Bad charger? I don't know. All I know is it cost about $75 per ride. Not worth it.",

    "description": "Who says older kids should have all the fun on our bikes? We created our classic 250W e-Mini for our own \u201ckick-butt, take names younger kids, \u201d and now it is time to share it with the world! Have you ever seen a toy with a metal disc brake? Neither have we. Our electric mini bike is not a toy; toys don\u2019t last! Designed for the rugged outdoors, this e-Mini was built to last with the same durable construction and welded-steel frame as our gas-powered products. With a top speed of 11 mph, this bike is meant for the little adventurer in all of us. But as parents, we know that safety comes first \u2013 so all of our e-Minis also come with a toggle switch that governs the speed down to 7 mph. This e-bike has motorcycle throttle control with a charge indicator. The battery charger hookup is built in and the charger is included. The charger connects directly to the e-Mini and fully charges the battery pack in 5 hours. Always know your charge level with the charge status indicator mounted on the handlebars! The electric mini bikes power comes from the 250W motor with rechargeable and replaceable 7AH 24V battery pack. The continuous run time is 45 min. Maximum on a full charge. We include both red AND pink decals, so you can customize it to your liking! Mega Moto warrants to the original retail purchaser of this product that it is free from defects in material and/or workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase. Mega Moto builds every bike and go-kart to the highest quality standards. Our bikes are bigger, stronger, safer, and faster for the ultimate experience. Monster Moto is proud to launch the NEW Mega Moto line of products in Q4 2018. As part of our brand evolution, we are launching a new line of products built in the same tradition of Monster Moto products. Kids can explore the outdoors with confidence on Monster Moto and Mega Moto vehicles.",
