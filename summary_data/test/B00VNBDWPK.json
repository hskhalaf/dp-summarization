      "text": "Car: 2018 Fiesta ST .... Ive been using Opt7 products for about a year now; got their interior LED kit and just added the Fluxbeam headlights and am VERY happy with the quality, ease of installation and how bright they are compared to stock. They could pass for high beams if they were angled higher! my stock high beams are not as bright as these fluxbeams. - Installation was a breeze and couldn't have been easier. The only thing that took a little bit of time was nicely putting all the wires into my headlight assembly. Overall, I WILL be buying the foglight kit and eventually the HIGH beam kit once I have more money for fun items!!! A++++ OPT7",

This is not the products fault though. I have now researched and learned that is just the way it works with LED bulbs vs incandescent vs HID.

      "text": "I installed these LEDs on a 1997 Lexus SC400. The H7 male plug had a different configuration that what was used on the Lexus in 1997 so I had to modify the female to allow the square male to fit correctly. After some electrical tape and tie wraps to secure the fit against time and vibrations the installation required I cut away a significant amount of the existing silicone boot to accommodate the ventilation needed to keep the ballast running cool. Summer in South Florida will be the test... Great lights, lots of intensity, a PITA to install but I think they're worth the effort",

High-beams work fine, but with the dash warning. I contacted support but haven't heard back after several days. After a few hours of trying to research this problem, I came across an official note from the company; these lights are not street legal. Save your money.",

I had a 2011 Silverado and I got flashed alllll the time. So prepare yourself for that. Mine lasted about 2 years before I had to buy a new pair and they were 100000 times easier to put in than HID's. I have these in my motorcycle, my 2011 Chevy, a 2013 Ford fusion (with projectors), and only the Ford has issues.",

      "text": "Bought these because I wanted a plug and play for girlfriend's car, as she already had projector's but the car came stock with halogen bulbs. These are noticeably brighter than the H11 halogen bulbs. However, as other reviews have noted the beam pattern is distinctly different due to design of the led element. Also, if you're looking for the maximum lighting performance, these are not as bright as a proper set of HID's. For the money and convenience, I would recommend the upgrade from halogen to LED (ONLY IF you had projectors, not reflector housings). Reason being, you wouldn't want to be the person blinding all oncoming traffic.",

So far I like them and am considering ordering a set to replace the driver/fog lights. If I do, I will go with the yellow coloration since it seems to cut through rain and fog better than the white. Overall I would say, price, quality, and ease of installation make these light bulbs an excellent replacement for OEM bulbs.",

      "text": "These headlights are very bright, however the beam is not well dispersed if using non projector style headlights. After about a year of use, one of the little fans started making noise when it got cooler/cold out (40f and below). I recently took them out of my car (2011 Chevy Cruze) due to the beam pattern (was not well dispersed because I used OEM headlights without projector lens). They still worked great two years after install and are significantly brighter than the Sylvania Silverstar bulbs that I have in my car now. The Sylvanias however are halogen and cast a better beam.",

      "text": "Make no mistake these puppies are really good, so good this is my 2nd set! My issue is that not one of the 2 I bought came with the correct connections. Furthermore the customer service phone number is recorded saying \"due to getting to many calls please email us. Which I did and a month later I'm still waiting for a response. These are really really good and it was worth me making the new connections I've included a photo of the H-11 connection from their product (on the bottom) which obviously is too big. The top plug is the true size. Since they don't respond to customer service one has to wonder if they know about this issue.",

That\u2019s the model I chose when buying, and the manufacturer said they would fit. Adapters were included for wiring, but not even the adapters would plug into my existing light wire harness. I ended up having to cut and spliced the wires. Hated that I had to cut my factory light plug off in order to splice. Hopefully these lights will last as long as the truck does. As far as LED quality goes, they\u2019re super bright white! Great quality, and look awesome installed.",

These do not blind people but are brighter and allow you to see the road ahead when you're hauling heavy loads and need to see as far ahead as possible. My advice is just to purchase both low and high beam at the same time, you will not regret this purchase!",

The flux beam was garbage with my low beans especially my right side, the light beam looked nothing like the picture in the advertisement. The high beams only worked great on both sides. I contacted customer service and I got some bogus answer about adjusting my headlights aim, suggesting Im some kind of idiot that didnt have his headlights perfectly adjusted to begin with.
