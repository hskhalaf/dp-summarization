I see several comments saying they run a size small. This isn't correct. These shoes run accurate to size, however, the cushion is AMAZING. If you have Wide or thick foot, I would recommend getting a size up. I have a regular foot, meaning I don't have to buy wide shoes and I love these shoes. After you wear for a couple of days the cushion wears down just a bit and they are perfect.",
