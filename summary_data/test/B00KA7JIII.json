      "text": "This game is the best game I think I've ever played. It's for anyone, and has an enchanting story behind it. There are 10 chapters in which you need to guide princess Ida through impossible geometry, and while you work out a strategy, the game doesn't stress you! It's certainly worth the money. The only downside to this game is that saying \"only one more go,\" is something you can't be truthful about! But no, the downside is that it's pretty short, but still takes a few hours; plus you can play it again and again! You should definitely buy this game, it's the best ever!!! :-)",
