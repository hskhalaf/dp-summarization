Very easy to assemble: pedals, seat, handle bars, and drink holder were all that needed to be installed. Brakes and gear-changer worked right out of the box -- the easiest bike I have had to assemble in years. All around a great deal, well deserving of 5 stars and this review. Will make my next bicycle purchase exactly the same way.",
