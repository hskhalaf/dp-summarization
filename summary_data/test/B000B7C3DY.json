We use a different color each time to show the order all of the pictures go. The albums have held up so well, and I love the small caption writing space this album has next to the pics. We don't display them with the dust cover it comes with because they've held up well without it, they look better without in my opinion, and any dust is easily wiped off without leaving a mark on the fabric.",

The album is all for landscape pictures and almost all of the pictures I had printed out are in portrait. I think in the past, when people had digital cameras, they were more likely to take landscape pictures and this album would have been ideal. However, with camera phones, people are taking more and more portrait pictures over landscape pictures and this album then becomes somewhat useless. The album does not really allow you to put any pictures in portrait and thus loses points for flexibility.",

      "text": "I have been using Pioneer photo albums for a few years. They are good quality and hold the photos in place much better than other albums I have used. My one criticism of this album is that when I was sliding the photos into each slot, the windows were becoming disconnected from the page at the seams. This was not a huge problem, but I had to be very careful to avoid pulling them apart.",

They are perfect for filling with photos for gifts for little kiddos as it is so fun for them to see their memories in front of them instead of on some sort of technology! As I take new pictures, I print them out and place them in the back, so the events are chronological, very fun. These books are great quality and I like that they come in lots of different colors.",

If you have no health issues and don't have little kids around and want a nice photo album this is the one.",

It has a great cover, with a window for a photo, and 20 pockets for 4x6 photos. I was hoping that I could fit a couple of 8x10s in the pockets, but there is a small divider at the end of the pockets that prevent that from happening. Doesn't change that I love this photo album enough to buy one for myself as well. I'm very happy with my purchase, and the grandmothers are, too.",

The seals of each page is so minimum and the paper is inkjet printing quality that this album is definitely NOT going to last for years that you wish to enjoy with you family. Two stars for the cover fabric which has nice color, but it doesn't have spine window to insert title or date. If you are looking for something that lasts, it's worth few extra bucks to purchase better quality ones.",

It cannot be healthy nor is it anything I would want to keep or give to another.",
