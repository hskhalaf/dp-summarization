The kit to convert her crib was over $100- so I went ahead and made the leap and bought this. I figured in the worst case, I'd just upgrade her to a full bed earlier than planned. The bed is fabulous and FAR exceeded my expectations. It looks great, I'm not worried about her falling and is well made. Assembly was extremely easy.",

Designed to ship easily and fit into a smaller box, the side rails are two piece and are joined by a metal plate of sorts.

Then, if you happen to be kneeling down to give a kiss goodnight, and put some of your weight on the bed, the rails break. At this point we are trying to decide do we return the bed, and the hassle of disassembly, or do we try to rig it with a reinforcement of some sort. Would not recommend.",

It is sturdy enough for me to lay on as well though I avoid doing so. It fits perfectly underneath my oldest daughters' bunk bed too.",

      "text": "I really love this toddler bed. It's easy to clean and move. It goes together easily. It's close to the ground so if anybody rolled it would be safe, and the kids love it! It's one of the first toddler beds that weren't rejected in this house which is saying a lot! It is lightweight so if you need to move them room to room you can. If your babies get sick or they need to feel secure it's not hard to just move the beds. The frame is high quality and really sturdy. It will definitely last them until they get their twin beds! Twin beds for twins! I recommend this product 100%!!!",

For the most part easy to put together but you do have to drill some holes with \u201cself drilling screws\u201d, and the wooden slates you need 2 people to help you hold everything together. Overall I am very happy with this bed. Would buy again.",
