I would end up putting it on a cutting board so it didn't melt the counter, after it left some brown scorch marks. After that I put it away and got it out the other day to give it another try and right before bed I decided to put a board under it. I smelt something melting, picked it up and to my horror it had melted! The yogurt maker had melted itself. If I had gone to bed and left it i'm afraid there may have been a fire. This thing is dangerous.",

This one by Epica, I like because it's cheaper and has glass jars. I used a ladle to fill the jars, next time I'm going to pour straight from my Pyrex measuring cups and maybe I won't spill as much. I used whole milk and Stonyfield plain yogurt. Works well, just make sure you whisk the yogurt into the milk really well otherwise it will be lumpy. So far I like it.",

I followed directions on the starter packet I bought (), filled in the glass containers and set it to go overnight for about 8.5 hours. In the morning I had delicious yogurt. It's a little thinner in consistency than the store-bought kind but that was expected and fine with me. I pre-heated my milk and let it cool down to room temp before I dissolved the starter and that's supposed to help with getting a thicker consistency. I love how I can control the quality of ingredients and don't need to worry about additional additives or sugar. Will definitely be making more batches!",

I also fill the jars full when using my own starter rather than just the 3.5 oz the insert recommended. They turn out fine, every time. If you don't need all the additional stuff (timer, etc.) this will work fine for you.",

Several hours later, you have yogurt. Just put the lids on the jars and keep them in the fridge until you're ready to eat.",

The directions that come with the yogurt maker are interesting and not easy to use as the steps are split and on the first and last page. Once I found them all we were off and running. For a first time user who does not have to depend on an alarm or auto shutoff option this item works nicely. If you can't pay attention to the time there might be a problem here as there is no timer or auto shut off. For me that is okay. This is a good item for a beginner like myself.",
