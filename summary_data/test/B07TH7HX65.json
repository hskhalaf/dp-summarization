Also, my Polish family was in town and my husband does not speak Polish... it helped his communicate with my Aunts that would not have otherwise been possible. I gave it 4/5 stars for the accuracy portion, as the English-to-Polish did have a few errors... though I will admit Polish is an extremely difficult language. Overall 5/5 stars based on how much it helped us, anyways! Would highly recommend! I also used it to help refresh my memory on some Polish, could be really helpful to someone learning a language.",
