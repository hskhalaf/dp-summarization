He is on 4 different medications to try to help him sleep (negligible success), and he has a CPAP for central sleep apnea. He frequently twitches himself awake, so after a lot of reading and research, I invested in this blanket for him. He absolutely LOVES IT! He appears to be getting really good, solid rest as the twitching is minimized under the weight of this blanket. He has always tried to cocoon himself in his sheets and blankets, so I wish I'd invested in one a long time ago.",

Anxiety and insomnia were keeping me awake at night, tossing and turning. Waking up and unable to fall back to sleep. This last month of use, I feel so much better. So much more energy, better mood and much more rested. My complaint is that it\u2019s not a queen. Not even close. The \u201cqueen\u201d I received is actually 58x78, not 60x80 and it is definitely not big enough for 2 people. So size up! I would still buy again, just bigger.",

I always loved a heavy duvet in the winter but have a hot apartment, this blanket provides the weight and comfort without making it too hot to sleep. The weight is evenly distributed. I have the 15 lbs one based on recommendation for my weight and I probably could have gone a bit heavier, although it is astounding how heavy it feels when putting on the cover! I believe it makes me less restless and has improved my quality of sleep. It looks to be good quality material and the color is as shown, although once it is in the cover that doesn't really matter.",

However, it can be difficult pulling a 15 lb blanket over you, laying on your side, reaching behind you as you would a regular blanket, it just isn't the same. Think about pulling it before you do it. I changed the way I use this blanket, I just cannot treat it the way I do a regular blanket and I never thought I would have to. You can hurt yourself especially if you have rotator cuff problems. If you don't have rotator cuff problems, you will if you aren't really careful.",
