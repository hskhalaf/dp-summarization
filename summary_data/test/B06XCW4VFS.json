Seamless connectivity with Bluetooth. I use mine to stream from iPhone, Amazon Dot and a projector. Haven't tested battery life yet. I'll likely be getting a second to connect the pair as stereo surround for outdoor movie nights. Nice work Bose!",

If you turn the speaker off it doesnt actually turn off it goes into more of a hibernation mode. Which if it didn't tell you (literally it announces what its connected to every 15 or 20 minutes) in the middle of the night when your trying to sleep, would actually be a great idea. This is a software issue that Bose could patch but has not. There is a work around but its really tedious and for 300 you really shouldn't have to jerry rig your speaker.

The 360 degree sound is a plus on the revolve because of the flexibility it offers for where you place it, but I prefer the SLIII when I can find a good spot for it.

The speaker can be used connected to a power source or run on battery. It has a long battery life - every bit of the advertised 16 hours. Love the portability. I take the speaker only with me to whatever room of the house I am spending time in. Doesn't matter where the iPad is, the speaker works in any room. On/off and volume can be controlled from either the speaker or my iPad.",

Using it with google home and also to play music from my iPhone. Connected easily and took very little time. I purchased it with a charging cradle, which is convenient but not necessary to purchase with this speaker, as it comes with a charging cable. About twice in size as of a medium size coffee mug. Sleek and charming!",

On the roof, while he was shingling the shed roof, in the garden, on the deck, under the deck, and even in the outdoor chapel when our daughter got married. He can't live without it now. He tells everybody that comes to the house about the great sound. Glad I bought it..",

I'm on the fence on this one and will update after a little more time using the product.",

I also bought the charging cradle which makes is easy to just set the speaker on it to charge. Battery Life is excellent. It does get pretty loud for being a mid size speaker; however, the sound quality maintains throughout. I have other bluetooth speakers that get louder; however, at a certain point it's no longer quality music... it's just noise.",
