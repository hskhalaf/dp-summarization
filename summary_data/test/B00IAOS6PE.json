Next day doing some pictures the same thing happened it powered down and all functions froze. Had to remove the battery and wait 10 minutes then replaced the battery and it powered up. Serious fault somewhere in the hardware. Shame takes quality pictures. I returned the camera because of the powering down problem and ordered a Sony A5000L. Opening the Sony package it was sealed with their secure sticker. The Nikon arrived with the internal Nikon box open. This is suspicious. I think I was sold a second or grey good.",

And eventually would only open for business with the dial between modes.Now it has turned up its toes and doesn't take any images at all, I just get white screens.",

I used its 30 times zoom to take a picture of the moon (just for fun) and it took a very passable photo showing the craters quite clearly. One slightly annoying thing it can be a little awkward to hold, as the most comfortable position puts one hand on top of the flash and the other on the movie button, once you learn not to do this the little camera is to me faultless.",

      "text": "Bought this just before I went to Thailand in Nov 2014. Whilst I was away the lens stuck twice, but I thought it was something I did. When I returned home I was going to return but completely forgot, due to family illness. I didn't use the camera again until I went away to tour Andalucia during April 2016. First day on holiday, ready to take loads of snaps...it dint work at all and the lens remained stuck. A complete waste of \u00a3189. Now out of warranty (my own fault I know) and now I've finally read all the reviews I find this has been a common problem.",
