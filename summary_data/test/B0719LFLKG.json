The click means that it is secured to the splitter; however, the click also means that it will take some finger muscle/force to pull the headphones out. To remove your headphones, pull at the end where the cord and the splitter meet, DON'T pull the cord hoping the splitter will release your headphones because you could stretch the cord/or damage your headphones that way.",

Consistent delivery to all five channels. Durable construction. Nice feel on the cord. Nice snap in the plugs. The extra little 3\" aux is a plus.",

Also helpful for watching a movie in the hotel room when the kids are sleeping. In the classroom one group of students can listen to a story or lesson together during quiet time. The only caveats are that you have to have headphones or earbuds for everybody, and the cords need to be long enough so that people don\u2019t have to be leaning in or crowding each other. I recommend either audio jack extension cables or headphones with long cords.",

      "text": "I love this five way headphone splitter, I've used it on road trips, or if my friends and I are just listening together. This works very well and I use it with my adapter since I have an iphone 7. Also, if you are listening with only two, one, three, pretty much anything less than five it will still work with no difference in sound quality. Such a perfect gift!",
