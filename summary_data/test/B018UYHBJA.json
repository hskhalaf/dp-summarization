      "text": "I purchased these for my 15 year old son. the one ear cushion fell off and we have tried multiple times to put it back on. On the other side, the hinge where it folds broke in his hands. I purchased a warranty through square trade and was told that it doesn't cover accidental damage. I think having it fall apart in your hands doesn't really qualify for accidental damage, it is poor manufacturing. I will call the warranty company to talk to them about the online decision but I will not purchase any more headphones from this company.",

DO NOTE however that they are not noise limiting, and they do not have volume functionality in the in-line controller (it's just for mic functions). Also, for those asking if it works with a computer, it will but you probably need a splitter like this one:",

In any event, there is a one year warranty. The actual color was exactly as it appreared on our screen. This was definitely good value for money.

So today it completely stop working. Like literally one second I was walking listening to music the next none thing. I took the headphones off and on none thing. There was no cut on the wires tho it was curl up. There was no reason it stop working. So after one week it was done. Would not recommend these headphones.",
