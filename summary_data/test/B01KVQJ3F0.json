Also, when I could get only one I had to return the other because would not have enough to finish my bedroom window.",

It\u2019s lole the panels aren\u2019t rectangular. They\u2019re warped. It needs to be sewn better.",

They had a little tester spot where you can try to shine your phone light through it. You can't see the light at all! Yeah you might get a glow around the edge of the window, but that's normal. You could tape/pin them to the wall if you want. Yes they kind of have a plastic backing, and yes they are a little bit expensive (one panel per package) but they are thick and actually work. I bought them for all our bedrooms.",
