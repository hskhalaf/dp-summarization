Also, little thread-like pieces pull away from the outside so that it seems to be shedding. For construction I recommend Always Discreet. For absorbency, both are good, Depend possibly better.

They aren\u2019t bulky and cannot be detected under leggings. I had tried another brand and found they leaked. These do not leak. They\u2019re very practical for me especially at night when I have a difficult time getting to the bathroom on time because I\u2019m disabled. No complaints here. Will definitely be ordering again and again!",
