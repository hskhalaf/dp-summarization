      "title": "Recent Quality Problems - Beware",
      "text": "I've purchased this Merrick 5.5oz Chicken Pate for years through Amazon, however Merrick's quality control has significantly declined recently. In the last few weeks our 7yr old cat started having stomach problems and was admitted to a veterinary hospital for vomiting. No other symptoms or illness. Tonight we opened a can from the same case to find a dead fly in the food (see pictures). It would appear other reviewers in the last few weeks have also complained of sick cats and quality control issues with cans expiring in 2019. I've loved Merrick for years, but I feel compelled to let others know about my recent purchase experience. Buyer beware.",

I scooped out the cat food and noticed weird coloring. From the looks of it I believe it is mold. I have requested a return and am asking for a replacement batch. Hopefully this is just something screwy with one can but I would recommend owners checking their cans. Hopefully Amazon will replace the cans and I can update my review after I have scrutinized a new batch. Please check your cans, I would hate for anyone's cat to get sick!",

Remember, domestic cats are obligate carnivores because of their inherited needs. Over generations, cats have lost the ability to manufacture amino acids and vitamins like herbivores and omnivores can; they get these from the MEAT they eat. Dry food (kibble) just doesn't do the trick. You need to feed them MEAT and only MEAT for best health.",

My cats don't like to bite into their wet food, they prefer to lick it up instead. I mix it about half and half with warm water which mixes up well and they eat it all up. Very happy with this product, I repurchase it all the time.",

Cats are obligate carnivore, which means they have problems digesting plant products. Companies use fruits, vegetables, and grains to increase their profit margins. Though this brand general doesn't have grains, the fruits and vegetables are still a no-no. Just because they are healthy for us, doesn't mean they are healthy for cats. The chicken pate has about 2.59% carbs, which isn't bad (still not great), while the turkey has about 4.76%. I am still looking for the perfect brand, as this is not quite perfect.",
