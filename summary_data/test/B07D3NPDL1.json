The sound is crystal clear on chat when in a party and game play. I can hear footsteps from buildings across the road. I also play rocket league with pandora in the background and I can hear the game around 30% and my music the other 70% and the music sounds amazing. Along with chat in the background as well. Anyway. These are a sweet pickup if your looking for an amazing set of headphones at a very good price (IMO)",

I would be more satisfied with the $8 mic you can find in the PS4 box. Do not buy this mic. It is NOT worth anything above $10.",

These seem like they're better built but only time will tell. So far they have good sound (not great but good enough for the price I paid).

Almost wish I\u2019d splurged and went with the wireless. Of course there is a cord with a jack for your controller, but I overlooked the fact that you still have to charge them. They don\u2019t run off of the controllers power like my old headset. Which probably explains the great sound. The charger is really short, but a PS4 controller charging cable is long enough to charge it while using it. Conveniently they have the same style charging ports. Comfortable to wear also.",

I just did 4 hours on Ace combat and 6 hours of rolling face to DJ Tiesto and I'm pretty sure there's a few hours left on the battery. Bass is nice. It's not a 200$ 7.1 headset but yeah, I'm happy for 30$",

Only thing I didn't like was that you have to charge them to use them. 4hrs of charge time isn't bad especially with an output of about 10-12hrs of game time after fully charged. One main thing though they do get uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them. One thing for sure if you get these you need to break them in, just like any other new headset.",
