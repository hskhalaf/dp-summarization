However, this was not designed with women in mind. The compartments are not designed for any kind of cosmetics or for keeping your items organized well. And be mindful it only likes travel sizes. Don't try to pack any items larger than that. Fine for a weekend outing, not for a real 5-7 day or more trip.",

Considering the bag was already a few dollars cheaper on eBags, these discounts made it a $10 bag. Absolutely worth it in my opinion. My Motherlode backpack ended up being significantly cheaper on eBags as well. If you are considering any eBags products it would be wise to price check there and to make sure you are signed up for their emails.",

The total length of the toiletry kit is exactly the width of my carry-on and it packed flat on right top of my clothes.
