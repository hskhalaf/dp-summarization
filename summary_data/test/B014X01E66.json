It is worth pointing out: heat causes normal discoloration with copper\u2014I know it says it somewhere in the description. With that, you can tell which pans we use the most by how much discoloration they\u2019ve experienced. I\u2019ll be purchasing a copper cleaner soon. It 100% does not bother me that need to use a special cleaner on them every once in a while. These pans were worth the investment!",

I enjoy cooking on them, and so long as you immediately wash it they clean easy enough. However, they were what I was expecting. They seem more copper plated, and a very thin covering of copper to boot.",

      "text": "Just okay. For the price you can't really expect perfection. They arent as durable as most multiclad sets out there, but will do in a pinch. The worst part about this set is that the bottom of the pots and pans aren't flat (more rounded), so they wont sit flush with with your cooktop if you have an electric/induction range. Not only is this super annoying, but also poses a safety risk: never try to stir these pots one-handed, you will get burned!",

      "text": "All the reviews about them discoloring are phooey. Yes, it is copper and it does react when on heat and they do turn colors, but a tiny bit of polish every once in a while and they're good as new. We've had ours for several months now and even went a while without polishing them, letting them get all discolored. Got the polish out the other day and they shined up good as new. We also cook on an electric flat top and they distribute heat wonderfully. So very easy to clean off burnt on stuff too. Could not be happier with them!",

Definitely a great purchased!",

You should expect to shine copper to maintain it. They heat up fast, they hold heat very well, they are gorgeous when well cared for. I use the lemon and salt method outside, and heat oil inside to season just as with a cast iron pan. Fabulously non-stick, get the flavors of your food instead of having it turn to mush. Well worth the money.",

The set includes: 8\"\" skillet, 10\"\" skillet, 2Qt saucepan with lid, 3Qt saucepan with lid, 3Qt deep saute pan with lid, 6Qt stockpot with lid. Each of our Lagostina hammered copper products are carefully crafted to provide you with a durable, timeless Product. While copper is outstanding at conducting heat, the metal does become naturally discolored after normal use. This does not effect the performance of our products in any way, but we understand the importance of retaining the beauty of copper. To do so, follow these three easy steps: to restore our copper cookware to its original glow, first, rinse the pot or pan thoroughly. Next, using a small sponge or cloth, apply a copper cleaning solution to the Product. Once the copper cleaner has been fully administered to the pot or pan, rinse it and dry. If there are still areas that seem to be discolored, repeat the process until the original Color and shine are restored.",
