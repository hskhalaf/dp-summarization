The table is very sturdy (50 lbs) and well built. It's an excellent accent and also keeps anyone from accidentally touching the fire stove.",

(Others have noted the issue in their reviews; I should have listened.) Really? Still endorsed by Amazon as a \"Amazon Basics\" recommended product?!? Of course, the (ineffective) shipping packaging was essentially destroyed in the unpacking, and at 60# weight, it's unrealistic to try to return it (for only $100). So, I'm going to find a rubber mallet and try to un-dent the bowl, and live with it. So, consider yourself forewarned: buy this, and make sure to get a rubber mallet, too.",

It does the job and does burn logs well but it was quite expensive but is probably a result of the material used to male it.
