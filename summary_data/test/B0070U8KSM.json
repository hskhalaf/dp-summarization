      "text": "These are the most incredible sounding headphones that I've ever heard. I thought that nothing under $1000 would beat my beloved Hifiman Sundara but the HD-700 does! At less than $500. There is no treble spike nor harshness whatsoever. The most lifelike reproduction of voice strings and especially piano that I've ever heard. And these are nowhere near as hard to drive as I've seen written before. Much easier than my Hifiman Sundara and HE400i. Easier than the Sennheiser HD-650 and simply sound better than any of those headphones. Absolutely no negatives. None.",

I've got normal ears, so they fit great. Senn seems to have reduced the size of the ear pieces in newer models. I've returned two sets of newer Senn headphones because of this. The HD 700's are exceptionally comfortable. Ya, the cord sucks, but I'm not listening to the cord. Thank you for your time.",

These HD 700 are showing some excellent clarity, definition, and quick response across the spectrum. Thinking the treble will continue to grow with usage. As others have noted, they have a slight dip in the mid highs. I found their midrange and bass more than either of my other cans. (Grado 225e, Hifiman Mann 400i). Comfort is light around the ears, and the weight is very light, while they tend to slip a little when leaning back. Overall, these are audiophile standard that one could be proud to own.",

Sound quality wise, it's true that HD700 has a wide and deep sound stage. One of the best out there in headphone market. But it's also true that the treble is over-strengthened, making it suitable for only a few genres. The mids are way too weak. The piano sounds distorted when played in mid.

They are their own unique set of headphones and sound signature. You love it or you don't. Fortunately, I do!

I tried watching TV and movies with them and they didn't live up to the hype. While listening to HiFi music, however, these sound amazing.

For well-recorded tracks, however, the HD-700 headphones are my go-to and are awe-inspiring -- thank you Sennhesier. I'd like to own the HD-800S someday, to compare.

Now that these have started coming down in price, I think they're really starting to punch at their price point, especially considering that more expensive equipment (such as the HD800's/LCD3's/etc) tend to require an equally expensive amplifier to boot.",

      "text": "I currently have an ultrasone 750 pro closed back headphone. I bought this as an upgrade to my current headphone and IT SHOWS. Everything is better with this headphone; from tiny details to the soundstage and there is a distinct clarity on all the songs I have that I did not notice with my old headphone. Definitely worth the 650 price tag. The music feels more lively and the confort that this headphone provides is TOP NOTCH. The design of the cups go over your ears. The padding they use is very confortable. I did not feel any strain on my ears at all, even after 2-3 hours of listening to music. 5/5 stars",

Maybe my ears are damaged from listening too of loud music, but these aren't as loud as I hoped. You'll likely need an amp to get the full experience. Doesn't have shake your skull bass, but otherwise these head phones are very crisp.",
