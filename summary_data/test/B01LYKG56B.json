The hooks for the coats are not soldered/fixed to the bar, you hook them on and they swing since they don't clip or anything... 2. We had a very hard time putting the last bolt in up top in the back because the metal was far too tight and we couldn't line the holes up (but this was probably just user error). I recommend not tightening the other side too much before you screw in the last side.",

Also the paint layer was so thick on it that we had to hammer parts into one another. It was so difficult that I would think it was user error other than literally yesterday I put together a 6ft tall 200lb cabinet in under an hour, so this small coat tree shouldn't have been so difficult.",
