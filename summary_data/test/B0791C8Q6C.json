      "text": "Emerica upped the wino G6 low with a midtop version. And it doesn't disappoint. Ankle support/protection is always a good thing. Also fit as expected. I'm an 8.5 in Van's classics. These fit the same. I haven't skated or worn the regular wino low's so I can't really compare, but these are a quality and sturdy shoe. I don't think their too stiff or thick in the fixing tape at all. I've skated the huf hopper and that has a thick fixing tape feel. Emerica doesn't make bad shoes in my opinion and they are committed to making the real deal when it comes to skate shoes. And NO I was not paid to do this review.",

Off the bat I noticed that Id be able to save my ankles from the usual abrasion that accompanies breaking in low-cut skate shoes. These are soft on the inside and durable on the outside. They might feel too hot for the summer, but they're mad comfortable in colder weather. Been wearing them essentially every day since I got 'em with no problems whatsoever.",
