    "title": "HIC Harold Import Co. 43172 Tortilla Press for 6-Inch Tortillas, Silver",
    "description": "Style Name:Tortilla PressHIC\u2019s Tortilla Press is specially designed for creating 6-inch homemade tortillas and other artisan flat breads of the perfect thickness every time. Dough pressed into a consistent thickness looks great and cooks evenly. No more hand rolling or tortillas with doughy, undercooked areas. With its sturdy handle, HIC\u2019s Tortilla Press allows effortless leverage to press perfectly consistent dough every time. Easily press the perfect tortillas for creating wraps, tostadas, quesadillas, tortilla chips, and more. Perfect for making all types of tortillas, including flour tortillas, whole grain, corn, low carb, and gluten free tortilla wraps. Great for other artisan flat breads, like pita bread, Caribbean roti, focaccia, and moo shoo pancakes, even mini pie crusts, pastry shells, and more. A great addition to cooking accessories for easier food preparation, plus it\u2019s safe and fun when cooking with kids. Easy to use. Prepare the dough recipe or use ready-made dough. For best results, line both sides of the press with plastic wrap, wax paper, or parchment paper to prevent dough from sticking to the press. Roll a small amount of dough into a ball and place it in the center of the press. Flatten the dough slightly by hand then close the press. Fold the handle over the press and apply a firm pressure to create griddle-ready rounds. Gently remove the plastic wrap from the flattened dough and cook according to recipe.
