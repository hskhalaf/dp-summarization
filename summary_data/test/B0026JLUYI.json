      "text": "I bought this after freezing in the mountains overnight in my ultralight sleeping bag rated for 42 degrees F, when it was probably in the mid to upper 30s overnight. Since I bought this liner, I've used it a couple times when it got down to 30s overnight, and it has kept me very toasty with wearing only leggings and a t shirt. I'm surprised at how much warmer my bag is with this liner, since it's pretty thin. I tried using it when I slept on my friend's couch, and I woke up sweating because I wore a sweatshirt in my liner (I was okay once I peeled off the sweatshirt). Great buy, and reasonably priced.",

Even if there is no increase in warmth, it should at least keep the inside of the sleeping bag cleaner. And easier to wash this bag, instead of the whole sleeping bag. Will be using this in a Kelty Tuck 22 (regular length) bag. Also have a SOL Escape Bivvy for an outer shell. All three items fit together well. If there is a negative to this system, I will update in the future.",
