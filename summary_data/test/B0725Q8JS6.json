I normally wear a women's 7.5-8 in shoes, but running shoes I'm more between an 8-8.5.. The 8 fit perfectly. They are such cute shoes but my one concern is that the footbed doesn't feel very cushioned like the other pairs of adidas running shoes I've had. Hopefully they will not make my feet hurt when I run on the treadmill. Anyone who needs more cushioning could probably size up and put in comfortable insoles, otherwise I think they will prove to be nice shoes for working out at the gym.",

My toes almost always hurt me after a run. These shoes have a big roomy toe box. The shoe feels amazing without socks & yet still feels secure & cradles the foot. This shoe is lightweight, yet it stretches with me, is not stiff & really no break in period. The mesh provides nice breathability...that I can feel. I really like this shoe & most likely will purchase a second pair in a different color \ud83d\ude42",
