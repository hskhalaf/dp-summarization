Semi-advanced settings like static IPs and port forwarding are available, though accessing them is a little weird (just not where I would expect in the menus). The problem is that many of my devices now frequently require me to disable and reenable their wifi in order to stay connected. My iPad is the worst...sometimes it requires this process once every couple minutes.",

      "text": "Bought this and the Amped cameras during Black Friday promotions and they work great. I'm no techy but my son is and I was able to set this up myself without his help. He was pretty amazed to say the least. I just plugged the units in and followed the steps after getting the app. The phone app is very useful and lets you do a lot of things like pause internet for dinner and best of all block facebook if needed. The wifi performance is good and now provides us coverage all over and in our backyard. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.",

      "text": "This system took me less than five minutes to set up....from my iPhone. A true, modern day experience. No website to punch in, no IP address to keep track of, just as simple as an app download & following a few steps. It was literally easier than figuring out how to use Snapchat. Our daughter isn't quite old enough for the parental controls, but they will come in handy very soon. We're more than satisfied w/ the wi-fi speed & coverage. Smart TVs have no trouble streaming (we are a 100% streaming household), music plays with no problems. We have about 8 devices connected, at any given time, it's working great.",
