In the event they don't, Merrell offer 365-day no quibble returns (which I've been happy to use once or twice) and they will honour this, even if purchased through Amazon (though you'll need to send it back to Amazon and pressure them to process the return, they won't give it to you without it)",

The elasticated inserts under each strap prevent the strap from rubbing on the skin. Can be worn with or without socks of any thickness and can be adjusted to compensate. The soles are thicker than sandals normally are and provide greater comfort over rough or uneven ground. I got nine years wear out of my previous pair and these will easily match that!",
