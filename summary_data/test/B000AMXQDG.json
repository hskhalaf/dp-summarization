I used Meguiars on the front tire on Driver Side and rear tire on the Passenger side and then used Amour All on the other two tires so I had a good comparison of both the front and back tires for both products. The Meguiar's shine lasted about 8 - 9 days longer. So the old saying, you get what you pay for. Both are good products for the price you pay but to me per ounce, I get more bang for the buck from the Meguiar's.",
