      "title": "Perfect for kids",
      "text": "Good size and shape for kids. Seems pretty adaptable to a wide range of weights, the bindings are the limiting factor on how large of shoes will fit them. The only downside for long term use is that the rails are made of plastic and after some use on rocks get dulled down pretty easily. The front gripper is steel and holds up better, but is not articulated as on most snowshoes and seems to clog up with snow and weigh the foot down. Fully functional and kids love them!",

They are easy to put on, relatively lightweight, and narrow enough that she doesn't trip. She loves going on adventures in the snow. She's very strong and fit, but we definitely have to make our trips shorter...about 2-3 miles seems to be her max right now. But it's so fun that she can snowshoe on her own now, and she'll get years of use! We looooove MSR!!!!",
