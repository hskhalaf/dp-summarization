I am pro trained in Paul Mitchell as well (have my cosmetology schooling from them), and really didn\u2019t have high hopes for this being legit, but it\u2019s the real deal! It\u2019s not any cheaper on here though, so if you can get it from your cosmetologist, do it. I was in a bit of a pinch, and thought I\u2019d give this a try. The original awapuhi is a great classic product in PM, and is a very basic, somewhat gentle sulfate shampoo. This is NOT the black awapuhi sulfate free Paul Mitchell shampoo!! It\u2019s their classic awapuhi shampoo.",

After your hair is dried, that feeling goes away and It doesn't leave your hair dry or tangly. As a woman of color with natural hair, it is hard to find a shampoo that works well for me without destroying my hair or scalp in the process but this one works perfectly! I wish I tried it sooner.",

It also pulls color like crazy, so probably not ideal for those of us with party colored hair. The smell is meh, but at least it isn't strong, so that's a pro in my book. I don't think this works any better than anything you buy in the drug store.",

How can it go from my favorite scent to something so horrible? Either they changed the formula or it's not official? I don't know. Things always change. :-(",

Having it dry your hair a bit leaves it nice for the second day, and I follow it with a dab of the original conditioner by PM as well. My tried and true shampoo. Come back to stores please :(",
