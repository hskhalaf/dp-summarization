It does keep the bug out for the most part, and our dog has no problem going out, but THERE AREN'T ENOUGH MAGNETS. The middle doesn't seal very well. When our dog goes in and out, there is often a large gap in the middle because the there aren't enough magnets to force it closed. Also, the bar on the top doesn't stay very well. You have to constantly re-tighten it to ensure it doesn't fall down, which it will...several times a week. Honestly, wasn't pleased at all with the quality.",

Clean the frame of the door before installing. Install the top bar first and make sure you the screen fits properly before you peel the velcro attachments.",

Thus, we never got to test whether or not it would actually keep a BUG OFF. Perhaps if you replaced that rod with a regular curtain rod from JC Penny, that would work better, but then why pay more for a lesser product from Bug Off?

My only issue is that I asked them to replace one of the velco attachments that was defective when it arrived. They never responded (perhaps they didn't receive), and I never received a replacement. We ordered from them multiple times in the past, so disappointed that they did not send a replacement velco piece. Other than that, it's a good buy. Keeps out the bugs and allows my cats to go in and out of the house into the fenced-in yard without the bug issue.",

Used it only for the day for a party we were having. The side Velcro tabs also were useful but only exposed a third of the adhesive as to remove at the end of the day. Reapplied the plastic to cover adhesive. Well made and look for it to be around for many years. No complaints, good design and worth the cost.",

We never had any luck with the sides sticking to the door jam for any length of time, so we don't bother. We also have bought a size that covers the whole door jam, and come and go by going through the side flap verses going through the magnet slit in the middle. The larger screen has done a better job in keeping bugs out, and has made it easier to open and close.",

The tension rod slips a bit with usage, but the overall, this is perfect for our needs. It's an excellent alternative to purchasing an expensive screen door.",

The screens are super easy to install and go up in minutes. We had a large group at The Lodge and the guests were able to stay comfortable, keep the doors open and the insects OUT! Thank you - I will definitely recommend Bug Off screens to others and am going to purchase another set for our primary residence at the coast.",
