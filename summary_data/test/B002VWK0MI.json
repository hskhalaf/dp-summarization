The only criticism is that the rubberized coating on the cuffs is too thin and has already started to split on the edges after only a little more than a week but overal the crutches hold up well. I would recommend these crutches to anyone searching for an affordable yet durable pair of crutches.",

Being 350 lbs I figured bariactric forearm crutches would be a good starting point to get walking again. Had to return them because I couldn't get my arms through the cuffs far enough to reach the handle grips. I thought since they were bariatric and support up to 500 lbs. the cuffs would be bigger due to the weight they supported but not the case. Still love drive products just not this one.",
