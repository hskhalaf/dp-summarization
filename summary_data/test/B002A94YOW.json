Yelling their name is pointless, clickers are a joke ... and especially if your greyhound/whippet/longdog etc gets away from you unexpectedly, they are at full speed in 3 bounds or so, putting them blocks away and in serious trouble in seconds. I can't say this whistle -- WITH TRAINING -- will break through, but it is a damn sight better than hollering. My dog at least looks up and seems to be associating the sound with me (and treats), so it appears to be working great.",
