Amazon offered a return so we purchased another. The second one was the correct model, but the bulb began to flicker within a few hours of operation. We have arranged to return the second one once the first one is back at Amazon and the refund confirmed. We have already installed the infrastructure for this model and we like the image....but do we try it a third time? Not sure yet.",

Otherwise, zero complaints. -- A Note on Zoom -- Be aware that the zoom-in / zoom-out is very limited and your projected image size is determined mostly by distance from the screen, so be sure you read the product details and measure your space.",

My gut had told me to go with the ViewSonic since they have a very good reputation with computer displays etc. I ordered the ViewSonic PA503X as a replacement although it was about $100 more expensive.

The projector only had vertical keystone adjustments which didn\u2019t help. I ended up trying to use coasters and folded paper under the projector legs to try to level it which helped a little but since this was going to primarily be stationed on a table, it didn\u2019t look right. The projector should come with more adjustable legs \u2014- it only came with an adjustable front one. 2) No lense cap I returned this and will try the Epson VS250.",

I bought it on sale for $300 and find it a great bargain for the price I paid. Even in a well-lit room, the projection quality is great. I used HDMI cable to connect the device to my laptop. Worked like a charm. The one thing that would make it better would be a remote that would work for transitioning from slide to slide while using PowerPoint. Highly recommend the ViewSonic 3600 Lumens. Projector.",

My only complaint is that there isn't any good way to level the thing. There's a way to raise and lower the front, but the feet don't adjust, so if your stand isn't level, your picture will be tilted.",

Indeed, the image resolution for SVGA is 800*600. So I returned the SVGA and bought the WXGA version, whose resolution is 1280*800 and the number of pixels is twice of the SVGA version. Using the WXGA, the projected image is much sharper. I really like this product, and it is perfect for presentation, movie and online learning.",

This unit is not idea for movies or video games in a large room, but you would have to pay much, much more to get better resolution. For presentations and classroom lectures, this unit does the job. I am very happy and satisfied.",

I would have liked it to have a greater ability to change the size of the image- there is very little difference between the maximum size and the minimum size so the only way to increase or decrease the image size is by moving the projector. I often present in brightly-lit rooms and it has enough power to give a good image even then.",
