It is sturdy, well engineered and goes together easily. I have used portable leaf blower/mulchers in the past and they clog up easily and then you have to empty the bag into a lawn bag which is a hassle. From the attached photo you can see that a 39 gallon lawn bag easily attaches to the stand and when you drop leaves into the top of the WORX WG-430, the mulched leaves drop right into the lawn bag saving much work. I highly recommend the WORX WG-430.",

What I did was- I replaced the line that came with it with higher quality twister trimmer line from Home Depot (I did not bore the holes bigger like some reviews- I just used yellow twist line that was the same diameter). Now small sticks do not break the line like before. This will also work with wet leaves. The upside is that it makes less 'dust' floating into the air when you trim. The downside is that it gets clogged more often, and you have to stop and clear it out more. Do not use this machine without googles. Things fly out of it.",

Like many people I bought thicker line and modified mine to accept it. Second, it\u2019s a perfectly awkward height for the paper lawn bags from your local big box retailer. Third, it\u2019s easy enough to assemble but the legs feel quite cheap. I managed to somehow get one of my legs permanently jammed in there. But then there\u2019s the good side - when this thing is working and you\u2019re feeding it almost exclusively leaves you\u2019ll end up with a fine mulch that will quickly compost or is easily usable around the yard.",

As someone else remarked, you must carefully sort out any small ( even tiny) twigs from your leaves which is way too time consuming for me. The strings kept breaking or wore down very quickly. The machine is also very high which wouldn't be a deal breaker but it sure is a back-breaker after several loads. I don't know if I could recommend this or not because it seems to be one of those items that pleases just as many as it disappoints. I returned mine after using it one time for about 20 minutes.",

I have had to replace the twine a few times over the period of using this a few hours use. The twine is inexpensive enough that I'm not worrying about this. This is somewhat loud, but not as loud as I thought it would be. Wear ear protection still.",

I didn\u2019t need to replace the line this season but the process looks very simple and based on my experience so far I\u2019d say they provided enough replacement line to last for many years.",

The product basically uses the same cord you would find on a weed wacker and they wear out way too quickly. I spent way too much of my time replacing the cords.

Thankfully, with the electric WORX Leaf Mulcher, you can put the 'green' back in 'green thumb'.Showcasing a powerful 13 Amp motor that delivers 8,500 RPMs, the WORX Leaf Mulcher will reduce a mass of dead leaves and twigs to 1/11th of its original size. That means you won't be lugging 11 bags of whole leaves to the curb for distribution or disposal--instead, you'll only have to worry about a single bag.\n\nWith the WORX Leaf Mulcher's 13-inch cut diameter and oversized mouth, you can mulch up to 53 gallons of leaves per minute. Acres of dried leaves can be collected and pulverized into manageable mounds of mulch in practically no time at all.\n\nCreate Mulch and Compost\nIt is estimated that almost 25% of the urban waste stream is made of yard waste and debris. In the fall, it can account for more than 60% of what flows into your local landfill.\n\nThe WORX Leaf Mulcher actually transforms your yard's dead leaves and debris, which would normally end up in a landfill, into vitamin-rich mulch and compost that can be recycled into your garden or flowerbeds.\n\nShredded leaf mass furnishes nutrients that assist in new plant growth during the growing season. Furthermore, mixing mulch into your garden and flower beds will aerate the soil and encourage new growth. Additionally, leaf mulch will increase water retention in the soil, reducing watering time and saving money.\n\nCompact, Versatile, and Easy to Use\nAt less than 20 pounds, the WORX Leaf Mulcher features a compact design, in which the disassembled parts nest neatly together for convenient off-season storage on a shelf in your shed or garage. Setup takes only a few minutes, with absolutely no additional tools required!\n\nIn addition, the mulcher features a dust-reducing clean-air motor cooling system. Air and mulched leaves are separated through an external cooling air intake and exhaust to significantly reduce dust generation.\n\nFor further convenience, The WORX Leaf Mulcher's safe Flex-a-Line bladeless mulching system features tool-less cutting line replacement and a universal bag holder that accepts both paper and plastic bags. To top it off, an oversized on/off switch allows for easy, hassle-free operation.\n\nThe WORX heavy-duty Leaf Mulcher is the one machine that will end hours of misery once and for all and will make fall cleanup fast and easy!\n\nWhat's in the Box\nWORX WG430 Leaf Mulcher, 24 replacement lines, and one universal bag holder.\n\n\n\n\nTool-free locking system enables easy assembly and storage.\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe new Worx leaf mulcher makes collecting leaves easier, quicker and leaves your yard tidier.
