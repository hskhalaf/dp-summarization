    "description": "Style:In-Ground Fence KitThe Free Spirit In-Ground Fence allows you to customize a yard boundary for your pet. A radio signal travels from the transmitter through a buried wire, marking the boundaries you wish to set for your dog. Your dog wears a collar that detects the signal in the buried wire. As your dog approaches the boundary wire, the collar will beep and vibrate when entering the warning zone. If he proceeds further, he receives a harmless but unpleasant shock to contain him in the area that you have established. The Free Spirit In-Ground Fence can be used with pets over 5 lb.",
