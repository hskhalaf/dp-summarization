Typically, the blade wears down and the rubber wears off the wheel after about 5 years. I've been looking for a heavier duty model, but have not been able to find one.

Well for over 30 hours, we used it for over 100 meters of paver edging that hadn't been done for years at our new property by the previous owner. It performed outstanding in all ways and cleaned well. Now we are on our second round of usage and it continues to perform 5 stars as if it's a brand new item. Thanks for a great product.",

The manual edger takes a little getting used to, but once you realize it can do the job and relax a bit, it works great.

Also, it might be tough on your back, but I found it best to grip down low as the handle wants to twist in the thick stuff.

With the gas trimmer it is easier to mistakingly remove grass that you did not want to remove and there was more clean-up. It is faster than the gas trimmer and more efficient. I also enjoy the little exercise I get but not hard. The first time you may work up a good sweat but after that it is MUCH faster. By your third time using it, you will indeed appreciate why you bought it. I highly recommend that you wash it after every use and spray it with WD40 or another protectant for years of use.",

I keeps edges looking sharp. Well made, nicely designed. Easy to wield. No complaints. If your edges have gotten very overgrown, as mine had, you will need either a hoe or a half-moon edger to get them unburied. Once unburied and cleaned up, a quick pass with this tool every 2 weeks or so keeps them looking sharp.",

      "text": "I've just started using this edger, and maybe my technique will improve--but so far I'm lukewarm about it. The main issue I note with this tool is that its basic function is not cutting; it's yanking. What happens is that, as you run the edger along the margin of your lawn, tufts of grass get caught between the wheel and the housing, and the tool basically uproots the grass, resulting in a tattered border and requiring frequent breaks to clean out the clogged up, accumulated chunks of turf. Using this edger is faster and less hard on the back and hands than stooping down to use a scissors-like clipping tool, but it's far from pleasant and not especially gratifying aesthetically.",
