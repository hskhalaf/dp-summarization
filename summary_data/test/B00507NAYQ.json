Within a few weeks of receiving the new Targus backpack the fabric around the zipper frayed resulting in two holes. I have never seen anything so poorly made. I am especially disappointed because my last Targus Backpack lasted 11 years!!! AND, you only have a limited time to return for a refund (which I missed). I should have returned this backpack right away - when I first laid eyes on it - knowing that it would 'probably' fall apart. I am attaching photos",

Early October I noticed a rip in the lining, then yesterday noticed that the shoulder strap is starting to tear off. I admit his binder/lunch/water bottle can add up in weight, but no more than what should be expected. Of course I can't return it now, not sure yet if I have any recourse through Amazon. This is last time I will buy Targus, my husband's backpack front zipper ripped and the hardware on the strap snapped. Much better backpacks out there.",

Now the rubber padding the grab handle is splitting. In my opinion, any backpack costing over $50 should last 2-3 years with normal use.

The only thing I miss from my older backpacks was the waist strap, which would not only would hold the backpack closer to my body, but also would transfer some of the weight from my shoulders to my hips, which I preferred. Other than that, it is a great item.",

Despite the measurements seemingly matching up to my 17-inch laptop, it didn't quite fit and so I had to put my laptop in the main compartment rather than the designated lap-top space. After about 3 months of heavy use, the right strap started to fray. Despite this, the backpack has held up for nearly 3 years now, though I take extra care to not further aggravate the strap. Aside from these issues, the straps are pretty comfortable and it has a lot of compartments that have come in handy over the years.",

Recently used this on a flight as one of my carry ons... it held all my 'work' - laptop, cables/charger, magazines, pens and other paper work as well as about 3 days worth of cloths. I had a pair of hiking boots and toiletries in another bag, just didn't want to smash it in. This bag holds a TON, has LOTS of pockets and compartments and the 'shock' absorbing straps work great!

It easily held my 17\" laptop (even while in a neoprene case!) and it was easy to organize all of my travel things so that I could get to them easily. One other thing that I liked about this backpack (better than another one that I bought at the same time) was that when fully loaded (and therefore heavy), I could still easily get it on and off without help. My other backpack had straps placed slightly strangely, so I couldn't get it on quickly in the airport without some help.",

I've just been using it to carry around my laptop and some books, nothing extreme. I received an older version of this same Targus backpack probably back in 2008, and I used that one for about a decade before the wear-and-tear was enough to warrant a new backpack. Because of that, I thought I would just buy the same backpack again, hoping it would last another decade. But apparently Targus makes these backpacks differently now. =(",

Also small compartment is available on the back of the bag. We bought this product during 2015 thanks giving sale. Given 4 stars since pad is not so strong as SwisGear.
