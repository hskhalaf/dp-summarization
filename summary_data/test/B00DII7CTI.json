I found out from the answered questions that some vendors are shipping the older less powerful model. Amazon is aware of the problem now and they will check on it. After inspecting the lantern, I really liked it. Well built and compact but not what was advertised. Amazon was quick to process my returns.",

The top of the lanter does not extend out, almost creating an umbrella, far enough to shield the light from shining straight up into your eyes while you are walking with it. Traditional lanterns have this feature on the top but not this one. 2. The lantern has three brightness modes that you can cycle through, unfortunately the first mode is the brightest so upon turning the lantern on in the dark you again blind yourself rather then starting with the most dim mode first.",

It is also handy having the option of taking the diffuser shade off to use direct light. At the brightest setting, this is able to light up half of a typical car camping lot.

It puts out decent light on its highest setting, and more comfortable lighting at the lower settings. Honestly, there is nothing that I can complain about this light, even the battery usage is very good. You are foolish not to have this light or something like it around the house. A heck of a lot safer than candles. Great price, great product.",

Propane lanterns have a larger hat/umbrella piece at the top so it illuminates the path while not blinding you.

This Lantern has a lots of features. This Lantern is reliable and durable. It is as bright as it promised and the specifications match. There is a lot of misleading lanterns on the market. Lanterns that claim to do battle with the ultimate Darkness but in the end the candle wins. I have bought the smaller version it is just as equally awesome.",

      "text": "Great Lantern! Well built and priced. I really enjoy the options of hanging the lantern depending on your needs. One thing I would recommend to Streamlight is to make it that when you turn the lantern back on, that it turns on to the last setting that you had turned it at when switched off. When you have turned off the lantern, you have to go through the settings (high,medium,low) again. Of course it isn't hard or time consuming to go through the high/medium/low settings but it would be a nice have. I wouldn't be giving it a 5 star rating if it was a big deal.",

I almost wish there were an even lower light setting or a manual brightness adjustment (although I realize this would be very difficult electronically and cost prohibitive for an LED application). We kept both lanterns \"burning\" all night on low and it was more than enough light for our campfire purposes.",
