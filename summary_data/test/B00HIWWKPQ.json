I submitted the required proof for return around 3pm and again received a response in mere minutes assuring me my new pool would arrive soon.

All of the dinosaurs are not hooked together - they are separate from the pool so lots of airing up - total took about 2 hours since we didn't have the right pump.",

The slightest bit of pressure or movement caused the valve to open and it was difficult to get it to stay closed. I called Amazon and was provided with a replacement. Overall this is a nice product but it has some issues. The replacement appears to be okay.",

On day 2, a second leak developed on the same seam. I have attempted to contact Intex with no success. This was a gift from the Easter Bunny a couple of months ago, so we have passed the return window and are now stuck with this really cute, but not so fun pool.",
