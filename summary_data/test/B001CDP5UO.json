The pepper grinder will adjust the overall coarseness of the grind, but any sort of uniformity is sadly lacking. The salt grinder seems to have only one setting, extra fine, regardless of the coarseness of the original. The only reason that I give it more than a one star rating is its stubborn resistance to breaking.",

But I have some issues with the set: a) I use the smallest settings on each. Pepper is fine, but salt is still too coarse for my liking. b) The amount of ground pepper coming out is very small, so you have to crank a lot, whereas ground salt comes out too fast. c) they are plastic in the middle, not glass. One of them was already burnt on the side by my hot griddle. So, be mindful where you leave them.",

Thoughtful design additions are: top v. bottom dispensing (so bits of salt & pepper don't end up on the counter when you set the unit down) and the wide filler port. I couldn't give this product 5 stars because while the grind selector has 5 settings, there's really only fine, medium and coarse grind. Additionally, the price point is a bit steep. Even in light of those 2 things, I still recommend this product.",

The mechanism seems a little loose but can\u2019t tell if that is by design or just poor manufacturing quality. The salt grinder doesn\u2019t seem to have the same problem so more likely a quality problem unless intentionally designed that way. The product had promise but ultimately disappointing.",

      "text": "I really like Oxo products and these are no exception. Their products are easy to use, durable and often implement simple changes that make big improvements. In this case, the salt and pepper are stored with the mill facing up so you don't leave a mess when you set them down. I've had them for four years and they're still going strong. They're not too big and bulky, but they hold a lot of contents. They're also great for someone with arthritis since the grinders are big and easy to turn. Highly recommended.",

They're the perfect size--not so big that you feel like you're hefting a baseball bat, but large enough that you're not constantly refilling. It is so easy to adjust from fine to course with just a flick of the ring at the top. The grinder works well, producing lots of pepper and salt with just a small turn. They are A+ in the attractiveness department. I think I just found my new favorite shower gift!",

      "text": "We were searching for a new pepper grinder and ended up purchasing this set even though a salt grinder was something we really weren't interested in. The mechanisms on both the pepper and salt grind smoothly, easily and with moderate resistance. The grind can be adjusted from coarse to very fine. We keep ours somewhere in the middle. We're very satisfied with the pepper grinder. The salt grinder is a plus. Glad we ordered this set.",

I was tired of having pepper grinders that I had to stand there and twist for like 5 minutes to get the amount of pepper I wanted. These are pretty pricy but totally worth it! I get all the pepper I need with ease, and you can choose how coarse it is. I was about to attach my pepper grinder to a hand drill before I found these! Wouldn't cook without them now.",

They can be switched quickly and easy. They twist from the bottom so they won't leave around a residue. The one issue I had is someone accidentally twisted in the wrong direction and the bottom came off spilling the peppercorns. But that does mean refilling them is quite easy.",

Adjustment works very good but not exactly a consistent grind, you get larger and smaller particles on each setting. Best part is the fact that you have to turn them over to grind/dispense and the feel of the rubbery grip is great for holding on. Still, overall seem fairly well made and would buy again but only at sale price. Time wil tell on longevity.",

I purchased a pair for my mom as well and she already wants a few others! HIGHLY recommend!",

Well, actually it didn't work unless you shook it and then operated the grinding wheel by turning it about a half turn clockwise and then back, really fast. About two weeks ago, it stopped working altogether. Took it apart, cleaned it, tried again. No luck. Only bought the set on Feb 4 of last year, so I wouldn't recommend this at all.",

Only warning I have is that the Salt mill can produce a lot of salt rather quickly, so there is no need to turn it like you would the pepper grinder, unless you like a lot of salt. Once you have used it once or twice you get the feel of how much you need to turn to produce the salt you want.",
