This one I noticed the pole \u2018rocks/wiggles\u2019. I thought it might be the bolts at the bottom, so I checked it all. Upon closer inspection it is the pole itself. Where it is welded Together. That is loose and there is no way for me to fix that. I had purchased this for my classroom as well, so I didn\u2019t Open it & notice it until now, and it\u2019s pass the return window.",

I couldn't get 2 bends into it, and it was downright difficult to bend at all, defeating the whole purpose of a stand to hold up a tablet for someone who is too sick and weak to hold one up, much less manhandle the stand itself into position every time. Also, while seeming very heavy duty, a toddler nearly knocked it over several times. I think it'd probably be fine for people who are healthy, strong, and less erratic, but it just isn't a good fit here.",

Pros: pretty sturdy; iPad fit nicely with the case after adhering foam disc; wheel locking mechanism some to use with my foot, others I've used are very stiff. After adjusting the height stand feels secure. Main Con: Unstable. The top bar of the \"x\", where the wheels are attached, end up being higher so the stand teeters. All the wheels are the same and no height adjustment, so no way for the stand to stabilize. Other cons: screws for the wheels didn't feel completely secure. Had to tighten a few times after testing mobility (Wheeling around).",
