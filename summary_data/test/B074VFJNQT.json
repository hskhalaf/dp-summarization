I am super picky when it comes to my brows and ABH is the only eyebrow product that has ever really impressed me until now. I was looking for something that would have a little more of a permanent effect and this did not disappoint! It really does stay on ALL day with no smudging! This is definitely by far the best drug store eyebrow product!\u2764\ufe0f (Purchased in the color soft brown)",

I still do use my other eyebrow powder to shape my eyebrows but at least with the tattoo gel I have filled in brows the entire day. I love this stuff and will continue to use it.",

It does wash off easily with soap/water, so I'm not sure the relevance of \"lasting up to 2 days\" unless you don't wash your face.
