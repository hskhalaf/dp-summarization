      "text": "The Nikon D3300 is a FANTASTIC camera for anyone looking to make the jump from point and shoot to DSLR photography. It has the best image quality of any camera in its class, and even better than than some that are hundreds of dollars higher. It's 24.2MP APS-C sensor and EXPEED4 Image Processor are the same those found in the more expensive Nikon D5500 and D7200 series cameras. So what makes those cameras more expensive, you ask? Features. The more expensive units have things like more auto focus points, more dials etc. If you want to take great looking photos, look no further than the D3300.",

Low-light photography, ISO, and MP resolution (basically doubled) are greatly enhanced. Feels noticeably lighter than D60 which is nice, but has the classic feel and shape of the earlier D models. All my Nikon lenses which worked on the D60 also work on the D3300.",

These cameras take excellent pictures with Sigma, Tamron and Nikon lenses so you can pick a lens the size and price that fits your desire.",
