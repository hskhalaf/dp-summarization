To do this I needed to make straight holes and I needed enough power to get through the alloy. I put the belt on the second to highest torque setting, which would mean the second to slowest speed and the press worked great. Everything on this press is rough. It's not a work of art, but it is strong, relatively light and it will make holes. If that's all you need then look no further. When I use this press I clamp it to my work bench, then put it under for storage. A larger press would make moving it much more difficult.",

There's no adjustable stop on the handle, so repeated holes to a specified depth means screwing around trying to nudge the table up and down before re-tightening it and hoping it didn't move a millimeter. The depth of travel is pretty limiting. All that said... It's quiet. It drills straight. If you only use one occasionally, or have more time than money, this is the one for you. It does what a drill press does adequately and most importantly CHEAPLY. If you're a woodworker who uses one daily, you'll go insane fiddling with the table constantly.",

There is some runout but it\u2019s negligible and completely expected for the price. Belt changes are simple, but the belt is low quality. It may work itself in a bit, but it does seem to slip easily even with proper tension. Overall this drill press is a good value for a hobbyist or homeowner.",

Works well, reasonably quiet and accurate enough for my small garage shop. The belts/gears came in the loose position, as if I were going to adjust them to a different speed, but I was able to easily tighten them up for use. I think this may be the cause for some of the rattling that was reported in other reviews since this was not noted in the build instructions. Very happy with the purchase.",

At the end of the day, your intended use will dictate your experience with this machine, if you are drilling thin, soft metals, or wood, you should be fine, but I would not recommend this machine, if you are attempting any sort of steel fabrication, spend a few bucks more to get a drill with more power.",
