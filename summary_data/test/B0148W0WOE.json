      "text": "This product is amazing. I noticed some small roaches behind my tv on my kitchen counter and have always used boric acid. It worked so so and there would always be white powder around. Advion works so well and fast. It is super easy to use and I was able to put it in places that my cats can't get to. After 3 days of seeing roaches coming out in the day barely moving, It took three days and voila all gone, REALLY!! Hard to believe any product works so well, but this one does. It's been 2 months and still NO ROACHES!!!",

I placed the product several places in cabinet's and along counter top walls and used an index card to put it on to slide under fridge and stove. When I woke the next morning there were dying and dead german roaches scattered all over the kitchen floor. I was surprised at the number of them. I am no longer seeing any roaches in my kitchen. I only had to use about half of one tube. Thank God I found this product. Money well spent!!!!",
