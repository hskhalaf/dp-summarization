      "title": "This Cat Keep My Home Up and Running",
      "text": "I purchased this item for this coming Hurricane season. I live in Palm Coast, FL and we just had Irma come though last week. Was without power for 5 days. This Cat ran fridge, TV, small AC unit, coffee maker, and some lights. It started on the first pull and never let me down. Was getting a little over 12 hours of run time before I would have to refuel. I could not be happier with the way it ran. Had to change oil on a few occasions which only took 10 min. If your looking for a small generator that will keep items running with the power being out you can't go wrong with this CAT RP3600.",

      "text": "Bought this a year ago, sat in the box in my garage for over a year. Finally opened it up last month and was pleasantly surprised. It maneuvers better then any generator I've used before. Balance is good and the ability to fold the handle down makes it great for storage and transporting. Starting the unit is surprisingly easy. My chain saw is harder to start then this. All controls are on the front and easy to access. Used the RV receiver 30amp with an adapter and used a inverter welder (110v) fabricated drill pipe fencing. Worked GREAT. Be sure to use non ethanol fuel and this generator won't let you down.",

I could probably but a few more things on this unit, but those are the essentials. It wasn't really all that loud either. I think my neighbor's lawnmower is louder. It's not a quiet inverter generator to be sure, but it has way more power for much less money. I bought this unit as backup power for my home after a hurricane. You can run regular 87 octane gasoline that is 10% or less ethanol.",

It was also very easy to use and I liked the amount of outlets it had. I am planning on purchasing one for our family.",
