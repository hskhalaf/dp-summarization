      "text": "Good and accurate level. Magnets are strong. I use it for conduit bending for apprenticeship class. No complaints. Update: 8/20/17 So while in the bending shop using the Chicago bender I discovered that the 45 deg vial had leaked. Huge bummer since I only had the level a few months. Eventually I took it to Home Depot and told them I paid in cash and had no receipt, they swapped it out for me. I'm hoping I don't continue to have this problem or I'll be looking for a new level. I heard milwaukee makes theirs in the US.",
