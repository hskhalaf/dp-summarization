      "verdict": "The Shadow 6000 from Saucony is a robust running shoe that offers a lot of service to runners who need stability, comfort and durable protection. It is a daily shoe that athletes can use for mid-tempo trainings. Given all the positive praised from users, the Shadow 6000 is indeed an above-average running partner.",
      "pros": [
        "A suede upper with leather overlays improved the overall durability of the material while giving off a distinctly cool look, according to a large number of runners",
        "Most reviewers appreciated the padded collar and tongue, which enhanced the comfort of the skin and generally offered a snug fit",
        "The Ethylene vinyl acetate mid-sole is a reliable mid-sole material that gives responsive underfoot cushioning and springiness with each step",
        "The Triangular Lugs on the outsole unit lets the Shadow 6000 take hold of dry and wet surfaces",
        "This running shoe has an affordable price"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "There were runners who felt that the Shadow 600 needed a waterproofing mechanic to fully provide a seamless experience during all types of weather conditions",
        "Some reviewers noted that it looked too bulky and that it felt too stiff",
        "Its weight is heavy",
        "Others felt that it was a bit tight in the forefoot area"

      "text": "Hard sole. Definitely not the original, but then we know that. It\u2019s just that I was expecting a little better cushioning effect. There is almost no give in these. Still, all is not bad. They look like the original so that\u2019s nice. The other thing not so good is the stiffness of the sides. Not sure how to describe that, but it\u2019s like you\u2019re slipping your foot into a cardboard box instead of a nice comfy shoe. Once the shoe is on it is okay, but I have definitely worn more comfortable sneakers. Had I tried this on in a store I would not have bought them.",
