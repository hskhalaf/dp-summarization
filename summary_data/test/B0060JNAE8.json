      "text": "I'm not an expert on olive oil, and I wasn't having much success finding an EVOO that I liked...until now. I tried a lot of big brand names and I couldn't find one that had the flavor I was looking for. Even the highly regarded domestic oil didn't impress me. I wanted a great oil for dressings and dipping. From the first taste I realized Zoe's a high quality oil. It's robust and delicious. There are all kind of notes people attribute to it such as, \"fruity\", \"peppery\", sure, it has all that. I just know that when I dipped a piece of bread in it I couldn't stop eating it. I found what I was looking for.",

If you are used to an olive oil that is very buttery or nutty or mild then the slight bitterness and bite this oil has might turn you off but I love its flavor profile and so did everyone I know who has tried it. It\u2019s nice to have a variety of different olive oils that you can go to for different flavors and this one is definitely going into my arsenal. Also, this is a great price for this quality of oil.",

The packaging is perfect, cool designed, easy to store, and recyclable. My only problem with it is the price. I wish it was comparable to the prices that I pay in Spain. However, as an ex-pat and a person that loves cooking and loves good olive oil, I would definitely recommend this high-quality product.",

Personally assuming customers wouldn\u2019t notice is quite insulting to me. Frankly I believe it\u2019s a scam that the manufacturer probably thinks people won\u2019t mind or notice.

It is not possible to pour a small amount of oil without it running onto the edge of the can. It makes a mess and is wasteful. I wish the oil came with a better pouring spout.",

Although it is a good olive oil, the peppery nature of this olive oil keeps bringing us back.",
