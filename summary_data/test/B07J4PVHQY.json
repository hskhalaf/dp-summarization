She could probably still wiggle out with serious effort, but it's the best I've tried yet.

He thinks he owns the neighbor when I take him for a walk. This harness works perfectly for him. There is no chance he can wiggle out of it ( well I am pretty sure:) )It is lightweight, so it is perfect for use in the summer. It is well made and has a double hook for the leash, which makes it very secure. I purchased a small for him and he weights about 10 lbs. I highly recommend this harness, and I plan on buying it in more colors.",

A light pull from the front and it slips right off the dog. In fairness, my dog has an 18\" chest but she's also very skinny at 13lbs. Will try the next size down. UPDATE: The small fits much better, but still enough room to fit it over a coat. Bottom line, these appear to run rather large. Subtract 2\" from your dog's chest measurement and order the corresponding size.",

      "text": "This product was unfortunately smaller than expected. We bought a small as this was the size requirements stated for our size dog. He's a corgi Miniature Australian Shepard mix and no more than 13 lbs. He's a very small dog and we were expecting this to fit him well. The small size harness is more likely fit for the size for a medium sized cat (less than 8 lbs). This was my biggest gripe. The material seems fine enough for the price, no loose stitching so may be something that lasts a while, especially if you're training your dog not to tug on the leash. I wouldn't not buy it again, but I wish the sizes were more accurate.",

The only shortcoming is that the harness isn't adjustable (see photo of the harness from the back). Dogs grow and their harnesses need to grow with them. Flossie measures 18\" around her chest, 11.5\" around her neck. The Medium size (16-18\")fits her perfectly, but snugly. I'm sure the next size would be too big. So if your dog is full-grown, this is a perfect harness -- and a good incentive for them not to gain weight!",

The leash trailing is good to keep him semi-close while he explores. However, he has learned to slip the harness over his head to escape! But, he can only do that when the leash is resisting. If the leash is loose, he tries to 'back out' of it but he is unable without the leash restraint.",
