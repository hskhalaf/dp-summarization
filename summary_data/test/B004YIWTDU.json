(It said it is for seafood and nuts). I'll try it for seafood, but I'll have to but another nutcracker for nuts only. That's what I get for trying to buy something for dual usage.",

If I were inclined to get another one I'd look into the possibility of taking the latch off before using. The latch is a flimsy plastic piece so bring along a rubber band to hold the shears close in case the latch breaks anyway no matter what you do.",
