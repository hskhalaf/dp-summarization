Obviously being female I took 1 item at a time and my new friend did great. Although I wish the hand extension was longer it was sturdy enough to help me get it done. It folds up super compact for storage which is an added bonus.",

I have only used it once but I am thus far pleased with it. It folded up nicely after use. It claims to be able to carry 150 pounds but I wouldn't ever carry that much weight on it. Just with transporting a case of drinking water (24 bottles) the handle seemed to give a bit and seemed stressed. It will serve my purposes since I don't ever plan on transporting anything heavier than one or two cases of water and other smaller items. It is a great hand truck providing you understand its limitations.",
