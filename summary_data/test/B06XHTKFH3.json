Limited to Chrome browser...which is fine for me as I primarily use Chrome...but I can see how this can become an issue for other users who do not use Chrome",

Just about the only thing I can critique is the choice of materials for the dongle itself. The part of the device with the keyring is indeed made from aluminum, but the dongle itself (including the piece that plugs into the USB port) is made from plastic. This is unlikely to pose an issue, but it certainly seems strange to me.",

At my college, I can\u2019t get cell signal to receive my security code while in the classroom to login, had to go outside to receive the code, come back in the classroom to complete the login process. So glad I got the Thetis key, I heard it is more secure than receive the code by text and don\u2019t have to worry about cell signal. Another big plus, I get a free key after registered my first key!! Thank you Thetis :)",

The key doesn't work with Windows Hello due to limitations, but I have used it for Dashlane, Google, Github, and many many more.
