The size and dimensions are all accurate, however, the sides are all a soft fabric with absolutely no firmness and do not maintain their shape or stand up.

They, obviously, aren\u2019t made of the BEST material in the world, but they do exactly what I needed them to. If you are in a similar position to myself, buy them. You\u2019ll be glad you did.",

Space is at a premium and these under the bed organizers are a great idea. At under $8 for a set of two, this deal was almost too good to be true and quality is impressive.

I wanted under the bed storage for a place to store underwear, socks, and pajamas, and was hoping to use these as a functional drawer or something I could pull out like a basket. Because they're so flimsy and not sturdy, they really don't work the way I was lead on to believe. They're bags, nothing more. I don't want these anymore and will probably just leave them in the basement. I wish I could have a refund. :\\",

It's not the prettiest thing ever, but it's hidden inside a closet door and works just fine. My husband's shoes didn't fit very well, so it's mostly my shoes and I reserved the top row for his belts.",
