Grapes went down to a dollar a pound so I bought ten pounds. Sliced them all in half and filled all eight shelves. Set up the temperature and the timer and 22 hours later I had perfect raisins. mason jars full of them. Best tasting I have ever had. The machine was quiet and worked perfectly. The raisins had the same consistency and level of dehydration on each shelf.",

There's a pretty good amount of space in this unit so you can do apples, bananas, tomatoes, and coconuts all at the same time. Next, you can dehydrate pretty much anything, to include meats, safely because it allows much higher temperatures than cheaper units. I strongly recommend the non-stick dehydrator sheets (the generic is the way to go, btw).",

Instead it now appears the motor is out of balance and is effected by the amount of backward air circulating against the fan. Think I will be sending it back.

Load the trays and set the temperature, the Excalibur dries the contents of all trays evenly so everything's done at once. Dehydration concentrates the natural flavor, sweetness, and aromas of your food.

The Excalibur 9-Tray Large Dehydrator provides 15 square feet of drying space making this the biggest and best there is! Ideal for large families, large gardens, craftspeople, and sportsmen. This unit includes flexible polyscreen tray inserts to prevent foods from sticking to trays, 7\" fan, built in on/off switch, adjustable thermostat, and a convenient 26 hour timer. Troubleshoot-fan makes a rubbing noise may be due to shipping, the trays may have been forced into the fan\u2019s protective screen. Take out the trays, and blow on the fan blade to locate where it is rubbing against the screen. You may need to turn the fan on and press gently against the screen and listen where the noise increases. With a pair of needle nose pliers pull the screen away from the fan blade at point of contact. Your Excalibur dehydrator offers you the opportunity to cook at lower drying temperatures which increase the immunity boosting vitamin value in foods and keep it boosted for up to 9 months when stored in an airtight container. So, the next time you are looking for ways to improve your wellness, take on a tortoise mentality and know that low and slow will win the immunity race. Your body will thank you!
