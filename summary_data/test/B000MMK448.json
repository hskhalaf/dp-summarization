However, after using this three times, this doesn\u2019t really cook the brownie with great edges, even though that\u2019s the point. Instead of edges with a bit of density and bite (hopefully you all know what I mean!), the edges on brownies from this pan are the same texture as the rest of the brownie. There is no difference at the edge. Alas, does not really serve its purpose.",

I strongly prefer brownies with chewy edge and this pan does the trick. The aluminum is thick and durable; it looks like this pan will last a while. I also really, really like the handles! If you bake brownies routinely and you enjoy the edges, buy this pan. If you bake brownies once or twice a year and only like the edges, save your money by using a square pan and discarding (or sharing) the edgeless brownies....or make your brownies in multiple loaf pans or in muffin pans.",

It didn't disappoint as she really liked it and complimented it's quality and the cooking results. The one thing she said that would improve it, would be if I could find a lid for it so she could easily transport brownies to people/events. Thus far, I haven't been able to find one. Other than lacking a lid, she thinks it's great.",

The amazing thing about this pan is that you get the best of both worlds with every brownie square. Family members who like edges get edges. Family members who like a soft, moist brownie get a soft, moist brownie. You never have to worry about dry edges to completely bake the inside, nor a liquid middle for perfect edges. Everything just always bakes perfectly. I absolutely love this thing.",
