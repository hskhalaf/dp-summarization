We've then switched to attaching the key to with a magnet but that has been phased out cause now the kids can climb, plus... seriously. So now I have 250$ worth of crap that is no longer capable of performing its only purpose.",

It was secured to the housing with a spot weld on each washer. The welds had no penetration allowing them to break during gentle operation. I had purchased two and returned both. Pictures show the hinge rod in both the broken and original state (second safe).",

The screws on the bottom that hold the bumper foot are so tight they won't fully engage. I feel like this may be a knock-off product.

You can hear it unlock half way across the house on a quiet night. Unless the intruder is seriously impaired, the element of surprise will be lost.

For durability, I am giving it 4 stars because of the battery cover and the location of the battery. I could have been in the foam area since there's plenty of space to hide a 9V battery in there too.",

Mute button is a nice touch. Beeping is quite loud. The ability to use two buttons at once, for the code, extends code options greatly. Disappointed my 9mm Sig P226 tac-ops did not fit. Twenty rnd mag just too much. But the full size S&W M&P 45 ACP squeezed in. Fast and easy access meets all my requirements for this product. Definitely a good buy.",

      "text": "This is an excellent product in my opinion. It does a great job of quickly providing access to a firearm with minimal access requirements. It does come with what some reviewers have judged to be sub-standard hardware, but that is easily remedied with better lag screws. Will it stop a determined thief? No. Will it stop kids and casual searchers? Yes. The complaints about noise are not based on fact from my experience, this safe opens quickly and it's not very loud in my opinion. Having bought and installed it myself I would definitely buy it again, and recommend it to anyone with a pistol that they want to have fast, secure access to.",
