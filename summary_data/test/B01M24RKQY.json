The chair was very narrow and doesn\u2019t have the yoga feature like this chair so we returned it and ordered this Kahuna chair and wow what a difference. This chair is pretty amazing and packed with plenty of features. The foot roller are the only issue we have because of the fact they hurt my feet. This massage chair is hands down best best chair you can buy under 2,500 point blank period! 4.5 out of 5 and a must have.",

Same goes for foot massage, way too intense and no way i can figure out to make lighter. Most times i do not put my legs in the chair, just hurts too much. Too Skinny in the shoulder area for a big guy. Heat works well and back to buttocks massage is good.",
