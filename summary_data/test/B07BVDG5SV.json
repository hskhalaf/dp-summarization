My son\u2019s only 3 years old so doesn\u2019t necessarily do chores but this board is SO much more than just chores. It incorporates good values such as sharing, being polite and admitting when you\u2019re wrong. These are things that also deserve stars so I love how they\u2019re incorporated into this product. Not to mention, my son will do just about anything for a blue star. So it\u2019s definitely working!! I personally love how everything is magnetic. I also love the tiny pouch for the stars. Great system here. I HIGHLY recommend for any family.",

It\u2019s only Monday, but it\u2019s already motivated my kids to help when they usually would give me attitude. I have it on the fridge so can add more goals than fit on the board for my oldest. Since everything is magnetic it will works great! Also love the white board marker holder, and the magnetic pouch to store all the stars and goals. Fantastic product!",

She also likes that everting is magnetic so she can easily move items around and add them on her own. She enjoys looking through the chores and figuring out which ones she has personally done and which ones she plans on doing in the future. Also I love that it\u2019s magnetic, we attached it to her art easel as well so she can easily add stars. Using the marker you can also write in chores that might not be on the list.

I mean I can work with it but I'm just very upset with this product it's not worth the money. The little bag thing they advertise that comes with it is not for the Stars it's for the chores it does not fit all of the stars in it so I had to find a my own container container from that and keep it separate.",

Needless to say some of the stories are hilarious. Overall this board has done a lot for our child and we are very happy with this purchase.",

She loves being good and getting a star to add to the chart. She is also very excited to get a surprise at the end of the week. I love that it has spots for 3 kids because we also have almost 1 year old twin boys, so we will use this with them too. Highly recommend!!",

I love the magnets that come with it but I also love the fact that you can write down something instead, as I did with being good at school. 2 of my children are in IEP classes and they have been calming down at school because they want a their star. I can't say anything bad about it, but I wish they had on with more kids lol, I have 4 ,so 1 more space would be great but I'll buy her a separate one. Thank you \ud83e\udd17",
