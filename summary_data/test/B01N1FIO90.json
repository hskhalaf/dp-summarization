      "text": "Finally had an electrician install this light for us. We put it over our island. I absolutely love it. It puts off more lighting than the single canned light we had before though it casts lots of shadows but I will get used to that. I am using bright white bulbs and not the warm vintage style even though those look prettier IMO. I just like a lot of light especially in the kitchen. Now I want a similar one, just not exactly to put over my kitchen table! If you are going for a rustic look, this is it. BTW, if you have vaulted ceilings, it comes with joints that allow it to hang straight down.",
