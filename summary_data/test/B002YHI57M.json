      "text": "Works great, just make sure you don\u2019t have big rounded toe and heel co structure in your boot. A few of us did some alpine hiking in Colorado in June (snow) and needed these. Two of us had boots with rounded toe and heel rubber. Great for hiking but they don\u2019t match well with these. They kept falling off. We ended up tightening them so hard that my toes of the boot bent up significantly and my foot arched backward. Only then did they stay on. Great product just get some boots that will work well with crampons if you\u2019re really going to depend on them.",

I am rating the product quality here and not my disappointment in the way the product is offered. You can't order these with a choice of bar lengths. If they are too short, you will need to give Black Diamond more money. Simply consider the total cost. They ARE worth it though. EXCELLENT crampon. Totally satisfied with the performance and construction. I learned of this crampon from a friend who highly recommended them. I own other excellent Black Diamond products.",

I'm wearing size 11 shoes so maybe it's a deal of my feet being too big, smaller feet probably have better wrap from the toe cap. I've gotten used to them and still bring them with me as a general mountaineering crampon to wear with my mid-weight hiking boots.",

Since I didn't have Mountaineering boots I was worried how this would work on a regular but sturdy pair of Danner hiking boots. They strapped on nicely without any movement and never loosened on the climb. they are extremely well made and easy to adjust. I would recommend a very sturdy soled hiking boot or better yet mountaineering boot for more technical climbs. Very happy with them and they will accompany me up South Sister very soon!",
