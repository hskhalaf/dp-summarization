Contacted seller who immediately offered a free return lable or I could contact Garmin for in warrenty service. I contacted Garmin and they were super helpful and I had a new power cable and was up and running in less than a week. SUPER SERVICE!",

It also doesn\u2019t show if traffic information is being received. Do the engineers that green light these products even use them? The latest peeve is that I passed my displayed destination, yet the route keeps going in pink. That\u2019s what my photo shows. It lags by about 1000 feet at other times. Now I know why it was \"refurbished\".",

I read other reviews that you have to enter an address and can't search a city or state which aren't true. You just have to learn how to use it. Love how it tells you the delays and sometimes offers go-arounds for backups.",

With this unit, you won't be stuck without directions when you lose a cell signal in the middle of nowhere since a dedicated personal navigation system uses satellites instead of cell towers. Garmin packed this 5 inch GPS system full of goodies, including Garmin Real Directions so the voice helping you out sounds like a friend instead of a robot. Worry less about the fuzz with the built in speed limit indicator and know exactly which lane to be in with Junction View. You can even pair a BC30 wireless backup camera (sold separately) to give you eyes on the back of your head. No road trip is truly complete without the Certified Refurbished Garmin 50LMT Navigation System.",
