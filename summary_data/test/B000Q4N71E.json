It is so tight that I can barely get a knife in. Over and inch and a half. I pull it out to see if I could remove some of the rods, but they do not come out. I cant believe that I didn\u2019t return it when I got it. My sister and my daughter have the same one and theirs are fine, not tight as the one I have.",

We like to collect good knives of different brands, so no traditional knife block really worked. We ordered the wood block and it worked well for us. This is our first stainless block, and we love it! This stores a lot of knives. We like that this one has 2 sections, one for large knives, the other for small. It looks great o the counter, especially with all of our stainless appliances.",
