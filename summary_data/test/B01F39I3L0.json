The materials seem to be high quality and the box looks just like in the pictures. I made a video for you to see how easy the parts get together and added some photos of details. It comes in a cloth bag which makes it perfect for gifting. The mirror is real, and the hinges are metallic, making the top stay up with no problem. It is a great product for the price, and I am thinking of getting myself one too!",
