      "text": "This keyboard is the most ergonomic one you can buy, however the wireless capability is so poor that it makes this product unusable. My keyboard had to be within 2 1/2 feet of the computer to work reliably, otherwise it would start missing keystrokes, and as the distance increased it would loose touch altogether. I strongly recommend the wired version of this unit. I returned my wireless version for one. It works very well, and when you get used to the unique shape and position it allows faster and more comfortable typing. The wrist position and the soft wrist rest works for stress-free typing as opposed to conventional keyboards which forces wrist pronation, stress and wrist fatigue.",

No real problem except the viability of the letter on the keys was bad so I glued on a set of big bright yellow labels and it improves the usability. Why isn't it manufactured like this. The labels are OK but add a rough edge to the keys. Also, the current price on Amazon is $489.99. I paid $79.41 in 2013, a reasonable price. What is going on?",

The keyboard is ok, but two problems plague it. The first is that the connection sometimes dies. This can be solved by pulling the USB dongle out, and then plugging it back in. The other is that it sometimes skips key presses. I've read that this is a problem that is systemic. The keys themselves are ok, but not great. It's not super loud when typing on it. Most of the multi-media keys don't work on the Mac, or at least not without the Microsoft software, which I don't have installed.",

The space key might be tough to hit in the beginning, but it will be easy to use after a week or so. The mouse looks pretty ergonomic, too. The problem is... I still can't get used to it and make full use of the ergonomic feature. That is why I give a four star.",

But this second keyboard has been glitchy. It seems to have trouble consistently communicating with the wireless receptor, which I have moved several times closer and closer to the mouse and keyboard. But the mouse occasionally skips, and the keyboard occasionally misses letters, or types multiple letters with a single keystroke. It's super frustrating, and I have been all over the online forums without finding a solution. It wouldn't be a huge deal except this isn't a $100 keyboard, it's a $400 keyboard.",

The mouse is slightly tilted to the right and has never caused me any pain unlike other mice I have used. (I don't know if there is a left-hand version.) I have two of these units; one at the office and one at home. I would buy this desktop again if I needed a 3rd one.",
