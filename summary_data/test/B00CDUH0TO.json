Once inflated, the bag takes on the perfect teardrop shape ( pear shape?)---The needle insertion point is more defined than any of the other (Chinese made) bags that I own. This one sets the standard. Made in USA??? Not sure yet.",

Start with the sizes, Peanut, Small, Medium, and Large, - no having to pick which one because what you want is not available in your size - the Balazs Lazer Bags are available in all sizes - no nonsense. The connection is - Kevlar !!, double layered, perfectly centered, triple stitched Loop! No shortcuts here to throw the balance off. On the bag itself - the highest quality hand selected Smooth Grained Leather is all we ever use - smooth on your hands, but not slippery. The Fill Valve is perfectly centered and mounted to its own perfectly symmetrical leather panel !! - for perfect balance - no fill valves conveniently stuck in a piece of side panel here - this bag will not wobble. Check out the Lazer Shape - it\u2019s perfect and symmetrical - no short necks, then long necks, one looking like a water drip and the next looking like an upside-down carnival balloon. The Balazs Lazer Bag is perfection at it\u2019s best - with no equal. There are No Laces to throw a bag out of balance - but if your bag blows a bladder, you gotta have laces to service it right? The Balazs Lazer Bags have no laces because we want perfect balance, and the Air Chamber never pops and never needs to be replaced. You\u2019ll Add Air to it, but it will not pop. One other thing - No Welting to throw off the balance - no welting to rough up your hands. Others add welting because they have to stitch the long panels to the short panels somehow. The Balazs Lazer Bag is designed with all separate Panels of the exact same size for perfect balance, and we die-stamp them for consistency - panel to panel to panel to panel - they\u2019ll all be the same.",
