I do follow up with another, very gentle face wash afterwards. I have used Moringa and Heimish and they do nothing compared to this. I had a ton of makeup (makeover) on last night and this took all of it right off! I can't imagine I'll bother buying any other oil cleanser. Also, a little goes a long way.",

Ive been using a few months now and no breakouts or changes in my skin. Just easy as heck cleaning power. Highly recommend!",
