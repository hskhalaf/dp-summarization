I confirmed with the manufacturer that ALL of their items have a logo and they are sending me genuine replacements. So thank you Resqme for excellent customer service and boo to \"Pop's General Shoppe\" for pedaling fakes that could have jeopardized my and my family's safety.",

A couple of weeks I noticed the tool was rattling around so I detached it for a closer inspection. The spring mechanism had failed and the spring was just rattling around loose inside. I reached out to the company two weeks ago to make a warranty claim but I have not heard a response. TLDR Negative review for product failure. Reliability is the single most important thing with a tool like this. Negative review for poor (non-existent) customer support/service.",

I have been a full time paramedic for over 18 years and I can say with certainty that without the ability to secure the window punch/cutter to a fixed location such as the ignition key, one's chances of locating it in a timely manner during an emergency is almost zero. Save your money and buy something that can be easily located and used in a timely fashion.",

The ability to have a glass punch & rescue cutter on your person for such a low price, low weight, and low size considering that it can save not only your life but someone else's justifies buying several.

They are pretty small, definitely fit onto a key chain and no sharp or excessively pointy parts. The detachable clip is strong and quite secure. The tool should not ever come lose unless you want it to. Cut seat belts at an angle. Pop side windows and do so in a corner of the window. Check out videos online of how to use this product. Should you get into a wreck and if you can reach this tool it should definitely help you out.",

Ease of use is paramount in emergency equipment like this. I would recommend a punch type versus a hammer type window breaker.",

There is one caveat, when you test the glass breaking feature, use a glove or towel between your thumb and tool. The action is quite powerful and stings the thumb a bit, a bit like a bee sting. Definitely don't want kids to get a hold of these, but then again the action is quite stiff so they will probably not be able to make it work correctly.",
