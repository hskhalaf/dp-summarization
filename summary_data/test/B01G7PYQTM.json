Importing is quick and easy, do it right from the Promethease website (links to 23andMe directly and grabs your data. dna.land requires you to upload data yourself). Just be sure to download a copy of the final results to your computer for future reference (as Promethease will automatically delete information from their servers after 4 months). DNA.LAND is free (it's a research project) well worth the extra effort and produces some more interesting results.",

While my results between the two companies were very similar, my 23&me report was much more detailed. For example, both companies told me my DNA had a large percent of Irish, Scottish, and British, but 23&me was able to pinpoint specific regions where my ancestors lived. Not only was this company quicker, with my results, it was more comprehensive. For this reason, I would recommend 23&me first.",
