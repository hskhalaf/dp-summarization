      "text": "I bought this in late 2016 and it lasted until now. After having several iPhones, I took the plunge to get an Android phone. It was great at first, sleek and fast. The camera quality was astounding. However, this didn\u2019t last long. I found it increasingly difficult to take a photo or video without the app crashing down and not saving what I recorded. The past few months, the phone\u2019s hardware itself started freezing and breaking down on me. Disappointing as other than the aforementioned annoying problems, the other apps worked fine and I liked the touch button on the side of the phone.",

I spend half a grand on this phone at the time and it gave the poorest performance. For over half a year the home/apps/control button do not work, then the phone freezes way too quick due to overheat - I cannot use 2 apps with GPS, that is, if I run with Strava, then I cannot play pokemon. Oh, it does not have access to my SD card, although you can see the SD card is installed.",
