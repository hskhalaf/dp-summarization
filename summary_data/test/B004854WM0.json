I just recommend you discontinue this \"model\". I will submit a picture of the differences once I meet up with my sister.",

The fold down so small and flat and can be stored anywhere. And how the clamps work they can be put on any table no matter what size or shape. I've had it on really thick circular tables and it still worked perfectly! Everywhere I go people stop me and ask me who makes it and are amazed by it. I give recommendations for it almost every day. Do yourself a huge favor and get one. It makes going out to eat with a baby so much easier.",
