My only issues with the tent so far are that there are small metal shavings underneath the mattress from drilling the holes and the mattress itself is too hard. Both are easily fixed with a vacuum and a 2\" foam mattress topper. I plan on eventually replacing the mattress with a solid piece of 4\"-5\" foam. The tent is definitely worth it for the price. These issues are just the sacrifice you have to make to save a few hundred dollars. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the cover and the LED strip was very nice to have at camp.",

Other than that, it is super fast to set-up, gets you off the ground, and is very roomy.",
