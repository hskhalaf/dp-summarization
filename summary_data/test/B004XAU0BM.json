Needless to say not happy about this for something with supposed lifetime warranty. Cost to ship back to Oster is equivalent to buying new decent pair if culinary scissors. Would take weeks to get replacement presumably the same junk so just ordered new ones as we use often makes us wonder on the quality of the knives in the set, Won't be considering Oster products in the future",

I also use the steak knives for opening boxes from Amazon (which bothers my wife)! No problems. The swivel base is a little annoying, but not a huge issue. Great quality for the $$!",
