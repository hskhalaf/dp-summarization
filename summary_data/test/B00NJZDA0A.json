      "text": "This thing is a game-changer for my feet pain (plantar fasciitis). I spent about 5 minutes on each foot for a few days in a row and feel a huge difference in the stress on my heel/arch area. The product itself is of a very high quality and I'm glad I splurged a bit over the generic wooden rollers. I got the \"Extra Firm\" and find that it still has a little give in the rubber-material, but enough that it certainly \"hurts in a good way\" while using it. I highly recommend this product.",

As soon as we got them at work and I tried it, I was sold immediately and purchased one for home. My only complaint is that it's impossible to use on hard floors because the part that touches the floor is hard plastic so it slides instead of rolls. It needs a silicone band or something to give it some grip. I added a strip of a nice grippy gaffer tape around this part so we can use it anywhere, not just on a rug or carpet.",

This person iced her feet and used the nano-roller when training. Since I wanted to jog more but was afraid what increased wear and tear would do to my feet, I decided to try it. The last two nights, I rolled the trigger point massager under my feet for about 40 minutes. This morning when I got out of bed, I was able to walk without pain. I am utterly amazed. I have not had a pain free morning in years, due to the plantar fasciitis. Highly recommend.",

I only recommend using it with socks on to prevent yucky batteries from feet getting in it. I'm sure it's easy to clean if need be, but that is a personal preference.
