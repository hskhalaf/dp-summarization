But now I\u2019ve gotten a new MacBook Pro (nothing wrong with it), and when I plug it in blue is pink. That\u2019s with Acer settings, but can\u2019t fix it in custom color settings either. I see other Acer\u2019s in the list of Amazon approved monitors. I realize I\u2019ve had it over the warranty, but I wouldn\u2019t purchase another of this brand. Of course I won\u2019t buy HP either because HP plays a key role in Israel\u2019s oppression of Palestinians. The field gets more limited.",

Oh well, I give 4 stars for monitor performance and quality, but 2 stars for a screen size smaller than stated. So that gives me the 3 star review. I will keep it rather than go thru the return process. Here is the monitor you might get. Nice, and actually selling for more than this listed one.",
