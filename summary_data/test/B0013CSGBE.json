      "text": "I\u2019ve used the real product for years. Ordered this for the cheap price (retails for $20 at Ulta). Noticed the product was a bit runny, resulting in creases after applying, which is highly unusual for this product. Seemed pretty sketchy, so I bought a real Too Faced Primer from Ulta for comparison, which is the tube on the right. As you can see, the fake one on the left (from this Amazon seller) is a pretty good fake, except it\u2019s missing the logo on the top of the lid. Difficult to see here, but the top is also shorter on the fake.",

Then the consistency of the cream was also different. After wearing it a few times, it was proving that it completely didn\u2019t work. I thought they must have changed the formula what a bummer. On a whim I went into ULTA and guess what? Their product is just like my previous experiences. Notice even the tip difference? Definitely has me wondering what\u2019s going on. It also won\u2019t allow me to return it. Not cool.",

I'm so disappointed. I added photos so you can see the difference in quality and in the packaging. In the photos, the top is this crappy knockoff and the bottom is the real deal. The real product has a nice thick consistency that goes on much like a concealer and gives a great base for eyeshadow to stick to. This knockoff is nothing like that at all. Amazon also would not allow a return on this product so I'm out $20. Don't buy it!!",

It's probably the talc, which I'm often (though not 100% of the time) sensitive, too. So if you're sensitive, like me, this may not cause you irritation. So sad cuz I love how well it works!!",

Also, it's liquidy, which is what I prefer, as you don't need much to cover the eye. I definitely recommend this product.",

I should note that Too Faced is quite a bit cheaper than Urban Decay. I'll stick with Too Faced.",

It does help retain color, however, my eyeliner (which is black eyeshadow) creases as badly as it always has.

      "text": "I'm not really a huge fan of this primer. It does make eyeshadows look brighter and last longer, but it often separates in the tube into the pigment (or whatever the tan part is) and oil. This primer is often too greasy for me, and it's gross when it separates (so you have to knead the tube before use); the separation isn't because I've had the product too long- it did that a week after I opened the brand new package. I also have really pale skin, and I find that if I get any primer above my crease, it looks yellow and cakey.",

I'd been looking for an eye makeup base that works better and lasts longer than drugstore brands (such as Almay Bright Eyes). My face is oily, even around the eyes, so it's hard to have fresh-looking makeup for more than a couple of hours. I applied Shadow Insurance according to directions, but after a few hours my eye shadow and liner began to crease and run as usual. While I don't regret buying Shadow Insurance, next time I'll try a new beauty product in person before buying it online.",
