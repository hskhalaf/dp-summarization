It is hard to control since it has caster wheels on the back , so I wouldn't recommend it for too young of a child. It's nice to have a friend or sibling that gets one too. They can zip around together. The only problem I have with it is, that it doesn't have brakes, so you have to stop with your feet , wearing the bottom of your shoes off.",

I read that someone was terribly disappointed whose son was only 35.5 because he could not reach the petals. My son measured in at 45.5 inches tall so I rolled the dice. He LOVES it!! We do put a very small pillow in the seat back behind him and with that he does fantastic! As others have experienced, immediately after we put it together and took it outside, he and my 9 year old daughter started fighting over it! It's a great riding toy, very sturdy and extremely easy to put together! I definitely give it 5 stars!",

The wheels broke on this rip-rider very quickly under normal use. Very dissapointing and I have resisted the urge to buy razor products anymore.",

Definitely recommend this especially if you have active boys!!",

The construction of the pedal makes it impossible for you to put back on yourself. Razor has said they will send a new replacement front tire assembly, but that it is not available for 4-5 weeks. Am still in that window and haven't received it, so not sure if I am satisfied with the company's response yet. Overall, seems fun, slightly dangerous, make sure your kids wear a helmet when they ride it.",

I would recommend smaller children wearing a helmet, though, because they can spin this vehicle rather wildly and it's better to be safe in case they lose control.",

The manufacturer should take into consideration that girls like riding these as well and make them in pink or red. I'm going to have to bling it out for her. My grandson is a little shorter than most his age and my granddaughter is a little taller; but they have no problem with their legs reaching. Assembly was easy; I put it together and my husband tightened it up a little. All in all, I think I've hit a homerun with this item.",

The spins are way better than my Big Wheel that I rode as a kid until it fell apart. This is so fun and totally worth the money!! I recommend getting elbow pads if you are buying this for a young rider though. Until they get used to the feel of how to make the spins happens, expect a few dumps and some degree of road rash. Nothing major, but elbow pads should do the trick.",

I was truly disappointed in Amazon that they shipped a toy during the holiday season in the regular packing with no overpack. Any time of year toys should be overpacked so parents have a chance to hide the box before the kids see it!
