I was worried that when I adjust the diameter for bigger cakes the circle might not be accurately round. But, I never had a problem at all and easily masked a seven inch and 10 inch cake and the clear and sharp edges speak for themselves. Don\u2019t forget to use acetate sheets inside of the cake ring. I\u2019m chuffed it works so well for taller cakes as well when used with acetate sheets. Highly recommend it for its ease of use and hassle free cleaning and adjusting the diameter.",

(If you don't need a 6\" ring, then this problem would not necessarily be relevant to you!) The little sliding metal bar that holds the ring to its adjusted size also was very loose, so that it didn't hold anything. I can picture how one might use pliers to bend the ends of the clips more snugly to the ring, so that it actually holds its size (or, you could just use binder clips around the top, probably), but since the size is wrong for me anyway, I did not bother with these hacks.",
