It is EXTREMELY well built, and I know it will last for a long time. It's not often that you can say something like that about an item you put in a flame in order to create smoke. But this has totally transformed the grilling experience. My family loves it and it just really makes cooking out more enjoyable. The flavor added is amazing. Just make sure you buy the right wood chips. If you enjoy smoked food, you just can not go wrong buying this box.",

It does generate smoke and you can smell the flavor, but it doesn't add much to the food. It just dusts your food with smoke wood flavor. Having had a real lump charcoal smoker in the past that I used with favor woods, this is no comparison. The problem is that most grills aren't designed to trap and hold the smoke like a smoker does, so most of it just blows out the edges & back of the grill.",
