Was hoping for fun play and interaction, but with the limitations, we can't really put them to much use. The quality is mediocre, especially for a M&D product, and the packaging ties left large, permanent holes in all the animal bodies in front and back. You can't open the mouths to make them talk, so you can only move their heads and arms around. When compared to a decent quality puppet that more resembles a furry stuffed animal, these are just disappointing.",

She likes to cover both her hands with an animal puppet and run around the house making noises associated to the animal. For the Tiger she likes to go \"meow meow\" and makes it dance. These puppets are big enough to support most adult hand sizes, which makes it handy for story time and bed time readings. Like most Melissa and Doug items, the quality is really good and well made. If you want to wash these, I recommend gentle cycle in cool water and air dry.",

To my disappointment, I could barely get my hand into the puppet (I have avg. size hands at best). I could not keep them in the puppet comfortably for any length of time. Even though the ad says they fit most adult hands, I tend to disagree. I also disagree with the 2 people who said an adult could wear them. Utterly disappointed since I loved puppets as a kid and was so looking forward to them. Even though they are cute to look at, puppets need to be functional!",
