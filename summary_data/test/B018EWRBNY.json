My only compaint is that now I am finding the blue strings from the duster around the house. So I'm not sure how good the quality is? It's brand new and has not even been through the wash yet. I hope my cats don't eat or we will have a huge problem. I chose to spend the extra money on a nicer one so I didnt expect to loose the string so soon.",

The telescoping pole is great for reaching under the couches. Only complaint was the pole where it clips on the mop head. Perhaps a slightly stronger spring on this part would be good.

It's a bit high, it doesn't go under one piece of furniture as did my old one\u2014part of the spring-loaded connector is too high. Otherwise, it's obviously an excellent quality mop and handle. Kurt (seller) includes a warranty registration card but it requires a stamp. I would like to have the card read: \"Your personal data will not be given, sold, or shared with others.\" Or, an option to register online.",
