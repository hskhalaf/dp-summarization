Although whey tasted good, it always gave me stomach problems. When I heard about this stacked protein I was skeptical at first because I've never tried plant protein before but I am now converted and don't use anything else. I love both vanilla and chocolate and use them interchangeably depending on my mood and what I'm mixing with. Both blend well and taste great. My kids also love it (2 and 5 yrs old).",

The vanilla flavor does not have a sugary taste nor a bitter taste. It just right in the middle. However, it is a plant base product. I love using the product with almond milk with a hint of cinnamon and fruits . Will update once the product finishes. Great ingredient, I\u2019ll say go for it and try for yourself.",

I typically include frozen berries, almond milk, peanut butter and spinach if I have it fresh and it\u2019s perfect flavor to not over power with sweetness but still have great flavor and this does that. I need a plant protein with little or no stevia so this one was perfect. Will definitely be buying it again!",
