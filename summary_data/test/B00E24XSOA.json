I decided to get them because of the reviews, I think they are fake reviews because these boots are the most uncomfortable boots that I have ever purchased. It is actually kind of weird, When I put them on they feel great but then I walk around and its terrible. Pros: Easy to put on material seems to be good price Non-slip grip is great Cons: REALLY uncomfortable The toe is too narrow and causes a lot of rubbing no arch support",

It is not even on a seam point. I am not hard on boots at all, Used this for light yard work. My previous pair of the same boots lasted for over a year with much more frequent use.",

Fortunately you can get in and out of these boots by just opening the zipper. Other than that they are comfortable, fit true to size and the sole is really soft like the sole of sports shoes.",

I feel like i'm on ice when I wear these in the restaurant I work at. 2. The laces are slippery enough that they don't stay tied tightly with a regular bow like most normal laces will. This can be solved by spending $1 at Wal-Mart to get new laces, but still. I would give these shoes 5 stars if they weren't being marketed as non-slip, but they don't live up to the expectations the ad creates for the buyer.",

These boots are definitely not hot weather boots, the tongue and collar are heavily padded. One the soles of mine had a hole in the side of the sole that appeared to be from a bubble that formed when the rubber material was molded. Returned the boots due to size and sole defect.",
