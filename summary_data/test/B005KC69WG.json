Since it's just plastic pushed together, I dont know how it would serve as a heavy use/everyday closet. But again, absolutely great for the value for a storage unit!",

The closet saver tipped over (several times) and will only stay upright with the help of cardboard boxes nestled underneath. The zip opening and closure can snag clothing, and does not add to the aesthetic of being a 'real' closet. It's such a hassle to open and close, I just leave the zipper open and watch my clothes and dry cleaning bags, oh and the wire hangars looking back at me.",
