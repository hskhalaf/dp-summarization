      "text": "I used to think it was a gimmick, but switching to silk pillowcases is so nice. My hair seems less tangled and I don't wake up with creases on my skin. I will say the pillowcase seemed too big for my pillow at first, but it shrunk in the dryer (happened by accident) and now it's perfect. It's easy to care for. I usually hang dry my pillowcase after a gentle wash and it's dry within 1-2 days.",

I wash mine in warm water and hang to dry out of the sun (no dryer, it wrecks the fibers!) I bought the grey color and it's a nice pewter grey. Love my silk pillows!",

I have grown accustomed to my crisp, cool cotton pillowcases. This just isn't the same:(",
