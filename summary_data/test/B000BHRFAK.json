I left it on her while she napped. After her nap she started to play and within minutes the harness was broken. This harness was not on her too tightly or too loosely. I did my best according to the very thorough instructions provided. The instructions were great. The product seemed to work well as she wasn't pulling, however it broke in under an hour, on the first day. VERY DISAPPOINTED. RETURNING.",

I can't speak to durability, as I have not had it long enough, but it doesn't seem like my puppy can chew on it while its on, and I don't keep it in a place where he can chew on it while its off....",

This harness helps alleviate most of pulling on daily walks . It also spins them around if they bolt and you have them on a retractable lead providing you can hold on , so this harness works best on a short to mid range lead. I am on my second harness in 8 years. The first one the plastic buckle developed some wear and at times would come unbuckled if he laid on it wrong. It's the best harness I have found to eliminate pulling.",

It does not seem to hug the front of the dog like the other 3 I had in the past. It is not the size, the size seems perfect. With my previous pups they had no choice but to walk perfectly. This version is not the same. My dog can still pull. While this is better than nothing, I am sorry that it no longer works like it used to.",

She hates the Gentle Leader and trying to walk he with just a regular collar is not possible right now. It's a bit challenging getting this on the right way, but once you get used to it, it works just fine.",
