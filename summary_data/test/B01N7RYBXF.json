The keyboard is centered about two inches to the left of the middle of the trackpad. When you are typing, your palm will occasionally brush the trackpad, causing the mouse pointer to jump to somewhere else in the document or thread you are working on. Maybe I have fat palms, but dang if this isn't the most annoying thing I've encountered this week. :/",

All my financial information and correspondence and business for a rental property. Try doing without that for a day or two maybe!

It is easier to buy and download software from the manufacturer. This laptop traveled very well and slips into any carry-on bag easily. Great product!!!",

For everyday office use this isn't a big deal, but this might not be the best machine for people who put their laptops through hard use: travel a lot, harsh working environments, etc...But it works fine for me thus far.",

If you want to have great laptop speakers, this one isn't that great. Personally, neither of these things matter to me (headphones work perfectly).",
