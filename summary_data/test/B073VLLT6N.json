We purchased these ice cleats this past fall and have used them extensively this winter. These things stick to the slipperiest, hardest ice surfaces that we have come across including smooth frozen lakes / streams. They are easy to slip onto a hiking boot. We do notice that they can get slightly uncomfortable on long hikes over hard ice surfaces - a small inconvenience for slip free hiking on any slippery surface.",

By 5 miles I was fully frustrated and Took them off. They were falling apart and most of the spikes were bent flat. I don\u2019t write reviews often but these were terrible.",

The L was much too large for my shoes (women's size 9.5 hiking shoes) - probably needed to differentiate the sizes between hiking shoes versus heavy boots. With the strap broken, the cleats sagged and hung very loose. Had to readjust them every five minutes or so. Very frustrating during a hike. I got a second pair for a friend but after the strap broke neither of us felt comfortable trusting these on another trek.",
