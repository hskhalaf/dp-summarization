Cord is a nice length, and switch is easy to access and turn on/off. I wasn't sure whether I would like it or not based on other reviews, but it's perfect and I would definitely by this one again if it ever breaks or we need another.",

This lamp served both purposes, and it was smaller and more compact than I originally thought. The adjustable length is fairly strong and will keep its shape when bent. It seems true, as other reviews noted, that you cannot change the bulb, so I would be careful about that if you're looking for something to keep forever. Overall a pleasant surprise and very happy.",

The much-less than 22\" advertised goose neck failed at this angle, making the lamp sag into the work regardless of how we set it.

This tiny, space-saving, energy-saving lamp provides more light than any of my room lamps, and it is so convenient! I purchased it as a reading lamp at my desk, and have re-ordered another that goes over my washing machine. Now I'm ordering a third as additional light for the bathroom to assist in shaving and makeup. You can't beat this flicker-free, perfect spectrum light for getting your makeup colors right.",

The neck is very flexible as long as you don't manipulate it from the base. Treat it gingerly and it will perform for you. I wouldn't recommend using it on a headboard because of gravity. It's designed to be used vertically.",

The clip for the light also has little suction cups on it so that it remains more stable when repositioning the neck of the light. All in all, highly satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to anyone!!!",
