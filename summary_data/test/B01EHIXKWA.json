It's well-constructed and holds a 160-count box of Kleenex with no problems (I'm not sure why other reviewers are having trouble with the tissue boxes). The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did find the gold paint used on the \"pages\" of the \"books\" to be a little glitzier than I would've liked.",
