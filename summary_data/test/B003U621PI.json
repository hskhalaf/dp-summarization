At least you know what you're getting with Atkins bars, and they don't taste terrible. The Chocolate Peanut Butter is one of the better flavors, although it's not particularly chocolate-y or peanut butter-y. They're big enough that you could have one with a cup of coffee and be sort-of okay until lunchtime. I've been following a mostly-keto plan (although I'm not extremely rigid, because...life) and these seem to fit in as long as I watch my carbs for the rest of the day.",

They were much closer to their expiration date (August 2018) than typical, lacked flavor, and had a distinctive \"stale\" taste. That could have been the result of excessive exposure to heat in transit or storage, which accelerates deterioration of boxed food products. These were also *very* tough to bite and chew, much more than those we previously purchased (or the many other Atkins bar flavors we've tried). Definitely not recommended.",
