So glad I did now the kids can be kids and I won't be worrying they are ruining my cloth seats. I have a 2019 Chevy Equinox and they fit the seats great. Would definitely order these again.",

The old one we had, slid all over the seat and covered the seat belt so we always had a difficult time with buckling the seat belt. My son even gives it a thumbs up.",
