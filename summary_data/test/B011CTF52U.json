I always seem to make solid contact with this racquet which saves me in a lot of volleys. The grip did take me a few games to get used to, but will hold up over time.",

This is not a beginners racquet as the tiny sweet spot means the racquet is very unforgiving giving many low energy returns. A beginner would be better served with a racquet that is far more forgiving for imperfect racquet handling.",

The only drawback I had is that I couldn't find the size of the grip in the description. Once I received my set I realized the size was 3 7/8 (LG), I was hoping it was 3 5/8. However, after playing with it, this size doesn't feel bad. The grip (Ektelon Vision II) is a nice rubber grip which provides excellent grip, especially if combined with a glove. So far I love the racquet. I also ended up receiving the \"Python Extreme View Eye-guards\" from the Advanced Set (which is not a bad thing).",
