The jackets are a thick variety of fleece and stand up quite well to repeated washings. Pilling is minimal. I have found that over time when dried repeatedly at higher heat settings contrary to what should be used on synthetics, that some shrinking occurs. I have never had any of them tear nor had a seam come undone. They are perfect around the house, vehicle and yard. However, in the thorny desert, they collect allot of plant debris. Bottom line, they are highly recommended.",

Also the hood is adorable but slightly annoying to her. Thats why my other purchase, the Gooby Fleece (no hood) is my preference.",

They also seem to last because we haven t had to replace any foe any reason but outgrowing smaller sizes as they've grown, and we've had some for a few years. It doesn't hurt that they are so ply cute, not \"froofy\" bs people sometimes dress up their small dogs in. I estimate we have maybe 8-10 of them (although maybe we've gone a bit overboard).",

Its snug and it makes him feel secure and warm enough that he doesn't shiver. I love that it has leg holes instead of actual sleeves. It makes it actually usable and comfortable for the dog. Probably not feasible for larger dogs.",

The only critique/ suggestion I would make is if you have male dogs cut apprx 3/4 inch under the hoody so they don't get pee on their hoody as it sometimes runs a little close to their you know what..",

If your dog is not very big around for its length, you probably don't need to size up, as many suggest. Also, while it's cute, the hood is kind of an annoyance. It's too big to put on my dog (goes completely over her eyes, almost to her mouth), and pulled back it's a bit bulky.",
