      "text": "My family really likes this camera, and we use it quite frequently. We bought it about six months ago and it has held up well. Here are the pros and cons. Pros: Lightweight, fits well in your hand. Button placement makes sense. Instructions and controls are easy to understand. Very clear pictures. Decent battery life. Quick capture - which helps with a fast moving toddler! Nice looking camera, not bulky at all. Cons: Not as many features as others in its line. I'm fairly certain it would break on impact - from dropping or something like that. I always use the wrist band that it comes with.",

The camera has so many features that were missing from my previous cameras. I recently video taped my Grandaughter's first communion and it turned out great. But, when I tried to transfer the video to disk using the included Zoombrowser 6.5, I found it did not recognize a dvd format. I did get the movie recorded to dvd through my recorder but extra information was recorded along the perimeters. If anyone else has had this problem and found a solution, I would appreciate a response.",

This is the best of the \"Elf\" series cameras I have used yet, and the 12 MP image it produces just adds to it's capabilities. You can't go wrong with this little 'carry everywhere' image maker.

In addition- even a simple photo of nothing is far better quality than any other camera we've owned. Obviously, we're not well educated photographers, but I am confident that this camera will take great quality photos- for the quality, you can't beat the price! :)",

The Auto mode works so well for most every shot with the picture quality as good as I could hope for. The Cannon software allows the camera to interface with your computer seamlessly. Like most other reviews if you are looking for a relatively low cost point and shoot camera you cannot go wrong with this Cannon.",

My only reason for the return was the fixed focus and no zoom-in/out during video recording, which my 2-year-old Canon SD1100 IS could do. It otherwise seemed to be a very good camera for an amazing price--good picture quality, good selections of picture modes, various ISO settings, etc. I'd believe this would be a very good camera if you do not care for video recording. However, if you do use this camera for video recording as well, it would not be a good choice and you may consider the 300HS instead.",

The pictures I took were washed out. The camera menu was not simple. You have to push down on the button very hard and hold it to take a picture and then it takes so long for the photo to actually shoot that your subject has moved. I was very disappointed and am returning immediately.",
