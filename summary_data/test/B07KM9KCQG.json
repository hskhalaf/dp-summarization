It has gotten high marks for its robust construction, high-quality cushioning, and sheer lightness.\u00a0Despite some concerns over its ability to guard the feet from extreme rain and water, this shoe still makes a great pick for both recreational and serious hikers.

      "text": "These are without doubt the most comfortable boots I have ever owned and from that perspective they are everything you would expect from a brand such as Merrel. Sadly they are as waterproof as my Crocks and anything from damp grass or moorland to a heavyish rain shower will have your feet feeling soggy within a couple of minutes. I have worn these extensively in dry conditions over the winter and through the spring, but have now had wet feet on three occasions within the last week, in conditions in conditions the boots should have dealt with easily. There is no point having walking boots if they are not waterproof, especially at this price. So disappointed Merrel!",

      "text": "I know Merrell's come up short - that's nothing new really - but they are narrower than they used to be too, for some reason. I need a pair of waterproof boots for dog walking duties so I bought a size 8 even though I have only size 7 to 7.5 feet, and yes the size 8 does feel short but not uncomfortably so. However, the width IS uncomfortable. I would have returned them but I was desperate for them and stick with them hoping they'd \"give\" a little over time. And yes they have, to a point. They're definitely not my favourite shoes but I can say they are waterproof and appear to built well.",

I do not go trekking, hiking, extreme sport i walk my dog on the beach and in the woods. They have not been snagged this is poor seems. I would really like my money back.",
