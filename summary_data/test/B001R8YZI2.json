They looked at the ingredients in horror, \"Girl, there are some things in here you should never put on your skin no matter your sensitivity.\" Unfortunately I didn't think in the moment to ask which ingredients those were, but I went with a more natural brand and I haven't broken out since.",

It \"lays\" over the foundation vs. settling into it. I've noticed that foundation even stays on my nose longer, which has always been a problem. I'm sensitive to scents, and this is scented. However, it's not unpleasant (just unnecessary in my opinion). The scent fortunately does not linger.",
