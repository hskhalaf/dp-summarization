I have twin Ethernet ports on the Motherboard, with ok as expected performance, with a performance hit system wide overall. The built in seem to be a resource hog. This takes the load off of the CPU and System RAM and utilizes the PCIe which is very fast, and has improved response time to where there is almost undetectable lag. Click bang. -_-_-_-_- PRO TIP -_-_-_-_- Go into BIOS and disable the other Ethernet adapters that are not being used to free up System Resources. GO to the control panel and use the search for new Ethernet drivers, Intel has updates for this. All done Enjoy.",

With built in tests, dual queues, hardware accelerated checksumming, and optimized IRQ signalling this card can actually sustain gigabit speeds instead of just doing gigabit bursts and then tapering off like my old NIC (before it died). The hardware acceleration with checksumming and segmentation really helps CPU usage - with moderate to heavy network usage the CPU now idles at 3% to 7% usage whereas before under similar load it would be 7% - 13%. Overall I was pretty impressed with the purchase; would buy again.",
