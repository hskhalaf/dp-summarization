However, the case has cracked on all four corners, the bottom corners of the case being worse than the top corners of the case. Honestly, the case feels well built and I thought the life expectancy would have been a longer than this. For the price, maybe this is what I should expect. You'll probably think I am crazy but I have just ordered another one. Maybe the second one will last longer than the first one. I'll let everyone know.",

It\u2019s a great value at any price range. I did add a glass screen protector that fit under the screen protector that was part of the case. You can see a small bubble at one corner. The tolerance is close and I was probably a little off center. The pressure from the case caused the glass screen protector to raise slightly. It is not that noticeable when using the iPad and adds more protection so it was worth it. Very happy with this purchase.",

The rubber and hard plastic snap into place practically seamlessly.

So far I am very happy with this new case fits my iPad perfectly, nice and tight less bulky and light weight. Bonus the outer case/stand from the Otterbox fits this case perfectly. The only thing I didn't like was the screen protector so I removed it with an exacto knife.",

Highly recommended for clumsy adults or any parent who would like to save some money on screen repairs!",

      "text": "This case is awesome! I'm giving it 4/5 stars for 2 reasons though. One, there's no way for you to stand the iPad up so if you're working at a desk it's going to be frustrating having to hold it all the time. Second, it's a huge pain to get on and off. I don't mind this one as much because once it's on you can tell it's never coming off or loosening up. It's a very rugged and durable case that will absolutely protect your iPad for falls. Just wish they would add some kind of kick stand in the back to prop it up and it would be perfect!",
