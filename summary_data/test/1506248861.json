      "text": "These books are excellent in the depth of knowledge they cover. Might go a little above and beyond whats required for the MCAT but that never hurts. I would recommend reading through the books quickly the first time around as a refresher. Then another time while also creating Anki cards, (look it up on youtube spaced repetition will absolutely change your life). After the second time of reading take some full-length practice tests and fill in the gaps where you are struggling. (use AAMC practice tests for best results) If you do these 3 things I promise you will be ahead of the competition. How bad do you want it?",

I did lots of other prep including like all of the aamc practice material you can buy, and in retrospect, I probably would have done around the same had I just did that and not read these books. The only exception is the psych book that definitely helped my score.",
