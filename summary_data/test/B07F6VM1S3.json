Only one bud is connecting at a time right now and I don't know why. I LOVE the active noise reduction. I haven't had an issue with the double- tap but the press and hold seems glitchy. Some bugs that I am confident will be ironed out and then they'll be awesome. Sound quality and comfort are mostly subjective but the sound is clear and deep. They fit snugly for me with wingtips but of course that varies by the user.",

My issue is within a few months the left earbud stopped working correctly. Sounds muffled sometimes, and when the volume of the music is lowered a certain extent the left earbud makes a loud steady high pitched squeal. Loud enough to hurt my ears. After checking online I found out this is actually a pretty common issue with these earbuds. I am in the process of returning them.",

I'm hoping they make some software updates that make this better but for now these are pretty much staying in the case unless I need them as headphones.

They should also have come with additional accessories for a better fit to your ear. While they may seem to fit snugly they can still come out. Perhaps including over ear accessories should have been part of the package. Regardless, because of the sound issues I will have to be sending mine back.",

The noise canceling is really good 2. The fit is very secure. I don\u2019t see these falling out even with dynamic movement.
