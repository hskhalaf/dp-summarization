They have a nice rubber coating on them so that you don't rip up your hands using them. Only reason I took off a single star, the loop to hold the kettlebell isn't very wide. I am a slightly shorter than average male and felt that it was barely wide enough for one hand, let alone some two handed exercises.",

This might be too thick for some women with small hands. The kettlebell feels great. I love the coating on it. The length of the handle is perfect for snatches because of where it lands on the forearm (not the wrist). I love it. It's most of an old school style kettlebell. The price is amazing! The shipping alone is usually $20 and up depending on the weight of the KB. Great buy!",

I might cover it with electric tape or something. Waste of money. Could have bought a cast iron, non-coated bell and put some grip tape around the handle without this uneven mess. Seriously, it's like my 4-year old nephew poured enamel paint on this thing; drips and gaps everywhere. At this point, I don't even know what point the \"paint job\" serves. It's certainly not aesthetically pleasing or helpful.",

And although polished, we don't have a problem with it feeling like it wants to slip out of our hands. We ordered a set in increments of 5#'s from 10-50#'s. A few of our kettlebells arrived defective with the hard coated enamel completely chipped. Most kettlebells arrived in their own individual packaging and others were plainly bubble wrapped and placed in boxes too big for their size, meaning the kettlebell rolled around inside. We experienced chipping in both types of packaging. Amazon has excellent customer service and resolved the issues with the defective kettlebells.",

If you want to try a different type of workout, this is it. A 10-15 minute workout, will bring the strongest person \"to there knees.\" It is recommended, do some reading (like book shown here) and start with a kettlebell (or bells) of a lighter weight to permit you to do the exercises properly.",

There are lots of exercises you can do with these things and they really do build muscle and tone you. The key is to get the proper weight for you.

This CAP kettlebell will give you everything you need to start a workout routine. It does not take much room, it seems to be a high quality product and the price is good.",

I got this one because it was much cheaper than Dragondoor. I was a bit afraid that the smooth enamel would make it hard to hold on to, but there is not much difference between it and the less smooth iron handles on my other ones. I do recommend that you get some climbers/gymnasts chalk if you are going to be working out hard. Your hands can get slippery with sweat and then any KB is hard to hold.",

My back and stomach feel stronger and a lot more toned. A word of caution--do your homework well on technique so you do not get hurt. Even better, work with a trainer (though, I did not).",

Just make sure to watch out for those exercises where the main weight of the kettle bell gets close to your forearms. For those exercises it would be better to use dumb bells.",

The only major drawback, and this is of greater concern as you go up in weight, is that they use the same size handle on all their kettlebells. It is a bit too small to get a secure 2 hand grip. If you have larger hands, it will be nearly impossible to do a 2-handed swing. Other than that, they are a great value.",
