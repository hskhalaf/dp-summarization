No frame to come off or get caught on. Easy to tuck away and grab when I need it (I am an online math teacher, so being able to quickly work through a problem along with a student is great!). Sturdy, but light enough to do what I need. Erases cleanly with soft cloth/paper. Perfect for my needs. Haven't found any negatives as of yet.",

I bought this to streamline working on this type of material, and so far it has worked very well. The board is quite sturdy, and doesn't bend or scratch when placed in a tightly packed backpack. I like how this model doesn't have the plastic edge; I like having no bezel on boards like these as it looks better and doesn't connect extra dust and dry-erase residue. Cleans easy with a lens cloth, writes nicely without smearing or otherwise being difficult. I have nothing but good things to say, can't think of any downsides.",
