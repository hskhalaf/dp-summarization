      "title": "Super Running Trainer",
      "text": "Have previously purchased Mizuno running trainers, old set needed replacing so just moved up the number to these. Currently at 375km over about 6months of use, no real problems to report. I am a neutral runner and mainly midfoot strike. They feel as supportive and light as the day I bought them. Wear on the sole has been nice and even. I use these for all my runs from 2k through to half marathons almost always on tarmac. Have had a few trail runs in the mud and they were a little slippy, but this was of course to be expected.",

I needn't have worried in this instance, as these shoes are excellent. They're extremely comfortable to run in and they look good too. I'm a low mileage plodder so I can't say how the shoes perform over 5k, but I guess they'll be very good. I went half a size up from my normal size 8 dress shoe.",
