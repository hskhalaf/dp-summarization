I can scrape off some, but the lens on the green ones is just not in good condition. I\u2019m in a time crunch now for a party, so must use them. Wish I had looked at them sooner because now I\u2019m spending precious party prep time trying to salvage these green glasses. Again, blue ones are perfect so maybe I just got a bad batch. It would have been nice if there were some quality checks prior to shipment.",
