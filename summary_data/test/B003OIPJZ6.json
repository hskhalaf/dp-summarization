It really minimizes the amount of foundation I use and also, I can get by with a much less expensive foundation with this underneath. Washes easily (I can tell bc I can see my pores again, ha). I\u2019ve also used it alone for a bare skin look. A really valuable addition to my admittedly pretty basic and streamlined routine.",

Even with the tint it has, it didn't help my skin very much. On days that I don't use the smashbox product, I use aveeno tinted moisturizer and that works better than this product as well.",
