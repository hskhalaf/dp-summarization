It padded well so the kids can hit it pretty well and not feel a thing. The handles for my hands are well placed. I can position the pad for maximum protection. The material, while not leather, is pretty good. The size is just right. Perhaps a little large for basketball, but it does its job well. I highly recommend to any coaches or assistant coaches.

The bottom seam of the pad I received arrived busted. I'm a little worried about how it will continue to rip if I use it. Otherwise, it seemed solid. I would have liked the rear loops to be slightly larger to more easily fit my arm through. But otherwise, if it came defect-free, it would have been a good pad.",
