    "description": "Lang Tools model 3495 12 piece combination internal/external snap ring pliers is one of the most versatile set of pliers on the market. These heavy-duty, fixed-tip snap ring pliers assist you in removing or installing internal or external snap rings on a wide variety of applications. Each pliers has a center screw and spring washer which allows for easy convertibility for internal and external ring applications while providing a strong and secure hold in use.
