When we got them they were cheaply made enough that I was easily able to crack one open to look at the batteries. They are powered by 3 tiny button batteries which are extremely dangerous for children if ingested. I planned to give them as party favors at a 5 year olds birthday party but at the request of my husband, an ER doctor, I removed them all and will be returning them. They did work and are cute for older kids but dangerous for young children.",

He had 14 friends coming and my wife thought that with most of his friends being boys, they would love to have a flashlight. What kid doesn't like flashlights? So we researched them and found this one. They shipped on time. We received them in plenty of time for us to include them in the gift bags for the kids. They did not disappoint us! The kids found them in their gift bags and asked if they could take them out. They played with them for the rest of the party. It was a great gift for the kids. I hope their parents agree.",

Not a big deal, but I'd suggest always testing. If you need all of them working for a party, or whatever, it'd be a bummer to leave 1 or 2 guests with non-functional flashlights while everyone else is playing. Seller sent email after I received, asking if everything was alright. I'm guessing they would've remedied the non-working units, but I just ordered batteries on my own (I needed some for another device already, so it wasn't a big deal.).",
