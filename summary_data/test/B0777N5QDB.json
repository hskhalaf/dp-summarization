This back pack can hold a lot of stuff. Things that currently have in it are a set of rain gear, Ryobi radio with battery, tape gun, window cleaner, pens, info notices, Lysol wipes, my battery back up for my phone, and other ods and ends. The on thing I don\u2019t like about this back pack is the straps to adjust the shoulders are not folded over and sewed so the don\u2019t just come out if they are at the ends some how.",

It is about as large as you would want a backpack to get before it's just unwieldy to wear on your back when full. I think they picked a perfect size. Most importantly, this pack is TOUGH! I feel very confident that it wont break even though I loaded it up with many pounds of supplies and have it hanging in a closet by the top handle. I'm very pleased.",

Stinks so bad- don't want people to think it's body odor. I can't get in touch with customer service. I'd appreciate a replacement. Did you ever buy something, lift it out of the box and say \"wow\" out loud? Turn it over and say \"niiiice\"? How about... OK, you get the idea. This far exceeded my expectations in initial quality. Looks like a product that'll give lots of use. Be advised: it is kind of big for everyday use.",

No failures of any kind to speak of. I love the \"Pockets inside of Pockets\" to keep Stuff organized. Train tickets / keys / wallet / work paperwork / Lunch. Yes, I will eventually succeed in \"killing\" this Bag, but at this price point, I would buy another one to replace it.",
