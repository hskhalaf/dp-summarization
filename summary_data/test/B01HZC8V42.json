The remaining 60% of her day is, of course, reserved for tail chasing, dog terrorizing, lamp breaking, and other general menace and mayhem. I would definitely put this purchase solidly in the win column. Now, if only I could find some stylish, yet unbreakable lamps.....",

When it's in bed mode it's not very soft (the sherpa pillow is, but the striped fabric on the sides isn't). The sides are stiffer than I thought they'd be, which I get they have to be to support the top and sides in box mode, but still, it's a bummer my cat won't use it. It'll cost $7+ to return so alas, I'll keep it, and hope she'll change her mind. It has a strong smell too, so that could be part of the problem.",

I feel the stiffness of keeping it open is starting to diminish and have noted some sagging already. I changed my review bc my cat absolutely loves this!! He sleeps on it, scratches, plays with it. I don\u2019t expand it but he loves the sides to rest his head on.....",

I move it around the house during the day, depending on which room I'm in, and she always returns to sleep in it. But most importantly she sleeps in it almost all night, which means I'm free to move again! I'll be purchasing another one soon because she smacks my husband's cat whenever she tries to get in.",
