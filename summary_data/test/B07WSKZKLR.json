No amount of sweat and tears and expletives could get that vile blue liquid completely out of the couch fabric. Now, the couch is ruined. I'd rate it -10 if I could.

His sheets are stained and it took over an hour to clean the video game console. We are hoping it continues to work. We scrambled to try and clean everything up (so I didn\u2019t think of taking photos) and it caused a great deal of stress and lots of tears. I do not recommend this product.",

She wasn\u2019t doing anything other than squeezing it while she watched tv. I don\u2019t know if ours was defective but I am afraid to buy a new one. But we loved it while we had it!",

Awesome for kids with anxiety. It burst 2-3 weeks after purchase, throwing neon orange slime across my living room. My daughter was quite rough with it though. It did come out of my light colored rug with Dawn and a really good vacuum. I won't be buying it again. Not worth the risk to my livingroom fabrics. ;)",
