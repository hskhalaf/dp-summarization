It's only been a couple of days, but I can say that Niko has been regularly eating, and I can see the spark in his eyes again! We will continue with the suggested treatment.

Since using Healthy Pets Hemp oil for dogs, her pacing has stopped and she sleeps through the night. She's more mobile now too, able to jump up on the couch again. The difference in the last few months is amazing. We thought this summer was going to be her last, but she's so much happier now. She's still a senior dog, but now she's back to enjoying life again.

She eats this mixed in her canned cat food. It does seem to help. I like that there are no additives with this brand, smells of earthy hemp. My cat gobbles this up when drizzled on top of her canned food. She seems upset if I don't give it to her, so it must help.",
