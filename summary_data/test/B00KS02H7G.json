Plenty of room to add more products and nice to be organized. I particularly like being able to see everything",

Shipping was extremely secure with it carefully packaged and wrapped inside the box. Hinges for lid are smooth. Only small negative worth noting is that the drawers do drop down a good bit when pulled out. They aren't on a track so it is to be expected. But it's not nearly as bad as many sub par smaller cheaper acrylic boxes. This is simply an item that you can't go wrong for the money, overall appealing aesthetics, storage capacity, and durability",
