      "text": "The handles on this JoyCon grip are larger and feel much better for an adult hand size, and do have a bit of a grip to them. While they're much better than the Nintendo pack in grip it still isn't nearly as good feeling of a controller as the other current consoles. Small gripe but the Joycons do not fit in quite as snug as the pack in grip. I haven't found a better Joycon grip yet and would highly recommend this over the pack in.",

      "text": "Customers need to carefully look that this is actually a different shape than official Joy-Con grip that comes with Switch. While it works just fine when slipping in Joy-Cons and holding them, it's not as comfortable to hold for my fingers. There are square angles that poke my fingers. When I try to slide my Joy-Cons out of the grip, there's barely room for my fingers to hold the release button before taking them out. $10 may be an attractive price for what is basically a piece of plastic shaped to hold smaller controllers, but in my opinion it's not worth it if it's not as comfortable to hold or makes Joy-Con removal a hassle.",

Part of the issue was the joy-cons' plastic lock buckles, which I replaced with metal versions. However, the PowerA grip has plastic rails that eventually would not lock the joy-cons in place, whereas the Nintendo version has metal rails that keep them from sliding out. So, this grip is good, but you might eventually need to replace sooner than you would Nintendo's grip.",
