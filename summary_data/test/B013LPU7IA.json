By early June they were completely tore up from I'd say about 30 hours total of just regular batting use. Sure my kid plays a lot of ball, but 3 months? Come on. Fortunately they're not too expensive so replacing is not too big of a deal. But I thought Franklin was supposed to be high quality. I guess not so much.",

Literally, 2 games into the season and the stitching around the 'Shok-Sorb' padding is coming undone in 4 different spots already. I repeat, 2 games of recreational softball. Guess I know why they were on sale. These gloves won't even last half a season playing one night a week.",

My son plays somewhere in the neighborhood of 50+ games over the summer and he wore the same batting gloves every game. The glove can get a little stiff when thrown in the bottom of a baseball bag but what gloves wouldn't? I'll buy another pair when these finally give out.",
