I'm normally a 10 but bought half size bigger and it wasn't enough, so sent them back and got a size 11 which fit like a glove. They look fantastic and several people commented so. Very happy indeed. 4/5 is a great and realistic score.",

In the right size they are very comfortable and I'm happy with them now. Not too expensive either.",

However the plastic used for design that borders the toe vamp causes it to feel suffocating towards the end of your foot; it may also dig slightly into the top of your foot which is what happened to me. As long as you go up a size and don't have particularly strong/wide feet the trainer should fit comfortably.",
