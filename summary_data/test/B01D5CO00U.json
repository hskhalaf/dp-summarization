      "text": "We bought the 9.5\u201d for off season training and wow, what an outstanding piece. It is the same pattern as my son\u2019s game glove so training is more natural. The finger stalls are a bit snug on my xl hands but this glove is fantastic. I\u2019m also a big Rawlings fan, so I love the glove. I didn\u2019t expect it on the gamer series but the leather is very stiff and that makes me love it even more. This tiny glove with very stiff leather makes catching with two hands necessary. Now my son is very natural catching with two hands. That alone has made his game a lot stronger.",
