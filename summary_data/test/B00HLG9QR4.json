The fiberglass pole is very strong, but is very slippery if any pressure is exerted on the umbrella in closed position....it slides very easily. It has no rubber tip to prevent it from sliding away when attempting to lean it on any other wall or support..... say a counter in a store....it will slide out flat on the floor. It must be kept in a gripped hand. Absolutely cannot be used as a cane.",

With this grip on the handle you know that the umbrella will stay secure in your hands. In other words, this umbrella is excellent.",
