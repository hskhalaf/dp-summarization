      "text": "This is the most uncomfortable shoe that I now own. I cant return them since now Ive worn them otherwise I would. Insole is plasticky which makes your feet sweaty. The back part of the shoe cut me within an hour. And the fabric rubs with every step on your toes which hurts. Not a happy camper, I so wanted to love these shoes.",

Toe box is hard as a rock and you will get blisters on your heels. That's pretty expensive blisters for around 60 bucks. These are going back going to get a softer pair we saw in the store and a lot cheaper.",
