The ones he\u2019s killed include death by drowning, death by car tire crushing, and death by toilet. This Lg puts up with being left outside, overheating, complete discharge, and dropping countless times.",

Battery lasts forever and audio is loud and clear. It was \"almost\" too easy to switch phone number and minutes....all automatic......but I forgot to try to make a phone call.......that's what makes it finish up the registration!",

I only need it for when I'm away from the house (more like the 70's with a CB radio). Sound quality is clear and clean, much less bulky in my pants pocket too. I had over 8000 minutes that transferred over to the new LG.",
