These do NOT disappoint. They are so loud and clear. i'm sure my whole neighborhood can hear them when i turn them up even 1/2 way. The video is with them playing at about 1/4 volume. Install was a cinch just splice 2 wires and you're good 2 go. Definitely want to bury these it really helps the bass shine rather than sound empty.",

I installed them myself - I\u2019d suggest doing a fair amount of research before buying speaker wire. I ran mine outside from the basement, drilled a hole and figured out the line was probably sufficient for outdoor quality. I ran mine through conduit but my initial wire wasn\u2019t rated for direct burial so I re-wired everything which was a little painful. Go for direct burial wire - and research the gauge before committing to purchase. The process of hooking up to speakers is quite easy.",

The large pool area where these are installed now sonically sounds as if I'm indoors - they really fill the large, outdoor space with a warm, enveloping sound. I was apprehensive about paying so much for these; however I have truly never been disappointed with Bose products or their customer service. These speakers sound great and I truly hope they will withstand many years of four-season weather here in the northeast. Time will tell, but others' longer-term experiences with these speakers strongly suggests they'll hold up just fine. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK, BOSE!",

Even with 100 watts each going to these speakers with 12 gauge wife, they're not THAT loud - but loud enough. It's a well rounded sound that at lower volume levels really provide a good experience. If you turn it up loud, however - the base will bottom out.",
