I despise pet hair on my floors (yes, I know, I probably shouldn't have pets, but I do), and I am compulsive about trying to get rid of it. I have a house with only tile and hardwood. This machine is a workhorse and very satisfying to use. It has never failed to perform. Additionally, I have never replaced the filters, i just clean them out by rising them in the sink, let them dry, and use them again. Highly recommend this product.",

It also does a very poor job of picking anything up that is not in the center of the V, so getting along the baseboards won't happen. An expensive mistake.",

I have tried various troubleshooting methods, such as, emptying out contents after each use, cleaning out filter, & disassembling head to see if there is a build up, all to no avail. Really disappointed that this vacuum was not built for longevity.",
