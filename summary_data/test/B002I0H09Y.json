There are also no checkpoints so if you die you restart the entire mission. The bots have very dumb AI's. The only reason this game isn't getting one star is because of the multiplayer which is alright. But do not pay more than $10 for this game. There are much better games out there for the current marketed price of this one.",

      "text": "Great mobile Call of Duty. The multiplayer is great, the maps are fairly small but they work well on the vita. Definitely a Call of Duty game, perks, kill streaks, and COD maps all on the go. The campaign is short (each level takes less than 10 minutes) but fun. Spans Cold War era 1960's to 1990). Wish I hadn't listened to the negative reviews and got the game earlier. It is my favorite shooter on the vita (Killzone is good too, but gameplay feels slower). Highly recommend",

The campaign is in the style of UNIT 13 which I was also uninterested in. The game has tight controls but with a \"specs op\" only like mode for the campaign and a multi-player that is stale after playing each map only once my advice is to stay away.",

I Bought the game thinking it would be the worst thing I have ever played on the vita, but I was pleasantly surprised with a fun, portable Call of Duty experience. The game is fun, but full of potential. The multiplayer is the main reason to buy this game, because the campaign, just wasn't good at all when compared to Call of Duty campaigns. In fact, it wasn't really a campaign at all, more like time trial missions. Over all, if you find this game for a decent price, I'd say buy it. It is not worth the original 50$ price though. Hope this could help someone out!",
