      "text": "FANTASTIC. This is replacing a 52\" samsung 1080p TV that I absolutely love but this TV has stolen all my attention. Black levels are shockingly amazing. HDR on my Xbox One X is just incredible. We have two tv's in the living room and the difference on the same game is incredibly obvious. Brights are flawless, darks are pitch black, and colors just pop like you won't believe. I could not be happier and the One Connect box makes cord management a dream. The numberless remote could take some getting used to but I only use this TV attached to an xbox so the remote rarely gets used for anything.",

It is amazing and I love it. Also, was never overwhelmed by curved screen before but it definitely is worth it on this QLED. Added bonus surprise: The sound is extremely good, much better than my other big screen, and my QLED is the 2017 model. My understanding is that sole difference between 2017 and 2018 QLED model is even further improved sound. 2017 model is already excellent TV sound.",
