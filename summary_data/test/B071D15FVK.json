Honestly, it does not help me personally focus on anything but the cube, but that may just be me. I like the rolling dials, sliding switches and the rocker switch on the cube a lot. That being said, if you or anyone who will be around you while you are using this cube are bothered by repetitive noises, please see my video review here for what the different parts of this cube sound like. The noises are not loud, but you can definitely hear them.",

It has been multiple days and he's been carrying this around the house, I think it's his new favorite toy. I even like playing with it when he isn't using it. It keeps him very distracted. The colors are true to the picture and it will fit almost entirely in one adult hand. I've seen some complaints about how loud the buttons are, but while you can hear the buttons when clicked, it hasn't been a problem for us.",

The sliders aren't too easy nor difficult to slide. Different buttons click at different volumes, for example the flat spinner that doubles as a button quick is quiet enough to click in class. Also, the switch is pretty loud, but satisfying as a result. My personal favorite part is the squishy flick thing. You can flick it as well as press it down and I love it! It doesn't feel cheap. It doesn't feel very expensive, but it definitely doesn't feel cheap. Great value.",

I think an adult would lose interest quickly, though it is fun to play with at first. The pink/maroon button pops off, making it a choking hazard. I simply removed the button and gave the ball back to the small child. Everything else seems well-on. Edit: the sliding buttons came off too",

Now, my toddler uses it to \u201cturn on tv or shows\u201d. Lol. Still a great use for the trip I bought it for. But please watch for the pieces that come off easily. Choking hazard for little ones.",
