A little pricey so this past week we tried a different brand that was organic and had all good ingredients at half the cost. Our first taste of the other brand was disappointing, it didn't taste at all like a shake in fact we didn't know what it tasted like, chalk maybe. So, even though it costs more, we are back to ordering Organic Valley because we were spoiled by the excellent taste plus knowing the ingredients were wholesome. This review applies to the chocolate flavor as well.",

Also, it does not have other additives of questionable benefit/harm (green tea extract and other additives). Probably because it lacks stevia, it does have sugar, but still gives 1g of protein per 10 calories, which is actually better amount of protein per calorie than other shakes out there.",
