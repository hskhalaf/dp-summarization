Ive had this caera for almost a year now as well and its highly durable! Its been in boats, cars, tree tops, boxes, waterproof bags, you name it. I love my little D3300 and I hope you will too!! 100 outta 5 stars! (if you like my photos follow me on instagram @emmie.phorourke)",

It's a perfect fit for beginners and amateurs who want to get the hang of basic photography without spending an arm and a leg. The camera is easy to handle. When buying a DSLR, though: keep in mind the price of camera bodies but also keep in mind the price of lenses that fit that body. I'm finding that lenses for similar Canon bodies are cheaper now that I want to buy more accessories and lenses. So the relatively low price of this model may produce costs later. Do your research.",

The autofocus is fast and convenient. Best of all, the camera is a joy to hold, with a comfortable, ergonomic design. While the 18-55 kit lens is perfectly fine for most uses, I would recommend a fixed-length lens in addition, due to its superior optical properties. I roll with Nikon's 35mm AF-S lens myself, which is great for both close-up portraits as well as grand landscape shots. Overall, 5/5, would absolutely recommend.",

All pics are very clean. Video is stunning. I didn't expect that to be that good. After all, it's not a video camera.

Wish I had sprung for the camera bundle with the additional lens. I ended up buying a used telephoto lens and that's been really fun, but it's 10 year old technology (but has more zoom power!)

To supplement, I purchased the sharp 50mm f1.8D (and I can use this 50mm only in Manual with the D3300, but that's fine) and the 18-140mm. The 18-140mm is sharp, shoots circles around the kit lens, and is a terrific tool for the D3300. Bottom line: Start lens shopping as soon as you start using and getting used to the D3300.",

Taking pics of young children is also difficult because unless you are in midday light you cannot turn off the flash without the red eye reduction light coming on and the child flinching.",

      "text": "Ordered this bad boy 2 days ago and received it it tip top shape. The picture quality is outstanding. Especially at ISO 400 with 34mm exposure. The \"auto\" setting is perfect for beginners. After you perfect your craft you an then move on to the manual setting when taking pictures. I strongly stand behind this product! No need for the 55 to 200 lens unless you plan on taking really wide range shots. If you are looking to take pictures of products, headshots, fashion and other regular type photoshoots, then 18-55mm is all you need. Just make sure you have really good lighting to ensure optimal performance. Great Camera!",

The color rendition is excellent with both the 18-140mm and the supplied 18-55mm. Both lenses produce sharp pictures, though pictures taken in low light conditions at high ISO settings (1600 or so) are definitely on the grainy side. I stick to ISO 400 or lower for most uses. I also have a D7100, but find the D3300 much handier for shooting outside of my little Web page studio.",
