They're awesomely designed and look very cool, but they're just molded plastic. They are very light and fall over a lot, which is super annoying. I'll probably weigh them down with something but I'm not sure yet what. Also, the board is cheap cardboard. It feels very, very very cheap. If the plastic game pieces were weighted and the board was even low-grade wood, I'd be happy at the $50 price point, but as it is it isn't good.",

Although the board folds into quarters, it stays quite flat when opened and the fold seams are not noticeable. The thick board (cardboard) seems durable if used with reasonable care. The chess men have a good heft to them. Although some pieces are a bit top-heavy, if moved carefully around the board, they should not topple over. The bags holding the chess pieces are attractive, but if the pieces are not arranged just right in their bags, the lid of the box won't close completely. Still, excellent value for the modest price.",

The board is quad-fold cardboard, and unaesthetically displays \"Harry Potter\" and \"Wizard Chess Set\" multiple times around the board. If the pieces feel light and cheap, its because bottom of each one is hollow, making the top-heavy pieces able to fall over easily. Also, the knight piece takes up too much room in the space in front of it and causes the pawn to be out of place, very unlike the picture shown. This set is not worth more than $20, you are paying the extra $80 for the name \"Harry Potter.\"",

They are a little top heavy and the bags they come in are a little fragile. The box it comes in is really nice and sturdy. Overall a great set for someone who collects Harry Potter or Chess memorabilia. Not made for a camping trip or anything more than nice table top play and display.",

The Chess Set looks cool and the pieces are designed exactly the same way they appear in the movies. They are plastic but not very cheap. The chess board looks good too. It\u2019s a very cool chess set to have. It\u2019s definitely a head turner!!",

Best thing about that is the small parts of the pieces are flexible so if dropped they don't break right off. With that in mind, if given to a younger person, they may break them off, but that isn't the fault of the maker of this set in my opinion. Overall, very pleased with it compared to the $80+ Harry Potter sets.",
