The two are not really comparable. Water tank in full size only needs filling once and you can change the pressure from 1 to 10. 5 is enough for me at the moment. As you can see it is actually quite compact and doesn\u2019t take up much room on the sink. The portable one is massive and needed filling up 4 times in order to do all of my teeth. My teeth and gums feel super clean so will see what the hygienist says at my appointment today!",

Dont use really cold water, cool/slightly warm is far more comfortable as is working your way up to a higher pressure.

      "text": "Purchased yesterday on next day delivery. I have gum problems; dentist recommendation. Just used it for the first time and my teeth around gum area feel really clean. Was noticing that although I use interdentals, teeth didn't feel clean around the gum area. I believe this is going be a great asset. Bit messy, but was my first use, and quite frankly not as messy as I thought it would be first time.",

I'd no socket or shaver light with socket to plug into in the bathroom so had to use it in the kitchen. That was fine but a bit of a pain. Ended up having a socket installed in a bathroom cabinet so that I dont have to unplug it. Very happy now. Have an electrician install it through as needs specialist consideration: electricity with water can kill!",

      "text": "I've owned probably 5 of these things over the years. As already said, after about two years they tend to break down, which is what happened with my previous one. I was skeptical that the 'new' model was any better than other. But it is. The water coming out feels a little 'thicker' - meaning it's not like a needle of water coming out (something I've experienced previously). It feels to me like my teeth and gums get a better cleaning. Plus, a minor but good thing, the design is well done. I have the white model. In short, if you already have one, and are skeptical, I'd rate this as the best one I've had.",

After a few uses I tried flossing with and then straight away used my old one which dislodged some food matter that the Waterpik had left behind. I have returned it and received a full refund.",
