It's easy to use and doesn't require a Phd in thermodynamics to operate and change modes. It's very tank like to hold and feel. And I love the wireless charging. The magnetic end is very useful when you need to fasten it to something metal. Definitely one of my top 3 flashlight that my wife knows about. Lol. If you are reading this honey, I love you.",

I carry it in my purse or while on shift, in my pocket. It's a fabulous, easy to use, lightweight flashlight. Super bright when needed or just the perfect amount. It charges easily and speaking of charging... I was concerned about waiting until the battery drained to re-charge. I researched this topic and found that I should just keep it \"topped off\". The batteries are reasonable to replace when needed. Buy this, you'll love it as I do. Thank you, Olight!",

      "text": "I bought this flashlight less than two years ago and used it very minimally. Maybe two times per month. Recently the battery has completely failed and will not hold a charge for even five minutes. I contacted olight support who informed me that the battery is supposed to last 500 cycles but is out of warranty. I guarantee I have used 100 cycles of less. Olight will not replace the part and advises me to just buy a new one. For the high price tag I feel the battery should last more than 23 months especially considering I have used it only 50 to 100 cycles, much less than the described 500 cycle life span. Very disappointing.",
