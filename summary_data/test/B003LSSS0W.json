Anyway I suffered with this junk for a year now I'm going to try and pawn it off for a few bucks so I can get a decent press. Bottom line if you need accuracy don't buy this press, you will be be extremely disappointed.",

      "text": "This is a great size for my very small shop. Set up was simple, instructions are clear and easy to follow. It has enough power for hobbyist level tasks. This is the second Skil drill press I've owned; I let the first one get away from me and then discovered that I could really use one. I looked at several others but chose to come back to a proven product. It probably will be inadequate for any jobs that would normally be done on a floor mount drill press, but works great for smaller projects.",

No printed circuit boards, everything I do is point to point wiring and I create my own \"Turret Boards\". Would I buy this again? Yes! Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes!

Changing speeds is done switching belt pulleys. Laser guide is OK not real bright but I use a Magnifying Lamp when I drill so do not use it much. It is very quiet and easy to set up for 'small projects' due to the vertical travel limitations. You need a Floor Mount Press for 'large projects'.",
