I finally decided on these Until I found something better and they were really cheap. They have been great they barely ever have any leaking issues. The nipples had small holes so I poked a fork in them to make them a little bigger for my older daughter. We use them all the time and they\u2019ve never broke. Cleaning these are a breeze. Very impressed, I have ended my search for the right baby bottle after having these.",

When I'm ready to use the bottle I just replace the lid with a nipple. No pouring etc., it's great! Very high quality, thick glass. I've dropped one into our quartz sink and it actually broke a drinking glass but the bottle didn't break. It's great having extra bottles to pump into and I feel much better about heating glass bottles instead of plastic.",

My only complaint is that the lid does not screw on very tightly and if you take it with you in the diaper bag, it may leak. Make sure to put the nipple on the bottle in case you do this, and I also recommend putting it in a ziplock bag to prevent leaks in your diaper bag. Overall great bottles.",

      "text": "If you're looking for glass bottles in order to avoid plastic, these are the best deal for your money! While I do like Lifefactory glass bottles because of the silicone cover, it is $15 for one whereas these are $12 for 6! You just can't beat that price. The only thing I wish is that these were wide mouth bottles because it would be so much easier to pour in formula. Now, I feel like when I go to pour a scoop of formula into the bottle, a lot of it doesn't fit inside and gets all over the bottle/counter. Other than that, I love these and bought both the 4oz and 8oz.",

      "text": "Love these glass bottles. Suggested improvements: make glass lighter, they're quite heavy for little hands. Include a protection cover with this set, I think it's a bit ridiculous that one SINGLE cover is almost the same price as this whole set. Danger: glass bottle broke after accidental drop and glass pieces went everywhere! Pretty scary. If you are going to buy this. Might as well get the protection cover.",

With the new bottles, not even a drop of milk falls onto his chin. I mean, I actually feel guilty I didn't have this earlier for our baby.",

I have dropped several in our stainless steel sink and not one crack! Even if one were to break they are super affordable, and you can buy silicone covers. Also you can fit a variety of nipples in the rings AND the rings fit on similac ready to go bottles. So this has been a great/versatile investment!",

In the case that the bottle get too hot, I can easily cool the bottle by running cold tap water on it. The second purpose of using the glass bottles is to store some MCT oil. Whether there is milk or MCT oil in the bottle, the bottles are very easy to clean and air dry.",
