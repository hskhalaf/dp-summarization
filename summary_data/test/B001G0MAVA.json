I've only replaced one button in a few years and maybe batteries once a year. I drilled the buttons and base unit into concrete block with a hammer drill. Just a small plastic anchor and it's done. The push buttons are on a flat wall with no roof so I put some electrical tape around them to keep out moisture (as seen in the photos). Excellent! Excellent!

We're getting some temps dipping into the negative digits tonight so I'll test to see if the system stops working.

Same goes for the Honeywell motion sensor I purchased along with this -- which rings with a different chime than the buzzer. Wouldn't mind were it less pricey... but for the extra distance and the multi-sensor compatibility I'm one happy camper. I'll probably add a second buzzer to cover another entryway... in fact, I'll add that NOW! Thanks, Honeywell!",
