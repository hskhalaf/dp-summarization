I've been using this product exclusively for a few years and it's never let me down, it's super thick & creamy and foams up a ton so a little goes a long way. The reason I'm rating this as 2-stars is because mine arrived with no cap which makes me fairly hesitant to use it (I checked the box / sorted through all of the packaging to make sure it didn't pop off on accident and it wasn't anywhere to be found.) So this product is 5/5 usually but the handling of it was 0/5 this time around.",

Other shaving creams leave my skin feeling soft, smooth, and hydrated. So I would suggest trying it out, it is the cheapest shaving cream at almost every store (like $2).
