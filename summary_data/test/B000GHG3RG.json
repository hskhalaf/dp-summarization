Perhaps that's how they stay in business, since they are relatively inexpensive. Even just a dark gray color would be so much better.",

      "text": "This wrist brace is elegant looking (compared to standard drugstore models) but it is still a wrist brace! Works pretty well, but I miss the elastic strap around the middle of the wrist that some of my other braces have had. My biggest criticism is that the thumb opening is very small. I had to phase the brace in slowly because otherwise my thumb joint was very irritated by the brace. I have very small hands (usually wear XS gloves) so I was surprised to have this problem. I would recommend looking elsewhere unless you need the aesthetic look of a grey/white brace.",

It's soft, breathable, very comfortable and perfectly supports and stabilizes the wrist. I messed my wrist up crocheting and now type 40 hours a week for work but this prevents much of the pain. The only downside is that the fabric the velcro adheres to loses its integrity rapidly; I've used the brace for maybe six months and the connection is already very weak.",

Cool firm support, but flexible enough to permit full movement for normal work, i.e., typing, writing lifting, etc. Product wraps securely and offers support above and below wrist and velcro has good grip with no unnecessary hanging pieces, and nothing extra to grab onto passing objects. Appears to be easy to handwash. I found this brace excellent because it gave firm all over support, without creating any areas that were overly tight or uncomfortable. Would recommend to any woman needing a smaller wristbrace. The others I used had an \"under wrist metal support\" that was far too long for a normal woman's hand/wrist.",
