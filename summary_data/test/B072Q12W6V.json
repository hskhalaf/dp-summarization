      "text": "I ordered a size up after reading numerous reviews, and the shoes were still too tight so I returned them. I need shoes with a wider toe box. However: this shoe has everything I was looking for: the Vibram sole would provide great traction while bike-hiking; the soles were not overly stiff and it was easy to walk around in them; the outer material appears to be extremely tough and waterproof but most likely not very breathable. I ended up purchasing FiveTen Kestrel Lace ups in my normal shoe size. However, I had to use some shoe-stretcher spray to loosen the right shoe just a bit and now they're great.",

      "text": "After having returned a previous pair of shoes from a different brand due to being too tight, I was nervous about ordering my actual shoe size (11.5US). These shoes are accurate to actual size (although if anything, just on the tiny bit oversized, but maybe it was due to wearing very thin, almost dress socks when trying them on). The clasp does a good job of tightening the shoe for bike rides, but I am concerned about the life-length of the clasp. I also picked this shoe due to the slate blue accent, which turned out to be an almost exact match to my bike. I would recommend this shoe.",

They can really tighten nicely on my slightly narrow feet and I love the ratchet strap. I have not seen that before but it works really well on getting just the right amount of tightness. I have also done some short amount of walking in the woods and they have good traction on rocks and dirt.",

I mean, I use to buy the high-dollar shoes but these work better! Rubber soles vs hard plastic over wet rocks, etc.... Cleat costs are minimal in comparison. Love these!",

I did notice that the outer sole near the crank arm hit the frame occasionally but a small adjustment of the cleat should fix that. I\u2019d probably buy them at full price based on quality and fit. Very happy with the bomber shoe.",
