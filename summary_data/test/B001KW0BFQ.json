Picture was a bit misleading because it shows 7 shelves but only after I received the product did I realize that they are displaying home goods and CD cases, not DVDs. Only fits 5 standing dvd sized shelves per side. Each shelf holds 22-23 dvd cases. Would advise you to measure and mark your shelves (holes) before you install the fixed (stabilization) shelf.",

It got to the point where I couldn't fit anymore in the room and my cd's were in growing in piles on the floor. So, I ordered this and I can't tell you how much cleaner the room looks with 1 central storage unit. It didn't take too long to assemble and you don't need much clearance to spin it. By time I was done moving everything over, I used every shelf. I will order another one when that fills up.",

There was a lot of sawdust, so if you choose to assemble this yourself, be prepared to clean. Love this shelf, though. It easily held our CD's, Blu Rays, and DVDs. It takes up very little space compared to the last shelf I had that didn't even hold everything, and it was fairly easy to put together.",
