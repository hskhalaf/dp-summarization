      "text": "Ordered two of the 36-inch Countryside Flower Box Planters to liven up our bay windows. Hopefully this helps out and does the trick! Planters are made from durable plastic and each have two pre-drilled holes in the bottom for drainage. The Pancea aluminum brackets were used for mounting and had to be ordered separately as the window boxes do not come with anything to mount. All in all, we're very satisfied with this purchase. As far as durability, I'll have to monitor to see how they hold up during the change of seasons.",

I ordered two more, just to be on the safe side, and today went to transfer my plants from the 2-year-old planters to the new planters. As soon as I touched them, the 2-year-old planters shattered into a thousand pieces. I swept up the dirt and put my plants into the new planters, for now, but I will be looking for replacement planters ASAP. These planters are NOT suitable for use outside. Or possibly for anything other than very temporary use.",

I don't have a drill or anything fancy to cut holes out, so I used a switchblade to cut an X into two of the already shaped circles on the bottom of the planter and then I pushed it out with a pair of scissors and circled around the hole and it gave me two perfect circles!

    "title": "Countryside Flower Box Planter, White, 36-Inch",
    "description": "Size:36-Inch| Color:WhiteConstructed from a superior plastic blend, the Countryside Flower Box features a timeless design with a matte finish. The purposeful ridged layers ensure ruggedness and sustainability. These versatile planters can be placed on flower box brackets under windows, on porches and decks, or along walkways. Built-in feet provide proper airflow and reduce the chance of water pooling under the planter. Suitable for indoor or outdoor use. When using outdoors, remove rubber stopper on the bottom of the planter for proper water drainage. Countryside Flower Boxes are lightweight, UV-resistant, recyclable, and proudly made in the USA. Dims: 36\" x 8\"x 6.5\" (L\"xW\"xH\") Soil Capacity*: 13.9 quarts *Soil capacity measured in dry quarts, one inch from top of planter For best results and to sustain healthy plants in a Countryside Flower Box Planter: \u2022 When using outdoors, prior to planting, invert container and remove rubber stopper. Store rubber stopper in safe place to use at the end of growing season. Removing the stopper will allow water to properly drain from the Countryside planter. For additional soil aeration, add a soil amendment such a perlite, small stones, or clay pieces to the bottom\u2014and up to 1/3\u2014of the container. \u2022 When deciding what to grow in the flower box, check the planting instructions for the specific plant species. Follow the directions and, if planting multiple seeds or seedlings, place each plant the recommended distance between each plant to allow enough space between them to grow \u2022 Position the flower box in an area that will receive the recommended amount of sunlight per the plant\u2019s instructions \u2022 Add potting mix to fill the container up to 1\" from the top \u2022 Water accordingly and often, especially in mid-to-late summer, high-temperature months. \u2022 Although the Countryside Flower Box Planter is frost proof and can survive the winter, to promote longevity of the containers, we recommend moving plants and containers indoors. Either insert rubber stopper on the bottom of the planter and grow your plants indoors; or empty the flower box of any residual water or dirt, clean with warm soapy water and store in dry area.",
