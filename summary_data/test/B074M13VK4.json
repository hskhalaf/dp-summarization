Like fat floating at the top of soup. I\u2019ve washed these very thoroughly, multiple times. I do not see this happen with any of my drinks unless they have ice from these trays, so I know it\u2019s not my glasses or soap residue from my dishwasher or anything like that. It\u2019s definitely coming from the ice. Another thing that\u2019s annoying is once you remove some ice, you can\u2019t get the lid back on securely.",

Once clean, these trays have been a great addition to both my scotch, and now my kids have discovered them and they\u2019ve added mint leaves to one of the trays for their drinks. The size at 2\u201d is perfect, the silicone helps the cubes pop out easily. Overall great product and value!",

The lids, however, don't stay on that well, because both they and the tray are flexible, so it doesn't seal very well or stay on. Lids are made from a very soft material that flexes too much, they should have been more rigid. IMO, get the version that has the trays, but don't spend money on the lids.
