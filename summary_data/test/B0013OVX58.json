Try taking 1-2 grams before your workout, if you don't see much effects try upping the dose. Arginine and Citruline both work in the same way to raise nitric oxide, but Citruline works much more efficiently. During the process of being converted to nitric oxide, most of the Arginine is wasted. So next time I'm going to try Citruline",
