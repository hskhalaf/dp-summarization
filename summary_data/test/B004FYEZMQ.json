This results in a truly amazing and graphically incredible game that's really hard to put down. This game's enemies are creatively thought-out, tenacious, and powerful, making the game both more challenging and exciting than its predecessors. I honestly hated the ending like most gamers did, but I can't get over how good the rest of the game is. The DLCs are exciting in their own right and add many hours of gameplay to an already amazing game.",

Yes the originally published ending was a kick to the groin, but if you download the Extended Cut (free), it will feel like a much softer kick in the groin. Still worth it for the co-op multiplayer.

The way they do used games and dlc frankly sucks. Sign of the times I suppose.",

It has great set pieces, plenty of feels and the Reapers are awesome as always. Too bad the ending isn't changed by now but besides that it's pretty amazing. A good ending would of made it perfect though. Go figure.",
