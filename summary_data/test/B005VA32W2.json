      "text": "Just got this in the mail, and need to warn you about the packaging. BEFORE adding your nectar, check that the two bottom pieces are LOCKED together. The picture that I added shows the unlocked position on the left, and the LOCKED position on the right. Very subtle, but critical. I didn't even think to check.... spent an hour wiping up sticky nectar from my floor, rug, counters, and cabinets. When I hung it outside, I immediately got several hummingbirds. It has a very small profile, but holds quite a bit of liquid. As long as you know about the bottom ahead of time, this feeder should be great !",

As the temperatures climb into the upper 80s, the cap expands (and/or the bottle shrinks) and releases the bottle onto the ground below. I have 2 feeders and they both do this.

Not one hummer wanted to bother with it. As soon as the First Nature one arrived, five birds descended on it literally within 30 seconds of putting it up. They like the rim that they can sit on and relax while eating; it looks like a birdie dive bar with several birds perched on it at any given time.",

In addition, it is small enough that you don't waste a lot of food and the food you do put in stays fresh because it must be frequently refilled. However, the liquid container is the cheapest most flexible \"jar\" I've ever seen. Within a week the jar and feeder were falling out of the hanger. Unfortunately after the fourth time it fell out of the hanger it broke for good. Would I recommend it? Absolutely not when there are so many other nice ones out there that have glass \"jar's\" or at least sturdier plastic.",

So, though it is a lower priced model and plastic, it does not leak and works extremely well. As long as my hummingbirds are happy, I'm happy, too. I also use this hummingbird nectar, which they also seem to love. It uses a combination of sucrose and dextrose.All in all, both together seem to be a very winning combination.",

Cleaning it is quick and easy. The ant dam on the top helps a bit, though ants are pretty amazing. They sometimes drop from above, so it is not a complete solution.

Also sits flat on the countertop so it's not rolling around while you're trying to fill it.

By the way, when you clean them after each empties, please remember to dismantle the feeder dish and bottom. Dirt tends to build up in there. Also, when putting feeder back together, just be sure the bottom dish and feeder top are securely fastened before placing on top of bottle. You should have no leakage of bugs in your feeder.

Small thin bottle brush can clean all the individua flower holes from mold that tends to grow. Bought two--one for my home and one for business. Highly recommend.",

I change my feeders almost every day during the warmest days and clean them out with a simple dish mop. I put the flowers into a jar with some detergent, and a good shakeup with rinse does the trick. The whole process takes less than a minute. During the height of the season I skip the flowers altogether to make things simpler. Enjoy the birds without the fuss.",

It hasn't been terribly windy yet, so I don't know how this feeder will handle the wind. There are many ports for the hummers to choose from--considering how territorial these creatures are, I do wonder if more than two hummers (on opposite sides) will eat simultaneously. \"Can't we all just get along?\"",

But after the second time filling, I hung it back on it\u2019s hook, and the entire liquid holding part came unglued or disconnected from the top part with the hook. It fell to the ground and spilled everywhere. I thought it must just need to be snapped back together but after a couple more times of reconnecting the pieces, it just won\u2019t stay together. I even tried only filling part way (to help keep it light weight) and it still broke apart. I\u2019ve had many different styles of regular bird and humming bird feeders. I\u2019ve never seen this happen before. Very disappointed.",
