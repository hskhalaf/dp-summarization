I will say that they protein does what it\u2019s supposes to do, I have noticed I\u2019ve leaned up a bit since adding this product to my daily routine. However, the flavor is NOT good. It\u2019s got that typical whey taste, but it\u2019s so strong it\u2019s almost impossible to mask. It\u2019s also extremely thick so anything you mix it with come out like 3 times the thickness of pancake batter. Overall I wouldn\u2019t purchased again.",

The smaller size is nice because large scoops being dropped into my little blender will send a cloud of powder onto my hand and counter. Other than that, it's protein powder. Not much to say about it.",

He normally always drank the chocolate flavor and this time I ordered him the whipped vanilla powder which had 5 stars and great reviews so that's why I had originally ordered this brand. I highly recommend this product!!!!",
