      "text": "Love the scent, hate the bottle. The bottle is glass, with a fabric sleave that is only attached in a couple places, so it slips up and makes the bottle slip in your hands. I used it only a few times before it slipped out of my hands onto the tile floor and shattered. So lost practically an entire bottle.",

I noted most the smell of honeysuckle and sandalwood but it is hard to separate the complex fragrances it emits. When my wife put it on, I wanted to sink into her neck it was so alluring. I like too that it\u2019s different than the other perfumes she uses. It\u2019s a winner. Classy. I received this sample for free in exchange of my honest opinion.",

It is just a soft and pleasant scent that is nice and perfect for me. Since scent is a personal thing, my advice is go to a local store and sample before you buy. While I like this very much, everyone's body chemistry is different.",

This is a scent that really captures the spirit of London. It is both classic and new, much like the city itself. This is a very feminine fragrance, well-suited to all seasons. I love it.",

It smells expensive and is a little overpowering when initially applied (take caution), however it quickly dissipates into a lovely, light and playful scent. It's not heavy or too musky, but seems like a scent that young or young at heart people would like to wear. A little citrusy, a little spicy and something else...like sunshine. A good gift for the 20-40 year olds in your life. The holidays are coming.",
