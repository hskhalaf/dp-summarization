Only con is they are very dark and darken up everything. Unless it is a very sunny day I don't use them or I just flip them up in shadowy areas.",

Found cheaper alternative but their description did not seem to be certified UV A AND B plus mechanism appeared all plastic which does not last in Phoenix AZ. I bought primarily for driving and in black and they are VERY dark but in the very sunny desert for me was the right choice. Highly recommend.",
