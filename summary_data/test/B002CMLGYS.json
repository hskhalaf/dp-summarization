The reason I give 3 stars is that if your fountain is only 2 inches down, you will need to refill. So, weve had it running 3 days AND have our dripline hooked into it so it fills when the flowers get watered (good tip for anyone that didnt already do this) and it still has needed about a gallon of water a day. We are going to try to reconfigure the pump so it sits lower but as is, expect to refill it every day.",

      "text": "I bought this fountain for my husband when he decided to give the backyard a theme. I wasn't to sure about it. I was wrong! This fountain is SO cute. It looks terrific when it's lit up. We had a fountain before but we were disappointed because there was very little water sound. This is not a problem with this fountain! We love sitting outside and hearing the great sound this little fountain makes. That's the other great feature about this fountain, it's not too big. It is too perfect for smaller areas and gives you a big fountain sound. Everyone who has seen it LOVES it to. I highly recommend this product.",

It just seems as if it would have benefited from an additional coat of paint at the manufacturing level.

From what the manufacturer told me, the timer (that is not from Bond nor recommended by them) shorts out the lights that should run for years. They sent me new lights as it was still under warranty but said the same thing will happen again.",

Good size,super easy to connect, lights works well and the water flow is strong. Im sure you will enjoy it. I did buy the mosquito water tablets since I'm near a lot of woods. I will be storing it in the basement after the season. It does not look like it will handle NE weather.",

The pump is conveniently located so that it is possible to get to it to adjust the water flow without having to take out the water, etc. as with other fountains. The birds love it and we enjoy it.",
