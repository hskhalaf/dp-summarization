I now have 3 trips on the other and now this other bag is also missing a zipper pull. Came off in flight somewhere during luggage handling (I bag check). Have to say I have little confidence in the quality of the brand now and notice that fewer flight attendants use this bag compared to several years ago. I assume that it is the same quality issue. I will be moving on to other brand luggage.",
