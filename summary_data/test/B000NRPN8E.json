However, the only web site we've been able to find says \"no parts for Sierra II\". At this point we have a new, broken awning. If we do find a place to buy a replacement part, I'll update this posting.",

      "text": "So I\u2019ve purchased two of these based on reviews and I have to say I\u2019ve been extremely disappointed. Last year we used at the beach and halfway through our trip the wind got under it and snapped one of the bars that holds up the canopy and ripped through it. I thought maybe they just didn\u2019t put it up correctly so I ordered another this year and the same piece broke. It wasn\u2019t even that windy this year. Frankly that\u2019s quite expensive to get a couple of uses out of it prior to them breaking. Another family left one similar to ours up all day and overnight and it was fine. I will definitely not be buying another one.",

It\u2019s 9x9 feet, almost exactly. That the difference between 100 sf of shade and only 81 sf, or a 20% ripoff. Obviously they know it\u2019s only 9x9. Why LIE? One reason I bought the EZ Up brand was a perceived image of quality and trust. That trust is gone now. Aside from that, the numerous pivots were so \u201csticky\u201d that two adults almost could not get the frame expanded when setting it up. Hoping those pivots loosen up over time, but who knows?

The wheeled carry bag is a nice feature. Have used this for outdoor sporting events/tailgating with no issues. Easy to set up and take down with 2 people.

We have used it for family gatherings, fundraisers, and just about anything you can imagine. If you get these on sale, they are the Cadillac of canopies and you will get years of excellent use out of them. Add a couple of shade walls and you have the perfect set up. These were purchased for a church youth group and I have no doubt we will get many years of durable service out of them.",

That is an enormous difference. It's my fault for trusting the description; if I had read closely I would have seen, \"Angle Leg Design with a 10'x10' footprint, 8'x8' at top.\" Now I have to deal with returning a 32 pound item because of the misleading name.",

Setup really easy. Two minor complaints: The canopy is not seam sealed, so in rain, leaks come through the seam, down the inner velcro. Easy to stop with a swipe of seam seal, but still a hassle. No guy lines if it gets windy. Probably easy to rig something up, but something I would expect to come with.",

The first time setting it up is a little tricky since you need to put the cover on it as you are putting it up. My kids joined in (10 and 9) and they asked if they could do it by themselves next time because it was so easy. I will probably being be buying another one soon. They are easy to put back in the carrier with wheels too. Highly recommended.",

The stakes go into holes on the feet of legs. This wouldn't be a problem if there was no wind. Nowhere, we had to fold up canopy when we experienced even slight winds. In addition, my previous canopy's bag had a zipper down length of bag. This bag only opened at the end & proved difficult, although possible, to slide canopy back in.",

You also have to have 2 people to raise and lower the canopy. The bag is very handy for moving the canopy in and out of the garage as it has casters and a conveniant handle. I do not use the stakes that are included as I use this on my deck and use tie downs and eyebolts to hold it down. Have not tested it in big winds as I always take it down if it gets real windy.

It provides shade, and a meeting place, shelter from rain and falling nuts, can be decorated, and goes up and down pretty quickly if 2-4 people work together. The carrying case wheels are small, so a wagon helps if you need to pull it far on unpaved surfaces. It can be lifted and carried short distances by an adult. Check the case size to see if it fits in your vehicle. Vendors at outdoor markets, who set up on pavement, where it can't be staked, weight the legs on windy days.",
