I purchased this a week before I purchased an actual smoker, I know, impulse buy but I was able to use it on a few chicken thighs. It actually turned out really good but not as good as an actual smoker. The most difficult part was maintaining the charcoal temperature and I only had to replace the wood chips and coal once in the 2 hours of smoking. Placed directly on top of the heated charcoal. Side note: I did not soak my chips. If you ask around they say it's best not to.",

Yes, it gets discolored but it has no affect on the flavor. I had a cast iron one that would rust no matter what I did to season it. I threw it away .",
