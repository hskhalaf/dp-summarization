Plus you get annoyingly specific challenges that are insanely difficult to do. Completing this will be really hard to do, so if you want a time waster, go for it.",

What I mean by that is that a 1 year old can hold the controller and move their character around a bit and not make anybody wait on them to finish (Mario kart). You all share the same screen too so no screen space is given up either for any number of players. You can even set teams to help out the little ones... or set them on their own team, either way. This Super Smash game is great on the graphics and has tons of character options. The gameplay is familiar to old timers of the series and just a great family game!",

For example, Falco's spike is timed differently, so I am constantly mis-timing my spikes with him. I think this was intentionally done to make the game feel different.

The online mode works well enough, but you just can't beat local multiplayer in a game like SSB. I highly recommend this game.",
