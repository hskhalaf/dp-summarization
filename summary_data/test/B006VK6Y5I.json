The Mace Gun sprays in a thin steady stream for about 20 feet and is easy to use. It would be great if the Mace gun had a red dye in the spray so I could have marked the pit bull.",

When you buy a new cartridge they come with one pepper and one water. That is a waste of money, not to mention you will have so many different cartridges you might be carrying the water and not the pepper spray!!!!! That could put your live at risk.",
