      "Traditional one-sided draft stopper for the best seal. They are all we will sell. Be sure to measure. Always purchase a draft stopper that is a little longer than the space to fill. Get a natural pliable filling.",
      "Grown and sewn in the USA \u2013 All-natural chemical free clean buckwheat hull filling. Our buckwheat hulls are an excellent filling because they are a heavy enough and are pliable. No inserted small pockets of beads or sand needed. Even weight along the entire length provides the best seal. Our exclusive winnowing (cleaning) process provides the cleanest hulls possible. Our hull cracking process provides a denser, heavier filling.",
      "No loops. Stoppers long enough to properly seal are too long to hang on a door knob. They drag and get caught in the door. Grab ours in the middle, shift the filling, and hang in the closet. Also, no attaching to the door. Sounds good in theory, but they don\u2019t stay on unless they are very light weight, if one does stay on, it gets dirty from sweeping the floor all day. Dual draft stoppers are small, light and stiff, they are notoriously bad at blocking drafts."
