      "text": "You get to choose the color so that's nice. This Sendt is similar to a genuine Kensington lock in design and ruggedness. You do need a tiny screwdriver to set the combination which many people won't have. You can get a kit of small screwdrivers at many dollar stores. You don't need a high-quality screwdriver here - most people will never need that screwdriver again. The lock is easy to use. The plastic-coated wire is 6' long (too long in my opinion). As always, the thing wants to unwind and straighten itself out when stored in your laptop bag which is annoying. I have another lock made by Kensington that wants to coil itself back up which is much better.",

The cable can rotate freely where it attaches to the locking mechanism, so it's easy to put on and take off of any device. I bought several of these to take on an extended business trip, and used them on a laptop, monitor, and Xbox One. Once it was attached to the device it held on really well and did not feel loose in the security port on any of the devices.",

While they were unable to cut the cable, they WERE able to break the lock away from the laptop. The problem is that the t-shaped Kensington metal locking tab is secured inside the combination lock's barrel with plastic. The thieves just used a large flat-blade screwdriver or pry bar between the laptop's side and the lock to break it away. Quite disappointed that the lock was so easy to break. So I can't recommend this product for anything but security against light-fingered thieves.",
