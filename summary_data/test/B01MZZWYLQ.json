      "text": "I bought these to replace my Beats that got stolen. They're not as light weight, and the strap that sits on top of my head isn't as comfortable. However, the swivel earphones are genius! My ears stick out more than normal people's ears so these fit quite comfortably for longer compared to other earphones. They're wonderful quality. They are noise canceling, which helps me focus at work when I need to shut out the other office noises. They are a great price and I love the sound quality. I love that they can be bluetooth or wired. I would defnitely buy these again!",

I listen to a lot of dubstep and these hit the bass notes extremely well, very comparable to Beats Solo 2's but at an even better price point. Paired via Bluetooth immediately right out of the box, super easy to operate with the on-ear controls. They don't tout \"noise canceling\" capabilities but with music playing, I can't hear anything going on around me. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "Very cheap compared to more expensive alternatives with similar sound quality. Accurate battery life. The headphones also fold up for safe storage. My only gripe with these is that they must be toggled off and on if you didn't have your phone Bluetooth enabled first. If they don't detect your phone on power up they will never connect to it. Also the volume works kind of weird. Pressing the power buttons rasies the volume on your device, making it seem like the headphones are at maximum volume when the phone says max. However the volume can keep going up higher still, but it would be hard to know unless you kept pressing them. Great product otherwise, perfect for the gym!",

Luckily I bought a warranty. I have had to send these headphones back to the manufacturer for replacement, twice now. The plastic housing around the headpiece adjustment has broken, in the exact same spot, twice, on two separate headsets. I believe it\u2019s a design flaw central to this model, as this has happened spontaneously on two separate items, in the exact same place each time. I wish they were designed better, because if they were, they\u2019d be perfect.",

Four stars, not five, to the fact that the headphones don\u2019t feel soooo secure on my head while I\u2019m at the gym. I have to hold it while doing some movements that require lowering my head, like a simple bending to grab a bar on the floor, etc. But on the treadmill, elliptical, bikes, or lifting weights without having to lower my head, no problem at all.",

      "text": "I bought these headphones LESS than 2 months ago. A month and a half in and they have stopped coming on!! I have tried charging it to no avail. Previous to that, the music would consistantly be cutting off and coming back on while I listened. The sound quality of these headphones are excellent, but they clearly have a lot of issue refurbishing them. I saw a previous review about this happening to someone else and I still took the chance and lost out",

I have a large head (7 3/4 hat size) and these fit comfortably. First day I bought them I listened to them for 8 hours straight with no discomfort. I love the portability of these headphones since they fold up nicely.",

You need about 50% or lower volume to experience a decent sound. Durability and battery life was great. Had these for More than a couple months and charged my headphones twice",
