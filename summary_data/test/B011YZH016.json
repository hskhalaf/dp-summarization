Their faces don't look right- Rapunzel's is painted on funny....Eugene's nose is giant and bends at a very odd angle. He looks like his face is eternally smashed up against a window. Sadly i'll be returning this. My daughter looked at it, and couldn't believe it was supposed to be the Tangled characters. She asked me to return it",

It was clearly used and the container did not look really clean, it was all foggy inside and the pieces were kind of everywhere in there. But the actual figures were in fine shape so it didn\u2019t matter much after that.",
