He can go get in it and calm himself down much faster than before we had it. The fabric seems really strong and washed well in the washer. I hung it up to dry and it was just as soft as before we washed it. I\u2019ve hung it several different ways and it works well no matter how you set it up. I\u2019m very pleased with this swing and definitely recommend it.",
