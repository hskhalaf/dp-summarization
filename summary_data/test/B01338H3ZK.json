      "text": "Let me start by saying I LOVED everything about this shoe....for 4 rounds of golf. Round number 5 was today and the love affair is over. The entire toe assembly came apart where the leather meets to sole. These are meant to be quality shoes and I have had other Skechers that have been fantastic (though this is my first pair for golf). Of course, now I've had them for a number of months I can't return them, so its frustrating. If I had played months of golf in them, fine, things wear out, but literally I played 5 rounds and rode in a golf cart the entire time.",

The shoes grip the turf well during the swing, with the added bonus that there are not soft spikes that wear out in a matter of weeks. I found the shoes to be very comfortable, so much so that I would have walked a few more holes after the front nine if I wasn't pressed for time. My goal is to eventually walk 18 holes on our local championship course, and with these shoes I feel that will happen sooner rather than later. No foot fatigue at all.",

Did not notice any of the \"squeaking\" that others have complained about. Bought these for those\"heavy dew\" early morning rounds and wet day golf- Will defiantly augment these shoes with a pair of non-waterproof Sketchers for those really hot days of golf!!",

These are just $100 cheap sneakers. I am an avid tennis player and learned the hard way that you need a much firmer sole if you want to protect your feet. These are going back.",

They are still snug but I believe going a half size larger would have been too much. The better solution I have found is to wear a thinner sock than usual.

Let it dry overnight and reinstall laces. This eliminates the \u201csqueak\u201d that is common with this model. Really a great golf shoe for the price.",

However, there aren't many shoes you can pull out of the box and walk 18 holes and be comfortable the first time. These are great shoes once you get past all the additional noise that they create.",

Great traction for a spikeless shoe. Insole has too much cushioning unless you have a foot problem, then I'm sure the excessive padding would be appreciated. Just too soft to really use ground forces.",
