I would totally recommend this charging as it is the perfect solution for charging multiple devices.",

It comes with a built-in Smart IC USB charging ports, so I don't have to figure out if it charges at 2.1A on a iPhone or to apply a low slow charge at 1A for other devices. There is plenty of room for various devices including charging power-banks. Works perfect as described, and if the price is right, this may be for you. Recommended. I will update this review if needed to share more experiences and therefore a frame of reference. If you found these extra photos useful, please take a moment to click YES below. Thanks.",

There are two iPhone places and two androids places in addition to the wireless charging pad. I needed that versatility since I don\u2019t know what people will need during their stay. Since we have five Apple devices, I use other cables that I have to charge the rest of ours. After using it for a couple of weeks, I have found that it charges well in each of the spots. What is even better is that it was about $10 less than another one that I was considering.",

I especially like the non-slip material the top of the unit is covered in, as it keeps smaller devices from falling off. The wireless charging pad is very nice to have, I just throw my iPhone X on it whenever I'm going to be in that area for a time. The coloring matches our kitchen decor, and the short cables included help in keeping clutter to a minimum.",
