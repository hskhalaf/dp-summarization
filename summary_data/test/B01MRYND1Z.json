Once he stopped workng i was amazed as to how quickly the floor was covered with dog hair. He has since been fixed and returned to us as healthy as when we first got hm. He runs everyday cleaning our wood floors and rugs",

I can't say enough about this product. This is the best thing I have bought myself, ever. It's so good that I told my sister about it and she bought one too. We love it! Thank You.",
