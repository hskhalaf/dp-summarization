Takes a few tries to get used to how the tip spins but we found it's better to barely let the tip hit the surface... if you press too hard it makes squiggly lines from how the tip spins. Nice alternative to my wood burning tool especially since my kids can use this. Don't expect it to look like you paid for engraving at Things Remembered, but for little jobs it gets the job done.",
