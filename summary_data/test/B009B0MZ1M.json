      "text": "I also own the Canon G-12, which I have been very pleased with, because it takes stunning pictures for a point and shoot camera. However, I wanted a better zoom in a point and shoot, so that I could get closer to subjects such as birds. This camera does that beautifully. What a thrill to be able to zoom in and focus on a bird's eye! The camera is light, compact, and simple to use. All I want to do is to just take pictures quickly when I see something I want to capture, without a lot of fussing with lenses and settings, etc. Perfect camera for me.",

This camera surmounts all of that frustration as it is actually a hand-held computer that happens to take excellent digital pictures and videos. It's smart and allows me to concentrate my attention upon the subject at hand. I love that I do not have to carry extra lenses, but can rapidly change from wide angle to telephoto without degradation of image. I bought this rather than a newer model because I did not feel the need an escalation in megapixels which reduces image quality in low-light conditions.",

After practicing with this camera, I have people with much more expensive cameras asking me what I purchased based upon the quality of pictures it produces. It can be point and shoot or you can play with much more advanced settings. More importantly, although bigger than a \"pocket\" camera, this camera has one (very flexible) lens that makes it much lighter and more compact than many costlier camera systems. If you want a camera that allows you to take great pictures but is still small enough to actually carry with you on family trips and vacations, this is a great choice!",

      "text": "This camera's biggest selling point is its 24 - 1200mm optical zoom. From its widest to its closest distance, the quality is surprisingly solid. In daylight, the autofocus performs well. The poorest aspect of the camera is its internal viewfinder. It's difficult to view any image distortion-free, which makes the manual focus option problematic. The flip-out viewfinder, which also rotates nicely, provides an acceptable but not dazzling image. The camera's menu is a little congested, and it's easy to launch a menu item while rotating the menu/iris wheel while prepping for a shot. The reason for owning this camera is its 1200mm lens, and on that account it meets expectations. It's a good adjunct camera for a DSLR shooter.",

I don't like carrying around a DLSR camera because it's too heavy. This one is point-and-shoot and the quality is good and sharp enough for what I want.

      "text": "I recently upgraded from the SX30 for the greater zoom, and also bought a T3i DSLR. I wasn't crazy about the SX30 because of some yellow tint in some photos, which I now realize was probably due to white balance issues. So let's talk about zoom. I compared the zoom on this little baby to my DSLR with a 100-400 mm DSLR lens with a 2 x extender, about $2,000 worth of lenses. Well, I found the SX50 actually took a sharper picture, and this is in a very low light environment. I could not be more impressed. Go Canon! It makes me wonder why I bothered investing thousands of dollars into my DSLR and associated lenses.",

I like taking pictures of the moon and they are just brilliant.

And 2nd, why was Canon so cheap and put a bayonet mount on the lens instead of the normal thread on for filters? All filters have threads, so why would you NOT put threads on the lens? Just plain stupid.",

The sensor must be greatly improved over the last few years as I get much better images at higher iso's. The stability control is also rather impressive. I didn't need the camera. I was impulsive to buy it. Not my smartest financial decision. I am so glad that I did. For me it is a great camera.",

The zoom is amazing, the clarity phanominal, and very, very user friendly. Still pretty light even for a larger camera. I absolutely love the consecutive shots I can take when the dogs or kids are playing in the sports mode you never miss a goofy face or the perfect jump with the dogs.

HDMI output allows you to view and share your video on an HDTV immediately, simply by connecting the camera to the TV with an optional HDMI cable. \n\nFASTER FOCUS AND HIGH-SPEED SHOOTING\nHIGH SPEED AF GREATLY IMPROVES FOCUS SPEED AND HIGH-SPEED BURST HQ ALLOWS FOR CONTINUOUS CAPTURE AT A MAXIMUM OF 10 FRAMES* WHILE MAINTAINING SUPERB IMAGE QUALITY.\nThe PowerShot SX50 HS is equipped with Canon's latest advancement in AF technology: High Speed AF. The result of several improved technologies, High Speed AF delivers significantly faster focus speed of 0.19 seconds and a dramatically reduced shooting lag time of only 0.25 seconds, for a super-responsive shooting experience that lets you capture every great shot as it happens. The technology also powers the camera's new High-Speed Burst HQ, with continuous capture at a maximum speed of approximately 13 fps. Moreover, images captured in High-Speed Burst HQ maintain the camera's superb image quality.\n\n*The continuous shooting speed is approximately 13.0 fps.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION.\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX50 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. Dynamic IS has been enhanced to provide better performance than ever before, now compensating for rotational movement centered on the optical axis in addition to horizontal tilt and vertical pitch, for beautifully clear and steady video.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. CONVENIENT SHOOTING FLEXIBILITY\nBRIGHT 2.8-INCH VARI-ANGLE LCD WITH 461,000 DOTS FOR SHOOTING AT A VARIETY OF ANGLES, PLUS AN ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER.\n The PowerShot SX50 HS gives you lots of ways to frame a great shot.
