Zero amazon shipping packaging...the rifle arrived in the beat up display box, with one small piece of styrofoam inside, and as a result, the rear open sight mount was damaged. Fortunately, this seems like it can be repaired, but it shouldnt need to be. The seller and/or Amazon, was careless in the handling and shipping of a firearm. Disappointed to say the least. That being said, you can\u2019t go wrong with a Diana 34.",

Next I mount a UTG scope and UTG compensator mount for 34 to help with barrel droop. I used two 1\" scope rings as recommended by other air gunners. Tighten all the screw after applying blue lock tight. You will not be disappointed with this rifle. It sighted in beautifully after a two or three tries. RSW has build a great gun for a low price, I would recommend this rifle to everyone.",
