The USB port does charge your phone as well. Now, its not going to blow your hair back or anything, but it does just fine for a golf cart. I broke my trim ring when trying to install and need to contact Pyle for another one, other than that, easy install. It was my fault, tried to force it. At this price point, you will be very happy.",
