I also keep a pack of disposable wipes and a few other small things in this basket. It's so perfect for grabbing and diapering somewhere like your living room so you don't have to go all the way to the changing table.",

Compartment divisions are reinforced so they maintain their shape. Would definitely purchase again, especially for the gift basket ideas which are adorable.",

Really all you need in a diaper caddy is space for diapers, wipes, and a tube of diaper cream. This is better served stationary to store a bunch of items instead of lugging it around the house. The handle folds down which is nice for storing, but it actually becomes a bit unsteady when the basket is full. I use my less expensive Eddie Bauer diaper caddy from Target instead.",

A collapsible handle is attached on either end, and a heavyweight, 100% cotton liner completes the sleek, sophisticated design. Keep everything where you need it, when you need it - the basket has enough storage space to hold a baby wipes container, diapers, ointments, burp cloths and swabs. Makes a great baby shower gift and can also be used as a base to build your own gift basket.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nEach SaraBear Diaper Caddy by Munchkin starts with a custom shaker style basket in a tight weave of real wood. A handle is attached on either end of the basket and can be collapsed to lie along the side of the basket. Each liner is made from a heavy-weight, 100% cotton fabric.
