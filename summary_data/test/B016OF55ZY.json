      "text": "Great looking but, super cheap materials and bad quality do not justify the price. If you remove the very thin insert there is no padding of any kind, it is seriously your foot against the sole. As others mentioned the stitching was all over the place and the eye holes were not lined up correctly. If you want a better shoe with the same build quality get a pair of Chuck Taylor Converse. Better build at a lower price and at least with Cons you know what you are getting.",

The leather holds its form, the laces are thick and stay in place. The sole is really solid rubber, and provides effortless drive to my pedals with no loss of force. I\u2019d recommend these as everyday shoes, they\u2019re mine now.",

After taking them out i notice a small rip in the lining between the inner part of the shoe and the sole where the red is visible. My insert is thick enough for me to get by without feeling it though. Overall the shoe is good but its almost like all the shoes, based on others experience too, were rejected from storefronts because of subpar/brand quality hence the price cut. I bet if i paid the $120 at zumies for the shoe it would be mint though.",

Good for cruising around on a board or also great for doing tricks as well. They are flexible so you can get good scoops in on your board for the shuvits and any other trick involving a scoop. Have been skating this pretty hard and they\u2019ve still been holding up just the regular wear and tear but all the stitching is still in place and no sole or side seperation.",
