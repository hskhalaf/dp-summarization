I'm amazed that it scored 4.2 stars as the coffee produced is EXTREMELY weak tasting. Even when I used two pods, with the smallest (5 oz. ?) cup setting, the coffee was still very weak. Obviously, using two pods per cup defeats the original price per pod advantage when compared to other \"Medium Roast\" pods available. (I'm going to check if I can return the remaining unused pods (77 of the 80 received) to Amazon for a refund.)",

Of course, I turned to Amazon (where - let's be honest - I buy almost everything anyway). While searching for the brand name coffee, I stumbled across this Amazon Basics variety. I was skeptical. But, after reading some other reviews, I decided to give it a try. It's really good! It has a mild vanilla flavor that's not \"in your face\" or overly-sweet but doesn't taste burned like some coffee does. And, the price is very economical for how many K-cups are included. I will be buying this product again.",

On top of the outstanding taste, the price per pod is also very reasonable. Can't give this 5 stars for \"presentation\" because they come loose in a plain cardboard box, but this is 5-star coffee on what's really important--flavor and cost.

I think of that sort of flavor as generic -- without the depth and character of, say, Sumatra; and without the punch of French or Italian roast.

      "text": "I bought this coffee because it was a great value. It was pretty good coffee. I know kcups can not always brew the best cup of coffee but I really enjoyed the flavor. This coffee was not over roasted, no ground up tire flavor. I am more a light roast person, but really thought this was nice coffee. It was not as great as Blue Mountain Coffee, my personal favorite coffee, but still a good cup of coffee. I would purchase this again.",

I can recommend Amazon Fresh Fair Trade Sumatra and Peru in the regular (not decaf) varieties for the same reasons.
