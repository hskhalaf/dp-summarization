We bought both black and blue. He wanted blue but the link he texted me came over as black so that\u2019s what I ordered. Ended up ordering blue too but those went back because the blue didn\u2019t match his school blue and he didn\u2019t get the coach\u2019s approval . Not UA\u2019s fault so no stars off for that.",

He 'graduates' this year so it's very sad that everything he was looking forward to has come to an abrupt end. But these shoes are nice and he matched is shoe size (in the USA) and they fit exactly as we expected.",

This shoe is big enough but because it has the higher top and the velcro helps keep his feet in place. I was wary of getting white but it does clean up pretty well. Some of the material does not want to clean off as well as I had hoped with a rag which is why I wouldn't give it 5, but definitely a high quality shoe and would recommend.",
