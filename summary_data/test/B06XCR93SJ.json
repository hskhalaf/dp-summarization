They replaced the TV with a 2 year old refurbished TV (which has vertical banding on screen. Sony will do nothing about this. Expected when gets old !) Warranty is useless. Essentially paid full price for a 2 year old defective refurbished TV. Complete scam. Be aware of Sony tactics. Recommend stay away low quality company. If you decide to buy Sony good luck its a gamble as the warranty is useless.",

Only nit is that I wish the remote was backlit and the play/pause buttons are too small--not a good design for cord cutters and Android TV.
