It's a huge upgrade from the first in the series, with extended maps, more content, new characters with the addition of quests to keep you occupied. It is far harder than the first but definitely more fun. Popcap are extremely responsive to customer queries like certain classes being too OP, and they have already announced that they will be changing it to make classes more balanced. Great plus in my opinion.",

The game keeps on switching to the intel card that crashes it and until I work out how to update it , (I am having several issues here), than the game will not work. Can't disable it neither. If I had just the Nvidea card I would be fine. Check your system before buying and look at the internet threads to see just how many people are having similar problems.",
