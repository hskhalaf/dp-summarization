By the first week of March, the steam button wouldnt come back up after being pressed. By then, it was too late to return it. Either I was sent a defective iron, or the quality truly is what I've experienced...I may never know. In both cases, I lose.

If you get one that makes that clicking noise, don't let them tell you that it's normal. Exchange it for a new one. The exchange process was super easy and fast. Love this iron.",

If you need to iron more than a few pieces at a time, never get this unless you have strong muscles (add the water, it gets even heavier!!!).",

If you do a lot of steam ironing you might prefer a steam station iron with larger water capacity. You will be filling this one frequently which wasn't a bother for me. The only real gripe is the temp setting wheel is too large and is easily bumped when grabbing the handle which changes the irons temp. I see other reviews mention this issue also. This could easily be a problem if ironing delicate fabrics with lower heat setting and inadvertently changed to high. This was more of a concern for me than running out of water too frequently.",

The handheld iron\u2019s integrated electronic steam pump delivers a substantial burst of vertical steam (up to 210g) and pushes up to 30% more steam into material (compared to steam irons with no pump), ensuring fast, effective removal of wrinkles from all types of fabrics. A handy LED digital display illuminates for linen, cotton, wool, silk, or nylon to indicate when the soleplate has reached the appropriate temperature for the selected fabric. The iron\u2019s Microsteam stainless-steel soleplate provides 400 steam holes for even steam distribution and includes an ultra-thin silicate coating for scratch-resistant strength and nonstick gliding to protect even the most delicate of fabrics. A smart steam motion sensor turns off variable steam when the iron stops moving, conserving water and electricity. Even more, the iron\u2019s precision tip makes easy work of maneuvering over collars, along seams, and in between buttons, and the precision-shot function allows for a concentrated shot of steam at the top of the soleplate tip. For safety and peace of mind, the iron shuts off automatically after 8 minutes if left unused in the upright position and after 30 seconds if tipped over or left in the horizontal position. Other highlights include one-touch controls, a cool spray mist for extra-stubborn wrinkles, an integrated anti-calcium system, and a self-clean system for long-lasting performance. From household linens to personal wardrobes, make a good impression with help from the Rowenta SteamForce steam iron. The anti-drip system helps prevent spitting and leaking when thermostat is on a low setting.",
