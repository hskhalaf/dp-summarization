I purchase 2 of them and set them up (which is quite easy) but couldn't get them to appear in my Smartthing app. I couldn't find it anywhere. I contacted Samsung and am disappointed these are not \"officially\" Samsung. It's a different division and they are not supported by Samsung. I find this VERY deceptive by both Samsung and Amazon. The cameras work and have a good picture.. but will not ever be compatible with Smartthing as it's not made nor supported by Samsung. Not sure if I will be keeping these. BEWARE",

It was moving on it's own. I sent it over to Samsung to get it fix and supposedly the camera was fix. However, a month later the camera started to have connection issues to my router. Works about a few days until I have to reset it again. My camera is out of warranty and it will cost to much to get it fix. It's best for me to just buy a different brand of camera.",

The gears grind and there is loud clicking noises coming from within during setup. Totally opposite of my previous camera. The setup could not be completed thru the smartcam app because some fault in the camera would allow discovery of the camera but not connect or function. I am returning this product/",

The auto tracking is a nice additional feature, which initiates a record event and supports message notifications. After 30 seconds of non-movement, the camera position is restored to \"Home\" position. The Pan movements, when auto-tracking, needs improvement (manual Pan is smooth, but auto-tracking is choppy). My video playback stutters on high-res mode, so resolution adjustment was required for smooth local playback.",

The resolution is superior to other cameras and it works from outside your home wireless network, which unfortunately was not true with other cameras I tried. The SmartCam also avoids monthly subscription costs by storing images on memory cards, and it provides pan, tilt, and zoom. All in all it is a very reasonably priced camera with a host of options.",
