If not, they're the best fakes I've ever seen and close enough that I don't care, since they cost a fraction of the retail price. On the sizing: if you generally get larger sized sunglasses, these will fit you. I.e. don't assume these will be the right size if you wear 55mm aviators, because the measurements on the frame are different; I wear 62mm aviators and these fit me perfectly.",

Then I went online here and purchased them for $70.00 usd cheaper. Great right? The problem is the pair I looked at in the store were apparently women's and I ordered the men's. The shape of the lenses and the way they form to your face is different. I tossed the box and tags or I would have retuned them.",
