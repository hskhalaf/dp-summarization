This carafe is a bigger brother and if you follow the directions in pre-temping the pot it will keep beverages cold or hot. Also pumping harder really doesn't help, just pump with steady force and just to let you know the spout likes to drip one drop after I take the cup away and that is the only down side. I'd give it five stars but it is too early yet.",

It can be a little challenging to clean as the top is connected to the thermos and kept slipping shut on me as I was trying to wash it out. But I am already thinking of buying another of the same model to have one for regular and one for decaf coffee!",
