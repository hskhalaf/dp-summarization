One thing to be aware of is that the planters are much smaller on the inside than the outside, so there is not really 3 feet worth of planting length. Over all they seem to be doing their job, and depending on how they survive the winter I may purchase more to line the ends of the balcony.",

      "text": "Installed under a southern exposure window & warping in the heat. Yes, getting a black window box was probably not the smartest in our heat but I expected it to last longer than a year. Self watering only works for deep rooted mature plants that can reach down far enough to access the moist soil. Daily watering is still required for annuals, which is what window boxes are primarily planted with. Wasps love to make nests in the space between the window box overhang & house so beware. I'm hoping to fill the area with vinyl boards to prevent this.",

They look beautiful and are so lovely filled out with my spring/summer flowers. The self watering feature is new to me and has saved the plants during the intense summer heat. The install wasn't difficult, but does require measuring and accurate bracket placement. Once the brackets are up, the planters slide right into place. So glad I found these!!!",

After the first day of rain there was so much water in the planter that my flowers were floating/ drowning. After manually removing the water twice due to flooding, I drilled holes through the bottom of the planter so excess water could drain out. This defeated the purpose of the reservoir but it\u2019s still a nice planter box for the cost.",
