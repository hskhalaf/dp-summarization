I have a neuromuscular condition that makes it difficult to grip anything for more than a couple minutes at a time. It used to take 20 minutes, with multiple pauses for the pain, to shred 12 ounces. This rotary grater is so easy to use. In less than 2 minutes, I've shredded more than we can use for a couple of meals. Its great for using up all those small, hard to grate pieces. All without the risk of shredding your nails or knuckles!",
