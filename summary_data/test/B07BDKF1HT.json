Be sure to have 99% alcohol on hand for cleaning the resin tank of your printer, the prints, and any spillage. If you're using this with a Sparkmaker printer, also be sure to have a set of strong uv lights to finish the curing process. This resin should finish with an opaque and hard surface. Any amount of tackiness left on your prints is just a matter curing and cleaning.",

Had my first print and overall it was an ok print. Yes, a build error occured and the model is missing some features. I think I might have caused the error also \ud83d\ude11. After I removed the part I noticed the material color is more amber than clear. Even when cool white led lights are shined through the part it glows amber (warm white). In the marketing the parts do not appear these color. My resin was produced November 2018",
