Luckily my story has a happy ending and he was hiding in my parking lot and ran out howling hysterically when I came over, but I got very, very lucky. A scared cat is ridiculously fast and you may never see yours again.",

      "text": "My kitten LOVES to go outside and for rides. After trying a few harness brands, a girl at my local pet store suggested I try this brand. They didn't have the right size, so I got it here. It's awesome. It took a bit to figure out how to put it on, and there is a learning curve to harnessing the cat in, but once we got past that, it works great. If my kitten hears me take it down she runs to the door. It allows her to go outside safely. She loves to play in my flower beds and chase butterflies! I even take her with me on short car rides to the park. It's been great.",

I like that it slips over the head rather than having holes for the legs. Unfortunately one of the plastic sliders broke about two weeks in so I have to over-adjust the other side to make it tight enough. Parts of the webbing are already fraying as well.",

I am guessing the large will accommodate approximately 16 to 22 pounds.",

The adjustable sternum slide allows you to create a custom fit for your cat's body type, while the dual adjustment points on the girth strap allow a snug, safe fit. The shoulder straps glide through the two D-rings on the back, allowing an increase of tension (when needed) to restrain your cat without choking.
