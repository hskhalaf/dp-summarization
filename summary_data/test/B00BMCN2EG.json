The water cup satyes filled for about an hour. For me the drain tube works well because I use the grinder in a laundry sink. But if you intend to use this on a table top you will want it sitting in a pan or something similar for it to drain into.",

You really need to use a sponge or the water sprays all over the place but that is hardly a draw back. I also like that there is a cap over the post. This keeps any water from getting into the motor casing. The platform is close to the wheel so small pieces are still supported on the platform - no other tool is needed to hold them for grinding. I haven\u2019t tried the tilt yet but so far I would highly recommend this grinder. Absolutely love it!",

There is a drain hole in the water catch basin so it is difficult to put enough water in the basin so you can eliminate the the feed apparatus. If there was a plug to fit into the drain hole, I didn't receive it. The grinding bit that was sent with the grinder is too large and doesn't grind a smaller curve that might be needed within the design of the glass.",
