      "verdict": "The Altra Provision 3.0 is a moderately-cushioned running shoe ideal for road and light-trail running. It is designed for runners who need extra support. Many runners applauded the enhanced fit, comfort and breathability of the shoe, but there are also a few who found the shoe to be smaller and less durable. Overall, the Provision 3.0 is still considered by some as a successful update.",
      "pros": [
        "Some runners appreciate the new design and overall construction of the Altra Provision 3.0",
        "Most runners found the Provision 3.0 breathable and comfortable",
        "The quick-drying mesh in the upper works efficiently, as noted in some reviews",
        "It has a wide toe-box that promotes natural toe splay",
        "Many runners noticed the enhanced support that the shoe provides",
        "Overpronators liked the redesigned Guide Rail technology that helps reduce excess pronation",
        "The stability is perceptible, in a good way, based on the comments of a handful of runners",
        "According to some testers, this is the first Altra that looks like a \u201cnormal\u201d shoe, despite the FootShape toe box",
        "Multiple color options available"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A couple of runners mentioned that the sole of the shoe is not durable",
        "A handful of runners felt like it is a tad smaller than the earlier version of this shoe",
        "A few expert reviewers noted that it required considerable break-in time"

I wear a 10 but these seemed short. They are also very stiff and the arch is really overstated. I wore them around the house and my right foot was starting to hurt in the arch. They are very light but though. Not the right shoe for me.",
