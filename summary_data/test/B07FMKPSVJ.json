Also, the toasting levels on the adjustment dials are difficult to see. They are black numbers on a shiny chrome dial.

Plain brown box, no brand (certainly not \"Cuisinaid\") on the packaging, insert, or item. No. At this price point, I'll buy one of the actual brands that this is attempting to invoke.
