The pattern is very nice and it is comfortable enough compared to other lower priced anti-fatigue mats, but both have not held up at all. The top layer is not thick enough and has torn in several places. The smaller piece actually has chunks that have come up from it. I only wear flats, sneakers, and socks so I it is simple wear and tear, not something like a high heel or other shoe issue. Very disappointing considering I really liked them. I would have expected them to last much longer and would not purchase again.",

After opening them and placing on the floor I notice both have a hugh wrinkle at the end of the rugs (this is where the smallest part of the rolled rugs were) The rugs have flattened during the day, but the wrinkles are still very noticeable. It looks like the rubber crease goes all the way through the rugs. I have ordered other padded mats and have not had this problem. Going to give it a few days. If still there I will be returning them.",

The least high in traffic was the one that faded, but the other one in front of the fridge which is a high traffic area when you have teenage boys looks good.
