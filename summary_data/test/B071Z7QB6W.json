People frequently ask where I got mine and express a desire to get one, too. The only downside is the variety of designs...It\u2019s impossible to choose! Once you have one, guarantee you\u2019ll want more!! Great gift item, especially since most people have never seen an umbrella like this. They\u2019re unusual, useful, and affordable. What could be better? Other benefits: No need to lean them against the wall because they stand upright independently. You can hook the C-shaped handle over your wrist and still have both hands free for something else.",

The design is fantastic and it makes so much more sense when entering and exiting a vehicle over the traditional designed umbrella.

The handle had an internal manufacturing defect that caused it to break when it slid down the wall where it had been propped up and hit the wood floor. I contacted customer service at Bagail and they had me send photos and then agreed to replace it. No issues and prompt correspondence. Thanks again Bagail!",

Handle is comfortable, like that it can hang on my wrist if needed with out falling off. Light weight. It does stand on it own, so you can sit where you want to dry. I can get in and out of my car without get the inside of the door wet. Have used it on a windy day yet, but the way it is made i think the wind will not effect it.",
