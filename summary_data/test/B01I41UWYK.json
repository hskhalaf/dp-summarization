I know times will differ with different baby\u2019s but honestly once the kid is out she stays out till the morning. The swaddle is easy to use with the use of the zipper and the Velcro for those of us that can\u2019t do the old fashion way. Five stars buy it !",

I tried to reach out to the company but they never bothered to contact me back. For $30 I expected it to last longer than a month!",

      "text": "My daughter needs to be swaddles to sleep- period. We have tried lots of different swaddles and she likes this one the best. It leaves plenty of room for her legs without bunching them up, while still keeping her arms swaddled. I also love that it can be used to transition out of swaddling or even with their legs out. The print is gorgeous and we have received so many compliments from visitors on it.",
