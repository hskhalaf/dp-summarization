      "text": "After many years of working with a small portable router table this was a much needed upgrade. Assembly was very straight forward and simple. I highly recommend getting the Kreg PRS3000 lift with this table. I use it in conjunction with the INCRA MTL2 joint guides to cut box joints. The plastic measure guides slide right into the fence rai without any problem and stay in place while cutting multiple joints. I only wish the dust collection hose adapter was a little better. It has a tendency to unclip when adjusting the fence. When cutting box joints this is a bit of a hassle.",

As a result, one of the screws stripped out while tightening it, the others I\u2019ve only tightened slightly for fear that they will strip out also. As a result, the fence has some play and gets out of square with respect to the table until it's locked down...I have to check end-to-end square with each adjustment (probably a good idea anyway)! Also, when the out-feed FENCE FACE is extend out fully to the left, the T-knobs interfere with the Fence-lock handle, necessitating the use of a screwdriver to tighten.",

I have not drilled the top plate yet for my particular router, but directions seem easy enough. Hopefully I'll get it finished tomorrow.

Once you have it correctly adjusted, it slides easily with little or no racking, and a fine-adjustment wheel lets you adjust the fence inward or outward in millimeters. If you're building a cabinet to support the Kreg router table top and fence, be aware that you'll need a minimum of 1-1/4\" overhang on the infeed side, and 1-3/4\" on the outfeed side to clear the fence mounting and locking mechanisms.",

The locking casters are very sturdy and provide a stable work table when locked. I would purchase again.
