      "text": "The first day out plowing, the cable on this winch snapped. It was lifting a 48\" plow blade with 6 inches of powdery snowfall. It broke about 6\" above the hook. I never saw a cable snap before accept when my buddy was pulling out a jeep that was stuck 3 feet deep in mud. The seller is great, the shipping was fast, but disappointed in WARN for not making a better cable. This should not have happened for the life of the winch. Would I say not buy this winch? Heck no, it works great, but be prepared to have a spare cable handy in a snow storm.",

      "text": "I bought this to replace a Warn winch CE 4.0 that was 10 years old. The previous one was mounted onto the front hitch of a Polaris Ranger UTV and then I switched it to the front of a Kubota X900 RTV. The motor finally gave out so this new one is now on the front hitch of my RTV. i didn't have to replace any of the wiring from the old winch - just swapped out the winch itself. No need to change bolt holes, either. So far (after a few uses over the past couple of weeks) it's working great.",
