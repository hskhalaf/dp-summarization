This little gem allowed us to move a few things from one suitcase to another to make sure all stayed under the limit. Certainly worth the cost to save on future over the limit charges.

      "text": "I tested this scale with calibrated 25-pound weights. 25 pounds registered 24.9 pounds and 50 pounds registered 50.0 pounds. This scale is lightweight and easy to use. Well, you have to be able to lift the weight. It also has a tare feature if you want to weigh things besides luggage, I guess. Using this will be better than trying to use the bathroom scale, or on the return trip finding out you are a few pounds over.",
