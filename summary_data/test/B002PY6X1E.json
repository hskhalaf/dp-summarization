      "text": "So finally I bought Breville Panini maker after due consideration and comparing with various other products. It serves the purpose and is very useful for a family of 4. In one go I can make 4 sandwiches/ open toasties. However after few uses I realize that the base gets heated up after using it twice and the bread starts getting burnt. So you need to let the machine cool down a bit before you can use it again. which i guess is not so bad. No smoke, no smell and easy to use. I like it and can't wait to experiment more.",

Takes little space and can be conveniently stored in a kitchen cabinet. I own a coffee maker from Breville and they again didn't disappoint!",

They provide also a booklet with lots of recipes. I have the Breville smart oven for a year and half and I know this will be durable also.",

Thicker breads or rolls take some extra time and had to be moved a few times. The top really isn't heavy enough to flatten them out. It's easy to clean even with melted cheese.",

I am completely satisfied with this model that has met all my needs. It is ridiculously easy to clean and store, although I keep it on a cutting board to absorb the heat on one of my kitchen countertops. This model may be a bit expensive, but the features more than compensate for that. I highly recommend it.",

You can't remove the heating elements but the non stick surface comes clean with a damp paper towel. BTW, it also makes great paninis.",

He has also done quesadillas, eggs and some veggies. It heats evenly, cleans extremely well and a great time saver. It easily fits more than one sandwich. This one is a keeper for a long time",

    "title": "Breville Duo 1500-Watt Nonstick Panini Press",
    "description": "In keeping with its heritage of creating the world's first domestic version of a professional sandwich press, Breville introduces the Panini Duo . With a 1500 watt heating element that heats up quickly, the Panini Duo's top plate delivers beautiful grill marks on any kind of bread, while its bottom plate delivers even and quicker heat on the flat to make the perfect Panini or your own toasted sandwich creation. Grill surfaces are made with a non stick, scratch proof Quantanium surface for easy cleaning. With its sturdy construction and stainless steel construction, the Panini Duo delivers on Breville's promise of performance and elegance.Care The grill is easier to clean when slightly warm but should always be allowed to cool somewhat before cleaning. Always clean the panini press after each use to prevent build up on baked on foods. Wipe the cooking plates with a soft damp cloth. If the cooked on food is not removed with the damp cloth, reheat the grill for 1 \u2013 2 minutes then brush the food with a little oil. Allow to stand for 5 minutes with the grill turned off, then wipe with a damp cloth. Wipe the outside of the grill with a soft damp cloth and warm soapy water. Do not use abrasive cleaners or harsh scouring pads on either the plates or the outside of the grill. This can scratch and damage the surfaces.",
