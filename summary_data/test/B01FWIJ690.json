Few dislikes: hard to find accessories (case cover), most of them shipped from China, takes like 4~6 weeks to receive them. You definitely have to buy the MateBook portfolio keyboard, MatePen and MateDock USB-C multi-port adapter. Even with all that you're paying less than other 2-1 Laptop/Tables.

It seems to be that this particular product has a 70% chance of getting defected ones judging from other reviews and my own experience. So I don't recommend getting this even it goes super sale. Instead just save more money and get the more known appropriate better reviewed brands. Not to mention that this tablet doesn't support MS ink pen and from what I heard only Wacom bamboo ink can also work with it if you cannot afford the real Huawei Pen anywhere.",

The screen flickers a lot. The M5 is under-powered. Oh yeah, the harddrive is partitioned into two parts, and it cannot be changed. There's virtually no hardware support for this tablet.",

The idea of an iPad Pro look-alike running full Windows is enticing, unfortunately, this device lacks the power, build quality, and screen quality of the Apple offering.",
