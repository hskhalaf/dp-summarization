Once he did the reward on his face was amazing. Then he practiced this skill, and still does at 18 months. We call this his school work along with other activities that hello engage different parts of his brain. Not to say that this ball never goes missing our gets thrown around the room and put in other toys. It so does. But that's part of learning too and we welcome that as well.",

The toy is a little too big for a baby to do both motions from the sitting position. Sharp corners on the wood. Kind of expensive.",

I'm very impressed with the quality and finishing of this product. I'm not worried about splintering or sharp corners, everything is smooth and rounded off. The ball is the perfect size for helping my daughter to use more pressure at her fingertips to grip, further developing that pincer grasp. The only critique I might have is that the walls of the tray be higher. It's easy for the ball to pop out of the tray.",

The quality is great and feels so soft and smooth. Ideally I would have gotten this months ago to start teaching her the concept of placing the item where it needs to go.
