I am not a super fast cuber but I am pretty good. \"Full CFOP, UNDER 30 SECONDS per solve\" before today, my favorite 3\u00d73 was the D-Fantix 3\u00d73 that came in the combo pack with the 2\u00d72, 3\u00d73, 4\u00d74 & 5\u00d75. I bought myself a Rubik's Speed Cube as a birthday present to myself. My expectations weren't high but didn't care cuz it was a great cube to add to my collection but.... It is seriously the beautiful & smooth cube I have ever owned. I am so happy.",

Therefore, I was looking for a cube without stickers yet still true to the original color scheme. This cube is the perfect solution! I am not a fast cuber like those crazy folks out there, but just prior to writing this review I easily solved this cube in 45 seconds. I am certain I will continue to improve on my speed using this cube. I am very happy with this purchase.",

Sometimes I get anxious that the looseness of it will cause it to fall apart in my hands, but it still has yet to do that, if it even will which I doubt because this is an official Rubik's brand cube. It makes turning much smoother and more comfortable than the original because the original can have varying tightness, making it only good for learning. THIS one, however, is perfect for solving quickly, and now my record is 1:34 seconds!",
