It does not change indoors even in full sun through a window, it only changes in direct sunlight outside. I've had the statue print indoors for about 4 months on a table. it had sun on it through a window everyday. even though it was not changing color it was still absorbing the light. now it does not change color at all on one side. the same thing happened to the cube I printed.",

It kept snapping going into the extruder and then printed out very rough, like thicker in some spots and other and making my hot end sound like a truck driving down a gravel road. If I pulled out this filament and put in a different kind all the issues went away so I know everything is tensioned correctly and the nozzle isn\u2019t clogged. The color change is nice but I\u2019ve only been able to print a small handful of simple statues. I tried the squirrel that came as the test file with my Ender 3 printer and the raft wouldn\u2019t come off at all.",

However, we left our print outside for a few days, just sitting on our patio table. Not even in direct sunlight. After about 3 or 4 days it completely stopped changing color at all. Now our print is just plain white. It even yellowed a bit and looks terrible. If it's going to stop changing and look terrible after only a few days, what's the point?",

After printing you need to expose the object to sunlight or UV light for the visualize the color change, once object is out of the light the color vanished after 2-3 minutes top. The Filament is prone to tangling so you need to look at it from time to time, that's the only thing preventing me to give a five star feedback. The boxes includes small rolls of sample filament (20 gr).",

Maybe my profile isn't dialed in 100%? Whatever the reason its taking me a little bit to try to get good prints out of it. So far no tangles so that's a plus.",
