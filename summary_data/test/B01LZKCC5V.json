In three short months, the two support bars in the middle have completely bent and no longer support the bed in the middle. Sure, we have fun in bed - but it's not like we're monkeys. I've sent two support requests to the manufacturer, and no word back. Based on the quality of the product, the poor customer service, and the false warranty, I can't recommend this bed at all. No matter how cheap it is.",

I used two furniture felt pads (cut down) to make up for the lacking length. Worked out for my first night, but I can't imagine they will last very long.

Therefor, they were just long enough to throw off the geometry and cause the legs to twist to the side due to being too long. I took of the caps, trimmed off 1/4\", and placed the caps back on.

This makes it really easy to put them on, but I fear it'll be TOO easy for them to no longer work, as opposed to being screwed in. Guess we'll find out down the road! Also, very simple, very minimalistic. Excellent for what I needed.",

Design is slightly different, center pole supported by two long free-standing legs rather than pegging into a mirrored bar underneath.

While at 300LBS I am heavier than most, i am well below the weight of two people expected to sleep in bed. Issue would be solved if the design had a lower bar running the length that support legs bracketed into. Currently looking to modify bed so as to not have total loss",

They all have negative reviews in some percentage. (Maybe they were put together wrong.) Arrived on time! Easy assembly. Hubby set it up alone, \"finnessed\" the cross bars to fit, eased them into place with no problem. Sturdy. So nice to have the mattress off the floor after moving across country with no furniture and waiting for it to arrive once we were in our new home. Surprised and delighted in its appearance and stableness!",

I'm assuming it was gripping to the floor too much and was causing the two poles to creak as it was being bent.
