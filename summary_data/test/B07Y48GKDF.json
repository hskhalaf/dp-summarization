Takes 18650 batteries which ran out after being fully charged after about 2 hours use, so if you're going filming for the day, you'll need a few more. Hard to find exact ones, but I eventually found some for about \u00a310 each. Will I get a different one. Probably. Will I keep this. Maybe.",

It opens up a huge array of creative possibilities which I'm only just discovering and really looking forward to exploring. It's also very compact and when coupled with a mirrorless camera like the Sony A7iii makes for a very compact set up. For the money it's great value and will hugely improve your film making. Highly recommended.",

I previously owned a Ronin S and the Weebill is so much lighter and quicker to balance with the locks. It literally took me 2 minutes to balance the first time and no horizon drift unlike other gimbals. So far I\u2019m really pleased with this gimbal.",

Very portable and compact with its size with lockable arms. Two main reasons, why I purchase this gimbal over others was 1) can use heavier camera\u2019s and Len\u2019s (motors strong) 2) Very compact in size 3) Control settings within the gimbal itself. Overall a very well-designed gimbal and key bit of equipment for any filming enthusiast.",

Even with a Sony AX53 video camera, smaller than pretty much any SLR, there is a runaway vibration in the tilt motor that just about shakes the thing to pieces, and the camera, and the footage, of course. See the video for details. Maybe this is a bad batch, but I am trying one more and then going for a DJI alternative. Buy cheap, buy twice, as is often said. In my case, it will be three times, but that's the lot.",
