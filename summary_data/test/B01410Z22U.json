Took several emails to even explain to them ur isn't a hardware (thermometer) issue since I can't even begin to try to pair with it and takes readings yet. Had to tell them to go read the recent reviews (2.5 stars), others reported the same issue. I shouldn't have to tell them to read reviews for their own app. Got no more contact from then. App still crashes on loading and still no updates for it on the play store. Total waste of money.",
