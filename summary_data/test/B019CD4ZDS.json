Here is my advice: if you have cats that vomit, pull at their hair (especially around their tail, towards their tail, on their sides), lose weight, cough, or have chronic cold symptoms (including coughing/sneezing blood or mucous) they probably have tapeworms. Parasitic control will save you money in the long run AND prevent your cat from discomfort and probable demise. Tapeworms are common with larger populations or crowded populations of kitties.

However... it is possible for fleas to infect cats with tapeworms (Google: \"fleas and worms in cats\" in you're curious, but take my word for it). I noticed worms in/on my cat and needed medicine fast. I was able to trick my cat using Greenies Pill Pocket treats and by cutting up the pill into small chunks. My cat experienced NO issues and had no side-effects from taking the medicine. His only side-effect: no more worms! Yay!",

Anyways I battled all 8....yes ....8 and got them down. Just a note if you made a chewable in tuna flavor I would pay the little extra.",

I got 3 arm scratches, a belly scratch, and a small puncture on my thumb.... but damnit I got that pill down her throat \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I am optimistic that the blood loss will be well worth it!

We gave a 2nd dose two weeks later to kill whatever larvae might have been left behind. Its been maybe two months since we used it and our babies are still healthy and no sign of those nasty parasites/worms. highly recommend.",

    "description": "If your cat has had fleas, there\u2019s a chance they have tapeworms too. Tapeworm segments look similar to grains of white rice and are visible when stuck in your cat\u2019s hair under the tail or by the back legs or in their poop. It\u2019s not always obvious that your cat has tapeworms, so the best way to identify a problem is through an exam performed by a veterinarian. Use Bayer Tapeworm Dewormer for Cats to treat your pet. Cats' everyday grooming behavior puts them at risk for ingesting fleas, which means a risk of tapeworms. Fleas can carry immature tapeworms, and they are the main source of tapeworm infections in cats. A cat that has been infested by fleas may develop tapeworms. Outdoor cats that hunt small rodents may be at risk of infection from tapeworms as well. In addition to treating with tapeworm dewormer, take steps to control fleas and rodents on the premises in order to prevent reinfection; Otherwise another round of the tapeworm dewormer for cats will be necessary. This is especially true in cases of tapeworms transmitted by fleas where reinfection is almost certain to occur if fleas are not removed from the animal and its environment. Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment and control of parasitism. Keep away from children.",
