A few weeks into use, the light would sometimes flicker from light to dark settings. It was sporadic, so I didn't worry about it. It has steadily worsened until the light is no longer bright and often flickers. It may be a bad apple, we will see if the manufacturer fixes the situation. UPDATE: Manufacturer sent me a new lamp, unbidden. Just showed up after I wrote this review before I could contact support. Very impressed. Will use the new lamp for a few weeks to ensure quality, then increase my rating again.",

Also having to hold the power button down to turn off for several seconds like a phone is annoying when you just want it off.

The only thing that would have made it even better is a couple more inches more on the arm. Unfortunately, this review will not let me attach a photo.",

In the full setting version this desk lamp is too bright but it is dimmable to ones liking. Will buy another one for my work office. The lamp comes in a nice book, very well packaged and protected. My lamp arrived a day earlier. Recommended.",

The head does rotate so it is able to help the limitations of the angles.",

I also got the base with it and works great together.",
