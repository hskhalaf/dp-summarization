      "text": "These (and other) 1920s-inspired oxfords that Clarks makes are just adorable! I got them in both black and brown (which I believe is referred to as 'burgundy'). They are so feminine, elegant, and very cute. I feel like a flapper:) I'm either a size 11 or 12, but usually find that I have to wear a size 12 with thick socks. Surprisingly, I got these in a 12, and they fit just right with a thinner type of sock; it could be that I haven't broken them in yet. They could complement almost anything. I couldn't help but post photos of me wearing them with patterned palazzo pants and seemingly clash-y striped socks. Love!",

Am waiting for the next half size to be available at the same price! Update: Ordered the burgundy because the black one half size up was too expensive. Should have listened to other reviewers, they were indeed brown. Returned again, and after waiting a long time in vain for the 7.5 to go down in price, I decided to bite the bullet and get them anyway, because they were too beautiful. Oh well, it's ok to splurge once in a while, no?",

I would have still worn had the heel been lighter an not 3 inches. Saddly they were returned.",
