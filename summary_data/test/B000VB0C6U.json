There is a 5 yr warranty listed and we have tried to call the listed number multiple times but are put on hold and after a while a message plays saying that we will get a call back and then it disconnects. We have never received a call back. In the future, we going to look for a stainless steel kettle.",

Yes I'm a klutz but it wasn't a hard knock either; just a little ding. So this one is a decoration/yard sale - brought my old chrome dome down for regular use again.",

So we have to have been drinking the coating which can't be healthy. It's too bad it turned out to be of such low quality. Otherwise it is attractive and has nice features. But for more than 60 dollars I really expected much greater longevity. I've had much cheaper tea kettles last much longer. I won't be buying this brand again for any of their products.",

Would take several minutes for water to boil, even if not that much water in the kettle 3. The main problem is that the handle would get very hot! This is just an accident waiting to happen.

It sits out happily as a gorgeous feature of the kitchen.

ALSO CONVENIENT TO BOIL WATER FOR OATMEAL OR FRENCH PRESS COFFEE, A LE CREUSET KETTLE IS AN EASY WAY TO ADD A SMALL DASH OF COLOR TO ANY KITCHEN.\nFEATURES\n * Single-tone whistle alerts when water has reached a rolling boil\n * Generous base size for greater contact with heating element so water boils quickly\n * Convenient quick heating with superior heat distribution\n * Fixed whistle can be easily flipped open for pouring\n * Stainless steel handle brackets for secure handling\n * Heat-resistant ergonomic handle for safe pouring\n * Kettle capacity marked on the base for quick reference\n * Can be used on any heat source (gas, electric, ceramic, halogen, induction)\n\nHEATING TIPS \nWhen filling the kettle with water, only fill water above the first layer of holes on the interior of the spout (see diagram on box for more information).\n\nFor efficient and safe boiling, always use burner a similar in size to the base of the kettle.\n\nCLEANING AND CARE\nDo not bang the teakettle down onto a stove's surface or work surface. Repeated banging may damage the exterior enamel.\n\nDo not place the kettle on the heat source without having water in the kettle. Never leave a teakettle simmering for long periods on any heat source; it may boil dry, which can result in overheating and damage to the base and enamel.\n\nDo not leave water standing in a kettle when it is not in use. A buildup of scale may occur and reduce efficiency.\n\nBefore pouring from your teakettle, remove it from the burner and ensure the handle is in the upright position.\n\nLe Creuset proudly uses heat-resistant plastic on our handles and whistles.\n\nNever place in the dishwasher.To clean, simply hand-wash the kettle with hot, soapy water and dry thoroughly. A gentle kettle de-scaler may be used periodically if required. \n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSlow down and savor the serenity of the Zen tea kettle during a busy day. Shaped like an inverted bowl, the low, broad-based kettle features a gracefully arched Asian-style handle that locks in an upright position, or releases for compact storage. A round heat-resistant knob adorns the lid. Flip back the spout cover to stop the whistling and pour. The Zen holds approximately 50 ounces of water, more than enough to brew four cups of tea. \n\n Le Creuset makes the Zen kettle of enameled steel in a choice of many bright, modern colors to match any kitchen. A stainless steel band on the lid and around the rim opening helps prevent chipping. Best of all, the tea kettle is suitable for any type of stovetop burner, so you can give one as a gift without having to know your recipient's stove type. Clean by hand or in the dishwasher when necessary. --Ann Bieri\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Le Creuset\n\nSee more",
