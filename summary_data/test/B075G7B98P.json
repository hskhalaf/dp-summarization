I am extremely disappointed, and based on the reviews of other buyers who had the same experience, opted for a return and refund rather than a replacement. What an absolutely garbage product.

After multiple attempts to operate I returned the unit to Amazon for a replacement. The second unit arrived and worked great for the first 3-4 pots of coffee. Then the second unit failed to initiate the grinding/brewing process following setup. There are obviously reliability problems with this unit.",

Next, the grinder began channeling coffee grinds into the inside of the *machine* (as in, behind the enclosed black plastic shell) rather than into the coffee filter cup. Without these selling features this machine an expensive waste of counter space. Worse, there are no ways to fix these issues because of Karups's choice to use proprietary triangle head screws to fasten the parts--a choice which I can only proscribe to ensuring that you will be forced to buy a new machine.",

Not sure if it is from the materials that the product is made from, or the residual coffee that is left over from the previous day's brewing, for which there is little remedy. The design means that about a tablespoon of coffee stays in the chute and does not get pushed out until the next day's brewing, and anyone who knows coffee understands air is not good for coffee. It uses more beans to get the same amount of brewed coffee as compared to a basic coffee pot.",

Customer service at Krups is a nightmare and is not dissimilar to a colonoscopy sans anesthesia. They do not make it easy and put the onus on you. The machine itself is nice and easy-to-use and makes a pleasant batch of coffee, but it is nowhere near as robust as older models. Krups really messed up with this one. If you are looking for reliability, look elsewhere.",
