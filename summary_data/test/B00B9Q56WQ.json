If it drops on the floor the whole thing falls apart. The front and the back base separate. Sometimes the side buttons get stuck and I have to fuss with it and separate to get it going again. I like that I can add all my email account to the phone and that it has a connection to skydrive as well, but I'm not convinced it's the best phone out there.",

Windows phone is a good system but apps are limited and some cross platforms apps (laptop, iOS, Androi\u0308d) are not present (yet ?) on Windows phone. Check carefully what your needs are. For example, you have Evernote and LastPass but not mSecure and Dashlane. Some specific apps like Chronos calendar are very good. On screen keyboard could be better. A lot of Nokia specific apps for Photos are not useful on that small unit.",

If you're not a heavy smartphone user it's simplicity may be even an advantage, but if you want to do some productivity work like sync calendar from Outlook not via Sky-Drive (restricted in many companies) or upload something to Youtube it's a pain. I also strongly dislike the magnifying button that defaults to Bing, it is very annoying and cannot be changed to a real search engine.",

You don't have as many apps as for android but if you don't use many of them then it does not matter as much. There is no Radio integrated into the phone so if you need it this phone is not for you.

      "text": "Bought the Lumia 620 from FGS Trading. As they promised, the phone was unlocked, and most importantly unbranded. No carrier logos, start screens, or software. This phone even came with the Windows Phone 8 GDR 2 update, which is just being rolled out. I also bought a Lumia 520 from FGS Trading a few weeks ago. Excellent service and prices, and no problems or bait and switch. The Nokia Lumia 620 has a very bright and clear screen, excellent call quality, and quality construction. Windows Phone 8 is a great OS. I strongly recommend this product, and this seller.",

Same size as iPhone 4 (my wife has iPhone 4), but comes unlocked and for half the price. With Windows Phone gaining apps everyday, this is a steal at the price. 512 MB of RAM is great. Although I experience some freezes sometimes when too many apps are open, the phone is awesome including battery life.",

For less than a third of that, you get a latest version of WinPhone 8 with updates, free Office, free offline and updated maps (with Garmin, you have to pay every year for the exact same thing).",
