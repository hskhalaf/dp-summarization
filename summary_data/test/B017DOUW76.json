I find it so confusing, and was reading a book, but cannot find the one I was reading, or which page I was on. The pages are full of book cover pictures, and if I tap the top or bottom of the page It starts a new book.Maybe I am too old to follow new devices, perhaps I should purchase the Kindle Touch again. At least I knew exactly what I was doing with it! Such a shame, as I read all the time. I have bought the Help Manual, so maybe I will be able to understand the device better.",

My only qualm about buying a Kindle was the lack of options for book format, but then I got Calibre and everything was easy. I have since found that ebooks are much cheaper on amazon and there's more choice, including foreign language books. A happy happy customer.",

      "text": "Having put my last Kindle through the washing machine (don't ask) my original bog standard Kindle just didn't do it for me any more, so I bought a new Paperwhite one. I absolutely love everything about it and, easy to hold, lightweight and easy to navigate the menu and options. Quite simply, if my house was on fire, this would be one of the first things I'd save!!",

So far it has been plain sailing with my Paperwhite, and I was pleasantly surprised at its ease of use and fantastic for reading in all light whether dull or sunny. What's more fab is just order a book and there it is in your library. So the experience is pleasant enough. Whether I will have a paperback book again remains to be seen, but so far I can say Kindle Paperwhite surpasses my expectations. Simple and ease of use makes this a winner.",
