The standard calibration on the built in rgb setting was actually good enough straight away, I simply knocked the brightness down to around 40 which was required in my dark'ish room.",

I use it for video editing, photo viewing and minor editing, daily browsing and email. On/off switch is in a convient place. all the inputs I need. Picture is very good/excellent in my opinion. I am not a gamer, so no verdict on that. I tried to think of something negative, but cannot think of anything at all. I looked at all the monitors in this price range, and chose it for resolution. HD wasn't enough, this is way better for my MacMini. Overall a great purchase.",

I unplug everything, plug everything back, still says it can't detect my macbook. This has become such a nuisance, I've seriously considered returning it several times. I figured I need to turn it off for about 15min, disconnect all cables, then turn it back on, connect all cables and then MAYBE it will connect. Once it's connected no issues. Real shame at this price point Benq couldn't resolve these connection issues.",
