Today I made sure I had two charged batteries and the PNY Elite 64GB chips I use. Much to my dismay, the camera turned on yet would not take a picture in any mode or setting. Even the video would not work. The mirror would not retract either. I changed batteries, no help. I removed the SD cards, no help. The display on top turns on yet no autofocus action and no way would it take a picture. I now have two bookends that say NIKON D 7100. I was a fool.",

I have also used it with the Nikon 10.5 Fish Eye, as well as the Nikon 12-20 mm fF4.0. Exposures are perfect and high ISO performance is excellent. The shutter is quieter than the D800.

I use a 50mm 1.8g for right now, and hoping to get a wide angle lens and/or an 85mm. I've only done portrait photography so far. I'm not super impressed with the quality in low light, I know the 7200 would have done better. But this was the best I could get with my budget.",

I shoot a 5-frame bracket in Nikon RAW mode (NEF) and I can set 1/3 or 1/2 stop increments apart. Very sensitive CMOS sensor lets me capture a lot more range than with the Nikon D7000. Ideal for entry level photographers new to VPiX 360 photography -- this Nikon is easy to learn with intuitive, and approachable controls that you can learn in a single weekend. From setting the F-stop to 8.0, to shooting your first VPiX 360 panorama... this is the model to get if you don't have the budget for a Nikon d610 or Nikon D800 series camera.",

If you are debating between the two and money is no object, go for the D600, but if it would hurt you financially, get the D7100. One of the few differences is that the noise kicks in a little sooner. With the D600, the noise at ISO 100 vs 200 vs 400 is imperceptible to me so I routinely shoot at 400. With the D7100, I default to 200. ISO 800 on the D600 is about the same as ISO 400 on the D7100, and it's not bad, but I stay below that if I don't need it.",

Nikon changed some of the control button features just enough to annoy you a little until you get used to them. But the ISO capability is tremendously better than the D300s I was shooting for years. I gained a full 2-3 stops with this camera. Even at the higher ISO's the noise is finer and less noticeable because of the resolution. The shutter noise is remarkably quieter as well. Putting aside the cheap build - I think the camera is a winner over all.",

    "title": "Nikon D7100 24.1 MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR (Body Only)",
    "description": "Style:Body Only| Configuration:BaseFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nUnleash the power of Nikon's DX-format HD-SLR system.\nMeet the new flagship of Nikon's outstanding DX-format HD-SLR line-up: the D7100. Incorporating recent advancements in HD-SLR technology, the D7100 brings a thrilling new level of image quality, speed, connectivity and creative capabilities\u2014a specially designed 24.1-megapixel DX-format image sensor, superior low-light performance, ultra-precise autofocus and metering, advanced video recording features, built-in HDR, mobile connectivity and much, much more. Pair it with any of Nikon's superb NIKKOR DX- and FX-format lenses, versatile Speedlights and accessories, and the D7100 will be the centerpiece of your creativity for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPTURE EVERY DETAIL TRUE TO LIFE\nPURE, SHARP IMAGES\nThe D7100 marks an exciting advancement in image quality for high-resolution DX-format cameras. Nikon specially designed its 24.1-megapixel DX-format CMOS sensor without using an optical low pass filter (OLPF), resulting in the purest, sharpest images using D7100's DX-format CMOS sensor. Combine that with fantastic ISO performance at both ends of the spectrum\u2014down to ISO 100 and up to ISO 6400\u2014the processing speed and intelligence of EXPEED 3 and the extra lens reach of a 1.5x crop factor, and the D7100 is the ultimate tool for those seeking a lightweight DX-format HD-SLR.\n\nSPEED AND PRECISION IN HARMONY\nHIGH-SPEED SHOOTING WITH FLAWLESS METERING AND AUTOFOCUS\nWhen the action speeds up, fire a blazing fast 6 frames per second continuously for up to 100 shots. Building on the acclaimed autofocus system from the D300s, the D7100 uses 51 focus points, including 15 cross-type sensors for detecting both vertical and horizontal contrast variations, to achieve fast, precise focus. The central cross-type sensor works all the way down to f/8, a huge advantage when using compatible teleconverters. At the same time, a highly accurate 2016-pixel RGB sensor evaluates every scene, taking into account brightness, contrast, subject distance and color, for spot-on auto operations like Face-Priority and full-time autofocus during video capture.\n\nWIRELESS SHARING AND CONTROL\nCOMPATIBLE WITH THE WU-1A WIRELESS MOBILE ADAPTER\nThe D7100 makes it easy to share your great photos immediately, wherever you are. Connect the optional WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter and instantly transfer shots to a compatible smartphone or tablet, then upload them to the web, send by email or text\u2014share them however you like. With Nikon's free Wireless Mobile Utility installed on your smartphone or tablet (available for both Android and iOS), you can also remotely control the D7100. Use your phone or tablet as a Live View monitor to take shots without having the camera in your hands, a huge advantage for everything from self portraits to digiscoping with a Nikon fieldscope.\n\n\n\n\n\nCREATE MOVIES THAT AMAZE\nDAZZLING 1080P VIDEOS, SLOW-MOTION AND TIME-LAPSE SEQUENCES\nWith full-time autofocus and manual exposure control during video recording, a built-in stereo mic and an external stereo mic jack, headphone and HDMI jacks, the D7100 achieves exceptional cinematic reproduction and quality. Record in several high-definition formats: 1080p at 60i/50i/30/25/24 fps or 720p at up to 60p for ultra-smooth slow-motion sequences. Dual SD card slots give you additional recording time, and an all new 60i function enables smooth playback on HDTVs or external monitors. And, of course, every shot looks great through a NIKKOR lens. Create beautiful background blur with the AF-S DX NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G, or use the AF-S DX NIKKOR 10-24mm for an ultra-wide-angle view that's perfect for establishing shots and working in tight interiors.\n\n\n\nPREMIUM ACCESSORIES\n\n\n\nWU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter \nUsing the WU-1a optional wireless mobile adapter you can now automatically send great images to your smartphone and even use your smartphone to remotely capture images from your D7100. With an easy to use app, now when you can't wait to share that great shot you don't have to. Share it to your smartphone in a instant. Nikon EN-EL15 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery \nThese rechargeable batteries provide extended life and consistent power, even in colder conditions. MB-D15 Multi-Power Battery Pack \nThe MB-D15 is equipped with a shutter-release button, AE/AF lock button, multi selector, and main- and sub-command dials for improved operation when taking photographs with the camera vertically oriented. ME-1 Stereo Microphone \nRecord crystal-clear sound and significantly reduce autofocus noise on your compatible DSLR camera using this compact stereo microphone.
