It did take a long time to put together by myself about 2 1/2 hours but it completely doable. The only thing I do not like is the flimsy back piece. I would eventually like to replace it with a more sturdy piece of wood. I also would love another shelf as an option to have two on one side and one on the other. It is definitely worth the cost.",

I needed the whole thing assembled quickly at that point, so I guess I will just deal with it. The drawer does not close easily. If you push it shut it doesn't close without an extra push (pic 3).

Something will be upside down... it will be frustrating. Keep your eyes on the prize. It\u2019s cool when it\u2019s done.",

A bit more written guidance would provide clarity and be a good idea. Overall it is exactly what I expected and I am happy with the purchase.",
