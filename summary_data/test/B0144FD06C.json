      "verdict": "Danner reintroduces the Jag on the market and it eventually gains positive remarks. The brand is successful in redesigning it as a lightweight yet durable hiking boot. It reaches out to experts, newbies and casual walkers, and obtains their approval.However, a notable rating does not equate to perfection. It seems that Danner misses a few points in addressing comfort. Overall, the Danner Jag is a worthy pair of hiking boots, on and off the trail. So maybe with a little intervention, comfort is within one\u2019s grasp.",

        "It is able to protect the feet from getting wet, based on numerous user reviews",
        "Some wearers declare that this day hiking boot requires little-to-no breaking in",
        "Loads of owners and a few experts are dumbfounded by the retro style of the Jag from Danner",

Comes pre-coated with some sort of water-proofing/stain repelent, which is very nice, as I had worried the boot might show dirt and salt stains too easily, but it is actually quite resistant to these elements. Danner makes a lot of military boots, so you know what you are getting is a quality product, made by people who care.",

Danner doesn't have many options for women in the Jag boot (only 1 color) so I ordered the men's version. I wear a size 9 women's and the 7 men's fit perfectly. The colors are pretty neutral, light grey with green canvas and they seem like they'll wear nicely over the years. These are a great option if you don't want anything bright or with a bunch of addornments like a lot of hiking boots seem to have.",
