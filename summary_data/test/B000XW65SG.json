Both sides of the sling have fixed-length straps so it is not adjustable. This is frustrating because my son's torso is mostly out of the water and he gets cold, but he's not big enough to sit in the tub without the sling.",

The item does not deserve even the one star because of passing off a used item as a new one. The sling I received also looks too small/narrow and my baby might not be comfortable in it.

She was screaming and holding her foot. I eventually figured out after the 2nd time that I needed to stuff the sides with a rag so she can't wedge her foot into the grooves. Other than that it's a great bath I just wish that they didn't have those plastic grooves where babies can possibly hurt themselves.",

It should be shaped different.",

The hammock was very useful for first couple of months Overall this is a good product, but isn't perfect",

The mesh sling holds my baby securely and the pocket makes it easy for me to reach for the shampoo and body wash. However, one thing i wish the tub had was a better-designed padded head rest for babies who are still in the mesh sling for their baths. Sometimes i feel like my baby's head is positioned uncomfortably so i would often hold her neck/head for support. Overall, i think this product was worth the purchase for its price.",

Not sure how other people are laying their kids in here, but it works well in my opinion. We leave the infant hammock attached at the top, and fold it under to make a sort of pillow for him.

My other one does have an extra piece that is a seat that I like for when baby can sit up. If I couldn\u2019t blend the two that would be great. But, very happy with this one.",
