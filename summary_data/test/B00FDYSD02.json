It was quiet and just enough breeze to move air. It looks nice, not cheap. I needed to move it so it would oscillate further in another direction and was amazed at how heavy it was. I gave it a nudge and it didn't give an inch, so I would say it's sturdy. I'm happy with it.",

My one complaint about the product is that the power cord is a bit short--only three feet or so. This might be sufficient for most people, but if you're looking to place this anywhere that isn't pretty close to an outlet, then you're going to need to use an extension cable. The Vornado that I had for many years and that I replaced with this fan had a cord that was probably two feet longer. That said, this is cheaper, works well, and is not unattractive.",

It does not have all the bells and whistles like remote control and bright blue lights, which is why I chose it. Just low, medium and high power with an on and off switch.

For reference, a library is 30 dB, a refrigerator running is 40-50 dB, and AC units are around 60-70 dB. One important thing to note is that you have to clean the fan periodically, or it won't pull as much air through. The dust will build up behind the fan and on the blades, reducing it's output. Cleaning it takes about 5 minutes.",

Additionally, the cord is too small so the \u201cfan\u201d has to be directly in front of an outlet. A total waste of money.",

      "text": "This fan is weak. We bought it but it doesn't move air in any way that made a difference in our warm house. Sure, the fan is quiet but it's not helpful if it's quiet but weak. We bought it to replace a Lasko fan that worked fine but was kind of loud. Unfortunately, had to return it, which sucked because return shipping was 1/3 the original price.",

      "text": "While this fan works, it is neither quiet nor does it move a lot of air. The blades that come with it are so flimsy they often bend while the fan is running, causing a decrease in air flow and an unpleasant noise. Would not recommend, even at this price point.",
