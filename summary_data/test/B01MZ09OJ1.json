      "verdict": "Subtle, elegant styling defines Puma Astro Cup Suede shoes. The on-trend look and comfortable feel compare very well to the Puma Liga Suede which is no mean feat. Perfect fit, true-to-size length, lightweight feel, interesting colors, and a low price point make for highly coveted kicks.A few minor things hold these back, however. The red colorway looks burgundy in person, and the sneakers have thin tongues which might be an issue for someone who needs more padding. Overall, however, the advantages are stacked high for this model.",
      "pros": [
        "The Puma Astro Cup Suede sneakers have a subtly elegant look that is typical of most retro styles, most users stated",
        "Many reviewers commented that these Puma low-tops are a very comfortable alternative to the Squash 2000s or the Liga Suede",
        "A good number of testers were genuinely pleased to find that the Astro Cup Suede sneakers provided a perfect fit and ran true to size",
        "They say there is no rubbing in any area of the shoes whatsoever",
        "Several praised the low pricing of the low-top casual kicks",
        "They added that with the Puma Astro Cup Suede, you get quality shoes without breaking the bank",
        "A significant number of purchasers said they highly recommended the sneakers for people who liked subtle but interesting colors",
        "Some consumers remarked that the Puma Astro Cup Suede shoes feel lightweight",
        "They also liked how well the shoes\u2019 uppers hugged the feet",
        "The soles of these lifestyle sneakers provide a decent grip, one customer commented"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A few people reported that the red colorway of the Puma Astro Cup Suede is more burgundy or wine in person than real red",
        "According to one individual, the low-top sneakers have very thin tongues",
        "One person complained that the Puma Astro Cup Suede provides very little in the way of arch support",
        "He added that this made the shoes more ideal for casual adventures rather than heavy use or extended times on the feet"
