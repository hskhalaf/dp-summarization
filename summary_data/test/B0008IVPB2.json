However, this product alone will not help you lose weight. You also have to include excerise everyday to really see the results kick in. Also, mixing the powder with milk instead of water makes it taste wayyyy better. Lastly, avoid the vanilla flavor, it tastes awful. Stick to the chocolate flavors. If you mix the chocolate flavor with milk, it literally takes like a regular choclate shake.",

Also, I mix it with water and it is still very rich if you use six to eight ounces of water. The price is okay, but the delivery to the door can't be beat. I don't like being seen in the store buying diet products because I'm vain I guess. I loose weight fast on this one because the protein in the morning really gives my metabolism a shot.",

Aside from the high quality of this product, the subscribe and save option for this item on amazon has saved me heaps money-wise, as it enables me to afford this product in bulk on a monthly basis. I\u2019m so thankful for this slimfast powder and for this particular size, and it\u2019s definitely affordable price.",

The slimfast official site said it could be made with water as a substitute for milk so I made it with 8 ounces of water, 1 scoop powder mix and it was fantastic!
