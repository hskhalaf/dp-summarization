Always loved Snickerdoodle's, very disappointed!These are not@all the same cookies I previously loved.Won't be ordering again! Now,I have 5 boxes of unopened cookies. These were not cheap!When you expect the same product that you previously enjoyed&end up w/these,I feel mislead.Hate wasting food&really hate wasting my money!!There's no one I would even consider giving these to.Would still like to know,what happened?!?",

However, Enjoy Life has changed the ingredients in the double chocolate brownie cookies adding konjac and sorghum flours. My child is allergic to konjac and had an allergic reaction after eating one of these cookies from the newly redesigned boxes. Please be aware that it\u2019s not just the photo on the box that\u2019s changed, ingredients have been changed as well with no notice of said ingredient changes on the new design. This is disappointing and unacceptable from a company that is supposed to be attuned to the needs of the allergy community.",

None of the hosts said anything. Yesterday I was at church, saw the cookies were not being served, ate one and checked the \"best by\" date. It is 3-30-2020. I will not purchase this product again. I had to throw away 5 1/2 boxes. Not a good use of church funds.",

I would stay away from the chocolate chip and double c brownie, they are just overpowering sweet. If the gingerbread was sold individually, I might pick that one up, but otherwise, not coming back.",

About a year ago Enjoy Life changed the packaging and the formulation for all their cookies. The Soft Baked Double Chocolate Chip now are 11g of Sugar per serving instead of 10g. I count my sugar intake and this new formulation is a relatively high sugar and net carb buster! I like the product but will have to cut back on them.",

      "text": "Due to nursing a baby with severe food allergies I was on a very restricted diet for about 10 months. When I found the Enjoy Life brand I was SO excited. These cookies are just alright. I prefer the Hard Chocolate Chip Cookies over the Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies (in the Enjoy Life brand). The taste on these is definately not like a regular chocolate chip cookie, it has a bit of an after taste. But if you're diet is limited, or you have a gluten, dairy, or other allergy they are a good alternative for a sweet treat. I do LOVE the Enjoy Life chocolate chips, though! They sell these by the bag.",

This might sound strange, but eating the cookie with a salty cracker on top (I use Saltines), it tastes delicious and not like candy corn or too sugary at all! I am happy I found this trick because at first I was upset with the taste. I also like to flatten out the cookie and then stack one saltine cracker on it, and eat it like a cookie sandwich type thing. I guess the salt balances out the sugar. This might be weird, but for me it works!",
