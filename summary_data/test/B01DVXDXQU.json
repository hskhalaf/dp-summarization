Just had a storm and power outage last week, so this will come in handy the next time. Weather Band is pretty boring until a storm comes but it is handy when you need it. The reading light and adjustable falshlight is a nice touch. Update: Hurricane Matthew! No power for 5 days. This radio was a lifesaver!",

Saw a few comments about weak radio reception and I experienced that too until I popped up the antenna. Came through loud and clear. Tested all the features and they worked fine.

This was our sole link to the world and it did a great job. It's much smaller than you'd think from the picture, but it has a decent volume and it does what it needs to do.

It will not recharge via usb or solar so crank away. 1 Dec 2018: I received a new radio from the seller based on my previous review so a big thank you to them! The new radio works great; it charges well by solar, crank or usb and it works well as a flashlight or reading lamp and as an emergency radio it has good reception on the weather band. I'm still only going to give it 3 stars because there should be better quality control.",

I did send a photo and that seemed to satisfy them. Otherwise i would have just returned the unit through Amazon.

Never had to use the solar or crank. Antenna isn't fantastic, but we were able to pick up a few local stations on FM radio. Now that the storm is gone, it still didn't pick up all radio stations...but in a crises, it saved us.",

I am well within range of 2 NOAA weather stations. 2 This is minor, but the battery compartment needed a bit of fidgeting to get it closed.",

I tried charging it but it didn't fix it. I've seen other reviews with the same issue so it sounds like some units are defective.
