It handles my Rolex Yachtmaster silently and keeps it wound just right. Very convenient. If you have a really costly watch this winder will save you money on maintenance in the long run, reducing wear on the mainspring and stem. I would not pay the $400.00 list price, however.",

I should probably upgrade to a larger (multiple watch) model at some point, but I'm good with the singles that I have right now. This model is nice 'n' quiet and keeps my automatic watch wound. I don't think it works on the Seiko Kinetic type of watches, though, even though it has a left-right feature (I think it goes 5 turns left, then 5 turns right), as well as a left, and right turn feature. Additionally, it has a 12-hr rest feature, which I believe is meant to prevent over-winding of your watch. This is a great product and I definitely recommend it!",

      "text": "Great watch winder. Virtually silent, stylish and efficient. I believe it has a 800-900 rpd setting. Note: The little pillow is a bit firm at first but can be smushed to fit your watch snugly. Has setting to wind left, right or to both sides. It is not a continuous wind; it rests and starts several times a day and does a few intervals at a time.",

    "description": "Trouble Shooting Steps: All WOLF winders are designed to have cycles rest between its winding cycles to ensure that the proper amount of tension is placed on the main spring of your watch. All watch cycles will take approximately 6 hours of winding and rest, and then will go into a 18 hour sleep phase before returning back to the winding cycles. When placing the cuff inside of the drum, please ensure that the watch strap is fastened securely so that the watch does not sway back and forth during its winding. Once you place the cuff inside of the drum, you will hear a clicking noise that will indicate when each side of the cuff is locked into the drum. All WOLF winders utilize gravity to rotate the rotor inside of your watch.
