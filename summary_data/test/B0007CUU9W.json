Sturdy, won't break, the plug at bottom is a turn style lock so kids can't easily remove, the head removes if you want to put larger coins such as half dollars in. My daughter has named him Wilbur and sleeps with the little guy. She won't let me recycle the box he came in because even it is adorable. It looks like a barn and a stall for him. Great gift and great purchase!",

It's the size it says in the description and it's adorably cute! Bought 2, one for both of my daughter's. My husband is so excited about them he wanted to wake up our kids just to give them to them. But I convinced him he could wait to see their excitement till morning. I stenciled their names onto them with permanent marker (we'll see how long it'll last). Can't say enough good things about these cute piggies!",

My daughter happily said \"she looks like Red Riding Hood!\" I'm surprised at how sturdy this piggy bank feels too!

She carries it everywhere, even puts it in her little baby stroller. It's a plactic / rubber material so she can't break it or hurt herself if it's dropped . I also purchased the My pink piggy bank book that was recommended with it and am looking forward to story time with her new piggy of course. We're very happy with it.......nice quality and very cute appearance. You never know what little one's are going to take to so this was a pleasant surprise! Would recommend",

Only complaint is as others have said, when you want to empty it (we take the money to the actual bank when its full), its a bit tricky to get all the coins out as they get stuck in the legs. Once you shake out most of the coins, I have small enough hands that i can scoop out the last 2-3 coins though.",
