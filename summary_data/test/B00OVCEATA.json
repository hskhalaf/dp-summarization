We needed to shorten the plastic hose that attached to the motor as the original, longer length was preventing the motor from sticking to the floor of the waterfall.

I did get it to a good level and am very happy with it. Nice during the day and even better at night with the water and lights casting shimmering light on the ceiling. Noise level is good too, I can hear it but not too loud to be bothersome. All in all a great purchase. I would recommend it.",

I went to the nursery and bought a nice 14\" ceramic pot liner, set the fountain in it and filled it with small stones.
