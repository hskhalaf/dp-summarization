I only hooked the hooks onto the existing frame right over the existing bunk bed steps. (I didn't use the screws/bolts) If you have kids or live in a dorm GET THIS ASAP.",

I cut about 8\u201d off the end of the feet to fit the cab-over bunk height in our class-c motorhome and that was easy enough with my grinder and a cut-off wheel. If you don\u2019t have that tool you\u2019ll need a metal hack-saw or possibly a dremell with a cutting wheel would also work.",

Then I popped the rubber feet off the old section, and capped the bottom where I cut instead. Cuts must be made from the bottom, because cutting the top will remove the threaded holes where the hooks attach. Ladder seems well built, and was exactly as described.

Bunk ladders come with rubber tread covers to provide comfort to bare feet.
