There were also comments regarding the length of the strap making it difficult to use. I uploaded a pic to show the length on myself, at 5'6\" in height. My 6'4\" husband also tried it on and said it felt comfy for him as well. The strap is actually a little longer than the Canon strap the camera came with. I like having the strap not advertise the model of the camera. After having my camera stolen last year, that is important to me.",

I tried putting one through the wash which it survived but it didn't make it any softer. If you have sensitive skin i wouldn't buy any of the cheap ones.

      "text": "Straps are a little long but you can just tie or cut them. Used for a 35mm konica and a 35mm olympus, never broke or slipped. I've had it for about 6 months , it's worth the money but it's definitely not built to last a lifetime. I'ld recommend this to amateurs like myself, or students till you really get comfortable with photography no point in shelling out a ton of money on a strap if you don't know what works and what doesn't. It's a good everyday strap or starter strap can be used with multiple cameras.",
