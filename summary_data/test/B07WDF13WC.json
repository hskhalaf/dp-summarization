Unfortunately every time I tried to open one of my recipes, the google drive app crashed. Upon taking a quick look online, I found that this is a common problem. Seems that amazon does not support google docs so unfortunately had to return this. Very sad!!!",

Extremely disappointed. EDIT: Amazon customer service contacted me and I've been able to return, great service and easy return - would have added 2 stars.",

I also got a microSD for downloading stuff as well. I bought this device to review on the Tech Travel Geeks.

      "text": "This tablet continues to be a very good choice. I previously had an older version (3rd gen) that the battery was starting to fail on. One thing I have noticed is that not all apps adjust if I open the tablet the wrong way up. Most apps will turn to be correct but some don't. One such is Cube Connect. I have spoken to them and they have said the app never had auto rotate. But on the old fire tablet it rotated to orientate correctly. The new tablet doesn't. It seems as though Amazon have made an \"improvement\" that doesn't suit all apps. Other than that it's still a great tablet",

I thought it was something I did in the short time I've had it and reset it to factory settings but no.

I've also found the built-in Alexa features really helpful, especially since I've been using it for basic things like music playlists, setting alarms etc. Screen quality is excellent and sound pretty good and for the price definitely worth it if you use other Amazon services",

      "text": "I am pleasantly surprised by how good the 'All New Amazon Fire HD 8' is! I am more familiar with Samsung tablets so an Amazon device takes a little getting used to. I waited until Amazon Prime Day for 50% off to make sure I got extra value for money. As far as I can tell the fact that it doesn't come with Google Play Apps and it has locked screen adverts does not detract from the experience of using it. I may decide to learn how to tweak things to my preferences but right now it's perfectly alright.",
