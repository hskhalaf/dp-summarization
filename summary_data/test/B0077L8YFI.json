It seems to be close to the same weight as the doctor's and gym's scales. The body fat % is sensitive to your hydration levels and is not totally accurate, but most scales like this use the same technology. It can be sensitive to what flooring type you set it on, but that's not surprising. You just need to make sure you have a firm floor, like tile or hardwood, that isn't springy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this scale, especially if you've bought in to the fitbit ecosystem with one of their trackers already.",

Obviously, there's some very minor variation in the weight and body fat % reports (it's only an electric scale, not like a high-quality professional scale) but for the purposes of monitoring your weight and fat % for the reasons of personal health management, it's wonderful! It sometimes gets confused and weighs you in 10 lbs more or less but that's fixed by just popping out a battery for a few seconds and then popping it back in. Definitely worth it if you want to track your health as well as your weight -- if you just want to track weight, just buy a manual scale.",
