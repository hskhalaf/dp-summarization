It doesn't really smell to me. I reccomend this product. Our vet even noticed it had made a difference on a new rescue fur babies fur after a week of putting it on his food and said to keep it up.",

Her skin and coat have always been fine, but I bought this to give her extra vitamins, minerals, and Omega-3 & Omega 6 Fatty Acids. She has no problem with the flavor, smells like vanilla. Knocking off a star because the 2 bottles I received in mid-March, 2019, have an expiration date of mid-December, 2019. Either this product has a very short shelf life or I got old stock. Also, nowhere on the bottle does it say to shake it, but several reviewers say to shake well.",
