They started perfectly fine. Broken belts were easy to replace and that's normal. But the hose coming unattached constantly due to ill shaped plastic the suction stopping without being clogged, and it whistling non stop due to a gasket missing is not normal in less than a month. I suggest you save your money and buy something that'll last at least six months if you need a commercial cleaning vacuum.",

Same cheap plastic, same everything - except a much better cord. At more than twice the price I expected more, but I'll keep it because there just don't seem to be reliable, cheap, bagged vacuums out there any longer.
