Does what I bought it for, Spindle Sander. Faster sanding in confined hard to reach areas than a Dremal type tool. In addition, when using a Dremal (I know the spelling), those little drum sleeves kept popping off after tightening the drum holder. Don't get me wrong, a Dremel is the best tool I own and use. Need more companies to make 3 inch long sanding spindle sleeves, A must, to get 5 stars. Loud, who cares? No reviews, No problem, that's why I have \"Prime\", which is also awesome!",

I just wish the vertical oscillation was a bit longer of a stroke, but happy overall.",
