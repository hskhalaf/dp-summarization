This \"New\" Touareg Vibe version is made to lesser quality. The \"leather\" appears synthetic and the outer sole is some sort of plastic that is slick and will surely crack before the shoe is broken in. Clarks should be ashamed to release such a product but I guess isn't surprising for a company that has obviously sacrificed quality to save money in both materials and manufacture after moving production from the UK to Asia. Returned shoes before wearing. I would not recommend.",

It took a few days to get used to the round v square toe. But, I totally dig the look. AND they are lighter than my other Clarks. NOTE: These have a sewn-in pad.
