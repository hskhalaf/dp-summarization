The bottom just spins and spins and the stick does not come out. One stick was actually missing the bottom piece that makes it turn. Color comes of on clothes and suits, but not off skin. while it's a fun item for the kids, as a parent I would advise against it.",

I use the sticks to get the spots under their eyes so that I can see when they wipe it off and need to reapply.

I haven't had an issue with staining, even on my snow-white fair 3 year old. I wipe off what I can then spread on a layer of CeraVe hydrating cleanser and use a soft wash cloth to get the rest off- no issue even with the darkest colors. Also we only leave it on for about 2 hours max, wash their faces and reapply.",

The colors are bright, bold and the application is so much easier than squeezing zinc from a tube and rubbing it on their faces. They like to draw their own creations on their faces, too, which is always funny. So far no burning on their faces and no breaking of the product.",
