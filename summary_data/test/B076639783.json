As you can see from my photos, the black decorative print and the \"No. 9\" are both missing. The \"cap\" is awful. You have to twist it and squeeze the product out. After twisting it back to close it, additional product comes out - giving me more than I actually need and preventing me from standing it right side up because the product gets all over the counter. I'm not sure if this is just a very old product/packaging or if it is completely fake.",

    "description": "Size:5 Fl OzTHE DRUNK ELEPHANT DIFFERENCE\nWith a mission to deliver clinically-effective, clean skincare products formulated with both cutting-edge synthetic and natural ingredients, Drunk Elephant knows that every ingredient should directly benefit the health of your skin or the safety of the formulation. \n\n BESTE No. 9 JELLY CLEANSER\nBeste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser has a unique blend of mild surfactants and makeup dissolving emollients, with a gentle formula that rinses away without an ounce of residue, leaving skin clean and soft. \n\n NO FRAGRANCE\nAfter carefully balancing the best ingredients available, Drunk Elephant doesnt have to add anything to mask their natural scents. When you smell their products, you will likely detect nothing but a glycerin base with slight hints of Marula oil, Zinc Oxide, Thermal Mud, Fruit Enzymes, and Vitamins for a refreshing and reassuring scent. \n\n BREAK THE CYCLE\nYour skin is left vulnerable with the overuse of harsh exfoliates, chemical peels, expensive laser treatments, Botox abuse, layered foundations and powders, and chemically-laden beauty creams. Theres nothing wrong with an occasional beneficial beauty splurge here and there (when appropriate), but it can be a vicious cycle that is hard to stop. \n\n COMMITTED TO CLEAN\nDrunk Elephant is committed to using only clean ingredients that either directly benefit the skins health, or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulas. Youll never find the Suspicious 6 (Essential Oils, Drying Alcohols, Silicones, Chemical Screens, Fragrances/Dyes and SLS) in their products.",

      "SENSITIVE VS. SENSITIZED. When skin is exposed to irritants and sensitizers, damage can be imperceptible and cumulative, leaving it in a reactive mode. \"Sensitive\" skin is often just skin that has become sensitized over time by harsh additives",
