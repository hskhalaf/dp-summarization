Just went to purchase another at CVS and verified the one from Amazon was a fake. The one I\u2019m pointing to is the one from Amazon next to the one from CVS (the authentic one). Also note that even though it says scented with Rose hip oil, the ingredients are the same as the real one with no mention of Rose Hip oil.",

I just put it on as soon as I get out of the shower however I do have to Massage it in pretty thoroughly before dressing or it will stain delicate fabrics.",

My skin seems to be getting more dry with age, so this product really helps. I put this product on my face (although they do have a similar product just for the face) before I put on my foundation; makes application so much easier! Says the product helps with stretch marks, but I'm not sure how long you have to continually use the product before you notice a difference. Will buy again, but the bottle should last me quite awhile.",

I also had purchased the Serum to make it a combo. The serum said it was supposed to reduce the coloring of the stretch marks but it seemed like it was making it darker for some reason. Over all not what I expected. I switched to Aveeno Moisturizing and WOW I wish I started using that from the beginning. In a week it lightened up the marks on my stomach and I have not had any new marks.",
