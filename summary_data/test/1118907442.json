On that note, I wish some of the stock photography illustrations in the book were replaced with additional examples as the examples that were in the books were helpful. Nevertheless, the books are generally helpful, especially when laying out the format of functions and indicating what goes where. However, if you have programming experience elsewhere, consider another book.",

I have found the content to be always accurate (rarely outdated, even in 2019) because these titles focus on baseline understanding and not peripheral topics.

I had previously known HTML and CSS but I thought I'd buy the book anyway and hope I'd learn some new tricks, which I did. The layout of the book is wonderful and it is overall just a really good resource for a beginner, or even a more experienced developer.",
