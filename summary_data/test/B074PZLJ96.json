I stopped brewing kombucha a couple years ago when I got a really moldy batch, and it grossed me out so badly that I couldn't do it for awhile/I had to throw away my Scoby. I'm ready to try again, and this kit is perfect for someone starting up (or starting over!). It comes with everything you need- a healthy Scoby, sugar, tea, a jar, and other \"accessories\" to make your brewing complete. I can't wait to see how my kombucha turns out!",

It has enough tea leaves for at least two batches of Kombucha, and the scobi will grow and multiply if kept well. It is important to remember to open the box right away and tend to the scoby as this is a living culture that cannot tolerate extreme heat and being bagged in a oxygen-deprived pouch for long. It has to breathe, and it needs to be fed. The box might be a bit pricey, but buying everything separately isn't exactly cheap either, and it is good to have a guarantee that you get a fresh scoby.",

It's even a good introduction into maybe making other fermented beverages. It's warm here so the activity was quick and now I'm drinking them. I have not tasted kombucha before so I can't review on the taste, but my trials have been sweet/vinegary with a little kick.",
