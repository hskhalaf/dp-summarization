I\u2019m trying to accomplish two things: prevent my kids from walking out the front door AND keep my toddler out of his brother\u2019s room. These worked great on our front door but didn\u2019t fit on our interior doors. I guess our knobs are more bulbous because these covers fit snugly around them and actually make a doorknob EASIER to turn. I\u2019ll have to come up with another solution.",

If you not hold it properly and press it, it hurts your main fingers a lot. Also if you have small hands (ladies S size) it is too big to hold and twist. For kids it is good, it works for them. In the darkness, it can be quite challenging to find where you need to press to open it easily.",

They are FAR too loose on our door knobs, requiring a significant amount of pressure (I had to use both hands) to open a door. Even then it took more than one try. I had this on our front door and took it off almost immediately - if I needed to open the door quickly these would be a hazard. It was also an effort to install - the littler tabs don't easily click into place. Returning and looking for something that's a better. fit.",

Very well made only drawback is they are difficult to take off which is good for him but not for me:)",
