      "title": "Good first Baseball Game",
      "text": "This is a pretty good game overall. It is the first attempt of baseball on the Vita, so I was trying to be fair with my expectations. PROS: Plays well, and feels like a console game. Controls are nice, and it was adapted well. Graphically looks pretty good for the first game. Has pretty good overall console modes support CONS: Can tell its a bit buggy. Slow at times, and takes a long time to simulate in franchise. Longer than it should. The ball is weirdly big. Frame rate/overall smoothness is lacking. It definitely needs a bit of attention, but not bad for the first portable attempt.",

Its really odd because it only happens I try to start my number 1 pitcher, so every 5 games I have to simulate one. It's not a deal breaker for me, but its a little irritating.",
