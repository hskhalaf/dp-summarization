It does just fine, and the upper leather is very easy to put in the cover so that it\u2019s closed. Some other review it looked like it is hand made, I completely disagree, it looks very professionally made (and I am picky, such a thing would disturb me if it were true). The color doesn\u2019t exactly match the red/purple keyboard but it\u2019s pretty closw so it won\u2019t bother you. Overall great value for the money. Also very light. Definitely doesn\u2019t fit the charger.",

      "text": "This cover is OK. Price seems a little high for what it is. It protects against scrapes and scratches mostly; It's not going to do much for drops or rough hits inside a backpack. Using the flap as a mouse pad is impractical for me; too close to the laptop and not enough space. For me, this cover has a bit of a \"my mom made it from Hobby Lobby / remnants from an upholstery store\" vibe to it; it's not horrible but it may not be the best for you if you are picky about aesthetics or work in a more professional office environment.",

But I will be shopping for a higher quality case for my Surface laptop which I think is one of the most beautiful machines ever made by Microsoft and I think it should be enshrined in a quality case.",

Once you get it into the case you cannot get it out without spending some time to carefully remove it. Friction is your enemy. Doesn't matter how you put it into the case, the only way it reasonable fits is without the type cover. That's a No-Go and I will return.",

In contacting the seller, they quickly rectified the situation. The redesigned sleeve fits much better, but is still snug enough so it doesn't take up much more space in my bag than the naked device. Will spend some more time with it and will adjust my rating accordingly.",

I never leave reviews on anything but if anyone else has a Microsoft surface I would suggest getting a larger one like a 14 inch and make sure you check the INTERNAL dimensions to make sure your laptop fits, not just the external dimensions. Pictures are of my laptop directly on top of the sleeve; the laptop is clearly larger. Even side by side it's beyond a snug fit.",
