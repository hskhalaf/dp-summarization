It has made a huge difference to my dogs, and I truly feel it helps them to hear from me when I am gone for an extended period of time. They figured out pretty quickly what the music call means and they run to the PetChatz box to greet me. I love that I can see them and the ability to record their reactions is great. The first time I ever used it, I got fun pic of 3 dogs figuring it out :)",

      "text": "The PetChatz only works like 30% of the time and when it does work, the picture quality is horrible! For being so expensive, I would expect it to work a lot better and be higher quality. I bought this so I could check on my dog while at school or work but it was a big mistake. It seemed to work fine the first month or so that we had it, but after awhile, I can't even connect to it EVEN while sitting in the same room! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",

The treats are also super tasty for him, and I can tell he gets super excited when I dispense it. It's a great product, and I'd highly recommend it to all pet owners!!",
