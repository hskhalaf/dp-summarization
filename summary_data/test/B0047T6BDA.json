      "text": "I bought this hammer months in advance of a stint working as a stone mason...so I was past the date when I could get a refund or return the hammer...and on the first day I used it, I bent the handle...hitting a freaking brick! A brick hammer too weak to use to hit a brick? It is poorly designed with a heavy head but a ridiculously narrow and thin neck which bent and which I could then re-straighten with my bare hands...and I am no circus freak strongman. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. I had to eat the cost of my now useless craphammer.",

Not only is it a good tool, its affordable. Gives you everything the more expensive hammers offer, and I have not had any downsides yet. Highly recommend this.",

The only reason for less than the full stars is that the finger grips are slightly annoying when you turn the hammer around to use the other end. Not problematic, but seems like a bad idea to use them. Also, rusted easily with just a few drops of water overnight. But the $20 savings got me over that, and it was bound to happen working around mortar and water.",
