To make it work, you need download Rode's app. Sadly, the app constantly freezes and it is so hard to manage when you are in front of a camera juggling a bunch of things. It is advertised as free, but you can't do much with the free version. You have to buy the app to be able to use it to use it to its full potential. So until they come up with a better app that works fast and easy to manage, I wouldn't buy this microphone.",

The last update the app recieved was probably over 5 years ago. It is entirely impossible to respect a company so negligent with their tools, regardless of whether they make good microphones.",

As another review noted, it's not that much better than the earbuds mic - although this is obviously easier to use discreetly when videoing. If you're just doing audio, save yourself the money and hold the earbuds mic in front of you. It would have also been nice if a code for the app would have been included rather than another $6.",

It's been reliable, easy to use, and flexible. My only complaint is getting the tiny wire to stay upward in the clip is hard; it keeps coming out.
