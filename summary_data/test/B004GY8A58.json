      "text": "These pacifiers are just as good as the popular Soothie pacifiers. They have pretty much the same nipple design, but the gumdrops have more of an oval shape over the mouth instead of a circle. My baby takes both and there isn't a lot of difference between the two, but I just think these are a little cuter. I like being able to buy them in 6 count instead of just 2 at a time. Stock up because pacifiers have a way of just disappearing it seems!",

I order a new set every 6 weeks (that's the recommended time for replacement by the doctor) so that I can have one in the crib, one in the car seat, one in the play pen, one in the pack n play, a couple in the diaper bag... well you get the idea ;)",
