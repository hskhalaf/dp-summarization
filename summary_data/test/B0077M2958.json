They work better with oil, but still not as well as I'd like. It still has some jerkiness if I move the tripod on the dolly while shooting video\u2014which is the main reason I bought this dolly. In every other way, it is more than adequate for my needs (shooting seminar speakers). If the Chinese would oil the wheels before shipping, I think customers would be a little happier with this product.",

For video, it does move the camera around and I'm only using an amature video camera with the image stabilization on. That said, it does shake and rattle the image over cement and areas that are not perfect. On stage or gym floors, it's fine. Again, I'm not spending $500 for a dampened tripod dolly but this works well for my purposes.",

I sometimes see reviews of this and similar dollys where people are trying to use them as \"trollys\" for video shots. Good luck. Some have even smaller wheels. This has 3\" wheels. Tripods attach very solidly, making the tripod and dolly *one unit.* Very convenient to *roll* your equipment 12' \"that way\" when doing a shoot, than pick it up and schlep. Chances are this (and other similar) tripod will prevent your tripod from opening to IT's widest \"door-opening width\" which *does* affect center-of-gravity-- but I doubt many use 500mm telephotos that might tip it in the \"studio.\" (or your den)",

The brake on the wheel kept making contact with the thumb screw to adjust how far from the center the tripod leg locks would slide. It made for a terrible performance.",

Unfortunately it struggles to stay smooth even on only slightly rough surfaces. We were shooting on a worn plywood floor and the wheels could barely move without issues. It works okay on very smooth floors but for anything else you might as well hand hold your camera. I'm hoping with some adjustments we can get the wheels to roll more smoothly.",
