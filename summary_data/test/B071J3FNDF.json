He puts about 4 along the top of the posters to hang them up, but they are big posters. Maybe he doesn't need as many as that, but it looks fine and he is happy having his posters up. edited : I purchased more of these magnets to hang pamphlets up on notice boards. They are strong, and even if they break in half, they still hold up the pamphlets and brochures.",

For normal items, though, these do work well. I'd stuck the magnets to a wall and they did what I'd expect. I will warn you, the packaging was less than ideal which resulted in a few of them being broken. This didn't hurt my feelings as I only needed 1-2 magnets. Just as a heads up if you need the exact amount. I'd guess I'd blame Amazon for that and not the product.",
