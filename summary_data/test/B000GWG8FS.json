Expiration date was good, might be the transportation or storage that kills the probiotics. Purchased them again from Sprouts and I'm back on track.",

One of the few things that actually helped was taking Garden of Life Primal Defense Ultra probiotics. They were recommended to me by a fellow GERD sufferer. At first I took one pill twice a day, but as my GERD got better, I cut back to once a day. At this point, I can eat pretty much what I want, and I've stopped sleeping on the wedge pillow. I still get heartburn occasionally, but much less often (usually when I've eaten far too much), and it is MUCH less severe.",
