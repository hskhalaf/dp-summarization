My only gripe - it does lose the Bluetooth connection every hour or so. Sometimes it will vibrate to notify you of this which is nice but easy to miss (I would like it to keep vibrating/red until reconnected, or attempt to reconnect on its own). There doesn't seem to be any one reason for this but hopefully it gets patched.",

The device will extend the range of pokemon catches and gyms that can be spun when traveling by automobile...as long as you keep the speed down around \"school zone\" level.

If you're a casual or occasional player, you might not find it worth the money, but if you're a bit more serious and hate missing a pokestop, you'll love it. Not to mention, it helps cut down on the battery drain on your phone as it watches for stops, pokemon, and credits you with walking distance even if your phone screen isn't powered on, as long as the app is running.",

      "text": "The fear I had with this item was compatibility, because I read some people have had problems connecting the device to the game. In my case, the Pokemon Go Plus works perfectly with my Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. The most likely is that you won't be using it all the time, because what's the point. But is really useful when you are exploring a new place, a new city or out just doing something and you don't want to lose all those pokemons. The only thing is that sometimes it takes a little time to detect poke stops. But that may be related to my internet connection, I don't know, even though is great to know you keep catching pokemons.",

It makes catching Pokemon, spinning stops, and getting kilometers much easier and saves a lot of battery on my phone.
