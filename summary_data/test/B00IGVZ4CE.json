I contacted the seller who told me that I could find a spare flange valve clamp online with the information in the user manual, but there is no information that is useful. I spent a day and a half trying to find the part with any numbers I could find on the unit and have found nothing that will work. Unfortunately for me I now have to buy a whole new unit to replace the one I bought less than one year ago. I am completely disappointed in the lack of help this company provides on the products they sell.",

The glass also is partway full with water which makes reading from a distance a challenge. All in all, a great unit for the price. Update: August 2018 Still pumping and keeping my 14' above ground pool clear. I substituted sand for crushed glass in the filter which seems to maintain a nice flow without the pressure getting too high. I backwash about once a week. Water is beautifully clear. A huge improvement over the stock pump which was supplied with the pool.",

Update, after most of summer use at least 12 hours a day, it does have a small leak around the pressure gauge. Nothing crazy, doesn't effect water level of pool. Makes reading the pressure gauge harder, but all the YouTube videos say those are usually shot quickly anyway. We can tell via the return pressure in the pool when it needs backwashed anyway.
