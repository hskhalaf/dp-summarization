Update: It was a hit at the birthday party which had children ranging in age from 6 months to 4.5 years. And held up to all the use at the party!",

We were able to re-live our childhood gym class days and had a blast doing so! the parachute seems to be very durable, however I have only used it twice. definitely would suggest buying if you are looking for a throwback or want to entertain children! it really is a great arm workout also!",

We originally had two mini-parachutes, but you can\u2019t do much with those. With this we can play popcorn and the kids can all fit under it for the finale. I\u2019m so glad I bought this!",

There is something so magical about when everyone brings it down behind their backs, making a big mushroom overhead. The kids faces just light up! Seriously...endless fun. And I've been able to make up simple music and rhythm games using the parachute, too, which makes it relevant to what I'm teaching. This this is HUGE, by the way. I typically have about 20 kids in my class and there is a handle for each one of them.",
