This is the second pair for my 8th grade son who is a girthy lineman. He's 5'8\" and weighs 180 pounds with a 34 inch waist. The adult large is perfect for him. The other great thing about these pants is they hold up in the wash. I've read reviews about other pants that fall apart in the wash. I wash these several times a week on a hand wash setting and have had no problems whatsoever with the pads coming out or the material ripping. Still good as new.",

Prior to receiving these pants he was wearing the school issued youth 3x pants and the waist line was way too short, so he could never get them pulled up far enough. It was painful to watch him adjust his pants every play. We received these pants sooner than expected and they fit perfect. I would recommend for anyone who is taller and needs a higher waist line.",
