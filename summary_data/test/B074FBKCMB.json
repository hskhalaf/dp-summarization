Also, when I try to go up once on a menu or something, the controller reads it as 2-3 times and will jump upwards 2-3 times. Same with the bumpers.",

The design feels a lot more sturdy and the look is sleek. Hopefully it can hold up, but for now it's working great. And that new RB button? Works great. I really am enjoying this controller.",

I then used the factory controller that came with the Xbox, and the sound is fine. I suspect the headphone jack port is loose and not working correctly. I also suspect that these controllers are refurbished and not OEM Microsoft products. I will purchase my next controller from a certified reseller next time",

However, the Product Description states, \"Batteries: 1 Lithium ion batteries required. (included).\" This is not true -it comes with a set of foreign sourced standard Alakline AA batteries. Reason for the lower rating. The controller is already about $5 more than the regular Microsoft black or white controllers, so without the Microsoft Li-ion rechargable battery pack, which will run you another $20 plus, it's not a good buy. If you have a rechargable battery pack in another Microsoft Xbox One controller, it will work with this one.",

If it connects, it's fine for the session - but it only connects half the time. Re-linking the controller has no effect. This isn't the seller's fault - just consistently terrible quality control by the manufacturer for xbox one controllers. The 360 controllers at least lasted a year or more before they began to have issues. I've owned 4 xbox one controllers and three out of four were unusable within 6 months. This one lasted half that.",

Looks really slick too. PS: I don\u2019t know if this is a feature of every Xbox controller, but it comes with software updates every once in awhile so if you ever have a hard time connecting to your headset, go check that out in the controller settings. I was super surprised to find that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t connecting.",

However when I got the controller, not only did I get the wrong color (an issue some have had with this product), but it was damaged. I got a white controller with a deep gash in the d pad. I'll be returning this item, but I won't buy another just because of the hassle. So, be careful when getting used controllers because even though Amazon says they inspect them, they clearly don't do a good job.",
