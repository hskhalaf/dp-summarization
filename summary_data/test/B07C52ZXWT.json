Keeps them both entertained and they\u2019re easy to put in and take out. The screw can be a bit tricky lining up, so I just keep it on and remove the adjustable headrest attachment. Inside we can use it as a stand. It\u2019s perfect! Love that it comes with both a cigarette charger and an outlet charger too! Good screen size and the sound is good! Only thing it doesn\u2019t have are headphones.",

The unit itself and remote are nice and straightforward. As for the DVD player, I can't get the DVD to eject by pushing the eject button while using it. I have to shut it off and turn back in and then push eject button for disc to come out. The disc starts where you last left off which is nice. The games are very basic Atari style games from the 80s.",
