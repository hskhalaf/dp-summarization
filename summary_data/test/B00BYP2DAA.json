I store my travel trailer outside so the cover has been put to the test with the elements of the desert. I really like the air vents, and the zipper access points. The straps are well made, and a bonus with the corner reflectors. I will be buying your product again in the future. Great product!",

Been on since Oct, several winter snow and ice storms, and still holding up fine. If I get 2 seasons out of it, for the price, I'll be pleased. Follow instructions... The negative feedback, not surprising, but they probably did not install and take recommended precautions. Update: Nov 2019. Ive used 2 seasons, just installed for 3rd, and confident it will be fine. I don't get the negative comments, they must not be protecting sharp edges on camper (i use some swim noodles)",

The only thing I wish these cover manufactures would do would be to re-inforse the areas around the corners. I know the corners do not always match in the same places on each trailer, so maybe a double thickness in the area. I know it was cold when we put this on and our fingers were freezing, so we did not pad the corners. I know we will pay for this, but it is what it is.",

We are now in the beginning of March and the fabric is splitting where the straps were sewn on. This product is definitely not worth the money. It is poorly constructed and not durable.",

Now that i know there's a trick to putting them on i will be looking to prevent it next time. I would guess no matter what brand you purchase you will have these issues. Take your time asking them carefully as you go. For the money, this was a good purchase. Hope it lasts, only time will tell.",
