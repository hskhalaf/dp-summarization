Seems like these would help a lot at first, but I soon noticed that they were actually impeding my ability to find good veins. If the manufacturer would make the lenses a little more scratch proof and clearer, I would consider buying them again. As for now, they sit in my backpack unused.",

    "description": "Invented and patented by scientists from Princeton and Caltech, VINO Colorblindness Glasses corrects red-green color deficiency. The only colorblindness technology in the world that augments the signal that red-green vision is designed to see. BACKGROUND: This technology was designed to amplify perception of the oxygenation signal coming from the blood under the skin. It aids color deficiency because color vision actually evolved to see these oxygenation signals from skin, so as to sense blushes, blanches, and other emotion states on bare skin, a 2006 discovery from VINO Optics scientists. Proven in studies to work: \u201cDiscrimination IMPROVED along the RG axis both for deuteranopic and deuteranomalous subjects wearing VINO OPTICS (O2Amp) glasses.\u201d Mastey et al., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science September 2016, Vol.57, 192.",
