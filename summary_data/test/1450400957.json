Also, the emphasis is on adding bulk and looking good. Some focus on stabilizing ones core, on other means of injury protection would have been appreciated. And, like most such books, the assumption is that the reader is young. Some suggestions for older lifters would have been beneficial.",

A lot of the illustrations were taken from Strength Training Anatomy. There's even one drawing with a description that gives a correction about the form - instead of making a new drawing, the writer just lazily reused a drawing from the previous book. Most of the new illustrations are mediocre photos. Also, this book focuses entirely on dumbbell training, no barbell work is included. I feel like some of the workout routines are interesting and I will be trying them. Still, this book rates only a 'meh' due to the sloppy way it was constructed.",
