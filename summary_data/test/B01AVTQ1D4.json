These are so straightforward to clean and so functional at such a good price I wrote this review. I normally do not write any reviews. Others in our wine group were very interested in the aeration designed for a 750 ML bottle. The only thing I cannot review is their lifetime warranty. Frankly I hope to never provide a review on this benefit. Love them (bought two) Richard Oertle",

Leave the wine in for at least 30 minutes......it tastes so much better than not using it.....amazing. I also use a bottle top aerator to pour the wine into this. As the wine sits even longer (1-2 hours) it opens up even more. The glass is thick....and it is quite beautiful, like a vase. Recommend washing by hand. Buy a brush to help clean this.....it can be tough to get to the bottom. Highly recommend!.....Cheers!!",

      "LEAD FREE CRYSTAL - Our hand blown lead-free crystal decanters add radiance to any room or kitchen with a modern yet elegant design. Impress your guests, amplify the ambiance and enhance the purity, aroma, and taste of your favorite red or white wine with our wine pourer. Perfect for a merlot, cabernet, pinot noir, port and other bottles of wine.",
      "PROVIDE YOUR WINE WITH ITS OWN CHATEAU - Free your wine from the grasp of an air restricting bottle by letting it flow into our elegant crystal wine decanter aerator. Decanting the wine from the bottle to the decanter oxygenates the wine and releases its rich aroma and flavor.",
      "PERFECTLY ENGINEERED FOR A STANDARD 750ML BOTTLE - Don't be tricked by other manufacturers claiming their decanter has a volumetric capacity of 1700ml or more. The volume is pointless, what really matters is how much breathable surface area 1 bottle of wine is exposed to in the carafe. When an entire bottle of wine is poured into OUR decanter, the wine reaches the widest diameter on the decanter allowing for maximum aeration. This is a wine accessory you can't live without.",
      "EASY POUR SLANTED SPOUT - Avoid spills and drips with our specially designed large slanted top. If you are a wine drinker, you will appreciate how our 32 ounce / 750ml wine breather enhances the taste.",
      "MAKES THE PERFECT PRESENT - A great present for any \"wino\". The perfect idea for wine lovers, enthusiasts, women, men, dad, mom, husband, wife, grandparents and more. Surprise your wine connoisseur friends with a unique wine present for holidays, weddings, or birthdays."
