I like how it has a time chart on the bottle so you can track your water consumption, which is easy to do since the water tastes better. It also comes with a gel-ice thing that you can freeze & attach it within the water bottle to keep the water cold. I\u2019ve recommended this bottle to many people!",

Also, the infuser part you would have to cut up the fruit kind of small, therefore, possibly coming through the badly designed fruit screen. Sent back.",

I found out about the \"Increment Bottle\" that is designed in Ireland, but takes 30-35 days for deliver. And these are also handmade which adds to the time. Discouraged, I found this bottle, and it works like a charm. It might not have the \"giant water drops\" on it but I really like how it has the times (morning starting at 8 and the last ending at 5 in the evening). I need what kick in the but needed to motivate me to drink water. All-in-all, I love it.",

Bevgo, I would strongly encourage your design team to revisit their shape choice for their infuser in this bottle as it very much resembles the male anatomy when the detachable ice gel ball is connected.

I do not use the infuser much, and have no issues with it leaking without it. I love how it opens and locks. I also really like how the lid is designed so it's easy to clean and no areas to worry about mold.",

Only fruit with little pieces like grapefruit or other citrus fruit may end up floating in your water. The top is very nice. When you close it, it has a seal that fits on the water spout so it doesn't spill. There is also a sturdy plastic loop that can be put on a hook on your bag.",

Would definitely recommend this product and am considering buying a couple more, one more for myself and several as gifts for fellow nurses.

The flavor is delightful. Beats plane water hands down. I keep the pitcher loaded and in the refrigerator. It's nice to have it to fill the dinner glasses with the same great flavor.

It's got a little ring for easy carrying and another strap on the cooler sleeve.
