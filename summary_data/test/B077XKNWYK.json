      "text": "This is much softer than other cooling towel company's models, and seemsmore lighter on the neck as well. It is machine washable, and easy to store outside the container. It has been used steadily for a week now, as I have a condition where I need a cooling towel to be outside over 80 degrees. I would recommend in the summertime to place a few ice cubes in the neck area, this way, as the ice melt the towel stays cooler longer. Love the towel, Love the brand and could not be more pleased!",

      "text": "This cooling towel came well packaged in a special bottle. The actual towel size is 12'' x 32'' and the mesh fiber material is very soft. I found that after this cooling towel is soaked in cold water and wringed out, the cool stays for some time. According to the description though, you can't store or pack it while it's wet. This towel is also easy to care for, since it's machine washable (with warm water and mild detergent) though it's air-dry only, so no dryer. Overall, I'm pleased with this towel.",

Can\u2019t wait to take it on vacation wirh me soon. It\u2019s very light weight, easy to take along. You can even just tie it to your carry-on. That way you are immediately ready for that tropical destination. Best thing is that it dries fast.",

I like that I can soak the Arctic Breeze cooling towel in cold water, wring it, then put it over my head. It stays in place pretty well. Or I can tie it loosely around my neck. On other days, I simply use it to wipe sweat from my face. You can wash this in a warm-water setting with gentle detergent, but you must air-dry this. You cannot put it in the dryer or you will compromise its longevity. Recommended.",

A great extra little comfort that can add zip to a hike or recovery to a rest.",
