With any carafe you will need to pre-heat with hot water while you get the rest of the coffee pot ready. It only takes a minutes to let hot water sit in the carafe to pre-heat. With that said you obviously can not do that when you use the auto setting but we found the coffee to still be quite hot regardless.",

The older pot is very quiet, but this one is the opposite. Other than that--a good coffee pot....great brand.",

Very quickly we noticed that it was difficult to pour coffee without significant dripping - necessitating clean up after pouring every cup of coffee. In cleaning the counter I moved the coffeemaker to reveal a large black spot where the coffeemaker had been sitting. After contacting the manufacturer, customer service maintained this was not a design or manufacturing flaw, but user error because a little notch was not exactly centered over the spout. After a few tries, I had difficulty always getting the notch in the magic spot. Makes decent coffee but also makes a mess!",

    "title": "Capresso MT600 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Stainless-Steel Thermal Carafe",
    "description": "Brew up to 10 cups of delicious, full-flavored coffee in under eight minutes with this programmable coffeemaker. The machine provides an illuminated, 24-hour, LCD digital clock and timer with soft-touch controls for easy operation. Set the timer so that fresh, hot coffee awaits dinner guests when it's time to serve dessert or so that the aroma of a freshly brewed pot fills the house a few minutes before the alarm goes off in the morning. The coffeemaker supplies a 10-cup stainless-steel thermal carafe with an ergonomic stay-cool handle, brew-through lid, and drip-free pouring spout. Removing the carafe from the coffeemaker stops the flow of coffee and allows for sneaking a quick cup before the end of the brewing process. Simply replace the carafe to restart the flow of coffee. Another thoughtful detail includes its special smaller-amount setting, which ensures maximum aroma when brewing just 3 to 5 cups at a time. For added convenience, the coffeemaker features a stainless-steel-lined heating system that eliminates contact with aluminum and reduces the need for decalcifying, the ability to retain programming during short power outages, and automatic shut-off after two hours for safety and peace of mind. Other highlights include a handy water-level indicator, a washable gold-tone filter (no need for disposable paper filters), a charcoal water filter that removes up to 82-percent of chlorine and other impurities from tap water, and an electronic indicator that shows when to replace the charcoal filter, as well as milled steel housing for superior strength and style and concealed cord storage to keep countertops looking tidy. The coffeemaker measures approximately 9 by 8 by 14 inches.",
