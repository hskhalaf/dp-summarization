      "text": "My kids are still pretty young, 7 and 8, so I was worried that the songs would be too suggestive or the criticism too strong (as reviewed in other/different karaoke video games), but it was perfect! Age appropriate and fun for everyone! Some old school songs, some oldies, some new hits - the perfect mix. It's a lot like Just Dance in its finishing ratings system, with 5 stars and points awarded for loudness, accuracy, and flair. I'd highly recommend this game! I hope more come along with different songs soon!",

You would literally have to scream into the microphone to even be heard and at that point you are louder than the TV. You can blow into the microphone and still hardly hear anything. Complete waste of money. Maybe I got a bad one who knows, but until the vendor reaches out to me this will remain a one-star review.",

It has a lot of songs, not 50 I think, old and new, so if you're only playing this for hip modern music then you're out of luck. There's optional dancing. I really wish they made DLC for this game to keep it updated or at least brought out a second one. It's a good deal money wise and let's not forget just dance let's you sing now as well.",

Whether you're singing at the top of your lungs, or swaying to the beat in the back of the room, the vibe is infectious, and all you have to do is let go and enjoy the music! In addition to the party atmosphere being created in \"Party\" mode, players can also use the real-time feedback and test their vocal prowess in \"Sing\" mode, or try singing in Team mode to battle for performance supremacy in a game show-like environment!",
