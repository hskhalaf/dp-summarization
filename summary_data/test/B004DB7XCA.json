If you're looking for a great way to store canned food this is it! One unit holds three rows of 14 cans two units connected holds 7 rows of cans for a total of 98 cans. I will be buying two more. Recommend to assemble two or more units before you put cans in them :-). keep the extra pieces because if you need them in the future they are a bit pricey off the website. Definitely recommended!",

It does store a lot of cans which is nice. It was easy to assemble. It doesn't do well to hold small cans of things like Tuna. It can hold a few large 28 oz type cans like Libby's large cans of pumpkin, but they won't roll for the top or middle shelves as the bars that connect the sides prevent it, but you can insert a few of them from the bottom and push them up.",

Unfortunately it's costing us $14 in shipping to return it. Kind of an expensive mistake. If only folks who manufacture stuff like this actually used it, maybe they would manufacture a quality product. I think they spent more money printing the box it was packaged in rather than spending it on the actual product. Sorry to be so negative, but I just dislike companies that manufacture cheap junk and make it sound like it's the \"gift to mankind\" and will solve all my pantry problems.",
