The boost soles add a noticeable amount of cushion and the toe shape is wide which is perfect for me feet. I often have a problem with my toes being too cramped in basketball shoes causing my toenails to break all the time. So far I haven't had that problem with these. There is also pronounced cushion ridges in the lining at the heel which keeps your feet planted inside the shoe which is a must for balling in low tops. So far I am impressed, I just hope they hold up to wear and tear.",

So, I wasn't going to let the tiny bit of narrow fit keep me from using them. After a few times, I don't even notice that they were narrow to start. I just don't lace them as tight near the toes.",

Maybe this is my fault for using basketball shoes for standing all day. I really like the shoes except for those cushions which ruin them for me. On goes the quest for comfortable works shoes.",

At the time the 10.5 were $65 and at that price I had to cop. They seem authentic. The stitching, materials and serial #\u2019s are all correct. Overall, super clean pair of kicks for a decent price.",
