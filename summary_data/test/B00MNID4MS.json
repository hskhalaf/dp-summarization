      "text": "Very stylish, sturdy, and adjustable. The mechanism is smooth and crisp. Do note that this kickstand can only be mounted with a bolt from above, intended to be used in the triangular space between the chainstays of a standard bicycle. It's not visible in the photos here, but the threaded hole does not go all the way through the body of the kickstand, and so it cannot be mounted with a bolt from below into a threaded hole in a solid surface, as in some specialty bikes such as the Strida line. If that's what you need, Soma makes a (somewhat more expensive and boxy) stand that is similar in function with a hole that goes through the body.",

I was so disappointed but thankfully it works on my boyfriend's bike. Both our bikes are heavy and this wonderful innovation is perfect for keeping the bike extremely stable. Please make sure that you take the correct measurements after installing what you need to on your bike to make sure that the kickstand can come out properly.",

Should have gone with VO's other centerstand offering. This type just seems gimmicky.",

Its ingenious design collapses both legs over to the non-drive side of the bike. It deploys and retracts with the ease of an ordinary kickstand. It's a little chunky but not to the point of being an issue. It's a little heavier than an average kickstand but I don't care. Whomever designed this thing deserves a hug.",

For the 520, used the longer of the two provided bolts. slight adjustment / alignment with the rear chainstay so it would not interfere with pedaling. Highly recommend this stand.",
