      "text": "Awesome hydration pack! I bought this for Ragnar, but used it at a half marathon first. It's not very big, but it has pockets in the front for your keys, phone and protein bar. There's a large pocket in the back for the water reservoir, but you can fit a few small items in there too. It's light, it says secure, no bouncing around. It doesn't make my back super sweaty either. The straps allow this pack to fit on a slender person or a bigger person like me.",

I learned the hard way that the first thing you need to do is fill it up some kind of mix consisting of apple cider vinegar, and baking soda (or something like that) to take away that nasty taste. There should have been some instructions on that. Anyway, other than that little misshap, it's awesome!",

Only issue is the side and chest strap gets lose so you are constantly tightening while you are running. It isn\u2019t enough to bother me, but it might bother others.

I think posting a video on how exactly to fill the bladder, remove air, put the pack on and then clean it after a run is very needed.",
