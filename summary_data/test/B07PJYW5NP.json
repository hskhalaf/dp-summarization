It provides a slight bounce while running I would have preferred more. However, no shoe will ever be perfect but this is overall a good shoe for the price and it provides additional nighttime advance warning to alert drivers due to its distinctive color.",

The shoe is a little snug in the mid-foot. Also, it is harder to make cuts as the shoe isn't as secure as the v4 or v5 shoes were. They are light and comfortable though. Plus I have gotten plenty of compliments on the new color scheme.",

Positives: The sole is rigid and allows for springy strides, traction is great, the heel to toe drop is ideal at 6mm. The forefoot and midfoot feel securely locked in. Negatives: If the heel cupping were better and didn't tear my feet up, it would be a decent shoe. The heel cup they have on the fresh foam cruz v1 is great, never had any issues with it. It looks like they have something similar in the t2/boa version of this shoe.",

The 1500 line is the best shoe i've been able to find for races that accommodates wide feet. I train in the Brooks Ghost and the new balance 1080, both size 12 4e. I have been very happy with the 1500 v5 and now the v6. the v6 is a little more airy, but has same fit. I expect to use it to try an qualify for boston again.",

I wasn't sure about support in a racing-type shoe, as I don't overpronate, but I found it gives me very good support while running very fast. It is just supportive enough to make me feel stable underfoot, but in a very light shoe. I find myself looking forward to 400m to 1000m repeats just because of this shoe. It's a total winner.",
