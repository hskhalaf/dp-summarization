Like some people have mentioned in the comments, the compaction of the ground coffee is the key to making great tasting coffee. If you overfill and over-compact the coffee grounds in the k-cup, the water will not filter through the coffee and will overflow from the top of the k-cup. I typically fill the k-cup 3/4 of the way with loose coffee grinds, tap it on the counter two or three times, and then run it through the machine. These k-cups are very easy to clean, just run it through hot water to clean the cups. I recommend this product to others!",

Minimal cleaning and maintenance especially compared to the other designs on the market. These are affordable and much easier and CLEANER to work with. I'd recommend these to any keurig owner looking to stop wasting all of the plastic (and $$$) on K-cups and start using their own coffee/tea. Cons: None so far. I'm sure after time the mesh will start to give but that's the case with any reusable K-cup.",

Buying these resusable K-cups allowed me to do that, kicking wasteful expensive disposable K-Cups to the curb. Now, it's not about short term savings - if you are mindful of how much coffee you use per cup, you can save about 20-30 cents a cup, which amounts potentially to about 50% savings all in all. If you a ton of coffee like I do you'll pay for the cups, disposable filter, and the container to store your coffee beans/grounds after a few months. Highly recommended. Enjoy!
