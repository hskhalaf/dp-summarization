I can't imagine a serious athlete would consider this a cross-trainer, but it's great for doing a lot of city walking. The toe box feels just a tad longer than my other shoes, but it fits fine. I need a wide toe box and have trouble finding shoes that fit the toe but don't slide off the heal. These worked for me. They look nicer than a traditional athletic shoe. A tad pricey for what they are.",
