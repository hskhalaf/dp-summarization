For the price, you cant beat this head unit. I really like that there is a \"Siri\" button on the bottom left of the unit, easy access to change songs, navigate, or call someone.

It\u2019s an external microphone that needs to be mounted either in the dash, or the steering column, and it is rather large for a car microphone.
