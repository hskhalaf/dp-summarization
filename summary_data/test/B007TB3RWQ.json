      "text": "When I first bought this sensor it paired with the hub and beeped when wet but did not send an alarm on the network. Fortrezz and SmartThings worked together to solve the problem and make it work as advertised. Now when I test the sensor it beeps and sends an alert to the hub, and the hub sends me a notification and a text message. Kudos for the responsiveness and level of support of these teams!",

Neither manufacturer will tell you that until you delve into the Community Forum for Smart(dumb)Things. Fortrezz eludes to some binary code set up. Bottom line stay away from both manufacturers until they grow-up. Unless you are a Linux Hacker.",

Yet its about the highest price zwave water sensor. I'm trying the Everspring water sensor now. Much better design for longevity. Any of the water sensor that sit off the ground should be superior to the fortrezz. Fortrezz apparently put very little effort into the design of this product.",
