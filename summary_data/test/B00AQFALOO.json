It's so bad that if I rub a paper towel along the side of the shoe, it will also turn black. Very poor quality, bought just over a month ago for school that started this week, and after one day of wearing they're going to be donated! Might wind up calling Stride Rite directly, to see if I have any recourse.",

They are comfortable, maintain their shape and color after being broken in, and are easy for her to put on and take off on her own. I'll be ordering another pair when she grows out of these. Excellent shoe!!",

They are cuter on then these pictures show.",

The Bad: The shoe is not dyed well and the toe does not hold up to Kindergarten recess. Go ahead and throw Tarrago #116 (Deep Brown) shoe polish in your cart. You will likely need to use it every few days.",

Being leather, I don't have to worry about the fabric ripping (yes), staining or peeling off as I've witnessed from other SR shoes lately during normal wear. They are accurate for size too.",

My kindergarten daughter has worn them all year almost daily for school and they are still in great condition- slightly faded, but nothing a little shoe polish can't help. I would expect some fading with 10 months of wear on an active 6 year old. I will be saving these ones for my younger daughter and buying new ones for the older for the new school year. I highly recommend these shoes!",
