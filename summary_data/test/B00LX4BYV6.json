I was up early 01/13/2017 and tried to contact Nuance, no luck it's as time wasting as the installation. I have never had a problem installing a product onto my computer, simple task. It is the end of day two and have invested another 7 hours. I'm DONE, WTH Nuance? I'm very disappointed!",

It still does not take adequate advantage of multi-core CPUs or of vast amounts of memory like it should. This program needs to learn how to utilize system resources if they are available. Come on Nuance get it together. Your programmers turn out the same old thing with only minor improvements over decades of development, yet claim vast improvements with each release.

There is no easy on-line support to help...only lists and lists or How to Set It Up. TOTALLY frustrated and about to ship it back. It is billed as completely user friendly and I am fairly good at following tech instructions. Finally had to hang it up. Got it for use at work, but it appears that it will require me to scream into the microphone.",
