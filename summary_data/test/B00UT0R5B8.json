And, since this model (168A) doesn't have a \"color temperature wheel\", I'll have to live with that green light from now on. I have a Neweer Led light that looks better, i've made a comparison of color and you can quickly tell that green led this Selens LED has. Package was fine, costumer service and shipping too. But... I'm dissapointed =/ (sorry about the picture quality, but anyway you do can see the color difference between both lights)",

      "title": "Cheesy Video Light",
      "text": "I bought this light primarily because it has adapter plates for common Li-ion batteries such as the Canon LP-E6. Brightness is rather good, but there are two critical flaws. 1. The color balance is just terrible and the filter doesn't help. You will need to do a custom white balance or correct it in PP. Of course it will not mix well with other lights. 2. There is some weakness in the contacts or electronics that makes it flicker annoyingly at times. This may be a individual unit defect. The construction is very cheap as one might expect from the price.",

I'm using two of these to light my streaming area that uses a green screen and the adjustable dial works wonders when the windows in my room go from day to night. An excellent option as well if you need a lamp for emergency situations as it does run on AA batteries. I used Duracell Ultras on it to test it out and it ran about 8 hours before it started dimming out. It's a great light for video or photographers needing good light.",

Up-to 8' for good illumination and it just gives you \"bright eyes\" and hair highlights after 12'. The whole use-a-camera-battery-adapter thingies are kinda a joke. The batteries weigh 3x more than the light and cause it to tilt towards the back. Just go with re-chargeable AAs. The dimmer is fine. Again, for the price ... it's perfect. Not spectacular.",

The Selens unit by comparison gives a decidedly green cast to my images, despite it supposedly also being poised at 5500K. My Olympus DSLR cannot completely adjust for it, and my photo editing software also gives only partial compensation. I'm sure if I spent the time tweaking the software the results would be better, but who wants to deal with that? Received today and returning right away.",
