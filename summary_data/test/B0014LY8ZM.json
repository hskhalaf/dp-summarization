The material is lightweight sweater material. It's easy to take off and put on.

Let\u2019s just say that, before I have the chance to alter it, they will need to take them off before they take a potty break - ANY kind of potty break.",

Also, I really like hoods - the dogs don't wear them on their heads, but it makes it so that their neck gets a built in snugly scarf kind of effect.",

The color (purple) is as pictured, the hoodie is nice and soft, and Hazel looks adorable in it. It's just enough of an added layer for the crispy fall weather and should be good through winter as well so the poor thing doesn't get too cold.",

I bought the XXL and she fits into it very well but it is too long and the excess gets caught under her hind legs and it would be impossible for her to relieve herself, so the sizing is not quite right for my barrel chested dog.

      "text": "This is the best hoodie I've found for our 60lb lab/pointer mix. Our dog is long and lean, and often sweaters can be too short for her. This one is completely different. It's extra long and covers her backside. Although the top is nice and long, the bottom is not, which is great as it doesn't prevent your dog from going to the bathroom. The sweater does start to pill after a while; however, the black color is less noticeable. We've also gotten several compliments on how cute our dog looks wearing this because it really does look like an actual sweatshirt. So cute!",
