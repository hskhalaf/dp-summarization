The best part though is they\u2019re soft(?) enough that they really shape to your body. Other petals I\u2019ve tried seemed like you needed to be shaped *just so* for them to look natural under a shirt.

If you wear them every day and take care when washing them, they will last about a month before the adhesive starts peeling off or clumping up like pilling on a sweater. They will still work at that point, but might not stay on as securely. At that point, if you are wearing them under something relatively tight fitting, they will stay put; if you are wearing them under a loose top, they won't fall off, but parts (maybe a third of the circumference) might pull away from your skin.",

They don't seem to be losing their stick, and I've been wearing them a lot. :)",

It doesnt hurt my nips when I peel it off and doesnt cause any rash. Also, when I put it on, i cant really tell that i have my nips covered. It feels barely there which is what I love about it. Very happy with this product and I will continue to use it!",

The adhesive has lasted months with close daily use and it is only now starting to peel. One gripe I have is that there is no place for the nipples and, with close to daily use, they grow sore from the adhesive being put on and pulled off constantly. A good fix for this that I've found is to put some lotion on the sensitive parts so the adhesive won't stick to them.",

Lines dont show even through white tanks and last hours & hours. To be fair, i've yet to use them in a setting where I would be sweaty like in a club or out in summer so I'll be interested to see if they lose their stickiness then. But so far so good!!",
