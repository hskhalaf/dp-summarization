The other item I appreciated is that the gauge allows you to start another - battery to battery without the jumping car exposing their electronics to damage from another system.",

      "text": "I should have bought 20 foot jumper cables years ago! No more pushing dead cars out of parking spaces to give them a jump! It's not just the length that makes them awesome: The wires are nice and flexible even at -15! The jaws are durable and the springs are hefty to get much better contact than the average set of jumpers. Insulation on the wires feels like it's going to last a long time. The bag is a nice way to keep them stowed while not in use.",

I bought these after getting stuck with wimpy cables, and they've saved my bacon twice already. I love them. I went for the thickest gauge wire I could find and these can jump start a totally dead battery unlike the cheaper ones that with much thinner wire. More wire is more amperage and that's what you need for jump starting. Plus it came with a nice bag that they fit into for storing them.",
