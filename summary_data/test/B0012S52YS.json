Amazing how ink cartridges are not standardized, even within a manufacturer's models. This model was out of production, but found it on Amazon! Buying bulk cartridges makes more sense this way. Wouldn't it be a great selling point if one of the printer company's offered a standardized cartridge for all it's printers? If not all, then at least a long running set of models.

The style is very sleek and small enough to fit on my desk. The only 2 downfalls I have come across so far is that when I printed a photo the colors are slightly dull . Secondly, the warranty from Canon is only 3 months. You could always purchase the additional warranty from Amazon.com for less than 10 dollars. All in all I think this is a great printer for the price and I am quite happy.",
