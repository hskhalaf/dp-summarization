      "text": "I absolutely love my lazer engraver. I purchased the 2500 it came packaged extremely well took some time to put it together but was well worth it. It has taken so reading, research, and alot of trial and error but I have finally figured out the ins and outs. I have burned wood in both design and photograph, learned to cut wood and also have been able to cut paper and felt as well as sticker foam as long as it is a larger item due to the foam melting with smaller details. I am still experimenting and fine tuning my settings for what I want it to do.",
