The picture shows the front and back of the cart to have a swinging door for easy access. The one received is fixed unless I unscrew the bolts holding it together. The tires had the same issue, a pin hold them in place not the same as the picture. Will be updating this with pictures for all to see.",

Being collapsible was a must since we were scarce on empty space. We could not have switched out the propane bottle at local gas stations without this cart.",

You have to attach it at the rear axle, so the extra torque this placed on the bike frame caused one of the welds to break where the rear frame narrows down to hold the rear axle.",

Came mostly assembled, strong steel frame and durable hard plastic platform. Well designed with doors on both sides which allows you to carry items that may be longer than the cart. The only negative was that it was packed poorly for shipping. When it arrived the box was torn in several places as the cart pieces had punched through since there is no packing materials around it. This caused some scratches. It is a great product.",

It will fit onto any bike with a little attachment on the back tire. Its lasting a long time and I hope it stays that way.",

I only use it on Saturdays and Sundays for grocery runs and stuff. Only really odd thing it is ships with no assembly instructions - fortunately the assembly is pretty basic and I was able to figure it out, but I can see how it could be a problem for some. Great for weekends only, strictly local use. All in all, nice - if your needs are limited.",
