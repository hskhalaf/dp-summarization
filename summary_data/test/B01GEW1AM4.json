I have now used it for about a couple of months and I'm extremely satisfied. It has plenty of power to blow grass clippings and road debris from my driveway, gutters, and concrete patio (see attached video). With the battery fully charged, the blower lasts between 18 to 20 minutes, which is plenty of time to me to do the clean up after mowing. Highly recommended!",

I see neighbors with blow dryer powered blowers and the leaves hardly move. This one blows them away well. Honestly, it's a big kid toy. The hose weighs almost nothing so most of the weight is from the battery. If you're doing light yard work, well worth it.",

I have a smaller size yard and it\u2019s perfect with the amount of power and battery time allotted.",

I'm also attempting to be frugal and I'm glad I went for it! This is definitely a black+decker quality item. In fact for my needs it's better. The charge lasts. Which is awesome. For a couple of days with moderate to heavy use. I did not use it for a period of continuous hours however, your owners manual should call it out should that matter. Super lightweight and powerful enough for a residential use. Go for it. You won't feel buyer's remorse.",

This is the last Greenworks product that I will buy through Amazon, where I cannot check the product before delivery. Shame !",
