I can order my size and know they'll fit well. The *only* issue I had with these shoes was the traction, or lack thereof. When I teach kickboxing or hip hop, I slide around on these soles. Otherwise, everything else is awesome about these shoes. Outside, they are great but in a wood-sprung floor/fitness studio, I'd ask for more traction.",
