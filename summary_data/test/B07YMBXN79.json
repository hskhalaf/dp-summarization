Amazing customizability, accurate. I would not recommend this for entry cyclists as it is a large investment, but if you are committed to cycling, totally worth the money.",

The Wahoo was easy to set up and link to my Strava account. The Bolt is slightly smaller than the Garmin 510 but has more features (which I will have to learn to set up).

You can build your own workouts for free on the Garmin Connect app. So it's back to Garmin for me.",
