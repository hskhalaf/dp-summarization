Whatever Denon is doing with this v signature seems to be exactly where my ears and brain like to listen to ambient and edm. I have far more expensive headphones that will probably just collect dust now (provided this somewhat flimsy build quality can hold up). Btw they also look very understated, the cups are extremely deep and go fully around the ear (learn something, B&O), and seal phenomenally well.",

Unfortunately, about 4-5 months of ownership the small pieces of plastic that old the ear cups onto the headband began to fracture and break. Sadly I took a gamble on these and bought them used, so the warranty does not apply. The manufacturer's repair center charges $65 to ESTIMATE the repair cost and the manufacturer parts center doesn't even carry the part needed. So basically I ended up with trash. As a result I cannot recommend these or any Denon products.",

They are easy to wear for hours on end and the sound they produce does not produce fatigue. Only had these for a couple weeks so I expect these to break in and sound even better.

      "text": "I have lived happily with the previous model, the AH-D1000, for years. Comfortable, light-weight and, to my ears, great sound. When they finally gave in I found their successor, the AH-D1100, the natural replacement. After several hours of listening the last few weeks I am still really pleased with the result. The reason they fall short of a five-star review is the fact that they are a little bit less comfortable than their predecessor was for long hours of listening. The sound is still great. The low frequencies are a little bit louder than before, but then I like that. All in all, great value for money.",

      "text": "The sound is very nice. I'm no expert - my hearing is rather bad, and these headphones help me to understand everything much better. They fit well and do not cause an uncomfortable feeling even when worn for hours. But the material they use for the plastic arms is very weak, especially at the four points where greater stress is applied when pulling the headset over the head and ears. Even very careful handling has caused hairline cracks and worse - one arm is halway through. This is a product that should not be bought.",

One thing to note about these is the frequency response: 5 - 45000 Hz, which is amazing. Most of the headphones on the market are only doing 20 - 20K. You can really hear the difference on the low end. They sound wonderful both on the computer and attached to my iPhone.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe AH D1100 sets a new standard for performance and value in over ear headphones. Part of Denon's \"Acoustic Luxury\" line, the AH D1100's are premium headphones suitable for the discerning music listener at home, and efficient enough for use \"on the go\" with portable music players. The AHD 1100 employ a newly designed 50mm driver featuring Denon's exclusive Microfiber diaphragm technology. This ultra lightweight radiating surface provides excellent dynamics and extended frequency response (5 37,000Hz) for crystalline clarity. The drivers are housed in precision Aluminum ear cups. To eliminate distortions and colorations caused by conventional sealed back enclosures, the AHD 1100 also features Denon's Acoustic Optimizer design. This improves low frequency extension and smoothes overall response by precisely adjusting the sound pressure balance behind and in front of the driver diaphragm. The adjustable headband features a new contour fit ergonomic design and is coupled to soft protein leather foam ear cushions providing comfortable isolation from outside sounds. This, and the unit's light weight (only 180 grams 6.3 ounces) ensures extended, fatigue free listening. The AH D1100 is equipped with an audiophile grade OFC oxygen free copper cable featuring equal length L/R design. A 3.5 meter extension cable is included along with a 3.5mm to 0.25\" adapter and a convenient carrying pouch.",
