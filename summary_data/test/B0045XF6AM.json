I will give you some thinking to do... shrubbery (hedges), tall grasses (ankle and above) deep, wild free birds, bird baths farm animals incl. wild animals and lovely home adopted pets...RID works.children are great carriers. We know this by children being sent home from schools with a note. so, if you cut grass and before you go spreading rumors, and or begin blaming where and from whom you may have contacted parasite...rethink of your last where abouts. RID works wonders. see if I operate equipment and or paint wearing shorts outdoors again. RID gets 5 Stars. by: hotel kalifornia",
