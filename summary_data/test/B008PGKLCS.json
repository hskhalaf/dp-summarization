I also tied the shoes extra tight. The heel is still a little loose but I can deal. As for sizing, I'm normally a 9 and these shoes were just the right size.",

I didn't notice that too much, my right shoe does it a little but I wear no show socks that have padding on the back so it's not a problem! These are so versatile and cute!
