My husband put it together by himself in just a few hours. It wasn't difficult. I love that it comes with the knotches for the kids to grip or step on as they climb. I plan to purchase a 20 ft tent in the near future to put over this dome to make it the ultimate \"fort\" for camping outside on warm nights. This will be used in our home for many years to come. Highly recommend this geodome!! It arrived quickly and well packaged.",

Good with a swing in the middle and blankets to make a fort. Only downside is that it needs two adults to reposition, but if you're keeping it in the same spot all the time that's not a problem.",

Of course, it is well used in the summer, but we're hoping to put a tarp on it this winter and turn it into an igloo when the snow starts flying. Assembly was a little tricky -- a two person job for sure, but seems very sound and we're a big fan.",
