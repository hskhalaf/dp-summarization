The problem is they made the diameter so small that there is very little expansion inside the ear canal. They are probably ok if you have a small diameter ear canal, as seen in many women. But for most men, these Macks will not work very well. Another example of a company trying to reduce costs, but in the process produced an inferior product. Flents ear plugs are much better. Initial diameter of ear plug is much larger, therefore greater expansion in the ear canal. I'am returning the Mack's ear plugs due to poor quality.",

You do not feel the moment of silence when the foam expands and reaches the point when it actually blocks hearing, it is as if the foam is less dense and cheaper. BUY THESE IN A STORE.",

Since I couldn't find it when I needed more, I decided to go with this brand... I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! These earplugs are amazing!!! I wish I had switched sooner. Noise cancelation is perfect and they are so soft!! They're a dream to sleep with in my ears. Wow! They are also a bit shorter than the brand I was used to, which is awesome for me, because they don't stick out: they go in and stay in. Love it!!!! Highly recommend them!!!",

But if you have smaller ears, or any other difficulties with putting them in, you might want to try these.",

These earplugs are neither good at blocking noise nor are they comfortable to wear. They pushed against the inside of my ears when in, and only comfortable when almost falling out (read: no seal). Even when uncomfortable shoved into my ear canal, they barely block any sound. This is especially true in the human voice range which is, in my opinion, the most important part of the spectrum to be blocked.",

It was becoming too painful to wear them so I thought I would stop and let the sores or pimples that were in my right ear heal and they did. I started using them again and the sores came back. Too painful for me to wear so I\u2019m hoping that the beeswax ear plus work a little better for me. Overall the product is good as long as you don\u2019t get any pimples or sores in your ear!",
