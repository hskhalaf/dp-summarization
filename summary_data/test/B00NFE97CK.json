However my thumb base rubs quite a bit even with wraps on sometimes it feels like it is getting choked. Other than that minor inconvenience these gloves are nice.

The only knock I have on these gloves is that they can be a little snug once I have my hands fully wrapped. I also have mongoloid hands, so this might just be me. They were a little stuff at first but broke in nicely after About 4 training sessions. Now they are the just right cup of porridge for me :). They do have more padding than I am used to (traditional boxing gloves), as they are a Muay Thai style glove. I have enjoyed them very much and love hitting the bag with them.",
