      "text": "A good solution when you need 3 or 4 instruments ready to go. Minor complain, the sax supports are exactly the same size, you assemble them with the alto lower support in the upper recess and the tenor lower support in the lower recess. This works well for the saxes' differing lengths, but the bell support on the one you use for tenor is made to fit the alto and is too tight to allow easy in and out for the tenor. Expect to have to bend this one slightly to make it fit the tenor bell.",

As for the alto stand the padding did start to come off after about a month but I never had an issue with the sax falling so I\u2019d say I got what I paid for.",

The part that hold the bell of the sax is too tight, so when one lifts the sax off of the stand, the sax comes with it. Someone bumped into it and the sax fell right over, so now, not only can I not return the stand, but I have a sax to find a repair shop for. Don't waste your money, this one is not a good solution.",
