      "text": "This review is for the 2017 CamelBak Quick Grip. At first glance, the zippered pocket seems too small to fit an iPhone 6S+, however the material is stretchy and the depth of the pocket allows a 6S+ (with slender case) and key fob to fit in the pocket. I am able to zip it up completely with the phone and key inside. I have not used the item for long and cannot comment on how much wear and tear carrying a phone and key might cause to the pocket. For now, I am very pleased essential items fit. This is the first time I have tried a CamelBak Quick Grip so I can't compare to the earlier model.",

I put half water/half ice and it seems to melt within 20 minutes in the summer. Not a big deal to me- just worth mentioning if it makes a difference to you.",

Several times when I pulled the strap tighter it would come off the padding. I had to fiddle with it many times during my run 2. The hand strap / padding piece chaffed my hand. The underside was not comfortable. Overall I won't be using this bottle again due to the hand strap issues. Disappointed.",
