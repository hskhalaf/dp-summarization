I almost didn't notice the wireless extender is a physical switch on the device itself. The signal levels are slightly better between the two AC bridged routers. Maybe it's because it has more antennae than my previous N router or maybe its because its on the less-used 5ghz. I went from getting a really spotty 5-10mbps between the networks to 30-50mbps.",

I did it right off the bat then finished setting up the router and have had 0 problems what so ever. My old router was dropping connections and would buffer on videos. This one has been working great! I definitely recommend it and would buy again.",

On this one wifi was very slow and connected slow or not at all to other devices. So this one is going back also. Based on my experience with this router I'd say this model has some serious issues.
