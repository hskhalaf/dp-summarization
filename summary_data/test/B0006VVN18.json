To keep the shower head ball swivel tight, I end up loosening the thread while tightening the ball nut and then the whole thing leaks and rotates. The spray jets are too large and it guzzles water compared to my other hand shower head. The filter would be better installed at the other end of the hose where it wouldn't weigh down the head. Am looking for another, more practical unit with finer spray jets.",

Not sure if the filter is doing much but I guess that depends on your water quality.

Unlike my old and lighter showerhead, I am reluctant to lift it out of it's holder to use as a handheld showerhead, because the weight of it keeps tilting the holder when you place it back.

Anyways the instructions in the reviews are all different and unhelpful. Here\u2019s how to remove the flow restrictor. The flow restrictor is purple, located at the base of the showerhead where it connects to the \u201cpipe\u201d/showerhead extender. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pull out and remove. You might be able to use a tweezers too. It\u2019s not difficult to remove. Screw it back onto the \u201cpipe\u201d and you\u2019re done.",
