Works on wood floors and carpeting. Then, today (12/10) the charger stopped charging. Not sure if it's the battery or the charger, but I have a feeling it is the charger. Plug it in and I get a quick flash, then nothing. Testing it shows less than 5 volts output. Very discouraging. Thinking I could order another charger, but it costs almost as much as the new price on the vacuum. It's supposed to have a 2 year warranty and I have contacted Hoover. Let's see how well they stand behind their products.",

I've got a lot of hair (both human and pet) on the floor and to pull all that debris out of the tube/bottom piece every time just to make the suction work well is kind of exhausting.

I had already sweep and used my Sweeper on my hardwood floors, and thought they looked pretty clean. After using this guy, I was shocked by what was left behind! I've recently adopted a cat, so not only was there cat hair, but also dirt and dust (pretty gross). I'm hoping it'll hold up!",

No complaints whatsoever - and i live in the desert, in a dust bowl, so these little guys get lots of action! I use them every single day. I had the Dyson cordless but didn\u2019t feel it was any better and i disliked having to constantly hold the button, and the price, so it went back and the Hoover stayed! I do have two big Dyson\u2019s for carpet and deeper cleanings though.",
