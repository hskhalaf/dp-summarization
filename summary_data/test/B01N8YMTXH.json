      "text": "Love these as I have a long standing ankle problem. Substantial upper and soles, good padding around the ankles. I use them for trail running in the Pennines, occasional damp feet which I think is water getting in the top around the ankle. Fantastic grip on most surfaces except on wet leaves when nothing but spikes would do! I'm size 10 and they are a little bit narrower than the running shoe equivalent as others have remarked but length wise they are fine. The sole is lasting better that my previous roclite282 GTX. Overall I think they are a great all round product and I will be buying these again in 2018.",

Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the Roclite 325 GORE-TEX Trail Running Shoes as Grade 3. GORE-TEX Upper Shoes engineered with GORE-TEX Extended Comfort product technology are designed for indoor and outdoor use in moderate and warmer conditions or during higher activity levels. They are durably waterproof combined with optimised breathability and are the ideal solution for people who value outstanding climate comfort and heat release. The Inov8 Roclite 325 Running Shoes are constructed from a flexible nylon mesh upper with mesh inner lining providing all round breathability and key ventilation, keeping your feet cool and dry through every step.
