I've had it a little over a month. If it does develop a problem any time soon, I know Amazon will stand behind it as they have any other problem I've had in my long and frequent order history. As far as shipping, it came earlier than expected and was packed to withstand bumps and jars in mailing. Very satisfied customer here.",
