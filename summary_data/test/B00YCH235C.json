I had $35 non stick pans which held up better than All Clad. Phone customer service of All Clad is closed. They are claiming this is due to Covid19. Excuse me but you are the only company I encountered which has not been able to adjust their operations within 5 months to this situation. DO NOT BUY.",

We have never exposed these pans to extreme heat or put them in the oven (though the manufacturer says you can) and we always use silicone non-scratching utensils that you have to use with non-stick. But now the coating is COMING OFF the pan and into our food, this is terrible and doesn't seem safe or worth the expensive price tag.",

However, whoever designed and subsequently approved the handles should be fired. They are some of the most uncomfortable handles on any pots and pans I've ever used. I purchased two of the smaller sauce pans so handling them should be no problem. However, if they have this handle design on larger pans picking them up maybe difficult and uncomfortable",
