They are perfect for the terrain they are made for. The build quality is superb and I have had no water penetrate the Gore-Tex. My only complaint is the sizing. The toe box is abnormally narrow. After reading plenty of reviews about the narrow sizing, I preemptively ordered extra wides which were still uncomfortably narrow.",

Generally this hiking boots makes small so if you wanna wear comfortably you should buy more 1inch or 1.5inch up size one.",

      "text": "I have had at least 11 pairs of various Danner shoes/boots (that I can think of), some made in USA and others not. I love most of them. These however, weren't quite the quality I expect from Danner USA boots. The toe box is quite large and the tongue is so thick and wide that it's difficult to lace through the hook eyelets. Basically the tongue doesn't fit very well into the shaft so I have to squish it down to where it's somewhat uncomfortable just to lace it. On a good note, the construction and material are solid. Hopefully the tongue problem gets better over time. I definitely recommend Danner overall, but these not so much.",
