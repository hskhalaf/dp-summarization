Only downside, having had to wear an AFO (ankle/ foot, orthopedic [sic] brace) for several months the two part sole, gum bottom/ and white rubber wrap around up the sides have separated, where the pair I had purchased prior that has a one piece version are doing fine. That said I bought 2 pairs of the canvas (one pair, victim to an act of dog) gum soles, and that the shorter wear life did not change my mind on buying them again in a blue faux suade.",
