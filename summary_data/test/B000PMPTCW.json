Jackpot!! In 2 days I have stretched 2 pairs of sandals to desired width. I tried to use the liquid stretcher alone in 2 occasions and it did not stretch the shoes. So, I don't regret by the FooFitter 2-way shoe stretcher. Good investment.",

There are instructions online, but it's easy enough to figure out how this works.

I had to leave it in for several days, twisting the knob a bit further each day to increase the stretch.",

The shape is unilateral which means it's not specific to right or left and given its pointy toe shape, it widens the entire forefoot rather than the one place I needed it- the big toe area which I cannot affect with this stretcher. The other thing to note is that it's better at stretching width than length and hard to control width vs length since it happens simultaneously.",

However, within four months, the threads on both of the stretchers wore off, meaning they wouldn't work, and couldn't be fixed. FootFitter sent me one replacement (and told me this was an exception to their policy that, if you buy on amazon, you only have 30 days to return/replace) , and that replacement has broken now too (same problem with the worn threads). So, I'm basically tossing $80 worth of shoe stretchers. Maybe this was a bad batch, but considering all three stretchers broke (wore out) in the same way within three months, I'd be very wary of purchasing these right now.",

This is all heavy metal and I can't imagine it breaking. It really is a quality product I would expect to last a lifetime. So did it stretch out the climbing shoes? You bet! But they are rubber and basically went right back to their original size. Now my wife uses it to stretch out her sandals, etc. Very happy with the purchase even though my climbing shoes still work.",
