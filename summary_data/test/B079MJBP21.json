Then another buyer complaining that they have \"changed nothing\". They didn't need to. They made the needle nose pliers have the teeth further apart making grip more agressive, and the wire cutters are now replaceable. Otherwise it's a solid multitool from Leatherman that will be used by me for years and years to come. Buy one, keep it in the car or your desk or your toolbox. Thank Leatherman later for all the times it comes in handy.",

After losing my last knife to TSA, I went without for a good bit because I didn't want to just throw money out the window. I stumbled across this knife one night, and I am glad I did. I've owned leatherman knives before, but this one is by far my favorite. It's heavy duty enough to get the job done, but not so big that it can't fit in your pocket (although it doe take a little getting used to).",

The black coating does come off onto your fingers for about the first 5 days of handling the tool (not much comes off on your fingers) but after that it stops completely. Excellent quality and I'm expecting it to last for many years to come. This'll definitely be in my pocket every day of the week :)",
