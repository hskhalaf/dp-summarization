Maybe from the silicone it is cooked in. Contacted them again but no response to this issue. Total waste of money I would not recommend this product at all. Gross!! Peel your eggs!",

I'm so glad I got this one with 6 cups and a holder so they won't turn over while boiling. When I am putting egg in cup, I put the holder over a round cake pan & that helps while I am filling them...

You definitely need to oil/butter the interior or your eggs will stick to the inside. They will fly around your dishwasher. You cannot stand them up in a pot boiling water -- they fall over. So, even if you're using one, use the holder. The taste is not horrible, but it is off. I am assume there are chemicals leeching into the egg. I also wind up with fluid on the top, looks like that yucky white stuff from when you fry them. Could stand improvement.",

You can't tell if they're undercooked or overcooked or just right. If you leave them in the microwaved for one whole minute expect either the cap explodes in your face or the yolk.
