I would definitely not recommend these skates. I feel like I flushed $80 down the drain. Hopefully the company will help me out. Have a nice day.",

I have a very narrow foot though so if you have a wider foot I would go with your regular shoe size in these. Those of you that said these run 2 sizes small are not correct. The reason your child who wears size 3 shoe would need a 5 in these is because womens size 5 is a kids size 3! These are womens sizes not kids so you have to convert the kids size to womens. A great skate for a casual skater.",

The size 2 fits perfect around the ankle and has about 1.5 cm of extra toe space. She couldn't even get her foot into the size 13's due to the narrow ankle area.",
