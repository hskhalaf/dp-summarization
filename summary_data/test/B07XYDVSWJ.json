The CrossFit Grace was praised not only for being very comfortable, but also because it was an overall great training shoe for dynamic movements, squats, and weightlifting.

The fabric did not seem like fabric at all; was rather papery feeling instead of a nice mesh of many athletic shoes available. I can't imagine them wearing well at all. Value way below cost!",
