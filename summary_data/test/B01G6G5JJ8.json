I wish it held more palettes because I'm not sure what to do with that thin drawer. I know you can buy additional pieces to add on, but my vanity already looks clunky with it. It's simple and good for beginners but you can tell how cheap it is. It makes the most horrible plastic screeching sound on some of the drawers.
