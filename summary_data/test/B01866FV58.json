Today I installed about 12 more bungees and what a difference! When using this for baseball, you'll want to install most, if not all, of the bungees. For my purposes (an 11 y/o son), I installed twice as many bungees on the top half and 3 additional on the bottom (cross) bar. I may install the remaining bungees on the bottom section, but it's really not necessary, my son uses the bottom section for grounder drills. Beyond that, this seems to be really excellent quality, compared to two other cheap rebounders we had before.",

The directions were not clear at all, however, if you ignored them and followed the markings on the pieces, it went together fairly easily. It is one of the more expensive rebounders, however, it is also quite a bit larger, and the net seems to be quite strong for now. We'll have to wait for summer to end to know more!",

      "text": "We like this product. Very sturdy and solid quality. All materials have a high-end feel - sturdy steel poles, galvanized nuts/bolts/washers, well-braided net. My wife and I assembled it in 30 minutes. Installation tip - look up assembly videos online (search youtube for \"Rukket baseball net\"). It really helps visualize it. We had it for a week so far, and it works very well. My general feeling is it will last a long time and not require much care.",
