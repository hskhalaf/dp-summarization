It's a good weight for a small job like that, easy to swing, but powerful enough to drive a small U-bolt into the ground quickly. I like the feel of it in my hand too. One small complaint: a small piece of black rubber came off about the 2nd time I used it, leaving a small scratch in the mallet. It still works just as well, but I was surprised it got cut so quickly.",

I even managed to even out the bottom of a huge second-hand aluminum kitchen kettle that was bulging so much it wouldn't sit flat on the stovetop. Now it sits flat on the stovetop just fine. I always trust tools made by Stanley. They are always well-made and stand the test of time.",
