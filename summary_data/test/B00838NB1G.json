      "text": "It works perfectly as described. It feels solid and locks well. The wheels actually turn really smooth and nice. I'm not sure why other people complain about it turning hard, maybe I am just lucky. It didn't come with instructions but the default code is 000 and then you turn the lock counter clockwise then you can pull the lock off your trigger. To change your combination, you have to unlock it, then on the right side of the lock module, there is a little pin hole. Stick something in there and then change your code to what you desire. Then release the pin. Your code will now be set.",

These trigger locks are a lot better than the cable locks and easier to take off if you need to quickly. It also complies with the law for locking up your guns from your children. I've tested it and it won't come off unless you have the combination. The other lock that this manufacturer makes is the key trigger lock and I also have that lock and it works great. I highly recommend this type of lock to people who own pistols.",
