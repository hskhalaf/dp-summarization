Two tiers, 4 legs pop open like magic, close middle support, now you\u2019re ready to work! 1000 pound capacity!!! All done? Fold middle support, grab lower shelf, lift, and everything retracts back to original position. I suffer, like many, with not much space to do a zillion jobs. These jobs, using this awesome, compact, surprisingly strong and mostly super compact work bench make everything so much better!",

One minor complaint - the legs come out a little while the table is collapsed, (when legs are tilted down). Not a problem for me, but maybe for others.",
