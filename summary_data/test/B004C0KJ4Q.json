Now, I'm returning it beings I've owned it for less than a week. I purchased two of them, also. Now I have zero confidence in the other chair. Just waiting for that one to give way, too...",

However, the metal screw holding the arm rest fabric into the metal somehow became loose and allowed the fabric to shift enough that the metal started to poke through rendering the right arm rest all but useless for fear of it completely tearing through. Pictures are posted for your own viewing. Other than that it sits as a chair quite comfortably despite the awkward headrest. There are also a few spots along the sewing that look like they are about to give as well.",

The headrest does make sitting uncomfortable so I just flip it over/take it off and all is well. I do think you have to be on the tall side to appreciate this chair as my wife finds it uncomfortable.

It sits very similarly to an adirondack chair - which is nice - if that was what I was buying it for. I bought it to watch my kids' outdoor games and this chair is not conducive to watching ball games. Again, great chair, but not what I was trying to buy it for. I will save it for sitting around the fire pit or napping between games. :-)",

This is not, but it's angled at one. No problem though, I will just sink it into the ground because it's very comfortable. We bought 3. One pink, one blue, and one yellow. We go to the beach soon so we'll see how they hold up, I have some confidence.",

For extra comfort I bring a little stool to elevate my feet. I like a chair that will support my head when I lean back but is still low enough that people behind me can see. A pleasant surprise was the chair is light enough for me to carry easily. Love that the carrying case is large enough that the chair slips in easily.",
