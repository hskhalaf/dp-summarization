Both Gerber and BG I thought were strong names, plus there was some sentiment for a BG knife he owned in the past. Unfortunately, it did not last the week. The piece on the sheath that says \"Gerber\" broke off and the fire-starter fell out and got lost somewhere on the trail as we were hiking. Very disappointed. I was going to have this engraved with some details of our hike. Glad now that I couldn't find the time to do it before the hike. I hope I can return.",

Here is my very limited review of this knife. Cons- Made in China. Doesn't have a full tang all the way through the handle. Fire starter installs upside down in the sheath, so it can fall out and you will never notice. Stupid marketing. Pros - blade was sharp, feels great in the hand, seems very tough and durable. Knife feels substantial in the hand, like it will be there when you need it. In conclusion, I have no doubt that this knife will serve you well and have a long life.",

Easy to resharpen, comes with survival tips that neatly fold into knife holster. Durability- I left it outside in the yard for 4 days, I live in beach town, and it did not rust. I've had it 3 years used it for everything from cutting cans to pork shoulders, tomatoes and still great. Cons None Note- It is nice and heavy, you can tell it is a good quality knife.

The not so good: Not a big fan of the serrated edge, makes sharpening extremely difficult, and the survival manual is instructive but unfortunately there is no pouch for the guide so it would get lose rather easily.",

      "text": "I bought this knife when it was on sale and much cheaper on Amazon than anything I've seen in stores like Walmart or Dicks Sporting Goods. The knife is high quality and sharp right out of the package! It comes with a Velcro sheath, a sharpener, a whistle, a flint stick, a hardened grip hammer end, and a survival guide with no where to put it on the knife set. Two holes on each side of the blade look to be for securing the knife to a stick for use as a spear. Nice quality survival knife and a must for camping trips or a Zombie apocalypse.",

On Black Friday, I was at Wal-Mart and found it for \"only\" $46, so I grabbed it. A week later, I happened to check here on Amazon and found it for $26 - the same exact knife being sold for $46 and $70+ elsewhere. Purchased it here, returned the other to Wally World, and my son was extremely happy on Christmas morning.",

      "text": "Pretty much every feature broke after one use. Shows poor quality and zero durability. Refund pending. Brought this along on a 3d backpacking trip and used it on the 2nd night to make a fire and generally test out this seemingly useful tool. 1. The retaining clip that holds the knife in the plastic sheath broke pretty much immediately from simple in and out use. 2. The serrated/saw teeth while effective showed heavy wear after simple sawing of soft woods. Looks as if I sawed concrete. 3. The knife rusted in a number of spots despite thorough cleaning and drying after use. 4. Tip of knife bent. 5. Fire starter works very well.",

Apparently this particular problem has been remedied. Love the diamond sharpener and fire starter. Highly recommended.",

    "title": "Gerber Bear Grylls Ultimate Knife, Serrated Edge [31-000751]",
    "description": "AMAZON.COM\n\n\nFrom Gerber, the 31-000751 Bear Grylls Survival Series Ultimate Knife is designed to help you endure in the toughest environments. It features an ergonomic grip for comfortable handling and a dependable stainless steel blade with a versatile serrated edge. Additionally, the knife and military-grade nylon sheath are packed with innovative survival tools, including a fire starter, a diamond blade sharpener, an emergency whistle, and a pommel.\n\nThis survival knife includes an emergency whistle, pommel, and sheath with fire starter and blade sharpener (view larger). SHARP, DURABLE BLADE HANDLES TOUGH SURVIVAL TASKS\nBuilt to offer the versatility that adventurers, backpackers, and hunters need in the wilderness, the Ultimate Knife features a versatile 4.75-inch drop-point blade. This blade is half serrated to make quick work of cutting rope and other fibrous materials. It features full-tang construction for overall durability, and it is crafted from hard stainless steel, which allows for excellent edge retention.\n\nINNOVATIVE, ERGONOMIC DESIGN DELIVERS VERSATILITY\nSurvival tools are only useful if they're easy to handle, so this knife features a comfortable, rubberized grip that's textured to prevent slippage. And because being a true survivor means making innovative use of your tools, the knife's handle features two holes for securely lashing it to a stick for use as a fishing spear--or whatever other bladed tool your situation calls for.\n\nThe included \"Priority of Survival\" pocket guide by Bear Grylls includes experience-based survival advice and instruction (view larger).

The sheath also has a life-saving fire starter rod locked into a water-tight holder. This ferrocerium rod produces a shower of hot sparks when scraped against the rough surface of the striker notch that is incorporated into the back of the knife blade. For further versatility and functionality, the sheath includes a waterproof \"Priority of Survival\" guide tucked into a protective pocket on the back of the sheath.\n\nThe nylon sheath is crafted from lightweight, military-grade materials that are mildew resistant for long-term use in harsh climates.
