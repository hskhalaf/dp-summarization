In the attached photo I have used a standard can of peas to show how big it is: note that the upright can is actually too tall to fit completely inside the crock pot. I think this size would only be big enough for a single-person household, if using it for actual slow-cooker meals. However, it is pretty convenient for keeping queso and other hot dips warm, and for taking a small side dish to a party (it comes with a rubber band to keep the lid closed during transport).",

      "text": "Had a ton of slow cookers- this one is fantastic. My biggest issue with more 'prestige' brands is overheating and making the meat jerky-like in texture by the time you're ready to eat. I love how it makes everything tender and, dare I say, moist, even if you're an hour or two late home from a busy day. I actually took this thing out of state to make short ribs for my Grandma because the results are so awesome and I wanted to show her. Cheap, awesome, better than big brands- so don't hesitate- this came to my house completely without any cracks or shipping damage- go for it!",

The pot is small enough to manage in the sink easily for cleaning, and the surface has not taken any stains. It does not take up a lot of storage space. It works well, is easy to maintain, and fits my needs. I am very happy with this slow cooker. E.M. Van Court",
