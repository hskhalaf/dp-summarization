It only moves around if you jerk the handle when releasing the pitch. Pull smoothly and no problems. Pitching machines of this accuracy usually cost way more and you have to find an outlet with a multiple extension chords. What a hassle. This requires no electricity and is decently priced. It took about 10 minutes to put it together. You need a 9/16 wrench, a crescent wrench, and a large flat-head screwdriver.",

It is used 4 days/week for practice, is easy to maneuver, and can be put in the trunk of a car, back of a station wagon, SUV, etc. This is a must have for young ball players (and Dad's alike who get sore arms!)to practice.

I found it to be challenging to get it at the right height and speed for the kids without a fair amount of time spent tweaking the micro adjustments. The micro adjustments are made with a butterfly nut which also increases the amount of time it takes to test it out. I would recommend that Louisville look into some sort of quick micro adjustment setup that allows for easier tweaking and on the fly changes. Aside from the micro adjustments once you get it dialed in it is pretty effective and the kids really enjoyed hitting off of it.",

Easy to assemble but the directions on using it are virtually non existent. Does not throw very consistent unless the ball is placed on the arm just right. You need to have the seams of the ball in contact with the rubber ribbing running along the throwing arm. Practice with it for a while until you get it right before you use in practice. Having inconsistent pitches for young players gets frustrating for the players (and coaches). Overall good product and works well.",

Simply center it for throwing over the pa\u0302te\u0301, and you strike after strike in slightly different areas of the strike zone. The other part I really like is in setting the machine stepping back and pulling the release you simulate the timing of a real pitch. Lastly, this device pitches at an appropriate height for little leaguers. No more throwing the ball like darts from the one knee position. Highly recommended.",
