The large size is ideal for more than one child to play at the same time. It's so big that my four-year-old stands on a stool to reach the top floor! It's a great value, pretty to look at and includes so many nice details and furnishings. Definitely recommend it. It takes some time to put together, but it will last for many years.

Further, the \"floors\" do not hold up well and started to bend/warp almost immediately. The third floor by the elevator cannot hold any of the furniture because it bends down due to lack of a support due to the elevator. KidKraft will send replacement parts but the thing is already put together and will take substantial work to disassemble and reassemble, and even then, I suspect the same problem will arise. My kid will still play with it but for the poor quality relative to the cost along with the terrible instructions, buyer beware.",

I kind of expected more wooden solid pieces than thin walls and floors. Comes with a lot of furniture but no dolls. Overall I probably wouldn't spend this much money again over this dollhouse.

Power tools (drill) aren\u2019t required, but they are highly recommended! The directions aren\u2019t entirely clear. I\u2019ve put IKEA furniture together that was simpler than this.

Elevator sticks and doesn't go to first floor - which is weird. But my daughter and all her guests loved this house.",

      "text": "HUGE dollhouse for the price! Sturdy, and should hopefully last a couple years before the kids destroy it (because why take care of anything nice). Cons: Assembly instructions make Ikea instructions seem easy to follow. Mine was missing the chandelier ceiling mount bracket and the handles for the garage door ... Not the end of the world since I can swing by Lowe's and get suitable replacement pieces, but I obviously would have preferred to get all the expected hardware in the box.",

There is one vertically standing piece on the third floor that is not super secure, but other than that, this house is amazing. More detailed directions would be awesome and a different type of vertically standing piece would make it great.",
