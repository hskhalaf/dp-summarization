All in all, it can be used for email and some Facebook. For $169 I'm not sure what to expect, but an old laptop upgraded to 8Gb of RAM with the anniversary edition of Windows 10 does a lot more. I do however, look forward to seeing where Kangaroo goes in the future. I like the concept, but the reality of it just isn't there yet.",

As for the hardware, it's decent but the 2GB ram is a limitation. The 2.5\" hard drive bay in the dock is only powered when you're plugged in, so you can't use it if you are on battery power. Also there is no support for Legacy OS installs so if you're playing around with Linux or ChromeOS, pick the UEFI version or you won't be able to boot up.",
