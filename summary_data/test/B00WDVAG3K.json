My solution was to cut the loop end off the line and run a Gibbon ratchet on that side. On setup I tension both the SI and Gibbon ratchets but I always release on the Gibbon ratchet because it doesn't seem to cause any damage. With this setup we are having a good time. I think the kit needs work.",

It is long and easy to install, so its actually really easy to find a pair of trees to hand it from.",

Select a moderate sized tree for the short end (about two feet diameter). Any bigger & 1) you won't be able to get the line around it & 2) you won't be able to taco fold. I was fortunate enough to run into someone that had been doing this for several years. Basic advice is concentrate on just standing still before you try walking. Also, consider this as a form of exercise (including yoga) & learn \"poses\" to build balance.",

Didn't think about how long it was when I bought it, but it is slightly difficult and a little more time to set up because of the sheer length of the line. Other than that, it is a wonderful and high quality slackline. If you are going to be putting this line up where you need a long length, even better! It still works with short distances.",

Everything in the kit works as intended, and I am very happy with my purchase. The 85 foot line is very long, which was what I was wanting, but for most people I would recommend the 50 foot line.",

Much longer webbing than I needed today, my first time using it, which is perfect as I hope to be using more and more as I improve. Comfortable webbing on my bare feet. Very attractive, high quality materials (it seems, so far. again, 1 day of use). Ratchet was very easy to use for setup, and releasing for take down. My experience was of a good quality, reliable product. I'm very pleased!",
