I mixed it with Benjamin Moore flat paint to complete the project in the picture. I had lots of paint left over from my 1 cup after completing this small cabinet. Excellent coverage in one coat and the finish is hard. I also applied Dover's clear wax as a finish. It's wonderful to have an alternative like Dover's - I love being able to pick out any color. Both products have clear instructions right on the container.",

It does EVERYTHING they say it will do. it is durable, covers beautifully and opens up an affordable way to redecorate. just wash your pieces with a 50/50 solution of white vinegar and water and off you go. I have used satin paint with it as I have many samples from Sherwin Williams and have had no problems with it. The coverage is much better than the expensive brands and I find it easier to use. it does take a bit longer to dry, but it is worth the wait. Try it, you'll like it.",

In total my project only took a few hours and the paint dried very fast. I was able to cover small blemishes on the furniture with ease and only a few coats of paint. Will be purchasing again once I run out (which will be a while as this mix goes a long way)! 100% would recommend. I do not have a before photo but it turned out great!",

I didn't measure anything out since I didn't want to ruin my teaspoons with paint. So I just kinda eyeballed it. Super fun. There is pretty much no way you can mess up. I really love the look.",
