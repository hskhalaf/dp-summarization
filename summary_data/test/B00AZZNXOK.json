      "text": "Great Headphones! So Why did I return them? I own Bose and Klipsch headphones (along with another 5-6 crappy ones) at the moment, and the sound quality of these is on par with the Klipsch (way better than Bose, beats, and anything else in a big box store.) Sound clarity and balance are both great. The only small issue is that they are tight, and my head isn't even that big. The reason to return these, however is not because I wasn't happy with them; but it was because I liked them so much, I'll spend an extra 300 and buy the Momentum 2 headphones which are also wireless. I wouldn't have considered spending 500 on headphones otherwise...",

Think of them as a more posh version of an on-the-ear headphone. Fairly accurate sound with some warmth in the midrange, though if you are using them for portable devices or phones you may find them to lack some needed warmth and the lower end of the spectrum depending on the type of music you listen to. Soundstage is 'Meh'. Coming from Thinksounds as my all-day work headphones, these are a pricey disappointment. Look elsewhere for value.",

They're not overly bass-ey like that other \"B\" brand are; so the highs are crisp and clean, and the bass is strong, but not overwhelmingly so.

The cups are a little undersized for circumaurals, which does cause some soreness in my (average-sized) earlobes after extended listening.

I loved the sound they produced, how stylish they were, and how well packaged it all was, but the ear opening wasn't designed for people with larger ears. Had these on during a 6hr flight. Did a fairly good job of filtering the outside noise, all notes were head, but they became uncomfortable. I woke up a few hours into the flight to realize my ears were in pain from the headphones clamping down hard enough against my ears (larger opening would prevent this) while wearing my glasses. I took off my glasses, put the headphones back on, and still the same issue.",

However, 2 small things: the case is giant (I know it's not meant to be a portable or foldable headphone, but still) and the ear pads are quite small. While they fit over my friend's ears just fine - it's a close fit. If he had bigger ears... it'll probably squish them.",

The only con is that the pads are a bit small for me and need to be well adjust on my ears every time I put them on, this problem is fixed with the Momentum 2.0 but at time of buying costed twice more and in my opinion don't worth the extra investment mostly because the 1.0 version is still great.",
