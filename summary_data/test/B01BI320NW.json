Yes, it fits snug, but I think it is supposed too. If you are un decided, go ahead and buy it. You WON'T be sorry.",

After recovering, I started using them for all my sports activities and I can feel, I'm well supported. Sudden twists or changes of direction while sprinting do not affect my knee as before. I thought they would cause issues to move while running but that is not the case. I know this is probably not the regular way other users have been using it.
