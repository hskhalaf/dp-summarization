It took some looking around, but of course, amazon had them. SO worth it. Some of my work uses the old gear, the old apps, and just feels better using the (vintage?) gear. These were new in their original packaging that wasn't yellowed or in lousy storage or smelled like a pawn shop, etc. They shipped in padded envelopes lined with very heavy cardstock and bubble wrap added for protection. They work flawlessly. Plug and play as top shelf brand gear should.",

The Netgear adapter installation went smoothly and had things running again quickly. This product installs easily as you wish all computer widgets would do. Highly recommended. Note: This old Dell laptop mostly collects dust. But it contains a licensed Audi service manual I need from time-to-time. In addition, this Dell has a high definition display and is built like a \"tank.\" And I can't toss away something that once cost thousands of dollars <g>.",

Most laptops built after 2006 or so will (if they have any slot at all) have an Express Card slot. So this didn't fit my laptop, but that's my fault for not realizing the standard changed 10 years ago. I have no doubt this card would work well if it fit.",

    "description": "RangeMax NEXT extends the possibilities of your wireless home network by providing a Steady-Stream of up to 270 Mbps, and is compliant with draft 802.11n. This next generation wireless standard utilizes advanced MIMO (Multi-In, Multi-Out) technology, which delivers incredible speed and range, and for the first time provides wireless interoperability at the highest speeds with other products with Intensi-fi. A RangeMax NEXT wireless network creates and maintains stable connection and enough bandwidth to surf the Internet, download MP3s, make Internet phone calls, share files, play network games, and stream high-definition videos, simultaneously at any distance or location in the home or office. Because RangeMax NEXT is compatible with all legacy b and g wireless products, you are sure to be connected. Preset internal antennas and 11n True -Test high-performance testing and tuning, provides maximum performance and high-quality streaming every time. Touchless WiFi Security makes creating the highest level of network security easy and includes WEP, WPA-PSK, or WPA2-PSK. Setup is simple thanks to NETGEAR\u2019s Smart Wizard\u2122 and 24/7 technical support.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe NETGEAR WN511B RangeMax Next Wireless-N Notebook Adapter makes it easy for you to provide blazing-speed wireless internet access to your notebook computer, letting you surf the web, check email, stream music, make internet phone calls, and get a leg up on opponents when playing online games. \n\n \n\nEasy Setup\nThe WN511B is a PC Card and requires a Pentium 3 class PC with an available PC Card slot for installation. It supports Windows Vista and is also compatible with Windows XP and 2000 SP4. Setup is as simple as inserting the card into the slot and installing the included software. A built-in stub antenna helps you receive a strong signal for the fastest possible speeds.  Fast, Backwards Compatible, and Secure\nThe NETGEAR WN511B uses the Wireless-N protocol (based on 802.11n draft) for speeds up to 270 Mbps and a range ten times that of 802.11g adapters. With this much speed and bandwidth, you can easily download large files, place Internet phone calls, download MP3s, stream video, and play online games -- all at the same time, without hiccups, and from farther away. You'll notice the difference immediately. \n\n The WN511B is backwards compatible with 802.11g and 802.11b wireless networks so you'll be able to connect to any hotspot, and it improves network performance up to 50 percent when used with the older 802.11b/g networks. \n\n You can feel secure about your information as the adapter supports Wi-Fi protected access (WPA2-PSK, WPA-PSK) and 64-bit and 128-bit WEP encryption for IEEE 082.11b and IEEE 802.11g. The included software makes managing different WEP passwords a breeze as you can set up different profiles for each location you frequent, saving yourself the trouble of having to type in encryption keys each time you connect to a hotspot you've already used. \n\n The NETGEAR WN511B RangeMax Next Wireless-N Notebook Adapter is backed by a 1-year warranty. \n\n What's in the Box\nWN511B RangeMax Next Wireless-N Notebook Adapter, setup CD, warranty/support information card. \n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWhat is RangeMax NEXT? \n\n RangeMax NEXT with Steady-Stream technology complies with draft 802.11n\u2021 and delivers up to 270 Mbps. This next generation draft standard and Steady-Stream technology enable stable connections at greater range for all your applications, all over the home, all at once\u2020. You can simultaneously share files, download MP3s, make Internet phone calls, play network games, and stream high-definition videos. RangeMax NEXT products interoperate at up to 270 Mbps speeds with other wireless products powered with InteNsi-fi technology, plus they are compatible with all legacy b and g wireless products. Advanced design and draft 11n-True-Test high-performance testing and tuning ensure maximum draft-11n performance every time. Setup is easy thanks to NETGEAR\u2019s Smart Wizard and 24/7 technical support. Touchless WiFi Security simplifies establishing the highest level of wireless network security with WEP, WPA-PSK, or WPA2-PSK. \n\n Compare the Advantages of the NEXT Generation in Wireless Connectivity \n\n First, there was RangeMax, which improved on the wireless g standard\u2019s limitations in speed and coverage. Now, NETGEAR offers RangeMax NEXT, which gives consumers a new level of capabilities and transfer speeds, including the ability to play online games, use VoIP, download large files, and stream HD video\u2014all simultaneously and with consistent speeds. \n\n\n\n\n\nSee more",
