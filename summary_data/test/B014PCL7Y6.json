Submerged about 12 times before LED's started going out. * I've only had them submerged at the ramp about 5 times since installing but so far so good. My main concern switching to LED's was if the brightness from the standard running mode to brake/turn would be significant. I've seen some cars with LED tails and the parking lights are either really dim or the brakes/turns are barely brighter than the running lights. These are about perfect to me. Similar change in brightness that you would see from an incandescent. I'll post a video to show them in action.",

The studs need to about a quarter inch longer to more easily attach the light with a license plate bracket and get the washers and nuts on. Also, since the wires come directly out of the back instead of the side, I had to drill holes in the trailer to feed the wires through so they didn't pinch. A lot more work than should be necessary. And, of course the ground wire must be attached to a stud ideally with a ring terminal.",

      "text": "These are nice lights, but one thing you need to know about the installation. The wires come out of the back dead center between the mounting bolts. This means you need to drill a 3/8 to 1/2 hole between the mounting holes on your trailer bracket to insure a flush mount and no pinching of the wires. I drilled a 3/8 hole and found that the sealant around the wires did not fit through the hole so I put two fender washers on each bolt to insure a tight mount without damaging the wires. They look great and look forward to lighting them up. Suggestion to manufacturer: Change the location of the wires to minimize problems in mounting",

On most of the higher end lights the wiring comes out of the side or has tracks in the housing for the wires to fit so they can be flush mounted.

      "text": "Everything works but the instructions are pretty sketchy. But, no wire nuts were included! Also, the wires should be a slightly thicker and stronger gauge, as stripping the wires for more exposure can cause several of the wire threads to come off as well. It would be helpful if a license plate brake was included for the left light assembly. Time will tell if these lights are truly waterproof.",

One design flaw is that the wiring comes out of the back of the unit directly between the 2 bolt/lugs which are used to secure it to the bracket. These wires then interfere with the unit resting flush on the bracket. I rigged up some spacers to make some room for the wiring. Otherwise, seems like a good product so far. The lights are very bright.",

However, in my case, wiring connection is in front of mounting plate on same side as light, so light wires would have to go back and forth through the mounting plate. Also, the light mounting studs are not grounded so you must separately ground each light to the frame. To do this right, you must buy and install crimp connections for each light ground wire. Overall, not as easy to install as it should be.",

I would ask that they update their description to note this, because this is very important and standard 1/4\" nuts almost seem to work...but you will destroy the threads... They look promising, but I haven't installed them yet because of the \"nut\" issue.",
