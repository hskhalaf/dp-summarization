      "text": "When I decided to start running after years of not running, I downloaded the C25K App and did the first two days wearing cross trainers. Big mistake. Too heavy & too stiff. So I ordered these shoes and I'm really enjoying them. They're light and the soles are soft with a nice spring. I will say that the tongue of each shoe had an annoying wrinkle that probably developed in packaging. A bit of care smoothing the wrinkles out when putting them on took care of that and the wrinkles have disappeared. If/when these shoes wear out, would I but then again? Yes, I would.",

The all mesh fabric design may wear out quicker than traditional leather sneakers. 3 months and I can see slight fraying where my big toe is. (update: the pinky toe wore through quicker) UPDATE: down to 3 stars... The tongue design on the shoe is a pain! It curls on the sides when you put them on. Many times I've taken a flat edge (think butter knife, chop-stick) after the shoe is on just to flat the tongue out against my foot. On that note I wouldn't buy them again, unless super cheap.",
