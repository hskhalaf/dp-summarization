With string I spent more time messing with the string than it would take me to do all of my edging with this scissor tool. With the plastic blade one I tried, a lot of the grass was bent over by the tool, but not actually cut. This tool has remained sharp enough to cut. I did have to use fine metal sand paper after allowing the blades to rust, but that restored it to good working condition.",

I do recommend wearing gloves when using these because the skin on my fingers started to be sore from friction after using them a while. Now I wear gloves and my skin doesn't bother me anymore.

I recommend locking the blades closed when walking between cutting sites to avoid accidental injury. Remember that these are grass shears. Briars and woody plants are not ideal.

So, for edging I thought I would stick with the noiseless manual solution and try this 36-in shears. Silly me. While I can get an *ok* job, it is too slow for this purpose. It will do around a flower bed easily, but using it as an edger is not its purpose. They do cut well and they are lightweight. SO, if you are using a weedeater to edge your lawn, I don't see the need for these shears.",

The opening for the scissor blades is not as wide as most scissors, which makes it difficult to cut the grass along the edge of the lawn. You end up making lots of small cuts to achieve the same thing you could using an electric/gas/battery powered edger. It's difficult to maneuver and more often than not, I end up pulling out the grass instead of cutting it. I was hoping to use this instead of my regular edger, but it's less of a hassle to use my battery operated edger.",
