Of the many that I have bought, they were cumbersome, slow, cheap and simply no good. Surprised! 1st, I stream, surprised how well it streams! 2. Touch screen, great! Many tablets are too sensitive or not sensitive. 3. Picture, Great! 4. Sound, surprised. Very good! Much better than the iPad. Also I stream sports, it too was excellent. The NHL game was clear with no buffering. The price at $118 was very surprising, a quality unit at that price? A great value with excellent quality!",

This lenovo is quite heavy, the goofy thick round side-handle design is just awkward. The real failure is battery life, which with wifi on and no apps running is maybe a day, maybe. This thing probably looked great in some design review and as a sales pitch, but for actual usability, or a device I can throw in my backpack and not worry about the delicate thing shattering, or just being charged for use when I need it, it's a total loss.
