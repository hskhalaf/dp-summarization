The buttons on the pen and on the tablet work. The pressure sensitivity works when affecting the brush stroke OpenBoard, but didn't affect the brush stroke in Pinta or Gimp.

I'm a traditionally trained artist, so getting used to drawing with the tablet was a slight adjustment, but after an hour or two of fiddling around, I got pretty comfortable with it. This tablet was super easy to set up. Like, crazy easy. And I like how easy it is to use. Again, it's crazy easy after the initial adjustment. Plus, It has a nice range of sensitivity. If you're a beginner or just getting started with digital art, this is a great way to go!",

I think that including a ball point roller instead of a stationary plastic tip would be more beneficial. The reason for this is that after intense use or pressing down, the friction causes the tip to degrade over time, causing me to replace it. A minor issue but would be more convenient if the tip were never replaced if it rolled.",
