However, they are super clunky and somewhat heavy. The sole/tread is much wider than a regular shoe. Not sure how comfortable they are for running and playing, but for occasional winter wear, I think they are fine. In the picture, the Keen Kootenay boot in size 10 is on the left and the Keen Peek a Shoe in size 9 is on the right. They fit my son about the same.",
