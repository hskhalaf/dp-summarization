I like the size of them in my ears and am happy to find some I like in white. All I've found have been black.

They are so small and comfortable and don't stick out of your ears at all. The touch controls work, and the case (while a little cheap feeling) is small enough to not be a pain to cart around in your pocket. They pair up almost immediately, and you can use either earpiece alone. I bought a pair for my wife and have sold several friends on them. Never had an issue with the battery. The microphone, however, is not good.",

Calls are also crystal clear as i can hear person even even in public commute and person on opposite side can hear me clearly as well.

Second, losing connection with the phone or not synching with each other and having to resync them every so often. Also the instructions for resyncing was not clear in the manual had to find a video to be able to do so.",

I thought it was something wrong with the charging pins not connecting but that might not have been the issue. I wanted to troubleshoot the issue before I contacted Amazon for a replacement. Luckily there's a troubleshooting guide in the item description that actually worked! I gave this product four stars instead of five since I don't know what actually caused that error and can't predict if this will be an ongoing issue.",

They don't light up when you touch them to pause a song or video but I don't think they were meant to lol. The charging pod is super small and nice. They're pretty sweet.",

It does take a little longer for the right one to connect to the charging case than the left one, but it still charges once connected so that's not a big problem. Overall it's an amazing product and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a pair of affordable earbuds!",

Surprisingly good for the price, case is a bit cheap but for the price you can't complain. Sound quality is good. I had some trouble figuring out the connection thing first but I got help from the Amazon assistance people and got it right away turns out that for both to sound at the same time the left ear bud has to connect to the right first. Then the right connects to the phone . At least that's how it worked for me",
