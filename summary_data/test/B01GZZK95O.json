I can't trust this phone to do anything I ask it to therefore I could never recommend to anyone to buy it. I've only had it a month and I hate it too. Gonna get rid as soon as possible.

I was a bit hesitant as some of the (very few!) negative reviews mentioned that there was an issue with \"ghost touch\", i.e. the phone randomly running apps, etc whilst charging. But I have had no issues at all. It is unbelievable value for money and seriously competes with much more expensive phones. It boasts a 16mp rear camera, 5mp front camera, fast processing speed, fast charging speed, good battery life, no bloatware, beautifully clear display, good quality music player, etc. I don't know any other phone that contains all of these features for under \u00a3200.

On the whole, the phone contains many of the more important features needed for a smart phone with the exception of one or two. The only thing that I think it lacks is NFC, which means you cannot use the phone for Android pay when out and about shopping. This is a fairly minor thing IMHO and does not warranty any mark down in scores.",

To say it far exceeds the galaxy in all respects except the screen colour vibrance is true. Now that I am getting used to a marginally less colour brilliance I wouldn't swap the Moto for the galaxy unless I was bribed. Fast, light,clear sound. Responsive and tough. Charges to full very very quickly and lasts plus I can add memory myself. Brilliant camera and only now am i realising how useless the galaxys edge functions were. Very pleased as I need the phone for business not a fashion accessory and the Moto is exactly that. Great buy",

Particularly like the 16mp camera and photos turn out nice and sharp.16gb internal storage is adequate with an option to add an SD card. Fast turbo charge is pretty good and battery life reasonable when turning on the battery saver facility.On the Motorola site it recommends the device is turned off/on again to clear the glitch but it is only a temporary measure. Hopefully a software update may be rolled out at sometime.Would have given 5 stars but taken one off for the ghost screen glitch.",

It can struggle if you have multipul apps running at once, it 'chugs' a bit, but its nothing to frustrating. All in all, I expect my next phone will be the Moto G5 plus :-)",

This happened multiple times a day at random times rendering the phone unreliable and basically useless. Tried phoning amazon support who suggested doing a factory reset which didn't solve the issue.

      "text": "Junk. You're much better off buys a second hand/refurbished Samsung Galaxy S7 which is the same price at the time of writing. After a couple of months of owning the phone randomly started switching off then turning back on the almost no battery life. This intermittent fault continues till now. The camera is very average and slow to load up. The storage capacity sounds a lot but I have yet to be able to save photos onto the SD card so the inbuilt memory quickly fills. And both of the side buttons have fallen off in the last couple of weeks! Don't buy.",
