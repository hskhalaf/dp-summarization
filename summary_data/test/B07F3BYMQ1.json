Also, what other people have called the perfect scratch is nothing but be kind of bristles you would find on a styling brush... A little piece of plastic with a round head. Does not really satisfy. And the fact that the handle fold in half on itself doesn't mean anything. When it folds in half you can't use the scratcher... So who cares if the design is innovative? You're better off with a $2 bamboo back scratcher from a cheap Chinese souvenir shop",
