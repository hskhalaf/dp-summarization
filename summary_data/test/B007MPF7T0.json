It's a great starter-corset if you've never worn a steel-boned corset before. It's a bit smaller than expected (I'm 34\"/24.5\"/36\", and ordered an 18\") but I think it's because of the differential between my chest, waist, and hips that does it. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it, and look forward to wearing it more!",

I vary between a 36C/34D, size 8 waist/hips. It looks like you\u2019d need to be a 40EE to make the top look \u201cright\u201d. I\u2019d return it if I hadn\u2019t worn it around already just trying everything to make it work. Would not recommend unless you\u2019re more top heavy.

Unfortunately the back digs into my back and is quite uncomfortable. I wish they would line the flap of material in the back in silk or satin, SOMEthing to cut down on the rubbing.

Hopefully this will slowly fit by the end of the 2 weeks. The material is sturdy and easy to apply by myself already.",
