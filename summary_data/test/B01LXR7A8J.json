Your feet feel amazing once out of them as if you walked barefoot all day. I have issues with heavier shoes tending to make my ankles hurt and these help sooo much. They do fit alittle big, if you have narrow feet go a half size down.",

Funny thing is, last month we paid $70 at shoe carnival for some Nikes.. which don\u2019t even have enough support and they\u2019re flimsy material. These shoes however are $30, and sturdy, perfect fit, and have plenty of support!! Very worth every penny!",

That is not the shoes fault!! Again--teenage boy. They are extremely lightweight. He thinks they are very comfortable and he is happy with them. If they were cheaper I would buy more. These were purchased because they were a gift of his choice.",

You could see by just looking at the shoes that they were different sizes. I checked the size label on the inside of the right shoe and noticed a size label was placed over the original label. The original label was a size 10 the fake label was an 11. Didn\u2019t appreciate that you were trying to get over on me. Shoes were returned. Not cool!",

      "text": "I was looking for the Appleyard mahalo lyte which I had before but was unable to find them in my size again so I tried these. They fit as expected and are very light. They don\u2019t seem quite as durable as the mahalo but so far they have held up well. The only negative I would say is that there\u2019s not a ton of arch support but it\u2019s certainly better than most skate style shoes. Can\u2019t beat them for the price and they look pretty cool too so 5 stars.",
