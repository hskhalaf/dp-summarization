      "text": "After buying pre-made Steampunk goggles, and seeing how hokey they were, I bought these as a base for making better. I chose well. These are solid, injection molded impact plastic, with cutting-torch grade lens tints (actually usable as really dark sunglasses), the nose bridge is bead-chain covered by a protective plastic tube, rather than a molded plastic chunk. Whether you actually want to work metal, or get your Steampunk on, these are the type of goggles you want. Even if they ARE just for show, the quality difference from cheap molded goggles will show that you really CARE about looking the part. Tl;dr: You want good goggles, these are GOOD goggles!",

      "text": "These are perfect for a costume or to add to your wardrobe. They are plain so you can spray paint them, or adhere any spike or cogs, or whatever you want. As these ARE welding googles, the lenses were very dark. Not recommended for wearing on your face or going outside in, especially not at night. (There is a way to remove the dark lenses and use two thin, clear plastic lenses they come with, if you so desire to wear them on your face). Also, the dark lenses contain some amount of lead, so use with caution. The adjustable strap is durable, and overall I am satisfied with the product.",

Also, on the box there is a warning that this product contains lead; this scared me a bit. I assume the lead is in the tinted lenses. All in all these satisfied me with how they look.",
