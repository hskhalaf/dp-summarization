It no longer has to snap in place to hold the iPad (I think that is what caused the other one to crack and chip). It seems like a better fit. Hopefully it will last longer than the old one.

      "text": "I like the open access to volume controls and power cable input. However, it does not fold exactly the same for viewing. Also, the case does not shut down or go into sleep mode when you close the cover if you have any current programs running. The authentic Ipad case has a magnet on the cover that would help close any programs running when you closed the cover. You have to do this manually with the JETech case. The back side of the case has a harder plastic cover which seems to slide more on hard surfaces. Overall, it does it's job holding my Ipad and protecting it.",

The case/stand design could be more robust and more protection might be added for the bottom edge of the iPad. The seller was prompt in all replies, answered my queries and accepted my recommendations. A decent case for the price, for your iPad Air, as long as adults are handling it.",

This single unit gives similar protection for about 1/4 the cost of my previous solution. While the back has a pleasing feel similar to the Apple unit, the front has a decidedly cheap plasticy feel to it. But the magnetic on/off function works fine, and it gives me a decent grip, and protects the screen. The trifold front also works slightly better than the original Apple unit, mostly because it's attached to the rear instead of magnet to the side. Bottom line, cheap and functional.",
