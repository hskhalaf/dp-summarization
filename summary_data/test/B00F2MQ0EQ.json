Basically the baby stopper has a pattern on it that acts like a cheese grater for baby feet. It took off the skin of my baby's pinky toes and had him bleeding in the tub. I'm sure this tub is great if you don't use the baby stopper, but as it is a core feature of the tub I would not recommend getting this product.",

He seems to have so much more fun being more stable - and I love that he can grow with this tub and have a new appropriate place to sit for bath. It also comes with a little bottle that can spray water like a shower head - it\u2019s his new favorite bath toy! He gets so excited when I bring that out! Highly recommend this product!",

It has got pretty good reviews from other fellow Amazon shoppers, its priced right and from Fisher-Price. So, you can't go wrong with this one. Currently, we are using it with \"Sit-me-up support\" which I found pretty useful as my baby love to sit and take bath while playing with her bath toys.",

He sits too far out of the water and seems uncomfortable with or without the seat. I love most FP products too. If you tend to have larger babies, I would recommend something else. I had the $14 First Years tub with my first baby and I liked it better. :(",
