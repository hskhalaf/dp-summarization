I've bought my previous 2 bottles in a store, ordered my 3rd via Beautylish, and tried my 4th on amazon via the subscription service.

I even had dry patches on my cheek after using this and my moisturizer was not enough to calm my dehydration. So I would not recommend this product to people with sensitive skin especially the ones with roscesia. Maybe it is the alcohol that dries out the skin that much.

And ever since I got on birth control after my second child I've found, at 23 years old, that my acne became worse all over my body. I have invested in Curology for my skin treatment. They advised this product to me for a cleanser/makeup remover for my sensitive skin. I was extremely impressed by how much it not only removed but didnt strip my skin dry of it's natural oils it needs. Which was very important to me since most cleansers dry me out. This is amazing for makeup removal and doing so in a way that helps your skin stay healthy.",

The micellar water allows me to wipe my face clean of make-up and \"life grime\" while in bed watching Netflix. And this stuff STELLAR. The amount of face gunk that reveals itself on my cotton pads is...kind of gross really but that is how you know the product is working! The bottle lasts me for quite some time - about six weeks. I hope you fall in love after your first swipe, too!",

Also it does a good job at cleansing makeup. I always wash it off with gentle cleanser afterward. You should ALWAYS wash it off with water, if not other mild cleanser. Otherwise it can sensitize your skin and potentially damage your skin barrier. I only repurchase this because I get to wash it off right after. If this were to stay on my face, I won\u2019t even look at it.",

There really isn't a HUGE difference, I just find it easier to push down with the cotton round without having to take it out of my cupboard. If you're debating between the blue or the pink bottle, get this one. The blue bottle doesn't work as well in my opinion. It's also not as sensitive to my eyes.",
