I found two better priced soy candles, one from Target for $5 (favorite pumpkin scent yet), and this one today while shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s (right) Trust me, I\u2019m the pumpkin-candle connoisseur, and if you buy the Wax Oils one you may not feel good about it for $13. My sniffer picked up smells of sugary maple more than spicy pumpkin. Hope this helps!",
