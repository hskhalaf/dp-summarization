We also used some small foam squares to cover the steel feet of the beam. It was a great purchase.",

May be it would be better just to have a beam made from wood only - as the real gymnastics beam. But since it was my choice to go with suede covered one, I do not blame the company. Just not 5 star happy with the purchase.",

      "text": "I bought this beam for my daughter, because she was upset about not having anything to practice on at home and \"the beam hates me.\" She's thrilled with this beam. It's two inches off the ground, which means I can place our 2-inch mat underneath for safety. She says it's just like the one at the gym except it's a little more \"fuzzy\" (i.e., suede). It's a good length, padded, very sturdy. Even I could stand on it without worries. My daughter practices her handstands, dismounts and other skills on her new beam every day. I can see improvements already.",
