I rather make a small quantity at a time so .5 l is perfect for me. SodaStream CO2 tanks work just fine. The design overall and functionality should be the standard in the industry. This product the nature of it is by far superior to what's competing with it.",

Bought this product based on recommendation from Epicurious. This makes me wonder if Epicurious takes kickbacks. This product is not worth owning. I feel duped.",

It is important to keep the attachment face at an angle when connecting the bottle to the equipment. Also make sure the water you are infusing is cold. I think it better hold the C02. I like sparkling water, but tap water tasted too much like chlorine. So I buy distilled water by the gallon for under a dollar. Refills from Home Depot are the best price, so far.",
