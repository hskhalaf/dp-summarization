I could easily shape my nails coffin, almond, or square (coffin being my preferred shape). I would recommend this to anybody who likes to file/shape their nails.

However, if my nails are very short, I have a hard time getting the file under my nail because the file has a rather thick edge (1\u20448 inch). Also, with the thickness of the point at the end, you cannot use it to clean under the nail. The case is plastic, but does a good job of protecting the file and stays closed in my manicure basket.",
