Unlike my old fan, this has three different speeds. Low is more than powerful enough for 95% of my need. The medium speed will work well on a hot day, and the high setting is strong enough to look like Fabio on the cover of a bodice ripper. So far, it's a five-star experience.",

When it worked it worked well, but I don't think they are built to last long. Consider this fan if you need a temporary, disposable fan to get you through a brief tough spot. If designed to work with regular use it would not be a bad fan. It's more for brief use and disposable. Most parts are recyclable. It's a shame because it's a stylish fan.",

I have used level three which feels like a major wind storm when I have been exceptionally hot from working outside. I bought two of these. One for my office and one for home. I hope they last a long time. I have had mine for about two months and they are working fine. I would definitely recommend this fan to anyone looking to stay cool in this hot summer we have been having.",

It's small footprint on a very crowded desk that holds three computers is also a big plus. Super quiet too. Very happy with this.",

Keep it out of sunlight when not in use. When driving, I put it in the clip thing where my phone usually attaches to. It stays stable and gives off a decent amount of air flow. Just saying it again, keep it away from direct sunlight, that will make it blow hot air. Good deal for the price.",

Not a big deal. The sound on the high speed is a bit loud, but then again I have it sitting right next to me. I'm please at how it somehow manages to stay put where I set it, despite it's light weight. Overall really pleased!",

Yes it's amazing, quiet and well designed. On high the fan uses about 820mah of power. So it should run for at least 10 hours hooked up to a 10,000mah powerbank.",
