My only MINOR issue, it is a \"little\" noisy when running. I have this about 10 feet from my bed and it is noticeable. If it stays like this- all is good, IF it gets more noisy not good. So if you are a light sleeper and plan to have this in the bedroom, you may need to consider another choice. My previous Heiden was whisper quiet until the motor gave up.",

Otherwise, I'll be returning this for the second time. The product looks really nice though. Their QC is just out of control. Update 6/28/2017 After a 3rd try. The product looks perfect. As described and does not over wind the watch with pre defined tpd settings. Silent enough for me to put it beside my bed.",

If you're hoping, as I was, to put your dead watches on this thing the night before you plan on wearing them, because you have an SKX or similar that won't manually wind, then you are out of luck. Apparently, a watch maintainer, as they should be called, will only keep a watch running after you've manually wound it. What a useless and expensive contraption. I guess us non-manual winding owners must continue to get strange looks as we shake our watches around for minutes at a time like we're insane.",

I also like the touch controls to set the winding options. The bar lights up when touched and you can set the TPD, Winding Direction, and on off for each watch individually.
