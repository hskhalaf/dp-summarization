Glad I ordered this one as the two speeds are enough and I think the smaller size will make it easier to control. I prefer the dremel brand as they have a reputation for longevity ( father has an old 200 and has really put it to the test over the last 15 years or so. Be sure to read the manual and let run for 5 minutes with no attachments to seat the motor brushes, very important !!! Do wish it came with a case but there are second party companies that make universal cases.",

I don't think it ever got past about 3000 RPM and sounded like a bad bearing all the time. It was replaced with one which mostly works. It typically takes 30-60 sec to get up to speed on the low setting. When it eventually does it is at 13000 RPM no load. I suppose that is close enough to the advertised 15000 RPM. Clearly the speed control has been changed and not for the better. The high speed setting seems the same as all other Dremmel tools, reasonably powerful.",

This might make offer improved handling by the user. Also move the power switch! It's in an inconvenient location and you have to be careful when releasing your grip to switch it on and off.
