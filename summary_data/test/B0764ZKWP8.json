I have a much more expensive speaker but this one was less than half the price with all of the same features plus the ability to answer phone calls. I do pretty thorough research on reviews and features before buying on Amazon, and this one seemed to cover all of the bases.",

Sound quality and available volume is far superior. Bass response is nothing short of excellent. You can feel the bass thumps on the shower glass. Half volume is about all I can take. Claims 5 Watts output which seems believable. Bluetooth stays connected and battery life appears adequate. LED lighting is very nice. Highly recommend.",

Unfortunately, after not even a week it could only hold a charge for about 20 minutes, and now it will no longer hold a charge at all. I'm really disappointed because for the first few days it was a great speaker. If not for it breaking down in less than a week I would have recommended it. Update: They sent me a replacement that is working wonderfully so far. Hopefully it continues to do so, I will update in a few weeks.",

The volume loudness is marginal. I have a 32 foot, in length, pool and I can not hear the music at one end when the speaker is sitting on the poolside at the other end. You can not even discerne music is playing if the speaker is floating in the water. If you\u2019re wanting a speaker for the shower, this is a great option. A speaker for your canoe/kayak this is a great option. A floating speaker for a pool party? no.",

The suction cup doesn't hold onto the glass shower at all, so I wrapped a cord around it and attached it to a hook that goes over the side of the shower. Problem solved. What would be an improvement would be a display for the FM stations numbers, because there is no feedback and it's a guessing game as to how to find the station you want.",
