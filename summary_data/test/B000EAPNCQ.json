I have another one that I purchased locally at a rip off medical supply story (they charged me $52!), and it's model \"S13.\" It has held up for months--however, I purchased another S13 from the same rip-off store and THAT one busted in two weeks.

Its almost big enough to wrap around my entire ankle, go across my entire back, or spread across one side of my leg. What else is there to say apart from I've gone through a lot of ice packs. Some don't get cold enough and some break very easily, and this one is both durable and cold enough to ice for at least 20 min.",

I tried placing this on stacked pillows and leaning against it to avoid the weight on the back of my neck, but because the outer cover is super smooth, and the pack is so heavy, no matter - it slides down and won't stay anywhere that I put it.

The ColPac treatment and PT have helped my husband tremendously and within 3 weeks he was walking without a cane and able to drive. The ColPac is easy to apply and even when frozen molds easily to the knee and any other body part. We heartily recommend it.",

We bought two and have used them many times. Very happy with this purchase! I do recommend slipping them in a pillowcase before use when taking them out of the freezer - that will help protect the skin and also absorb any moisture that forms as the pack begins to warm up.",
