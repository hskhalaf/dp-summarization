The only CON about this ball so FAR is that it's just like any other ball meaning in order for the Grin to show the dog has to pick it up the correct way. I had NO CLUE that this ball was Rubber and it does seem pretty tough. So we will see it also floats and can put treats in this ball. I also own the Green one!",

After a while of laughter to see which dog had the ball the correct way, we all were in stitches laughing. At home we added the treats and the dogs are very clever bagging it against the wall to retrieve the treat. DOGS will love this and the owners. Good presents",
