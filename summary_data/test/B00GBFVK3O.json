They are sturdy, good looking, large and have a great shape and handles. Very comfortable in your hand. They clean well in the dishwasher... no need for hand washing. And the price is fantastic for the quality. Other purchasers seemed to have had trouble with mugs arriving broken, but all of ours arrived in perfect shape.",

I didn't buy them for style but they look OK, not at all offensive and certainly not gimmicky like the mugs people give at Christmas parties.

My one observation and what keeps me from giving it five stars is that like another reviewer my yellow cup was missing. I got two purple cups and since purple is my favorite color I will keep them. They are a great size and a true 16 ounce cup.",
