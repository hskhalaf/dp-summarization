The shoulder straps have great cushioning, as does the back of the pack. My son used the exact same pack (different color) last year and it made it through the entire year of holding heavy school supplies, being thrown around, and even dragged on the ground a bit. He's using the same pack again this year! This is why I bought this one for my daughter. I'm sure it will hold up just as well. I would recommend this pack to anyone!",

The smaller compartment has a holder for 3 pens plus a lanyard for your keys and a little mesh pocket for change/small items. It also has 2 mesh water bottle holders ( I use one for my water bottle and one for my iPhone). It's a great backpack.",
