If you have a tank with expensive livestock like a reef tank, absolutely avoid this heater. It is not reliable and could cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars in dead livestock.",

Doesn't seem to heat the water up to the set temperature unless there is good flow in the tank. It was always reading 1.5-2 degrees below my set temperature until I added 2 powerheads to my 180g tank. Pros: Easy to install, looks good, won't break easily. Works well with good flow.

    "description": "Size:300-watt| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging\n\nMaintaining proper temperature is one of the most important factors in aquarium care. The Fluval E Heaters continuously monitor and display aquarium water temperature, ensuring the well-being of your aquarium inhabitants. Simply the most technologically advanced submersible aquarium heaters available today, the Fluval E Series features VueTech technology. With the easy to use adjustment lever, the temperature can be precisely set in 0.5\u00b0 increments. Its LCD display delivers peace of mind by continuously showing real time water temperatures. During normal operation the temperature readout will change color if the aquarium water varies +/-2 degrees F or more from the pre-set temperature. Should any external heat sources or other equipment, such as chillers, cause the aquarium water temperature to rise or fall beyond 5.5 \u00b0F, the colored screen will flash, indicating a potential risk. The ability to measure temperature in Celsius is also an option. The integrated fish guard offers advanced protection. Fish and invertebrates cannot come into direct contact with the heater core. The glass sleeve is also protected against shocks from large fish species. Built with a secure slim profile mounting bracket. The heater can be adjusted or removed without removing the mounting bracket. The great asset of the mounting bracket is its ability for you to mount the heater at varied angles, so you can view the front screen in any direction you wish. For those with a marine aquarium and sump, you can also attach the Fluval E heater there.\n\nWARNING: The heater must never be operated outside of the aquarium. If the water level falls below the minimum water level MIN, the thermostat can no longer \"read\u201d the water temperature and therefore can no longer control the heating correctly. If it has to be taken out of the water or when transferring or changing the water, disconnect the heater from the power source and wait for at least 30 minutes to allow it to cool down.",
