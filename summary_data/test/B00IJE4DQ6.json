Last year their finish started peeling I reached out to Electric with pictures and purchase information they never responded to my email or warranty form. Very disappointed since Ive been buying this brand for years. After this, Im moving on to their competing brand. Would not recommend if youre counting on their \u201cwarranty\u201d.",

I wish perhaps I would have gone with something \"edgier\" than these wayfarer knock offs, but I liked them enough to keep them. The only thing I'll add is that the grey lens is pretty dark and I have to remove them to look at my phone while driving. I think the matte black is pretty cool, and the pouch that doubles as a cleansing cloth is a nice touch!",
