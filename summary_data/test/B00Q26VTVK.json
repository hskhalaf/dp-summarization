Both ways, the color lasts and does not smear.",

This doesnt cause cracking or dry looking lips unlike too faced matte lip sticks. Too faced mattes are 6-10 times this cost and look like ur lips have been in the dessert.

Neither the lip colour or the shine-watchamacallit taste strongly or bad. Its kiss proof, mostly. Sometimes it leaves a bit of a smudge, sometimes not.

It does have that kind of \"plasticy\" feel that most long lasting lipsticks have. Another reviewer suggested blotting with a tissue right after you apply, and that helps take away some of the plastic feel. Heart Breaker is a neutral color, but a pretty dark neutral. More of a fall color than a spring color.",

After trying so many products (which were claiming to be waterproof, but they are not :( ) I have finally found the lipstick, which really stays for a very long time (about 7-8 hours) even after drinking coffee, tea, eating meals. Besides, this product does not dry lips and it has not given me any allergic reaction. Overall, I am very satisfied.",
