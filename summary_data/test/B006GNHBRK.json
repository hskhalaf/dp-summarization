So two improvements needed, longer legs and something to make the legs stay in place.",

The roads around my city are in pretty good shape but every once in a while I hit some gnarly ones and I can't imagine what my body would feel like without this support. They also look great!",

      "text": "These shorts are beautiful & I was very excited to ride in them; however, our first ride was challenging. They were super tight through a 4 hour ride, causing a lot of heat & discomfort. After the ride, I jumped into the creek & they have fit well ever since. The chamois is pretty thin so I no longer wear them on rides lasting more than 90 minutes. The reflective laminate came off almost immediately.",
