The main reason for selecting this make and model was its advertised 60 minute sustained shred time and 10 minute cool down with thermal protection feature. Once I work up the energy to shred I don't want to stop just because the machine can't match my enthusiasm. This shredder is awesome!!! It does everything it says it will do, and it is sooooo quiet. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",

The only time I stop is to empty out the bin. If you make sure you don't \"overload\" your bin, emptying it out is no problem, and is not messy. The window in front is great. In-between, I'll pull out the drawer and push the rubbish around to make it more level, so I can shred more into the bin. This is so worth the cost. Just a few more dollars than those smaller type shredders that stop sometimes after only 5 minutes. GET IT! You will not be disappointed.",

Why, you may wonder, would someone shred cardboard--well, what do YOU do with all those Amazon boxes? I will let you in on a little gardening secret. If you've ever put together a compost pile, you need greens, like grass clippings, and browns, like dried leaves. The problem is, when it's grass clipping season, you don't have dried leaves. Shredded cardboard makes a great substitute. Our compost pile is roaring! Happy gardening and happy shredding.",

Cut off the shrink wrap - plug in and GO - that was all!!!! Works like a charm - handles paperclips easily and crooked stacks of papers it just grabs and pulls them in.

The speed that it pulls in paper is a little slower than shredders that take in only \"6\" sheets at a time. But since it takes in 3x as much a 10% speed penalty is not bad. Good machine.

They are fixed permanently in the side to side direction. So the unit moves smoothly on the floor from side to side. But if you want to move it forward or back, you better pick it up or you'll scratch the floor. This thing really needs swivel wheels.",
