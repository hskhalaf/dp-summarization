It's a better setup, better picture, and with a Car Charger. There's no comparison in my opinion. A 16 gig SD can hold a lot of shows.. A LOT more than a DVD and a lot more convenient. BTW, the reception with the screw-in antenna is GREAT compared to RCA's. Not to mention it's about $15 cheaper! I'm VERY happy with this purchase so far.",

I got a lot more stations than my digital convertor could pick up. The fitting for the whip antenna is pretty flimsy, sometimes you have to hold it in tightly to get a good signal. It can also take a screw-on cable connection. You may need to move it around to pick up certain stations well. The remote control works nicely. I got it mainly as a small auxiliary TV to use in the kitchen or out on the deck. A great value for the money.",
