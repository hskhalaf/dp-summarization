We spent $450 on a terrible jeep (12 Volt Ride on Car by Moderno Kids) that gave our family nothing but problems. Battery problems, remote control problems, you name it.

The wide wheel-base offers stability and a roomy storage area lets them take along a snack or other must-have items while they're out on the trail. 2.5 and 5-mph, Max. Going forward; 2.5-Mph Max. In reverse. Ages 3 and above. Maximum weight capacity: 130 lbs.. Classic Jeep style on their very first car.
