The hand blender literally unscrews and comes apart when we use it, and it actually hurts to keep the power button compressed. I wish I had not waited so long to open the box and use it or it would have gone straight back. Mine actually appeared to be used when I opened the package. There are no instructions and the very nice jar did not have a top. Perhaps it was a returned product? Super disappointed",

So far it works good, not the performance I dislike, just the engineering. I'm a small, 60 yr old woman. This device is difficult for me to assemble and disassemble each use.",

As an example when putting the attachment on, it doesn't seem secure and there isn't a \"click\" that indicates that its on (like the Braun does). It even came off once when I was using it. I also use these hand mixers to make smoothies and I use a frozen banana, but it didn't fully liquefy the banana and I had odd frozen chunks of banana. I suppose its cheap enough to overlook some of these issues, but now I think maybe I should have paid more for something better.",
