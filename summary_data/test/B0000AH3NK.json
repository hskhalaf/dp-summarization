It took him about a day to even touch it. Now he knows what to expect, although what I have noticed is that he will dip it in water before he eats it. Maybe it tastes better or maybe to soften it? All in all, great product because of all the vitamins and minerals he needs. I just wish he was more excited to eat it! I guess nothing beats seeds.",

He particularly likes dunking them in his water, much to the dismay of his owner (that would be me). Anyway, this food is nutritious, without any artificial coloring, and much cheaper and healthier than what you'll find in the store. It's very convenient to be able to order online and have it shipped in bulk.",
