I think this knife must have skipped the sharpening except that the teflon coating was slightly removed near the \"cutting\" edge. They did something to it but sharpen it wasn't one of the things they did. Shame because I really like the look of it and the flexibility of the blade. If it had come with a sharpener I would sharpen it and try it but as it is I'm just going to return it.",

All sort of things accumulate in those gaps and it is difficult to clean. It has worked well for over 30 days of fishing with daily use, but I am definitely looking for a replacement.

I also would not recommend it for a camp knife that gets used for lots of different purposes. Rapala makes a similar 4\u201d model with a stainless blade and black handle that works quite a bit better.
