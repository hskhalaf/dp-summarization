Fridges, including minifridges, contain freon that allow it to keep food cool, the freon leaks when tipped (I did not put mine to the side but learned this information from someone who was helped me get the minifridge out of the box).",

      "text": "Bought this mini fridge in 2016 when I was living in a small bachelor apartment for 3 years. It worked great, never had any issues with it. It's got enough space to hold plenty of items. Now 4 years later living in a home the fridge is still running perfectly. I have it in my spare office to keep drinks & spirits cool. I definitely recommend this buy for anyone looking for a small fridge.",
