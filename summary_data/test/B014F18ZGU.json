While it does relieve some pain off my lower back, the bump and strange shape of the cushion spreads my legs and digs into my crack that it actually hurts. IT feels like I'm constantly on the toilet. I had to put some hydrocortizone cream on it because I think I got some sort of hemorrhoid or something. It hurts I tell you! I position the cushion exactly where I'm supposed to but it's no use. Sitting on a plain old cotton pillow is actually less painful than this.",

Using this for just 2 days has exacerbated my back pain as well as caused additional pain in my thighs and posterior region. I do not understand how this product has good reviews, they must be paid for. If you would like to actively damage your back, only then by this product. I would give this product negative stars if I could it is simply AWFUL. This product is incorrectly designed and can severely compress your nerves and damage your spine. Please stay away from this terrible product.",

The difference is my living room chair is softer than my den chair. So try this cushion on several chairs before giving up on it. If your chair is super soft and cushy, this might not be the right cushion for you. If your chair is on the firm side, try this cushion!",

I was hoping a gel cushion might improve the seating comfort to the extent that the chair would be more usable. This cushion flattens out and does little to nothing for the purpose I bought it for. It may provide orthopedic advantages for a 5 foot 120 pound person, but for a 6 foot 300 pound person, my wallet provides better support and cushion than this does. As my headline says.. your experience may vary based on your purpose and expectation.",

I\u2019ve tried another cushion that did not work at all , so so far this is much more comfortable. And is made really well too ! Thank you !",

I took more than 14 days just to decide if the product was worth keeping. Its the reason I took off 1 star. If there is a lifetime warranty, then we should have more time to register it. The 14 day time limit is just a way to avoid honoring warranty claims. Bad business practice.",

These cushions have some measure of help in keeping you in place in your seat, but that can be an up or down mark if you move around in your office chair. The coccyx supportive cushioning is the one positive I can speak about highly. It allows for the body to sit \"exactly\" where it should in the cushion. If the entire cushion were as think/supportive as the edges, it would've gotten an all five star rating from me. Save your money and purchase one that is a bit sturdier.",
