This works great, cleans well with not a lot of product. As with all waterless shampoos, it works best if you use it with a damp paper towel or wash cloth. I didn't give this 5 stars because it's not a spray (which is more convenient for me) and the smell is way too perfumey for me.",

The pleasant smell lasted a day or two and then I needed to use after-bath spray to keep the dog smell away. So all in all this product works but the clean didn't last as long as a \"real\" bath, however for how easy the process was (compared to a real, full bath), I rate it four stars.

To be honest work just like any spray fragrance for dogs except this is a foam instead of a spray. My dogs had no allergies with it, no loss of fur and on my little mutt actually gave him a little bit of gloss to his fur he seems to like it more than my husky, he has a thicker coat and rarely get smelly, on him it made no difference at all.",
