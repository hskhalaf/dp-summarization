Very obvious the phone was not refurbished but simplly repackaged and and sold. Don't waste your money. Also refurbished unit is not sold by Huawei.

Called Huawei support - sent them six pictures of the phone at their request - NO REPAIR - they consider it \"physical damage\" - even though the frame on their phone failed. Phone has been in case and protected since day one. Beware you are on your own even if your phone is still COVERED by warranty. Terrible service. Never will I buy one of their products again.",

Randomly puts my calls on speaker and airplane mode for no reason. So much for a refurbished phone, it's never worked correctly. Don't buy!!!!!",

The battery is absolutely useless now, it cannot hold a charge and the phone cannot be used without being plugged in to a charger. This means it is no longer a wireless phone, but a wired phone. The camera was good but lacked image stabilization, and the dual front speakers were fantastic, until one of them blew out. Fingerprint sensor was very quick and accurate. Overall a good product, but the manufacturer does not care whatsoever about their consumers and there are many alternatives that are better.",

This appears to be a common Android problem in general but it is particularly so with the Nexus series. That aside, the display is great and the camera takes great pics - that is, until the battery runs out from actually using the phone. Probably going to return it unless a fix comes out in the next few days.",

However, it drops signal and completely loses connection to data and cellular for calls all too regularly leaving your carrier to scratch their head, and tell you that since it is unlocked and provisioned specifically for their network it just may do that from time to time. Takes solid photos in a vast variety of low light conditions that borders on the impressive, often maintaining a great deal of color saturation, but video capture is just subpart. 30 fps with only electronic stabilization isn't sufficient when competitors like Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6 and 6S record 1080p at higher frame rates, yielding smoother video.",
