So essentially I received two phones neither functioned and had a lengthy return process. Also the second one I received had the previous owners media messages still on it, it was obviously not reset or refurbished in any manner. The phone itself seems to be a great phone, if you're looking for a keyboard, and don't mind having an older version of android. However I would recommend ordering from a different vendor then Forever Deals.",
