I wish I had used more lard or even vegetable oil for a more uniformed, less spotted seasoning, but it works just fine anyway. I'm ordering more scallops from Maine today, so I can use this pan again. Mmmm.",

I realize that shipping issues are to be reviewed separately, but think it's pertinent because I didn't think cast iron could have anything break off. That said, it's a lovely pan and I'm ordering the exact same one again as a replacement.",
