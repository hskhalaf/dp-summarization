This time if you want to decorate your lawn with Light Projectors then this is for you. As this one-time investment, you have to choose projectors on your requirement & product efficiency. The range of the laser really impressed me. It is powerful & offers a broad area coverage, they have also made it a priority to include an equally powerful remote. It is also waterproof. Amazing!!",
