      "verdict": "The Mt Adams, a backpacking boot from Danner, undoubtedly excelled in providing comfort and traction on the trails. However, its unsatisfactory points are not to be set aside. Its flimsy laces and imprecise width caused disappoinments. On the whole, the Danner Mt Adams still earned enough reasons for interested buyers to check it out. It may not be the best for wide-footed individuals though.",
      "pros": [
        "Some satisfied owners of the Mt Adams from Danner testified to its right-out-of-the-box comfort",
        "This backpacking boot offered a right amount of ankle support, based on several consumer reviews",
        "A handful of users said that the Mt Adams required little-to-no breaking in",
        "The grippy tread of the outsole received appreciation from a good deal of hikers",
        "A small number of backpackers noted that it protected their foot from getting wet"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A significant percentage of wearers were dismayed when the laces of the Danner Mt Adams were damaged after merely a few weeks of use",
        "A majority of online purchasers expressed how frustrated they were with its narrow toe box"

I hike 3 miles a day up a steep, rocky trail to the top of the Santa Monica Mtns, and have done several long hikes in the late snow Sierras with no cold or wetness, so I think all round they deserve 5 stars. The laces are pretty rubbish though, so I had to replace them after 3 months or around 350 miles.",

Only positive is that they seem to be extremely durable. On to Salomons.",

I bought a pair online without trying on (no one carries Danner around here) and by the way the boot is made, the neck applies pressure right on my Achilles tendon (below) the calf muscle. I literally cannot wear this boot longer than about 1/2 hour until the pressure is just too much and it hurts the whole calf area. It seems the boot neck falls right on the tendon in my leg in a bad spot. Try them on and if they feel right, you will be happy. It is an excellent boot.",

Never put any oil or anything on them and they are still holding together. The left boot string did get damaged somehow but the inside part of the string is still holding. Only aggravation I have is now trying to find an insole replacement. I work as a low voltage electrical technician which puts me on concrete and climbing ladders 99% of the time I\u2019m not driving.",

The boots are very comfortable wearing first time out of the box. I wore them all day walking around and they are a pleasure in my feet. They fit true to size and seem very well mad. The tread seem to have very good grip as well. Can't wait to putting them to work in the Adirondack mountains.",
