The door opens about 2 inches and just stops. When I contacted SentrySafe's customer service, they said I'd need to pay for a new gas strut, which would be $20 + tax (and I assume shipping). It doesn't make sense to me to pay around $30 every year and a half to keep the safe working and hope that it works when you need it. Don't waste your money like I did. Get another safe! PS - I wrote a review on Sentry Safe's website and they removed it. Beware!!!!",

So much more reliable than my previous safe and opening deploys super fast. Love the blue light illumination inside as well. Super spacious. Fits two full size handguns easily with room for extra mags or ammo, cash, and important docs. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a good nightstand safe.",

In some cases it would fail multiple times. So I went ahead with programming a new code as well as added two fingerprints and immediately it accepted the fingerprint in the first swipe after tapping it from sleep. Not sure if there is a glitch but inserting two prints and a code fixed the issue with the biometrics. So far so good and hope it stays that way.",

That way if my vehicle ever got broken into, they wouldn't be able to find it in the console and swipe it. I routinely walk by and swipe my thumb over the biometric lock and it opens every time. The batteries are a year old and are by all accounts doing good. Very pleased with the product",

He loves it, he can operate it just fine despite his memory issues with the fingerprint scanner. Battery seems to last a long time, and if anyone was going to have trouble with technology, it's someone with a traumatic brain injury! Should be great for any use, pistol or otherwise.",

There are only 4 buttons for the digital access code but it does allow up to six digits and only having 4 may be better for quick access at night. All-in-all a very nice product which I think very nicely balances quick access and safety.",
