This lightweight trainer is highly recommended by its owners.",

      "text": "I highly recommend these for lifting. I'm a person who usually has a problem with wide/flat feet, but these address the issue without any concerns. I once trained with the otomix stingrays and ultimate trainers, but I had an issue that forced me to buy half a size bigger (which resulted to me having some room near the toebox). Training legs wasn't normally a problem, but hitting calves was sometimes more difficult than it should have been. The ninja model is meant to address this issue for people that specifically train with weights, but none of my friends have been able to vouch for them since they didn't want to be the guinae pig to test them out.",

But I hear really good reviews for wrestling and lifting so cop a pair if you haven\u2019t already! For boxing, great support, I could pivot better, great traction and grip. But if I were you, find the right size for you just in case. I have narrow feet with a little bit of width so they fit great so keep in mind about sizing. Great pair nonetheless!",

      "title": "Good design, poor build quality",
      "text": "Design and finish are good. The sole is nice and low and stitched on. The ankle is generously padded which helps if you are kickboxing and getting your kicks checked. However, while training in these shoes for the third time only, the right tongue came completely off the shoe while I was wearing it. The tongue was held on with only a single stitch and no reinforcement. These will be great shoes if Otomix stops cutting corners on the most structurally important bits of the shoe. This is the same problem with every other brand I've tried: style over durability.",
