Unfortunately, that was not the case. Pros: It is made of silicone, so it is pretty flexible in the baby\u2019s mouth, making it easy to move around and massage the gums. Cons: It is extremely tight on the finger (I am a woman with thin fingers and it barely fits), it won\u2019t even go in my husband\u2019s pinkie... making it difficult to massage our baby\u2019s gums. Therefore, I would not recommend it.",

      "text": "These finger toothbrushes are by far the easiest way to brush tiny teeth in a tiny mouth. I love that the silicone is thin enough that you can feel the teeth but thick enough that baby can bite down/chew without it being uncomfortable. They're also inexpensive enough that you can purchase a lot of them and not have to worry if one gets lost or needs to be replaced.",
