The size of it is about as big as a morphe palette",

Sturdy and protective for travel. Can easily and safely fit all my day to day skin care, make-up (including alt options). Dividers are sturdy and customizable. They are able to Velcro in and Velcro out to change shape of compartments. I\u2019m a big fan and plan to buy more for Christmas gifts. Bottom line, this is a great structured make-up bag and it suits my needs perfectly. In fact, I\u2019m still using my make-up right out of it even now that I am home. I love the organization of it. Highly recommend.",

If your brushes are too long, the bristles will get bent or crushed. The separators are Velcro, so you can remove them relatively easily if you want to. The interior zipper feels a little more cheaply made, but it works. The pocket it zips is smallish, but it can hold a couple of packs of lashes well.",

      "text": "This make up bag is just what I was looking for. It is made of sturdy material and the zipper seems strong enough to last a while. It fits perfectly in my bathroom drawer, but it is large enough to easily fit all of my makeup. I love the adjustable compartments. The velcro is strong enough so they don't slip, but not overly difficult to move. Some of my makeup has left marks on the black surface of the bag, but it was easily removed with a damp cloth. If I was to order again, I would order the one with the white trim so it would be easier to tell which side was the top.",

It was convenient to carry and held all of her makeup easily, and it was relatively inexpensive as well (especially for the quality). The company even emailed me to make sure the bag arrived on time and we were pleased with the purchase. Excellent product. Very useful. Great company. We are both wonderfully pleased.",
