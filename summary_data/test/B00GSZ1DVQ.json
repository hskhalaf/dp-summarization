I bought my son the larges, and when I tried those, they were much more comfortable and did just as good a job of keeping the wind out. So, I highly recommend buying a size up. These are not noise cancelling at all so they do not affect your ability to hear, which is good since that's not their intended purpose.",

Ear Bags 'snap' into place and that's it! No itching, no shifting, my ears are never cold and my head is never too hot! I love that they lay flat against my head. If my hair is down, they are not visible. Period. I have found that I can also wear them with ear buds. Great product!",

These earbags with thinsulate are the perfect option - low profile, easy fit, stay on, keep my ears warm for EIGHT HOURS under very cold conditions. THANK YOU for a great option. If these can protect my ears under those conditions all day, they should be great for any other cold activity.",

      "text": "I acquired my first set of Earbags on a trip to NYC. When I lost one a few months ago (don't attempt to wear ear buds under them) I tried a headband, which turned out to be too wide and required awkward folding to keep out of my eyes. In desperation I finally ordered another set of Earbags. They're easy to carry in a purse or pocket, and stay put\u2014without ear buds of course. Bonus: They protect my ears from WY wind without ruining my hair.",

I wear them every day with this crazy cold weather we are having and I'm so glad I got them because they fit right under my hat and keep my ears nice and toasty.",
