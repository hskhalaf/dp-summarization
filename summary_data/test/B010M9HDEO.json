The smaller states are EVIL and you have to try and pop them out last or run hot water over the tray to get them out. And some are ridiculously small. I'd rather they printed the lines for the states on the back (a raised divot or something similar) and grouped the states in 6 or 8 (with exceptions for California, Texas and the Dakotas) to make it easier. Way too much effort to make ice to use.",
