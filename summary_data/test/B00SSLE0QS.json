The small, sharp 10\" blade is perfect for us and made short work of cutting firewood and taking medium sized trees down. I've used it twice and probably worked about 20 minutes each time and never had to swap batteries although I had one in my pocket just in case.

The battery life is perfect as my arms are getting tired by the time the charge is wearing down, although I\u2019m considering buying a second battery, just in case. Next I\u2019ll tackle my husbands abandoned telephone pole, also known as The Leaning Tower of Wind-toys, long deceased. The best part is it\u2019s mine! I purchased because the hubby wouldn\u2019t do the work. Now he wants to play with it, but it\u2019s mine, lol!",

      "text": "First off, you are not buying a Stihl or Husqvarna, please remember that. I needed something small for brush, trimming trees, cleaning up after storms, etc., and did not need a $400+ gas chain saw. I have family when that need arises. I have multiple Black & Decker 20V outdoor tools, so I added this to the collection since I have a stack of existing batteries. This tool exceeded what I ever expected it to do. I was able to even do cuts through 16\" chunks with ease. Expect about 15 minutes of run on a 1.5 AH battery and a little over 20 minutes on a 2.0 AH.",

The battery life is variable, depending on whether you continuously run the chainsaw or not. I used it over the weekend camping and it helped me cut up enough wood to burn. It does really well on 3-5 inch cuts. I hope it stands up to the test of time.",

      "text": "This product is great as it does what you buy it for, the portability of a battery powered tool. The battery life is really surprising as it lasts as long in this saw as it does when you have the Trim Saw attached to a MAX Drill. The only downside I've noticed is that it seems more noisy than my 18\" electric chainsaw. A great buy that I will recommend to anyone who asks for a suggestion for a 10\" portable chainsaw!",

      "text": "Smaller than my gas powered chainsaw, but does the job I need it for: cutting dead branches off a variety of trees around my property. Easily handled by one hand when necessary. My only complaint is that I didn't realize it does not automatically keep the chain lubricated - there is a small thumb pump on top of the chain oil reservoir that you have to manually pump 3 of 4 times to force the thick oil down to the chain. It doesn't use much oil each time, but does seem to keep it lubed enough. If you were making a large cut you would probably have to stop several times to keep the chain oiled.",

No cleaning, not set up, no mixing, no electric cords. If I didn't need a ladder this would almost be enjoyable.",

Like many others have mentioned, my oiler did not work at first. But found that the chain housing was just too tight. Once loosened, the oiler seems fine. So fine for smaller jobs.
