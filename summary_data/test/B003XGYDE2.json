I had a puncture and was able to inflate a 235/85 R16 tire from completely flat to 70 psi in about 8 minutes, with a 2 minute rest to prevent overheating of the pump - so, 10 minutes total. (If you think that is too slow, compare that to the 3 hour wait for a tow truck the Highway Patrol officer told me I was in for.) Then I was on the road again. VERY pleased with the performance. This is the 110 volt ac unit and is probably much stronger than any 12 volt dc unit.",

It's either defective or a crummy product. Obviously my fault for not checking it when we first got it. I'd stay away but if you get one, try it out immediately on the stuff you want to inflate. Also, it's labeled a \"tire inflator\" yet with the attachments provided, there is no way to actually inflate a tire. Very weird.",

Even automotive tires are pain to inflate because the end connector is threaded forcing you to screw on the connector to the valve which does not work with bicycle tires very well as you lose a lot of pressure trying to disconnect it. The other problem is that the \"quick connect\" adapter is not standard - your air compressor accessories won't work with it so you are forced to use the terrible connector that ships with this pump. After 3 months of use I am looking for another compressor as this one does not do a good job inflating any kind of tires.",

Nice idea -- but the grip slips on the screw-on attachment to the point that it is difficult to get onto a tire valve without letting out a lot of air and equally difficult to get off a tire valve without letting out a lot of air. The net effect of all that is that I have to overinflated the tires by a fair amount and then bleed air out to get to the desired pressure. That is basically unsatisfactory.

Within just a few minutes it had pumped almost fifty pounds of air into the tire and was pretty impressed with its performance. So guess what. I highly recommend this unit. It's small for storage. Lightweight, fairly quiet and definitely does the job.",

The directions weren't very clear. But my guesstimate worked and I was able to get done what I needed. Based on my use, I would say it's best for blowing up small items (rafts, balls, bike tires, air mattress). I don't think it has enough power to air up a car tire. Four stars because the directions of putting together weren't clear, and I don't think it could inflate a car tire.",

This one inflates quickly, and give you a continuous pressure reading. I am VERY pleased with the product!!",
