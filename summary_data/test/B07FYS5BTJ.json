Setup is quick and easy although the installation of the water level indicator may leave some people confused, it's pretty easy once you check out a quick video or look at the instructions for awhile. Everything has been water tight and these buckets work great. I transferred some plants from another DWC system that was running out of room and planted some seeds in the included rockwool. I'll see how well the rockwool works in the next couple of weeks. There's still a need for plant light (unless you're using natural light) and nutrients, but these will vary based on your needs.",

I compared them to the Kratky method of putting your plants in a jar, and the hydroponic planter has far bypassed the growth from Kratky method. Highly recommend this product to the house hold growing products indoors",
