Both monitors confirmed that this has only reduced the humidty in my small bedroom by about 2-3%... Really?? That's it after running for 4 straight days nonstop? And it's not really that quiet either. The noise is more than just a \"whisper\". It's a nice looking product and seems well made and I was excited to get it....but it's basically useless, unless reducing the humidity by 3% makes the quality of ones life any better. Returning it today.",

I've had it running for three days now and it works perfectly. The picture I attached is after two days and you can see it's about one third full. My windows are dry and my hygrometer indicates the humidity is lower. It runs quietly and apparently is designed to run continuously; the unit stays cool and the wall wort is moderately warm. I had no problem emptying the reservoir. I'm very happy and highly recommend it. If you register your purchase, the manufacturer extends the warranty to two years.",

In comparison, it's definitely whisper quiet and has a much longer power cord which is very convenient. I'm just not sure it's as effective because the water tray collects less than half an inch each day, unlike the old dehumidifier. Not being able to remove the water tray collection lid (both models) is a negative because it gets dusty and moldy inside, even after rinsing it out with bleach from time to time. Hopefully it'll operate for at least a year, or longer, like the Ivation brand did.",

I wanted something that would help with the window condensation, and to somehow help with my pillows that lay against the wall to stop feeling almost humid-like in the mornings?? It really surprised me.. in only 12 hours (7pm-7am) it had collected about half an inch!? (1st pic) The window was dry!!!! Amazing!!

It is terribly hot and humid out here (the kind of hot where you sweat all day and stick to everything), but these tiny little machine (which is smaller than a toaster) helps suck the hot humidity away, making it feel so much cooler and less 'sticky' inside the house. It doesn't seem to be making any noise, nor does it seem to bother any pets. It works pretty well, easy to use, easy to empty. Already recommended this product a lot and considered buying a second one for the bathroom. 5/5 Stars AMAZING!",

It does move water out of the air without killing your electric bill but it does it very slowly. 70 degree 50-60% humidity levels take only a couple ounces in a couple days. No appreciable change when monitoring with a humidity meter in the room but you do empty water out of the tray in a week, just not much. Customer Service is very high as I had reason to write them and they were prompt and professional in handling the issue.",

And leaving it on for a week I got a full container of water and then the second week just about a half or a quarter container of water. And this is in Mississippi so you know we have humid air.
