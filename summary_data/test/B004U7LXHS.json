(I purchased an Amazon paper shredder). Now, while filling bin number two, the first load is well on the way to becoming compost. An amazing process!",

It\u2019s not especially easy to assemble-but I watched a video which I stopped and started and had no problems putting it all together with occasional help in certain moments from my wife. It also looks really good in the garden which was part of what we were going for.",

If there is any animal products in there, flies may lay their larve and you will have maggots in the composter and then lots of flies later on.
