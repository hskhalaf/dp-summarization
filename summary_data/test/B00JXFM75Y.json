If all you are looking for is internet streaming movies, then there are less expensive (and more current) options. This device has no troubles handling everything I've thrown at it - from ripped BDs to a large selection of various quality HD mp4s and mkvs. It's small and basic looking. Cons: I don't think WD is supporting it anymore and the custom/modding scene doesn't seem particularly active or interesting. Just adding additional movie info scrapers appears to be a fairly advanced task. The lack of production is also driving up price.",

The only redeeming quality I found was the customer service which while eager to please, ultimately ended up being useless. Save your money and buy something else.

The WD-Live TV / Media Player is NOT the most sophisticated media streamer out there, but I give it 5 stars for two reasons: 1) It fills a niche market for those seeking a streamer with strong support for in-home hosted streaming media, and 2) the price. I'll always love the Boxee Box - my personal favorite - but they've stopped making them going forward, and prices have gone up a little for the remaining devices available. Currently at $84, the WD-Live TV / Media Player supports a wide variety of protocols to access and stream in-home hosted media.",
