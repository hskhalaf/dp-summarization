I wear it everyday for the SPF benefits and to always have a beautiful complexion. And if I forget to wash my face one night, it's not a big deal cause this is a non- clogging moisturizer first and foremost. I just recently discovered it has gluten in it though, which I am intolerant of, so I'm gonna try some of the other organic tinted moisterizers in the physicians line, hopefully they are all as phenomenal as this!",

It also had a terrible odor when first opened that was definitely from the sunscreen ingredients. Although the odor had dissipated on opening the cap a 2nd time, it's still not something I will use again.",
