The quality seems to be very good, as expected from Puma, and the foam insert(not mentioned in the listing here) adds a bit of extra comfort. I tend to buy mesh shoes for maximum breathability, but so far I have been pretty happy with the ventilation these do manage to provide. My only issue is that they definitely run small, even compared to the Pumas they replaced. I would suggest going a full size up from what you normally wear.",

I am able to walk in them and as a walking shoe they are comfortable, but I would probably have sore feet if I tried running in them. The provided image says the shoe is synthetic with rubber soles and looks like that synthetic rubberized material in the pictures. Most of the surface is in fact some kind of woven cloth-like material. It doesn't really detract from the look, it's just not what I was expecting.",
