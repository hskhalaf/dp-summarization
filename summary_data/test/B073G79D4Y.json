Total bummer, but oh well; I need reliability and not looks, ultimately, so back it goes!",

The ring is pleasant but not very loud and the caller ID does not show the actual phone NUMBER that is calling, just the name so if you want to call someone back your out of luck. Those are two things I don't like. It comes with a good battery that lasts a long time off of the base. Just be sure and charge it fully upon receipt.",
