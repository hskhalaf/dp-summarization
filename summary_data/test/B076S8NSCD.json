Surprising lack of advice about anti-static precautions while handling delicate components. Case is light weight plastic. Cooling fan is noisy. Vibration is a slight problem that may be resolved by standing case on padded material. Main complaint is that change of RAID setting appears to be blocked. Technical support advised how to get round this but result was corruption of one HDD. This \"repaired\" overnight, but RAID remained locked at \"SHR\". I would not buy this type again.",

The system won't backup any large files (it gets so far then starts again, never actually completing the file), it repeatedly backs up the same file over and over ignoring other files, or the thing crashes altogether and just stops making backups. Synology had no useful support that fixed this, and the logs are packed full of errors. It simply does not work.",

Security looks to be complete from virus checker, firewall and security features. You do need to bear in mind that with the 2 bay drive you, one of the disks is used for redundancy. It\u2019s less of a problem with the bigger NAS drives with 4 bays. Only one is used for redundancy. Essentially this means that your data is protected. Also have the option of backing up to various cloud providers.",

Not sure I'm going to buy the fourth but I'm convinced this particular model is a great machine. Highly recommended.",

The software includes 'packages' which you run to allow you to access files more easily, for example Photo Station which allows you to access images by thumbnail and view folders as albums, and also view images slideshows etc. The remote access (Quick Connect) is easy to set up and works a treat. I will be needing another NAS soon, and it will be a Synology unit. Without doubt.",

I don\u2019t want to spend hours looking at how to get this to work, or that configured.... Really disappointed.",
