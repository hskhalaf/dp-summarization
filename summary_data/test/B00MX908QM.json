While it was damaged enough that I needed to replace it, you should see how little damage was done to the helmet even though I ran over it with my truck. I think it is testament to how well this helmet is made, and how well it protects the head.",

      "text": "This product is still amazing even without the mips. Affordable, lightweight, looks great, but more importantly protects the skull. People have complained about the strapping system. I haven't had a problem after I adjusted the straps to comfortably fit flush on the sides of my face. The strapping is a little lightweight in comparison to what it formerly was, and people have noticed that too. This helmet still fits me great, and I'm not worried about the straps. I'm pleased.",

    "description": "The Savant is an amazing fit for riders who enjoy great routes as much as a swift pace. The slim shape combines impressive ventilation thanks to 25 wind tunnel vents and the comfortable convenience of the adjustable Roc Loc 5 fit and stability system. And with the lightweight and durability of in-mold construction, it won't weigh you down.",
    "rating": 4.7,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "In-Mold construction reinforces the area around the vents and ribs, creating a one-piece exoskeleton, which allows the helmet to be lighter, more durable and better ventilated than traditional designs",
      "25 Wind Tunnel vents with internal channels thrust cool, fresh air over and around your head while forcing heat and stale air out",
      "Quite possibly the best-fitting retention system you've ever experienced, the Roc Loc 5 easily adjusts both fit tension and vertical position with a single hand, plus it's 40% lighter than its popular predecessor, Roc Loc 4",
