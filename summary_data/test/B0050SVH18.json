Really not a very polished game. Camera is all over the place, some of the combat has some cool elements but overall this game is nothing special. There are some decent moments but the whole game is tainted by a one weapon approach, worse and simpler combat, spastic camera and various other issues. Playable though.",

      "text": "This reminds me a lot of the original NES game in the difficulty level. It'll take some time to master for certain. The game did freeze on me once while I tried to shut down during the first boss fight. Been fine since then though. Unlike previous \"bloody\" games Nintendo has allowed on their systems, this game hasn't been de-bloodified. You have all the violence you might expect from a PS3 version. The controls are excellent once you get use to them. Haven't been completely sold on the Wii-U touchscreen for everyday use but the game does a nice job of integrating it. Overall, a solid 4 maybe 4.5 stars for me. Was certainly worth the money.",

      "text": "Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge is a satisfyingly difficult action game chock full of blood and viscera. Compared to the vanilla version of Ninja Gaiden 3, Razor's Edge is slightly superior. The exclusion of healing items and the amped up enemy intelligence results in a considerably greater difficulty level. The Wii U gamepad screen is minimally utilized while playing the game on the television, but the gamepad screen may be used as the primary game screen. Overall, Ninja Gaiden: Razor's Edge is a competent, albeit slightly flawed, action game. If you enjoy fast paced action with a near masochistic level of challenge, then this game is for you.",
