I looked around the internet last week and the consensus was that these were due to dryness and Amlactin might solve it. Ordered it from Amazon. Yesterday, I applied two small dabs to each foot and rubbed it in. Not greasy at all. I put some socks on thinking that would keep it from rubbing off. Today, all gone. One modest application and they are gone. Amazing. (I have absolutely no connection to this product or company.)",
