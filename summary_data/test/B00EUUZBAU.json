Assembly wasn't difficult though. 14 mm or 9/16 std socket will be used 4 times. To Harper- I suggest that the packaging be redesigned to accommodate individual shipping/handling so that items don't break during shipping.",

However, this strength is designed around actually carrying the weight vs. maneuvering the weight about. What I am getting at is once you have a load on this truck, it is fine. We notice plenty of unwanted flexing which gives the truck a bit of a flimsy feel. Not yet concerned that it can not perform as rated but I certainly prefer a bit more of a 'solid' feel when I am moving any weight that requires a hand truck.",
