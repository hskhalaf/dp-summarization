In that short time, its mandatory adhesive wall cups literally tore the paint off the wall in one place, and permanently marred the other place. There\u2019s no point to pressure-mounted baby gates like this that are likely to damage your wall about as bad as a screw would. (See pics) Secondly, beware that a disturbing amount of pressure is needed to bend the top into shape. It pushed against our historic house\u2019s bannister hard enough to cause cracks and permanent outward deformation. 2 stars because this North States gate is easy to lift up and swing open with one finger, self-closes with gravity power, and is available in white.",

There is nothing that unlatches the knob from the bottom, so when I un-turn the lock at the top I have to pull the door up from the knob and then open it. On stairs, holding my young niece I didn't want to do that. I want a door that I just push a button or switch a latch that will unlock the door.",

But if it's something you may want to remove periodically you will find that because the gate appears to be bent (which is normal) it requires alot of force on the adjusters to install it correctly. They even include a small spanner type wrench to adjust it. You have to use that because it takes alot of force to straighten it out. Its not like one of those wooden gates that has basically one adjustment and you simply latch it in place.",

Although the gate says a max length of 38.5, my doorway opening is about 39.5 without the baseboard and I had no issues fitting this gate and tightening the screws (though I might have pushed it to its limits but it is still a snug fit).

Bars are close enough that he can't slip through. Sturdy construction, so he can't slam against it, and you can't accidentally knock it out of place. Easy enough to open and close for most adults (yep, most... no, I won't tell you who struggles, but it was funny... and there is no reason they should have... unintended intelligence test of sorts).",

      "text": "We discovered that our antique home has asymmetric door frames when we tried to use cheaper pressure gates. This one allowed us to adjust each of the 4 pressure points individually, so the gate can be fit to the unique shape of each doorway. It took a minute (or 5) to figure out how to actually open the door once installed, but now our 7 year old can pass through without a problem. He is happy our 9 month twins can't get into his room and toys. The gate door can be locked open, so it isn't a fire hazard at night.",

That is not the case for this one. I'm 8 months pregnant and can walk through this gate carrying groceries without any problems. I especially like that it can open both directions, and can lock into an open position if you open it all the way. But it still closes automatically if you don't push it far enough to lock it. Overall, it's a great gate. If I ever need a second one, I will definitely buy another of these.",

The pull back & lift up motion to open the door is a little stiff right now, but I think it will get easier with more use. I love the locking mechanism for the door. Also, when I swing one way it stays open, and the other way auto-shuts it. I appreciate the options there!",

We actually caught our friend's 4-year-old swinging from the gate and it didn't move, bend, etc. Opening is easy with one hand and the gate swings both ways, which is a nice touch.

The pressure-mounting just isn't secure enough to hold up to a child pulling on it.

      "text": "We have a puppy that will ravage just about anything that it can get to (just typical puppy). I bought two of these gates to block access to rooms we don't want her to get into. These gates are pretty easy to install and seem to be very sturdy. I like the stay open or swing closed features. It is also just about the right height to discourage jumping (at least while she is a puppy). All the bars are vertical and there are no horizontal pieces which makes them impossible to climb. Very glad to have found these.",
