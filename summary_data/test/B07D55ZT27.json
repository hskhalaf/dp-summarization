They are lined all through with cozy fake fur. But what us surprised, was the built-in ice-cleats on the bottom back of the shoe. I must say, the most genius idea ever. Living in AK and having icey roads all through the winter, this is the best feature ever. Wish they would make these for adults as well. My daughter wants the same boots now too.",

Keeps him steady on ice and I dont wory about him falling. The cleat is gental enough for my wood and tile floors too....no marks and he has hardly taken them off except to dry the past 4 months. They keep his feet warm and dry. Best boots we've ever purchased",

Also, the fur goes all the way inside to the toe, so it might be good to size up half a size. I would recommend this product and I didn't receive a discount for my review.",

It could do some damage if the stepped on another kids foot or hand while playing in the snow... but it's also great for walking on ice. Very happy with these! Fit as expected!

The only thing I was disappointed with, was that they didn't have the ice picks like the other customers received... They don't include that part in the description, probably because not all colors have them. Bummer. But, on the plus side, they have some terrific tread on the bottom! Very happy with these.

Really different. He really liked that. I initially bought the wrong size and that was my error. I ordered the right size and it fit perfectly.",
