I was skeptical about trying this model because I don\u2019t like the hub. Setup was not as easy as setting up a 350 but I gained the ability to control my PS4 and was able to download the app on my phone that controls everything. I still don\u2019t like the hub but everything works well once set up. Will have to see how long the buttons last.",

I have lost confidence in Logitech as a company and cannot recommend their products \u2014 certainly not their Harmony Remotes \u2014 any longer.",

I have had very good experiences with this system so far. It was fairly easy to program, but it takes time to get it right. The bottom line; I would buy this again in a minute because it makes the A/V system so easy to operate.",
