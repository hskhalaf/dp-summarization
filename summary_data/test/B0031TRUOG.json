I stopped taking them for about a week during which all of the above symptoms completely went away. Then I took one last night just to make sure it was indeed the Cortisol Manager making me have those symptoms. Oh boy. Today I have a pounding headache, increased heart rate, and EXTREME agitation, anxiety, and depression, along with \"brain fog\" and exhaustion. Bad, bad, bad.",

Nothing seemed to turn off my over-processing until I tried the Cortisol Manager. What a difference. I'm no longer waking up and staring at the ceiling. And combined with an occasional melatonin, I'm falling asleep much earlier in the evening. As a result, I'm much more productive during the day.",
