The flame \u201cnubs\u201d with 90-degree edges make it hard to clean them completely by hand quickly, but frankly, that's no big deal. However, I just burned myself on 450F oven racks with these on. Why? Because the silicon tore at the base of the thumb and the rest of the glove, and you don't realize that until it's too late. The kids got a kick out of my colorful language, though, so silver lining I guess. Sadly moving from a strongly recommend to recommend if you replace them annually.",

The other problem is that they are tight on your hands and difficult to get off. This is especially a problem when the gloves are greasy from handling food because the outside gets very slippery and they are almost impossible to remove. I never use these anymore because they are not effective at all. I would look to buy something else.",

I have pretty big hands and they fit me snug and nice, but were a bit large for my wife. On the plus side for her, it's easier to get her hands in and out of these quickly, where I have to work at it a bit.",

The same is true when working with cast iron pans over an outdoor wood fire - the heat begins to really start roasting hands. An inner fabric liner would help a lot.",

That won't happen with these gloves), and I could then handle the meat safely for slicing and serving. Because of the make-up of the gloves, I wasn't worried about contaminating the meat with chemicals. Clean up was easy, but a bit of glazed BBQ sauce was slightly difficult to get out of the grippers. Next time, I'll use a soft brush, if necessary.",

The size and fit is a little odd. I normally wear med to large winter gloves. Originally bought the large/XL but I was swimming in them. I did like the longer sleeve length but was concerned about handling food and the large size slipping. These are 'fits most' but are almost tight. However, I feel handling food is a little easier.",

They seem like a good quality product but due to the fit, I marked them down a star.",

When lifting a hot item, such as a roasted turkey, they function well. My only reservation is their grip after handling something like a turkey. When grease or oil from food gets on the gloves, it is a bit difficult to hold a boning or carving knife securely. Washing the gloves frequently while carving helps.",
