I have been overly cautious and quite frankly OCD about cleanliness and inspecting for bed bugs my entire life. Can't believe this has happened and this is the only thing I can think of that could have brought them into my home.",

You would think that a \"new\" product would not have a huge hole. If you look at the pictures, it's really hard to tell if there is a hole / rip because everything is white, so be sure to check your blanket carefully.

      "text": "I like this duvet. It is the first one I have ever gotten so I don't have anything to compare. But it is durable. It is easy for me to keep clean because I got a cover for it. It is not really light weight though. Maybe compared to others it is but it is really hot at night and I sleep with a fan and at times crack my bedroom window at night in the winter. I don't like being hot. I still like the look of it on my bed though; I just have to kick it off during the night. My dog burrows under it at night; she loves the warmth it provides her old tired bones.",

      "text": "I recently traded in my heavy-weight tog duvet from Ireland for the Equinox comforter. When the Equinox comforter arrived I was concerned - it was thinish and lightweight, especially when compared to my dependable heavy-weight tog duvet. But I figured I'd give it a go and see how it went and I was really surprised - although it is thinner, it was quite warm nonetheless. It's below freezing right now in NYC and my heat is only \"okay\" but this mattress felt totally sufficient. It's not super warm, its not cold, its the proverbial \"just right.\" Honestly I think it was a steal at just $30.",

It now has a large hole in the bottom of the comforter and lost a bunch of the stuffing too. It's too bad because I really liked this comforter for it's comfort, size, and warmth.",

It's very comfortable and has just the right degree of \"drape\" so that it isn't totally mushy -- it retains enough shape to cover you the way a comforter should -- without being stiff in any way. Highly recommend!",

This blanket (the one I am actually reviewing) is super soft but it is way warmer than we like it to be. I realized after I had washed it and it came vaccum packed in a small box.
