      "text": "Was very excited about receiving my new pair of Mephisto Shark sandals. I\u2019ve had a pair for 15 years and had them refurbished at Mephisto twice. It was time to retire the old favorites. Unfortunately when the new pair arrived I was disappointed to find the front Velcro straps to be different than my original pair. The front (over toes) strap is too short to close!! I\u2019m hoping this is an unusual defect, and will contact Mephisto to see if they changed the length of the front strap. As compared to my original pair it is inches shorter! You would need a very narrow foot to fasten the strap.",

      "text": "I've had a pair of the original Mephisto sandals since 2001 - purchased in Paris. While a bit on the heavy side, they fit well and lasted until this year when they experienced rubber fatigue. They were adjustable with velcro strips across the toe, arch and heel area. Bought a pair of All Rounder sandals and they were like the original Mephisto except made in Vietnam rather than Strasbourg and synthetic and leather rather than all leather. The present Mephistos came up on Amazon at a good price so I ordered them as they are all leather. Only adjustable at the toe and arch and not the heel - makes them too big.",

They used to make the women\u2019s version, for some reason they discontinued them. Fortunately, for me, the men\u2019s size 6 works perfectly! I have not been able to find a sandal that I can comfortably wear with/without socks. True, they are not all that attractive but who cares they are sooo comfortable. Great to wear walking, shopping or any other activity. They are pricey and they are well worth the money.",
