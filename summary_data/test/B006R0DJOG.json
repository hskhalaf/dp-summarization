      "text": "I have wanted to purchase a Mah Jong set for a while because my grandmother loves to play. I am by no means a Mah Jong expert, but I already love this set! The tiles are sturdy and very well made. I\u2019ve included pictures that hopefully help show how big they are. The characters are etched into the tile, so no having to worry about the ink rubbing off. Like other reviews mentioned, the case isn\u2019t super sturdy but I also don\u2019t plan on going halfway across the country with this Mah Jong set anyways, so who cares? It\u2019s perfect for storage purposes and for keeping all of the tiles organized. Can\u2019t wait to start playing with this set!",

      "text": "Really a beautiful set, especially for the money. However, according to my sources, this is not a \"Professional\" set. The tiles are sized for an automatic mahjong table. The tiles in a professional set are a little bit bigger than this. Again, this is from my Cantonese mahjong addict friends, so the term \"professional\" is probably loosely interpreted. Having said that, any mahjong player will be delighted with the weight, texture and detail of these tiles.",

The case is also well constructed and will protect the tiles for a long time. One of the best online purchases.",

The size of the tiles are not too small or too big. Considering the price, I think this is a good deal.",

The set itself is great. The pieces are not standard mahjong sized, but doesn't diminish gameplay. The book provided has some weird pictures for the dragon set. I've never seen the dragon set of tiles look like that, so you might have to print out your own handy guide to keep with the tiles.",

I don\u2019t like the pieces we got because they have all Chinese symbols and no English markings or numbers. Makes it very hard to play with. Also these don\u2019t come with solitaire rules. Not hard to find them on the internet, but you do want to have templates. While the set is nice and they are worth the money, I would not buy them again because they are simply not what I thought I was buying. I gifted these or I would return them.",
