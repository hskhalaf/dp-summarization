It's thick and silky. His blood tests are all good, too. I'm glad we started him on it and we intend to continue it. I don't know if another brand of fish oil would work just as well, but this one has given us amazing results.",

So, if you are seeking additional OA management, these should work. Further, my dog enjoys the flavor enough that we can simply use them as treats. So giving the capsules is not a problem.

I puncture the pill and squeeze out the oil very easily without any mess and it doesn't smell strong. She eats it up without hesitation.
