I had an earlier set from another company - those did not keep fingers warm, they excelled at keeping my palms warm, but fingers froze. These do not have that problem. The heating elements are where they should be: covering the back of the hand, the fingers and thumb. The three-level heating works excellently and the buttons regulating the heat level can be pushed with the gloves on. Having the thumb and index finger separate from the mitten section works very well. The exterior of the glove is well made with leather. Highly recommend these.",

Used it on the medium level and it lasted 3 hours so an additional pack of batteries (or two) would be essential. Very happy with this purchase!",

My fingers are thin so the mitts really don't wrap to my hand. The mittens are comfortable, keep my hands dry,and flex just enough. I would flex my fingers on the lift to reach the heating elements on the back of the fingers. Thumb isn't as toasty as I hoped, but it's sooo much better than it was. The batteries kept charged and working both days. For about half the price of some other heated gloves/mittens these are a winner.",

The orange is more of a red/orange and they are a bit like lobster hands but i like having my index free of the mitten. I wish the cuff was more of a gauntlet but its elastic and can fit iver or under my jacket. Glad i bought these gloves for those cold morning rides",
