So far I used the new TravelPro Crew 11 on a single trip. It is easy to roll in the airport, hotel, in the plane, and outside. Virtually effortless. What's really good is that my suit arrived almost without wrinkles after a 3.5 hour flight and a 40 min Uber ride. The suitcase is very lightweight. It easily fits overhead (on American Airlines). It looks good as well. Haven't used the USB feature yet, but it's pretty cool to have it. A great purchase and a great job, TravelPro!",

Particularly liked that the telescopic handle feels sturdy and doesn't wobble around. Zippers are of high quality. Got mine in the dark brown color and it looks sharp.
