This is a collapsible bucket. Its not going to be rigid when standing. However I find it light weight and reasonable for my uses. Oh ya I also used it as an ice chest for beer. I am very happy with it so far.",

      "text": "Good bucket, seems well-built and sturdy. Expands and collapses easily. I filled it up and let it sit outside for a couple of hours and it did leak a bit from the seam, maybe one or two tablespoons worth of water, so it's not completely watertight. If not for the minor seepage I'd give it five stars. But it should work well for what I purchased it for.",

      "text": "This is my second product of which both seem to have been made the same way. I've found the handle tends to pop out of the top ring/frame of the bucket. Once out it won't really hold again even if you push it back in. But I like the collapsible bucket so I create my own handle by pushing a wire all the way through the hole for the handle and twisting it back on itself above. That holds fine.",
