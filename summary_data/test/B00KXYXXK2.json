I live in an apartment from the 40's and the walls are made out of plaster and typically Bluetooth devices have a hard time getting the signal through but as far as I can tell this receiver does a good job of relaying sound to my speakers in an unbroken manner.",

Unfortunately, it has no Bluetooth to connect with modern streaming technology. Now with this $20 item I am able to connect to Amazon Music via an Amazon Dot. And WOW!. I am back into modern times. Everything connected very easily with no problems. Not the greatest sound fidelity using the RCA cable but at least I have access to streaming without the need for a new receiver. Easily a 5 Star product for its price, performance and simplicity.",

But the connection is annoyingly unreliable, cutting out frequently. Range is not the issue, as both receiver and iPhone are in the same room, perhaps 10 feet apart. I placed the phone within a foot of the receiver and it still cut out. This same iPhone works beautifully and reliably with my Rocketfish portable speaker, so the Bluetooth on the phone itself is not the problem. I'm too late to return it, and, frankly, $22 is not a great loss, but I recommend you do not throw your good money after my bad for this product.",

The Bluetooth pairs with my Peloton bike and will work for somewhere between 2 and 6 minutes. Then it makes the sound of powering off and loses the pairing, every time. And at a distance of about 10'. I cannot comment on whether this issue is isolated to Peloton devices, but if you are looking at this unit for a Peloton bike, choose a different product. I wanted to like this product. I guess it's too good to be true? The bluetooth loses connection doesn't maintain a connection and sometimes cannot connect at all.

The bluetooth connects with no issues and I can keep my phone in the backyard while streaming Pandora. The bluetooth receiver is connected to my stereo receiver in my garage and has to go through two walls one being brick. My kids also use this while in the backyard without issues.",

      "text": "I bought mainly for music streaming. It works as advertised and sets up easily but doesn't work as expected. I didn't anticipate this unit to have such low output current. For all my other attached devices the volume setting on my AV receiver might be '-25.' For the same volume level I need to set my amp to about '-5.' Unaware, I nearly blew out my speakers when I changed sources. I dinged this unit on sound quality but the fidelity seems OK. Output current is just too low for my mid level AV receiver.",

The sounds quality is pretty good, although not as good when I pair my phone through Google Chrome. I still need to tinker with the EQ. One of the things I am not sure about it is if it can be plugged in and then recharged as the power drains rather than pulling it out on the audio side to recharge as required. I also appreciate the follow-up email that Karen (from Etekcity) sent. IT may be just standard CRM but I did appreciate it!",
