While trying to lift the glass screen from the adhesive behind it the screen cracked and sent a spray of powder glass shooting toward my face. I was wearing eye protection, but still got some of the pulverized glass in my right eye. I am so glad I had this to clean out my eye. It is so easy to use you can figure it out without even being able to see it! Seriously... this product may have saved my vision.",

What I do know is the particular pair I received doesn't expire until 2020, so it has a rather long life ahead of it. Other companies sell the same thing but only give it a year or two until it \"expires\". It is a bit pricey though, but I guess it has something to do with the bottle more than the solution.",
