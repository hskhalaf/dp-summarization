I tried different plugs in n my home, I read the directions, and its just \"dead on arrival.\" I'm sorry, but is it so hard to have some quality control standards in China?!? Their reputation for crappy JUNK didn't develop for no reason!!",

That one finally died, it did last 3 years, so I bought this one. Wow what an improvement. This really does the job. Under normal usage you never overwhelm the motor. It just keeps grinding. I'm a big guy with big feet and dont get to the pedicurist nearly often enough so my calluses are pretty heavy, and this is doing a great job. I wont post pics because eww,,, but they are similar to other pictures shown :) 5 stars, this is exactly what I wanted.",

You don\u2019t need to press hard to get results. I pay for monthly pedi\u2019s but still get dry cracked heels in between appointments. No worries now, 5-6 minutes once a week and my feet and fingers are smooth and soft again. I like to follow this up by applying Bag Balm and wearing socks overnight to help moisturize my skin. Would have been nice to get at least 1 refill with this kit but hoping the one included will last for awhile.",

It seemed to be the right choice because there is not loss of power that others have stated from the battery version. When it arrived my whole family decided to give it a shot and it does work great. Dead skin comes off easily leaving your feet very smooth. If you clean the rollers they will last a good while before replacing them.",
