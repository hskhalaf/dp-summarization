The problem is that if you attach the base plate first, the axle is likely to be stuck. I had to disassemble base plate and put axle first. also...if there was no instruction, if you put the bolts in to out, there is a chance that nuts touch the tire.",

I will say, the rating for the 2 wheel configuration is only 300 lbs, so I can't recommend you do the same, but I will say that it did work for me.",
