This shoe, for me, offer that flat feeling with the added cushion. I like the barefoot feeling, which this doesn't have but I really like them!!

The survey also asks if they provide good arch support- well that's not what they are for anyways; so the fact that I answered \"no\", should not be a negative. If you are looking for a shoe with arch support, then these types of shoes are probably not for you.",

I can't wait to wear them on a hike and see how they work out in that kind of activity.",

Also, I saw someone complain about the width in the toe box, but I watched a review on YouTube and that was done purposefully for squatting purposes etc. I suggest looking into their reasoning before returning them.",

So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them.
