Cucumber mask: gets kinda tight as it dries. Smells lightly like cucumbers, made my face feel refreshed and cool in this heat! Note: this is a peel-off mask! Dead sea mask: gorgeous blue! Haha made my face feel clean, declogged! Avocado oatmeal: oohh one of my favorites! Got kinda tight as it dried. Odd smell, wasn't bad though. My face felt sooooo clean and healthy after I washed this off!",

And the price is nice as well. I like this variety pack because you can choose from a classic mud mask, a charcoal scrub, or a refreshing cucumber peel. All are freshly scented and I've had no skin reactions. I definitely recommend Freeman for anyone looking for a decent, basic mask at a great price.",
