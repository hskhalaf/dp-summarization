      "text": "Bought this for the wife a bit after her injurying a ligament in her left ankle. With the boot brace and sports tape not doing much for comfort, this was my next idea. No regrets, the day didn't even reach the 2nd hour and she was showing almost immediate comfort and mobility. Not a fix all, but definitely a useful tool in recovery. I'll be hanging on to this bad boy for a long time.",

The brace is very well constructed. I've used the cheaper brands over the years. They are poorly constructed, uncomfortable, plus they provide inadequate support! My wife says Kunto ankle braces give her ankle \"a little hug!\" Nice!",

It is a bit more expensive than some of the others I looked at, but for me it is worth it",
