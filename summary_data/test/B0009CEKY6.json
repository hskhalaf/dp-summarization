The one issue I have is it really only lasts about two years and then it is done. This is the third one I have had in about 6 years. But it is priced I guess to be replaced every so many years. We use the water from this for our Capresso coffee machine and for drinking. We live in an area that has very hard water and it tastes bad. This does improve the taste quite a bit.",

We do have hard water, and this provides clean filtered water for cooking and drinking. The replacement filters last for a couple of months and are a better value if you buy them on Amazon. We have never found them for less at the store. Highly Recommend this Product.",

Our four-year-old previous Pure filter holder was plastic, too, but several grades above this tin foil thingie. But it works, and the filters give you clean, good tasting water. Just don't bang anything into the holder. Maybe this will help in your deciding. Drink up!",
