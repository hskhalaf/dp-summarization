      "text": "I have always been the #1 fan of footjoy golf shoes over the years. They usually make great products. These shoes however are ankle killers. The elevated ankle support on the left shoe is covered with dried blood as it has rubbed the skin off in that area. As I have worn them a few times I doubt a return is possible. Looks like they are going on the shelf or in the trash. Real bummer!!",
