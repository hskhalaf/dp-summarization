      "text": "My cat likes these a lot, but I don't like that all of the pieces are different sizes. Some are too big for him, so I have to break them into smaller pieces, but because they are freeze-dried they tend to crumble and make a mess. Still, Rupurrt does enjoy them. I wish all of the pieces could be a consistent size, but I suppose it's just the nature of freeze-dried fish.",
