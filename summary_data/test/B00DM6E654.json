As a net-book for browsing and writing while travelling it would work great, but then again there are better options at this price.",

Finally carrying my laptop to and from work does not ruin my shoulder; this is a perfect laptop for a commuter/ regular traveler.

Auto update kicks in.98 updates to install. Then on restart it fails and hangs on blue screen now. Can't even start in safe mode.",

      "text": "I bought this laptop as a replacement for my Dell Inspiron which lasted 10 years and because I was moving to Canada indefinitely. Within 10 days of purchase the laptop will not turn on and is permanently stuck in 'sleep' mode. Now I am abroad trying to start a new life with this piece of junk laptop and potentially a long wait to get this repaired. I urge you not to buy this. Invest in an iMac. This kinda stuff shouldn't happen to a brand new laptop and I am extremely angry and upset at Samsung.",
