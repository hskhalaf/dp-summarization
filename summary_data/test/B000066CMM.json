Here are some tips that will help you: Takes a very long time to do and results are mixed than what I expected. Softer rocks polish better. Find a nice quit place outside when you do this, like a garage. Use a little WD40 on rolling area to quiet it down. Do not spray on belt only rolling areas. If you do belt will slip.If not it squeaks and over heats. If you prolong polishing times make sure you place a fan on the motor in order to protect it from over heating.",
