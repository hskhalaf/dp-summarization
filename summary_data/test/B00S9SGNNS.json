ASUS and their partner TrendMicro decided to require that you provide them with personal information in order to use specific features(AIProtection: Network Protection - Web/App parental controls, Adapative QoS and Traffic Analysis). If you opt out of providing them with personal information the features are automatically disabled. This is a very shady business practice bordering on bait and switch. I've tried reaching out to them via support channels. The response was to provide me a link to TrendMicro's policy and say tell me \"sorry it's policy. there's nothing we can do.\"",

The latest update does not allow flashing alternate firmware, so beware those that want DD-WRT, Asus Marlin, or Tomato. I had hoped to install custom firmware and use this as my router, but the lack of custom updates leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I'll be replacing my current router with one advertised to support open source firmware. That said, this router works wonderfully, and has great coverage.",

Blocking late night access was possible (this router, and previous one) but only by the hour. It allows you to set and save hours for particular MAC addresses, but then they are immediately lost. Going back in to review them and nothing is retained. I also could not get a new Sono wireless speaker to connect, until setting the bands to Auto, allowing the router to manage who got 2.4 vs. 5.0GHz. Very frustrating as I'm technology literate and have used an earlier model with similar firmware.",
