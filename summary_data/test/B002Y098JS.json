    "title": "Riedel VINUM Bordeaux/Merlot/Cabernet Wine Glasses, Pay for 6 get 8 -",
    "description": "The Cabernet glass is perfect for full-bodied, complex red wines that are high in tannin. The generous size of this glass allows the bouquet to develop fully, and smooths out the rough edges. It emphasises the fruit, playing down the bitter qualities of the tannin, and allows wines to achieve balance. This pack offers eight Vinum Cabernet/Merlot glasses from RIEDEL's Vinum series for the price of six. Machine-made and dishwasher safe.",
