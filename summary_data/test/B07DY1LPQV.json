      "text": "I bought 5 Pomsies anticipating the kids wanting them for Christmas. They are cute and cozy, but not quite as soft as I expected. I doubt that will deter the kids' enjoyment. I see these as an upgrade to last year's interactive hit: Fingerlings. (Don't get me wrong. I've bought more fingerlings this year, too) I think, however, that these will appeal a little more to the little girls and boys who prefer to touch and play with soft toys. Fingerlings are cute, but they are not cuddly. The Pomsies are cute and cuddly. I am excited for the kids to open them.",

And though she enjoys exploring its different emotions with the changing nose color and all that, there are just too many with too much detail. No one could possibly remember them all so you constantly have to refer back to the manual that comes with it. That's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. It's really inexpensive and perfect for gifting to kids in my daughter's class for whom we want to get a birthday present but don't want to spend a ton of money on because...well...there are 20 other kids in her class. That's a lot of presents \ud83d\ude09",
