You have to trim the ice off the round cube. Nothing like the picture. If you like to spend 10 minutes working on the cubes with your hands you might be able to get a cube like the picture. I highly doubt it. Additional the ice is sharp to handle while trying to trim. I would not buy this item. I tried multiple times as well.",

I found when placed directly into a beverage, the balls become nearly transparent. Not quite as good as the photo here shows, but quite nice. I even made a few trays in advance so I would have enough ice balls to share with guests. One thing to expect is that the balls do commonly split in half along the seam line. Not every time, but I lose some out of every batch to this problem.",

You will most likely have to break off a little bit of flashing to make them look neat. All in all, these are really good ice cubes even if they don't look the prettiest.",
