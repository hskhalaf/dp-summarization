He loved stacking them and also loved the window feature once I assembled it for him. Was also fond of the little doggie in there and the man. He kept referrin to the man as \"dada\". It was funny.

With 65 pieces there are plenty of pieces without being overwhelming. It is a toy you can feel comfortable letting kids play with without fear. Best part is that it comes in its own storage container so little ones can put away the pieces (or mini creations) into the box without it being all over the floor or table.
