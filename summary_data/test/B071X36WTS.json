    "description": "Offering class-leading performance at a great value, the Pflueger President Spinning Fishing Reel delivers the extreme durability and smooth drag that seasoned anglers demand. This fishing reel ensures smooth operation with nine stainless steel ball bearings plus an instant anti-reverse bearing that provides improved crank control. From the aircraft-grade aluminum handle to the graphite body and rotor, the President Spinning Reel is designed for years of use. The graphite construction provides extreme responsiveness without compromising rigidity, creating a highly durable reel that doesn't flex or give out under extreme pressure. You'll also enjoy exceptional pulling power thanks to the reel's multi-disc drag system, which uses stainless steel and oiled felt washers to produce smooth yet forceful drag. A braid-ready aluminum spool, precise-operating 10-bearing system, and a soft-touch grip round out this reliable spinning fishing reel.",
