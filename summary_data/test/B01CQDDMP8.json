      "text": "Super cute. My 2 year old loves Minnie Mouse. The height is good for her and would be for a 3 year old. I would NOT buy this if the intention is a 4 year old or older. We had the same issue as other people about the sound only working for a few moments. It didn't seem right to us. If you take the handheld piece out and check out the back, there's a switch with the choices of \"try me\", \"on\" and \"off\". It comes factory preset to off and if you turn it to \"on\" the vacuum will continue to sound as long as you're pushing it around.",

The plastic seems durable enough (not brittle like the more expensive Dyson play vac we used to have that constantly broke) and I actually like that the vacuum only makes noise when you roll it across the floor or hold down the power button constantly because it helps prolong the battery life (make sure you switch from \"try me\" mode to \"on\" mode). It is a perfect height for a 1.5-5 year old, maybe even older. Noise is not too obnoxious, and kids seem to love it.",
