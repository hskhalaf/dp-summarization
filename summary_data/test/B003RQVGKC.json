I love the flip top for easy cleaning, the locking feature ensures that the lid doesn't slip off, the opening is high enough that minimal litter escapes, and the box is HUGE. My cat loves having all the room, and I've noticed he uses more of the box than he used his last one (he would only potty near the opening because it was too small for him). My roommate's cat completely abandoned his litter box in favor of this one as well. I would definitely recommend this litter box, and will be purchasing another in the future!",

There was a bit of the learning curve with the swinging door, but it was fine since you can fold it up or remove it altogether.

And the design for easy cleaning is awesome!! No more taking off the whole lid!!! And did I mention it\u2019s huge?! It\u2019s large enough for my cats to have enough space height & lengthwise to so there businesses inside the cat litter box! If I ever need another one I will absolutely order this again. Highly recommended!",

It is very easy to clean, as the top hatch connects to the door and flips up. Also, my cat figured out how the door worked fairly quickly. (Even though I'm sure she only has one brain cell. Lol!) Happy with this purchase. I also use this litter:  It's 52 pounds of quality cat litter for only ~$12. (I reccomend buying new from the Other Sellers page.)",

I would\u2019ve preferred it to work properly and have all its parts but it well. At least the bottom isn\u2019t cracked or something, then I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do lol.",

The only issue I had was the front door would rub against the lower part of the hood and I had to trim it off so that the door swung open more freely. It left a small gap at the bottom of the door but I am fine with that and will probably glue a rubber strip on the door if odor seeps out but, I doubt I will have that issue.",

It had trouble staying on because of poor adhesive and when it did our cat batted it off into the litter. Too tempting of a play target. They could have placed a charcoal filter vent at the top and solved this issue. Lesson learned. If you and kitty prefer an enclosed box spend a few more dollars and get an anti-microbial treated surface and a vented charcoal filter.",
