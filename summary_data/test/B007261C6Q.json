      "text": "I shoot a great deal of landscape photography and bought this to use with my new NX3000, which has a kit lens of 16-55mm. I think this lens was worth purchasing compared to the kit lens though, even though it's not any wider than what the kit offers. The quality seems a little better, it's a little smaller (feeling balanced on the camera), and the ability to use it in low light (including indoors and for street photography) is a big plus. I liked it enough that I almost immediately ordered the 30mm pancake, and don't see myself using the kit lens much if ever again.",

It's lightweight and smaller size make it a nice overall lens. One of my favorite lenses and I would recommend unless you need really wide angle. The 10mm will fisheye, the 12-24mm is ultra wide, this 16mm is wide angle, not ultra wide as Samsung claims.",

I saw some reports of slightly less sharp edges with this lens, which I was able to see a little bit in some test shots, but with normal photos of real subjects, I haven't found it to be an issue. The sharpness is still pretty high even on the edges. Note that now that the 16-50mm power zoom lens is available, that lens is worth considering as an alternative to this lens, since it has OS and comparable aperture at 16mm (3.5 vs. 2.8). I don't own that one so I can't compare directly.",
