The RMS unit works perfectly every time. It will break eventually (I'm on my second one) with a crack from the edge of the chute to one of the rope holes, but it's cheap enough so that a replacement can be had quickly from Amazon. \"Simple is the essence of good design\" - Thomas Alva Edison",

I doubt many people have round feet, but I can see how a round portion helps in the later stages of pulling on the sock. My view is that it works OK for me, but would be better for someone with smaller feet.",

This device is lightweight and the ropes help her to easily do the task by herself, which is important as being independent as possible is empowering when older people start losing abilities.",

Move slowly!! The sock/helper doesn\u2019t stay securely on once the foot is in and the sock is being pulled up. The heel can come undone. The sock will still pile around the heel area because the helper runs off mid placement. Handles are sized comfortably. Compact.",
