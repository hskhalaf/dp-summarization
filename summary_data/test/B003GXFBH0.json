The light is good. Lit up the trees and houses very well at 100yds. I like the C battery POWER as opposed to a rechargable you cannot replace. I have had bad experiances with rechargable products with non replaceable battery and do not trust them. What I do not understand is why there is a 550 lumens sticker on the Waypoint box covering 210 lumens. Can anyone give me the answer? What is it 210 or 550 lumens?",

This thing blows away spotlights I've had in the past and it's totally worth the cost. It was $80 at Bass Pro and more than $100 a couple other places. I use it for inspecting homes but I can see many other practical uses.",

Very Good, high quality, rugged, construction ( i haven't tested the water resistance but it has a gasket seal secured by a screw). Haven't used this spot light enough to comment on battery life nor have I used it with the included car based cigarette-lighter-chord. One note: the external DC cable is only compatible with a cigarette-lighter; However, I assume it will work with an 120/240 V A/C plugin converter / adapter similar to: 110V-240V AC to 12V DC Power Adapter Converter US / Universal AC-DC Power Socket Adapter Converter - Use Car Chargers... found on Amazon",
