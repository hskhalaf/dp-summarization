      "text": "Great product for helping elementary and middle school students understand fractions, decimals, and percents. Especially good for helping understanding of the relation between multiple fractions (1/3 and 2/6 for example). Great for kids who are hands-on or visual learners. I used it recently with my sixth grade students in a lesson on adding fractions with different denominators and it really helped them to be able to see the relative sizes of the fractions. Great tool. My one complaint is that the set doesn\u2019t come with a base. Since the blocks are all interlocking ;kind of like LEGO\u2019s) it would really help if there was a base that you could put different towers into so you could easily compare the heights.",

A perfect visual and tactile representation of fractions and decimals - easy to compare with each other and get a better grasp on a too-often difficult to understand concept. The only thing I would add to the 1 column: 1 represented as a fraction (1/1). This is important so students understand that even whole numbers can be written in fraction form for when they move into mixed numbers and further, into making whole numbers into fractions to solve more complicated arithmetic. Not a deal breaker though! Easy enough just to write it on there with a sharpie. Would definitely purchase again.",
