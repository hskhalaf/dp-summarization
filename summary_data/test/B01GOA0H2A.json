However, I did kinda wait until the very last possible minute to order the damn thing so I can't really talk that booty chatter. I payed for faster shipping and it was worth it. Definitely worth the price and the quality is on par with far more expensive sweaters than this one. The double sided graphics sealed the deal for me. Merry Christmas",
