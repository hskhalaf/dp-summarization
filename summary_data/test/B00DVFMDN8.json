When I first saw how thin these units are, I bet the giftee that within 6 months (1) he'd bend and break it, or (2) it's so cool looking that it would be stolen. I lost the bet.

The super-fast start-up time is especially nice, considering how often I have to shut down or re-start the computer in order to get the touchpad to work properly. Others have already complained about the touchpad drivers, so I won't dwell on it, but this does reflect poorly on Samsung. I've been in touch with tech support, and they weren't especially helpful. They said that they updated some drivers, but the problem persists. Inexcusable in a laptop that costs this much.",

Even my 7-year old ThinkPad is now quieter than this. Simply unacceptable for a laptop at such a premium price.",
