      "text": "I love this pole chainsaw. Take my advice and wear grippy gloves when using it. You will be glad you did. Don't expect this saw to go zipping through stuff at high speed. It is made for more power than speed. That means the saw chain moves slower through the cut. Turns out that is a good thing because it affords more control. Since you are essentially using the weight of the saw instead of leverage to cut the slower speed is safer. I would recommend this pole chainsaw to anyone for tree trimming.",

I used the worx 6.0 AH MAX Lithium 20 volt battery and got 4 1/2 hours of run time out of it which was more than enough to get each job done. The pole is very easy to attach and gives you a great deal of reach when needed. It's a great light-duty low maintenance chainsaw",

Pros - - Battery can be leveraged across devices - long pole extension so don\u2019t have to worry about gas and use this for small branch jobs without ladder - battery usually lasts for 30 min on other devices but couldn\u2019t get this working for 30 min without chain falling off.",

The chain would periodically fall off, but after getting used to the saw and learning how to properly cut, it happened much less. I\u2019m satisfied and it is a nice addition to my lawn tools.",
