      "text": "I originally purchased this thermostat about 4-1/2 years ago, with LUX replacing the original after about one year due to the commonly reported low-battery problem. The current unit is about 3 years old and is now again flashing the low-battery error. While I was able to correct this using the reset procedure described in several other reviews, the reset only held for about 2 weeks before returning to the flashing low-battery state. Clearly, something is not right with these particular LUX models and LUX has apparently decided not to fix the glitch over the last 4 year period of time.",

It has worked fine until a couple of months ago started giving Lo Battery warning. We changed the battery, and a few days later the warning again. I even bought a new set of duracell batteries and again it only \"lasted\" a few days. My husband tested the batteries and they are good. I come to read the comments and find other customers with same issue, but at least they got 2.5 years without the problem, for me is more like 1.5 if you count when the problem started. It should have lasted longer.",

One issue - which at this point is completely typical with Amazon and it's hidden data etc. - is that I thought I was buying a TX500ue, but it's just a TX500u. Luckily it was still compatible with our heater. I'm just glad it didn't turn out to be half the size I expected, which is my common Amazon experience!",

The TX700U allows 7 different programs as well as the option to use one program for M-F and one program for S-S - and only costs a few dollars more. If you have any need for a \"programmable\" thermostat, it is like you need more than two different programs for the entire week, so the TX700U is the way to go. I have both now. They are easy to install and program - mine runs a pellet stove and I love it. The same (included) backplate works for both.",
