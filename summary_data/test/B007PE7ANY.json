This is a high temperature process to bring oil out of rapeseed, and then they called it Canola, I think that is marketing. Is it good for you? I donno, I called the company on this and they listened but nothing was changed, but it is tasty.",

I'm so glad I did. I think they are delicious and they are, for the most part, a guilt-free snack option for me that completely satisfying any craving I have for sweets. Much better than eating an actual candy bar. I will definitely buy these again.",
