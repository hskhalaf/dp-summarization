Get wet bags that are just ONE layer of waterproof material--the cloth is nice but not worth the hassle and additional headache to what is already the world's most stressful job (MOMMING)",

I know it\u2019s not waterproof but I\u2019d expect it to keep things dry when in the bag for an hour or two running errands.

Decided to buy a wet bag (rather than the wet/dry option) since I don't use the dry pouch on my other one, and this one was a few dollars cheaper. Was disappointed, however, when this one arrived an it did not have the hanging loop as it does in the photo (purchased the aqua swirl print). I'm sure the bag will perform sufficiently, but would have paid the extra for the wet/dry option had I known this one did not have the loop.",

I actually probably wouldn't have had to purchase this one, but I always washed my first in hot water with the diapers and it lost it's water repellency, but I didn't follow the proper directions, so it was my own fault. We used this bag weekly for dirty cloth diapers, and it lasted two + years, so for the price it was a great deal. Now that the kids are older, we use the bags for wet bathing suits in the summer, or for other soiled items when on the road.",

That is purely a cosmetic problem, however, the zipper, hand and snap are all in perfect working order. The PUL remains in good condition and I do dry it in the dryer. It could stand to be a little larger in size. It holds two days work of diapers, but sometimes we go three days between washes.",
