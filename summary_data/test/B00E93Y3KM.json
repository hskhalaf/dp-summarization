The faucets included for this $1000 model are NOT stainless steel and frequently freeze up after a few pulls of beer. I almost broke the shank trying to get the rap to open. My temperature is set at 38 degrees and if the lines are close to the back of the unit, they freeze, no beer. Even at 38 degrees. Buy good real stainless steel faucets from another vendor. Check your lines and keep them off the back inside part of the unit.",

Cider flows okay at higher psi. Cool novelty but having beer go flat because 50% of the c02 is escaping the beer as foam just doesn't make putting a keg down easy.",

    "description": "Size:2 Faucet| Color:Stainless SteelThe Kegco K309SS-1 Dual Faucet Digital Draft Beer Dispenser has all the features you've come to appreciate from other high quality Kegco models, now with digital temperature controls, fan-forced cooling, and one of the widest available temperature ranges on the market! K309SS-1 Keg Dispensers still have the standard Kegco features that you love, such as a removable easy-to-clean drip tray, a chrome guardrail, easy rolling casters, and a complete direct draw dispense system for dispensing up to two D System domestic kegs at a time. Thanks to the digital temperature controls, you can now see your specific temperature setting and set it easily with the push of a button. This keg beer cooler is designed for freestanding use and has a matte black finish on the sides with an elegant stainless steel door.\n\nFan-Forced cooling gives it one of the coldest temperature ranges of any beer dispenser on the market today and provides even cooling throughout the unit. Temperature can be set as low as 32 degrees for ice cold beer.\n\nThe interior is spacious enough to easily hold any full size keg, including Miller kegs, Coors Kegs and rubber kegs. It can also hold up to two 5 Gallon D System kegs or up to three 5 Gallon Cornelius Ball Lock Home Brew kegs, so you can dispense more than one beer at a time.\n\nThe Deep Chill function on this beer keg refrigerator allows you to quickly cool down a warm beer keg by forcing the compressor to work continuously for 24 hours. When the desired temperature has been reached, just press Deep Chill again to return the unit to normal operation.\n\nWhen you're not using this unit as a kegerator, it is easy to convert it into a regular refrigerator for extra storage. You can space the two included adjustable shelves far enough apart to hold 2-liter bottles or gallon jugs.\n\nEasily move the Kegco K309SS-1 Keg Dispenser to wherever the party's at on it's easy-roll casters, which lock to prevent it from rolling again until you want it to.",
