      "text": "I'm a Jack Black fan. They make useful, high performing products that i really love. This product is both a shampoo and conditioner. Many other shampoos I have tried have both but they do not rinse out well plus they leave an oily residue on my shoulders and back. This shampoo cleans well, conditions my hair so that it has a soft feel without being oily and rinses out better than any 2 in 1 shampoo / conditioner I have tried. Jack Black products are personal favorites - I have a lot and use them all the time. This will be my go-to shampoo as long as I still have hair. Recommended",

      "text": "Jack Black makes good products, albeit expensive products, and this shampoo/conditioner is no exception. I like the option of only using one container to both shampoo and condition, but like I said it is expensive and one other thing....it will sting your eyes like nothing you've experienced. I repeat, do not let this get anywhere near your eyes. Sometimes you cannot help getting a little on your face and possibly your eyes, but trust me, do not make that mistake with this product. The eye stinging and expense are really the only negatives with this product. It smells really clean and leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny.",

He also is concerned with thinning hair and from all the reviews that I read, this was a fantastic choice. I had also looked into \"Monet\" and was told it was a scam, so I went with this. He loves it. He likes the smell, all his scalp issues are gone, and he likes that it's \"for a man\". I tried it one day and I didnt think it was anything special, mainly the smell was \"manly\" and not my thing. It's also a good shampoo if you color your hair, it doesn't fade out coloring.",
