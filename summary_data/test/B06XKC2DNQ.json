I also bought one for similar use when sending music from an Apple MacBook Pro to a PA mixer for intermission muzak. The MacBook appears to equalize its own sound-card to sound good with the internal speakers. (I can't blame Apple for doing that.) Another plus for those using this on locked down machines at work: no need for any installation process the device is recognized on every machine by the standard drivers. Huzzah!",

It sounds great too, no static or anything. You get 3.5mm microphone and audio out jacks, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The only thing I don't like: the red light on it is bright and can NOT be turned off. So I wrapped it with black duct tape, problem solved. I'm not crazy about the \"gamer\" aesthetic but it's behind my desk so I don't see it anyway.",

I've even had my volume on the lowest setting and audio was playing at a medium volume. not too big of an issue but it can't get very quiet. However, the pros outweigh the cons so it gets a full 5 stars. 9/10 - Almost perfect",
