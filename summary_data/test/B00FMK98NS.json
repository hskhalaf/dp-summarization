      "text": "Good product for the price. I bought this to add onto my son's acoustic drum set. It fits on nicely. Since I don't play drums, I wasn't sure about the sound quality, but he likes it. I've learned more now and there are many different cow bells on the market for different sounds. This one is a little more \"tinny\" with a higher tone. If you want a deeper tone, you won't be happy. For us, it works.",

These two items are responsible for countless hours of joy in our home. Everyone needs more cowbell and get it from this Stagg CB305BK 5.5-Inch Cowbell-Black. We leave it near the front door when not in use as to allow anyone entering our home the opportunity to experience its purity in tone. Don't deny yourself any longer the basic affordable goodness this world has to offer. I highly recommend this item.",
