They were some of the best instructions I\u2019ve read for furniture. I especially liked the interior bolts so the screws went in correctly the first time and stayed secure. Also, I really like how the table looks. The wood is the color I wanted and there were no scratches. The packaging was perfect as the pieces were wrapped and arrived without any piece having marks. I would definitely buy from this company again.",

      "text": "We bought this changing table right after our baby was born. The wood looks very nice and it is built nicely. It can hold a lot of diapers (multiple boxes full) and many packs of wipes and have plenty of room for more items. Definetly one of the top purchases we have made for the nursery. Only complaint is the pad is not very thick on top and doesn't come with a cover. We just put a thin baby blanket over and it works just fine.",

      "text": "This changing table has been fine except that the paint is chipping off terribly and I am constantly finding flecks of white paint on my son - not okay. I had seen other reviewers mention that before buying it but figured that they were probably treating it with harsh cleaning chemicals or using it roughly. We have used this changing table gently and it has not stood up to basic use. I'm disappointed and I encourage others to look elsewhere for a changing table.",

The only complaint is that mobiles and music boxes won't clamp on the curved rear, but work great on the perfect straight sides. HIGHLY recommended!",
