I recently had a outbreak of adult hormonal acne. My dermatologist treated me with a retinol product which severely dried out my skin. He said to try this but because of its low price point I didn't think it would work well. I tried about six or seven high-end moisturizers. One cost more than $200, this beat every single one of them. This product works amazingly well and the best value out there as far as I'm concerned.",

Elta MD products are the only products that will hydrate my skin and not cause me to break out. I tried this product on a whim and LOVE it! My skin has significantly better tone and texture, smaller pores, and no breakouts. I wear a lot less makeup and have not had to go in for another laser treatment since trying this product. Sometimes the product alone is enough for a moisturizer, and sometimes I have to layer a thicker moisturizer on top once this one soaks in. Regardless, my skin loves it!",
