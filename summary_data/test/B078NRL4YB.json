Removable print bed surface, larger print volume and improved menus, plus bundled software for those newer to 3d printing. This is a fantastic printer for anyone getting in to 3D printing. I run a small print farm with 16+ printers, and the QIDI printers are fantastic even for my 24/7 volume production. Very clean printing (currently using hatchbox PLA). Customer service has also been great.",

I have a degree in industrial design, and we used much more expensive printers at school; this produces prints that look as good as ones that come off of much more expensive machines. Punching above it's weight class is an understatement. I printed the city image with AIO robotics color changing filament at 190\u00b0, and at .15mm resolution. The snowflake was printed with Yoyi clear PETG at 205\u00b0 at .2mm resolution. So far so good... I have run a dozen or so prints with no stringing (so far). The slicer software included works perfectly. I have had zero issues... Love this printer!",

Always use the glue stick on the build plate. I use the purple disappearing glue stick. TIP: Clean the build plate with spray window cleaner after every few uses. Allow to dry and the build plate is ready for re-use. The build plate & extruder get hot, so supervise kids. We LOVE this printer!!",
