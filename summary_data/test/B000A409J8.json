I rarely read 5 star reviews but I hope someone reads mine. This was good stuff! I'd buy again.",

It gave me copper hair after the first bleach, golden hair after the second bleach, and finally blonde hair after the third bleach. I have short hair so that makes it easy to bleach my own hair evenly. I will buy a 30 volume to see how things will go, but this product is wonderful. Just in case if you're wondering, I waited one to three months in between dyes so that my root looks brown-ish while the overall color is blonde (hence the picture). I personally love that. I just hate a drastic contract of blonde and black hair.",

My only complaint is the size of the bucket definitely mislead me on the amount of powder I had purchased. I was able to do 2 full heads of shoulder length hair BARELY which is still amazing for the price.

Make sure you leave about an inch and a half away from your roots at first so you don't get hot roots; the roots lift much faster than the rest of the hair because of the heat from your scalp. Then within that last 15-20 minutes margin, add the rest of the bleach to your roots. Also try your best to keep everything well saturated - this will ensure an even color and minimum brass!
