A better move that produces much tastier ghee is to buy high quality butter from Europe (they use heritage breed A2 cows in France, Italy and Switzerland). Make sure it is white in color and contains no salt. Making the ghee from this butter was incredible for my digestion and is significantly less expensive.",

I could not imagine that my coffee could taste any better than it does with the butter, but it does! This ghee has a lovely note of caramel and I have to say that it really enhances my morning brew! I've also been known to sneak a little bit of ghee after dinner to satisfy my sweet tooth. It's lightly sweet , creamy, caramel tasting and has a great mouth feel! I'm on my second jar since February, I'm addicted. It's. That. Good.",

I've reordered several times and will continue to do so. It is worth the expense, and the heavy jar and Ancient Organics packaging are proof of their attention to detail and how much care they put into their product.",

I only eat it fresh (like on popcorn or roasted vegetables) before serving, as it is expensive and I can get more bang for the buck- by using it just before eating.",

Ghee can be used in anything that requires butter. It does not contain salt. I use it on garlic bread, saute\u0301ing vegetables, frying eggs, etc. Since it is clarified butter, you find that you do not need as much when you use it. A little bit goes a long way.",

The first thing I cooked with it was just a simple light saute\u0301 with some baby spinach. I ate it up with my fingers waiting for the other parts of dinner to cook. For comparison, I then saute\u0301ed some spinach with some Kerrygold unsalted grass-fed butter, which is good stuff, but it was just like the fun left the party compared to this Ancient Organics grass-fed ghee. It is amazing. No need to look further. Click BUY right now!",

    "description": "Size:Pack of 1Ancient Organics Ghee is a premium cooking oil celebrated for its taste, nutritional benefits, and medicinal qualities\u2014it is unlike any other ghee on the market today. Our Ghee is hand-crafted over an open flame and made in small batches, ensuring you will always get the freshest Ghee. With an uncompromising commitment to quality and an obsessive attention to detail, we guarantee you won't find a more pure, better tasting Ghee. Ghee is the complete distillation of butter\u2014 the end result of a long, slow, careful clarification process that removes all the moisture, lactose and casein, making it completely shelf stable AND a perfect choice for people who are lactose intolerant. The difference between Ghee and clarified butter lies in their flavor and shelf stability: Ghee is superior on both counts Ayurveda recognizes ghee as an essential part of a balanced diet and is considered to be the very best oil one can eat. It has been used for centuries as a digestive and elimination aid, for energy, sexual vitality, skin and eye health, as a lubricant for the joints and for alkalizing the blood. Comprised of full spectrum short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids, Ghee contains Omega 3 and Omega 9 essential fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, E and K. Our Ghee is one of the highest natural sources of CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) because we use only the highest quality organic butter of pastured cows. Our golden Ghee has a delicious caramelized and nutty taste that will enhance the flavor of any culinary creation. It has one of the highest flash points (485\u00baF) and it is simply the best choice for high temperature cooking. Substitute our Ghee for olive oil, butter or vegetable oil in or on anything from soups, potatoes, rice and vegetables, with eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, smoothies or popcorn\u2014the possibilities are truly endless. Try it\u2014you will love it!",
