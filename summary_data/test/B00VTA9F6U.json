I\u2019ve also been wanting to switch from pour over to espresso because pour over makes me jittery. I got the larger reservoir accessory pack and can pull 3 espresso shots in about 10 min (including grinding, packing the shots, and switching the basket with the grounds out between shots). The taste is amazing and the whole set up is exactly what I needed. I also like that it isn\u2019t noisy like an electric espresso machine.",

They do sell a larger water tank and extra grounds cups which I will definitely pick up before next festival season. This little gadget is a game changer with good, strong, and crema rich shots.

Second, despite the careful instruction following, the internal water chamber seal busted in a few months and it no longer made espresso. The company's support has not been great--extremely slow, and the person I interacted with didn't speak English very well. In conclusion, a great product for about 4 months.",

After pumping it, it seemed to leave some water/coffee inside and I couldn\u2019t see any way to get it out other than shaking it a bit, might get dirty after a few uses...Nice sleek design though, very lightweight, and made good espresso.",
