On this try I took two capsules instead of just one. That night I slept 7 hours straight, definitely not my norm. The next night I slept almost 8 hours and the third night I slept 7 and a half. A large part of why I'm sleeping so well is that my arthritis pain is controlled enough so that it is not waking me in the middle of the night.",
