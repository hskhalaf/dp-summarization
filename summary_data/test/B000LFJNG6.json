      "text": "[...] Rorke Haining's review linked above beat me to the punch. In short, it's a great concept but rather than battery powered it would be better to have an option for a power adapter - either to a USB port, to a plug-in charger, or even to the Wii connector. Battery life is limited to a few days and there is no sleep mode, the only option for power management is a 1 or 2 hour timer that lets loose with screeching before shutting down. Wireless is great if you can set it and forget it for a few months, but I'll probably either modify it such that I can power it externally or buy a.",

With the wireless version, not only has it been effortless to use, it has a much better range for pointing at the screen. I find that I forget to turn off the device because I covered the blue light with black electric tape, but the 1hr-2hr alarm fixes this problem. Turning off the alarm causes the batteries to empty after gameplay, so be sure to remember to turn it off after playing. Overall I'm very satisfied with this product and I hope to get products from Nyko with similar quality.",

The directions are pretty non-descript; it doesn't connect to the Wii directly - just turn it on and set it in front of the TV.

Other than that, it's more sensitive than the bar shipped with the Wii and eliminates the need for the wire that plugs it into the Wii (which only provides power for the LEDs).",

Performance wise I think the bar has a longer range but not as much width and is not as responsive. Over all it evens out.",

(My cats always chewed on it) Easy to turn on, just push a button Cons Very limited battery life, an hour of playing will denote the need for four more batteries which..... Are very hard to put in the bar thing. More than ten feet away makes the wii glove dance and skip around almost all the time, except for when the batteries are fresh, which is only for five minutes or so.",

So unless you NEED a wireless sensor bar, stick with the wired ones, they're more reliable.",

Now, after a month of use, even when the batteries are replaced and we do flips in front of the TV, it will not sense a thing and I am on-line buying another sensor bar. My recommendation is to not buy this item.",
