It worked well for about a year, then it started to have intermittent issues with buttons working on the first press. After about 20 months, it would take 10 or more \"power\" button presses to get it to turn on. This month, it finally would not turn on, even after installing new batteries. I realize this is an inexpensive product, but it should last for more than 100 uses.",

For $12 it will weigh things and work decently, but it isn't as sensitive as it should be.",

The packaging is cheap but effective, it reacts reasonably quickly to changes in weight, and its .01g increments are way more precise than the .5g increments on my previous scale. I'm using it to measure out coffee beans and so far it seems much more consistent.",
