The yellow wrist strap was comfortable on my wrist, dried quickly, and did keep the camera near the surface when I did let it float away from me in a pool. I have a Fuji underwater camera about the same size as a Canon Elf camera. Camera dropped down in the water but the top of the wrist strap was visible on the water surface. I don't know how one of the larger,heavier SLR underwater cameras would do, but I now have no fear about losing my new camera.",

On our third outing using this float, the string that connects the float to the camera snapped. Fortunately we noticed this when we were out of the water and didn't lose the camera. The float itself is very strong and well built, but the string is very low quality. I will most likely purchase this item again, but will keep the original wrist strap on the camera as well and loop it around the float for extra support.",

The strap that actually connects to the camera is ultra thin. Too thin. And the stitching that connects the thin strap to the float is quite poor. To counter this, I re-connected the strap that came with my camera. I then looped this through the float in a way that it holds onto the float without worrying about stitches or flimsy straps. I then discarded the flimsy strap. I would recommend this product for the float alone.",

Great yellow color (suggest adding some neon colors to product line) for visibility underwater and for surface retrieval. Every small underwater camera (or any small gadget you do not want to sink) should have one. One improvement I would recommend to the manufacturer - improve the lanyard connector locking mechanism & material both in the twist-off \"locking design\" and material \"hefty-ness\", because it could give way if snagged against dive gear.

Of course this free for all idea is only done around friends/family people I trust with my stuff. Not in a public setting. ;-)",
