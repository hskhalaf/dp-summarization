The aroma part is very weak. I bought high quality oils, so its not the oils. You put the oil on a tiny piece of sponge, so maybe thats why. I had a water based purifier before and you could smell it for hours. With this one you can smell it if you stand right next to the purifier, for a few minutes. Thats it.",
