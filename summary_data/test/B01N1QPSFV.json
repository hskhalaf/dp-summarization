My left foot is noticeably smaller than my right foot but the shoes are still comfortable and easy to wear.

There is a generous elastic band at the instep which helps considerably in slipping them on, and I would judge them to be slightly larger than some Clarks in a similar style. I wore them all day right out of the box with no problems. The arch support and cushioning are very helpful in providing comfort. Amazon did a great job in delivery as always!",

I usually wear a size 7; these are 7.5 and fit well. If I didn't have any foot issues, I'd give them 5 stars.",

For me, who sometimes has trouble walking, this is a good \"safe\" shoe to wear. It's a good, \"all purpose\" shoe that I can wear comfortably all day.",
