The other book was generic instruction, in English, but nothing about how to use this course. I was lost from the beginning. EVERYTHING of apparent value was written in Russian! I don't read or write Russian. This was a waste of money for what might have been a good course. Beware.",

      "text": "Rosetta Stone across the board is an excellent learning tool. It \"activizes\" the learning processes by incorporating the senses (seeing, hearing, physically connecting) in the learning process. The program basically regurgitates the same controlled script in all languages (in my case Russian) and aims linguistically to hit the foundational areas essential for basic communication. It is excellent for expanding vocabulary and gaining understanding of basic grammer. However, it cannot be expected to be sufficient on its own. It is most effective when used in conjuction with outside instruction or other self-study tools.",

So I sprang for the phone call to Virginia. The tech I spoke with insisted that my package came with 2 discs. One for the application and one for the language files. This simply not true. And it worked perfectly on my old laptop. It has one disc and one disc only. No help. Out $200.00",
