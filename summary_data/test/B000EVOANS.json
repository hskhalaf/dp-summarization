If and when it needs to be replaced, I will buy it again at full price rather than have any other mouse given to me free.",

The two AA batteries makes the mouse a little heavy although with 6+ months of battery time. I still would have preffered two AAA size batteries to reduce the weight. Recommended",

It sometimes skips and does not always move as you are turning the wheel.

Sadly, it seems to suffer from a common mouse design flaw: the sides of the mouse slope outward, so that while gripping the mouse and moving, it constantly feels like it's slipping out of your hand. This is exacerbated by the weight: naturally, wireless mice are heavier than wired mice by dint of their need to include a battery. I've normally avoided all such mice because of this frustrating feeling, but I got this one for just $10 including shipping from Overstock. Sadly, though, it seems that we get what we pay for.",

The bad: scroll wheel is difficult to turn because the click indents are too big. You tend to accidentally click it instead because you have to press down a bit to get enough grip to turn the wheel. And there's no way to turn the mouse off except by removing the batteries, and the batteries are not easy to take out. Poor design.",
