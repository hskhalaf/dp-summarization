OK, so it sounds ridiculous, but it's insanely addictive. It starts of simple, just light and dark variants of red, blue and green, but then you have to start blending the palette and remembering the correct combination whilst the pressure is on can get pretty frantic. Collect power-ups, like shields & lightning strikes to help Woolston survive along the way. Recommended.",

It's not as easy as you think. You have to match dark and bright colours, and as the game progress you have to mix colours at the same time. And while you are mixing colours and matching bright and dark shades the baddies gets faster and faster!!! Eeeeeek! YES, I squealed! Happy to get this for free as the free app of the day.
