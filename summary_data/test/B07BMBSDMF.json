You can buy from the actual YETI Website for the same price..Plus i got it customized and shipped for free!! 34.99 plus tax..Can\u2019t beat that!",

I have another yeti product that I use multiple times daily and it's fantastic. By the way I ordered this 30 oz rambler on Nov. 4th. Rusting with less than 30 day usage, I wonder if this is an authentic item.",

For those that said it's not completely leak proof, I will said it basically is but what you need to understand is that if you can't have a 100% air tight seal on a lid like this or the hot beverage will burst it off. So yes, if you tip it over a tiny bit will leak out but it will most certainly buy you time to pick it back up. It's just a matter of practicality. If you want something air tight, you'll have to purchase a thermos but otherwise this is the best you can get in a mug.",
