The plates are harder to pick up versus other designs, but they certainly can and will be picked up by precocious babies and toddlers. Aside from that, the lip of the plates make it easy for kids to pick up slippery foods that tend to lie flat and resist picking up (like banana slices). The fat handles on the utensils are also good for little fingers. The whole set cleans easily by hand or in the dishwasher. Despite the price being a touch higher than other sets, I would buy these again.",
