Allergy information must be included on Amazon. Such a disappointment.",

They get a bad rap in some reviews because they can melt in shipment but that happened to me and you can easily call or click for a replacement, which comes very quickly and was totally useable. Melting could happen to any gummy vitamin. These are by far my favorite multi vitamin, period, pregnant ot not (been pregnant 3 times). No fishy or weird tastes at all and very gentle on the tummy. I plan to keep taking them and add a calcium supplement after I am through the pre/post natal period.",
