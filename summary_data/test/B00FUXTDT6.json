I work part time at a ski resort, so I had a friend on ski patrol do a little test with me, and it performed great. I mostly use it for my snow trail runs this winter, and the harness is comfortable and holds it in place nicely. Gave it 4 start cause I rarely give 5, I would highly recommend this unit though.",
