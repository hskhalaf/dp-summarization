      "text": "Generally, this tent is a pretty good deal, but at 78\", it is just about 6\" or so too short for a 6'2\" person like myself. It is a 4 season tent which means that it has less built in venting in the walls of the tent, but venting for cold weather camping can be accomplished by opening vents built into the doors. It could use some better stake offs for the rain fly to help to make sure that the rainfly does not contact the tent. The vestibules are larger than other backpacking tents I have seen... especially at this price and that is also a plus.",

The tent fits me (5'4\", 135lb) and my boyfriend (6'2\", 190lbs) comfortably and that is about it. This is not a large tent. You probably could fit a small dog in with us, but our Pit Bull and Bulldog sleep in their kennels in our van - they would never fit except for on top of us.",

It isn't the lightest or smallest tent for backpacking (it takes up about half of my 55L Bag space-wise), so if you are really counting ounces, you may need to shell out more cash for a lighter/smaller one. But for 2-3 day weekender trips, this it perfect.",

When I finished setting up the tent, it began to rain, this two layers tent keeps the interior well dry, and at the same time keeps it well ventilated. Vestibule doors can be fully closed or partially open for ventilation and sun shade, very good design. :)",

The set up is 10 minutes with two people and easy for one adult. My 10 year old can do it. I recommend the underlayment for this tent it protects the floor. One thing you need to vent this tent at night in the cold it is sealed tight enough that your overnight breathing will create condensation on the inside of the tent..",

Awesome that it has the convenient doors on both sides, a nice hanging net for the center, plenty of room and good space on both sides under the rain fly for packs. Got to test it in fairly torrential rain the first time out. Held up spectacularly. Also due to a poor ground tarp we laid, we found out the bottom of the tent is quite waterproof! Very lightweight, easy to throw onto a pack. 2 poles, super easy set up. Would buy again.",
