But, having tasted the new recipe, I deleted the new box from my cart. Yuck. Bring back the original recipe please!",

They feel indulgent - and are, to some degree: these have 210 calories and 15g of sugar. I wouldn\u2019t really call this a health food. But damn do they taste good!

The 16-bar boxes are easy to open and bars are (with lid removed or open) easily accessible, the 10-bar boxes don't rip open cleanly, stand on their side and don't provide easy access. What a wasteful way for a company to spend their money, this box is not an improvement but rather annoying.",

      "text": "I've bought these at Hannafords for years and since COVID-19 has been around I haven't been able to go so I ordered on Amazon. They are usually fresh and the dates have moisture to them making it like actually cookie dough consistency. These were dry and kind of crumbly. The date was still good, so I'm not sure if they got too warm in shipping wherever they came from, but it happened before it got to me because its been in the 30's here. Will not be buying again online.",

      "text": "IBD can be a pain... The chocolate chip cookie dough LARABAR is a relatively safe food for me, even during a mild flare. The ingredient list: Cashews, dates, chocolate chips, and salt. The cashews aren't ground completely into a nut butter. There are some small cashew pieces, which may present a problem for some. The flavor is pretty good, and the chocolate is usually strong enough to overcome mild off-flavors from medications (think metallic tasting antibiotics). The calorie density is such that a few of these allow me to keep my weight up. They're a great source of fat. (Not so much protein though.)",

They are sweet because of the dates, so I shoot my sugar grams for the day. Great with coffee. I ordered Cashew Cookie, Blueberry Muffin, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, all cashew based. Love them all.",

I don't know what it was because I always bought cookie dough or brownie flavors before. I couldn't finish the rest of my box because the taste kept me from finishing each bar I had. I am a little disappointed :( I'll just buy them one by one from the store from now on.",
