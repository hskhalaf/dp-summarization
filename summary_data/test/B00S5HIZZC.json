I did read the reviews and the description indicated the mud (or combination of ingredients) may lead to breakouts initially. Well, that is true. I'm well past the age of breakouts, and this soap definitely led to some redness and breakouts. I tried not using it every day, but seems like whenever I used it, the following day my skin was irritated. Not an allergic reaction (skin was not hot or inflamed), more like the detox effect was encouraging breakouts. In any case, I won't be using this on my face anymore. I will say it does have a nice scent.",

      "text": "I've only been using this soap for a few days now, but so far, it's amazing!! Like many other people, in the reviews that I read before purchasing this soap, I also have a horrible problem with acne. I'm a 37 year old female that has had issues with acne since I was 13. I'm allergic to salicylic acid, I've taken meds, I've tried countless all natural & organic products, but to no avail. Within these first few days of using this soap though, things are already better than they've been with any other product! The acne has lessened, the redness has started getting better, & my skin just looks fresher! I will definitely be buying this again!",

I've only been using this bar of soap for a couple days, but I can already see a positive difference in tone evenness of my face and my acne is almost nonexistent. Also, I'm pretty sure this soap will last for months, but if you're looking to make it last even longer, cut it into 1/4 pieces to use one at a time.",

I just dab tea tree oil on the break outs and they dry right back up. The customer service has been good so far. It is encouraging to buy from companies that pay attention to their customers.
