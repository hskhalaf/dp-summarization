I don't expect it to regrow hair that I've already lost, I'm a 65 yo male with typically moderate male pattern baldness, but I think I see less loose hair on towel after towel drying. At first I thought the 16 oz bottles would be used up very quickly, but when applied as directed, very little product is actually required. I have soft water which helps I'm sure.

It said something with Biotin in it. So, I took a chance & ordered this. It has helped tremendously & to my surprise I never have hair even in my comb & my hair has come back curly, which I never had in my life. I totally recommend it.",

My natural waves are more visable and bouncy. As for hair thinning, I'll have to use it a little bit longer to see if it helps. If it stings any part of your head, that means you didn't rinse it out well enough. Only reason I'm continuing use is because it made my hair bouncy and full of life. I am using OGX argan oil conditioner as well. I will update my review if I notice a difference in hair loss or not. Smells like rosemary oil",
