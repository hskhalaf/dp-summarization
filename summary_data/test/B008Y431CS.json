Be aware that the pen looks like you can open it to replace the nib, but if you DO open it, you break a connection inside it and the pen is then completely busted and has to be replaced--we learned this the hard way. DO NOT OPEN THE PEN. Not sure why it comes with replacement nibs because you really can't use them. But the tablet itself is really great and he's thrilled with it, and uses it all the time. I would recommend it wholeheartedly.",

In her defense, the instructions are in a fold that makes following the steps confusing. I hooked it up to my PC and it works fine, but not something I will use.

I'd be spending half an hour unplugging and plugging the wire and restarting my computer to no avail. It's a huge pain to try to get it to work. When it does work, it's great! The pressure is good and works well but the amount of time I spend trying to even get this thing to work outweighs it.",

And now the port to accept the cable crapped out, DESPITE always storing it in it's box or somewhere safe when not in use, which is what I would expect from my Bamboo tablet, which is almost 6 years old and still kicking.

I bought this tablet as a replacement for my 7-8 year old Wacom Intuos (what's now called an Intuos Pro), but I only used it for about a week before returning it for a small Intuos Pro. Quality-wise, there's nothing wrong with it... I love the sleek white color, and the tablet itself is very shiny and well built. It was just too different for me to adjust to, so I went back to my comfort brand. This tablet is great for artists on a budget. I even recommended it to a friend when she asked me for tablet recommendations.",

I called the warranty company to have my pen replaced and they told me that the pen was considered and accessory and accessories were not covered under the warranty even though the pen IS NOT an accessory because the tablet WILL NOT work without it and this tablet will only work with that specific pen.

No issues, other then the power and off button was broken and stuck inside the pen when i received the package. Was a very annoyed that i had to buy a new pen basically spending 80+ (including the tablet) with shipping to use it Since they wouldn't send a new one to cover the damaged product. The tablet was great, the installation for the diver was fast and simple to understand . But i really liked it, i would definitely recommend this for anyone, especially someone who's looking for their first tablet.",

Other than that, it seems like a good tablet for the price. There is a button on the back end of the tablet pen that seems like it should do something, but it doesn't move.

The product is amazing, I LOVE it. It's a beautiful white colour, and feels really nice. The installation took around 5 minutes and it was up and running, the pen pressure is great and I cannot be more happy. The only noticeable difference is the \"springy\" feel of the pen, as it \"wiggles\" a bit when you apply pressure. It's not really a bad thing, just different. But I definitely recommend this to any aspiring artist who can't afford a pricey tablet.",
