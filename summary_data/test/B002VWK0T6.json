Even so, there's only two kinds of legs and the photo made it pretty clear which ones go on which end. The legs did take a bit of hard pushing to get them into the plastic sockets, but then they slid right into place. I'd rather have them tight than wobbly, so I appreciated that.

Being familiar with the chair, and it did last 3 years, I bought another. It claims a weight limit of 400 lbs. I weigh 240. The price is right, so I guess I don't have anything to complain about. Only 4 stars however due to the suspect weight limit claim.",

      "text": "I purchased this seat for my MIL after her knee replacement surgery to help her in the shower. It is wonderful! It has big suction cups to secure the legs inside the tub and is very sturdy and does not slip. The seat is smooth and does not irritate skin for sliding across the seat after sitting down on the end. She loves it and is so happy with how easy it is for her to be able to take a shower without help even though she is still using a walker after her surgery. Well worth the purchase price!",
