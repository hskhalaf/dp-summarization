It is frustrating because I have had this product in the past and had no issues so that is why I purchased it again! So I bought it and had to return it and now another return this is frustrating having good coffee is important and not having it become even more complicated is very important!

The grinding tub detaches so you can leave the base plugged in and just dump the tub into your coffeemaker. Just a lot easier and neater. 2. You can clean the tub in the dishwasher. So you can grind nuts or spices in it then clean thoroughly vs ruining your next few batches of coffee. Also when it gets gunky with coffee grounds it's a snap to clean. Re the complaints about grounds spilling just give the top a few taps after grinding and the grounds will settle down.",

Everything about this model was what I wanted except. It is powerful, yet not to noise, well built, easy to clean. But no matter how long I ground the beans it could not come close to what my old grinder produced. It might be that the spinning blade sits up high over the grings so a lot of the coffee seems to get stuck on the bottom. Don't know the reason but if you are looking for grinding beans for French Press or drip this will do teh job.",

This is because the grinding cover(top part) does not seal so tightly. Every time it is used it is necessary to put the machine upside down if you want to clean the grinds that fall outside of the grinding chamber. 3. The included airtight freshness cap used to preserve excess ground coffee makes the grinding cover unable to fit on top. This means it does not store so well as it is now loose on top and might fall and crack if moved. (hypothetically)",

      "text": "I had high expectations based on appliance name brand. I was even fooled by \"easy to use\" sales video. Negatives: wimpy grinding button, mess of coffee grounds on and around machine when lid is lifted to check the grind, needed multiple times for each miniscule batch, unplugging grinder each time. So frustrating, I went back to using my Starbucks mini shake grinder. In conclusion, if not for the sharp blades, this small grinder is more toy than useful appliance.",
