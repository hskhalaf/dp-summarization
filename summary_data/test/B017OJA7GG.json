My problem with them is that the lights have noticeably different levels of brightness (some are kind of dim compared to others in the set) even though they get equal amounts of sunlight throughout the day. Also, the coolness/warmth of the lights vary. They are all a cool color (which I'm not crazy about, but that's my own fault for not researching more) but the coolness is variable among the six of them. Between the different colors and the brightness/dimness discrepancies, they look cheap when they light up so I'll probably move them to my back yard and get something higher quality for the front.",

      "text": "I am so disappointed with these lights. I was excited to find lights that did not require additional AA batteries to replace! They come on when the sun goes down...but they stay on for only about 2 hours. If I flip the on/off switch they come back on...but just for a short time. My other solar lights in the yard (battery-assisted) stay on through the night - so it has nothing to do with lack of sun to recharge the batteries during the day. Will the company honor their lifetime guarantee regarding this failure to perform?",

      "text": "For the price these aren't the worst buy, but my two main issues are the batteries and hollow plastic stakes. The batteries that are included are only 600mAh, so I replaced them with Energizer 2400mAh batteries to get 4x the charge. This has helped a bit with keeping them all consistently lit. The stakes are very cheap, and I snapped one in half when inserting them all in the ground (and it did not take a lot of force at all). I was able to superglue it back on with no major harm done, but the bottom line is I would look elsewhere for outdoor solar lights.",

Two lights wouldn't work every night until I'd fiddle with them. I'm sending them back. I put my landscape lights with wiring back in. For me, they work better. These are cheaper made and don't shine as bright.",
