      "text": "After purchasing some ten pairs of Delson models, this one appears to be the best. Suffering from bilateral plantar fasciitis, I found the foam technology relieving. Because I dislike most slip-ons and dislike lacing, the flexibility beneath the tongue is snug. I recommend one purchase a shoe horn to prevent repeatedly bending the backstop. All my Skechers may run slightly large, but not a problem. If forced to find any fault with Delton- Brewton sneakers, I'd say heel wear. Walking some 8/mi/day, the heel seems to wear down more than other brands.",

I tried to loosen the laces, but could not without cutting them which I did not do. I wish the manufacturer would let me know how to get these on my feet without struggling to slip my feet past the lace area. Complete waste of money if I can't take them on my trip.",

Obvious this style has issues, and so does the process to return a defective shoe, even if it happened to be the second par.",
