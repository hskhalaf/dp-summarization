It is comfortable for just relaxing. It doesn't have a cup holder but I am ok with that. I also like that i can sit sideways on it and let the floats come under my arms and sit more upright and talk to people. The fabric and inflatable pieces seem to be good, thick quality. Overall, I am very happy with this float.",

This keeps my body underwater, but my head happily and comfortably out of water. It's like a hammock, but your head and tops of your shoulders (you can position yourself up or down) out of water. It was such a comfortable position to casually watch my kids from my corner of the deep end that I realized it's a comfy reading position. So I put my tablet in double ziplock bags and it was indeed perfect. I bought two more because I am NOT sharing!",

They inflate quickly so we would deflate to take to/from our room if we didn't want the extra bulk. They're comfy sitting in the hammock position. A little awkward sitting like a chair bc one of the inflatables is larger so you're a little lop sided. One could probably use foam pool noodles in the sides if needed or desired. Remember to insert inflatables before inflating!",

They are durable, reasonably priced and easy to store. If you are looking for a float that will keep you out of the water while your floating in the water, this isn't it. Your body does get immersed in the water - but I enjoy that. The larger \"roll\" is for your neck support and the smaller one for your knees. I've purchased a couple for myself and am now buying them for gifts for friends and family. :)",

I have to give them a top-up every time I use it 2) the stitching is not good. It looks like someone sewed this together with their eyes closed.",
