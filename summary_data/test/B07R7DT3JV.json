      "text": "I had to change my opinion of these wirless earbuds, they are rubbish. i have had these since November 2019 and upto yesterday 26th March 2020, the left earbud has stopped working. I have tried resetting them which is recommended by Jlabs guide but still no good, i am losing my mind on these and every other mid range earbuds. DO NOT BUY THESE BECAUSE THE LEFT BUD WILL FAIL, CHECK THE REVIEWS OF COMPLAINTS. Do i really need to but a pair over 200 quid to be satisified?",

But I'm taking a couple of minutes to recommend these and save a few of you the expense of buying inferior wireless earphones. I wanted a pair of earphones for running and I had bought three different pairs that wouldn't stay in. I gave those away to family who will use them walking. After asking for friends recommendations on Facebook I hit on these. They sound great, the touch sensitive controls are easy, the charging case is sturdy and well made and most importantly they stay in my ears. I really excellent product. Well made, it speaks quality.",

I contacted the maker. No response. So, 1 star.",

Thankfully I had bought these from John Lewis (customer service at its finest) and they allowed me to exchange them for a pair of Jaybird X4 earphones, which are excellent. Read the other reviews on here (or anything via Google) and you will find that the left earphone dying is a very common problem with seemingly many JLab products!! How can a company like JLab continue to ignore this same common issue across multiple product lines? Absolutely ridiculous. Would never even consider another JLab product again. Sorry.",
