I pack her dinner at 7:00 a.m. and it is still warm at 6:00 p.m. In the test I did, the food was still at 150 degrees after 12 1/2 hours. To get best results, fill the thermos with boiling water and let it sit for 15 minutes before dumping the water and filling with food. I've been sending food that has a high liquid content (soup, chili), so I don't know how solid food would fair. My daughter is quite happy with the her dinners, so I feel like this was an excellent purchase.",

I can still smell the onion from chili from a while ago or maybe it's like a cast iron pan just needs to season lol, But if you can look past that its great for nice hot soup during the lunch or supper time, perfect serving size too. most times I get two servings out of one fill up if its hearty soup",
