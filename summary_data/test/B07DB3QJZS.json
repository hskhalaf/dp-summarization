      "text": "I got this drone without the camera, because I wanted a line of sight flier my 5 yo could fly too. This is a great drone!!! Awesome for learning how to fly. The altitude hold works great, and this is a very stable drone! I was surprised at the yaw (spin) rate was good even in the first speed. Great battery life makes this drone so fun! Flying outside, it did great even in 7+mph winds. A little big to fly inside, but with the prop guards you may be able to. Overall, this is a fun entry level drone for kids and anyone learning to fly!!!",

I have a DJI Mavic as well and sometimes I enjoy this drone more because it\u2019s almost as fast and I\u2019m not nervous to lose it. Only doing three stars because I can\u2019t find replacement rotor guards or motor gears and have stripped teeth in less than two months. Not a huge deal, but I\u2019d rather repair it than buy a whole new one",

She had flown a drone before so she was able to get it up and flying, when it got high enough she pressed the one key returned button and the drone would not returned, she tried bringing the drove down but it seemed like the drone lost signal with the remote. The drone ended crashing into a tree about 80 feet high. We were not able to retrieve the drone. Not sure why the remote did not work.",
