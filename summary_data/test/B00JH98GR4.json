It works great on thin carpet and hardwood but if you want it for anything with thickness this is NOT the way to go.",

It appears the designer focused on ease of mobility at the expense of the primary function. This was stupid choice; it doesn\u2019t matter how easy it is to maneuver unless it\u2019s picking up dirt in the process. I\u2019d give it zero stars if I could.",

One con: Between the last one I had and this one they shortened the cord. I have a big place so it's kind of a PIA. I hope they will reconsider this and go back to the longer cords in the future.",

So I called customer support, They said NO ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS, including MOTORS or even my on/off switch were covered under warranty. So DON'T' be fooled by the 5 YEAR 'Limited Warranty. It basicly covers the wheels and hoses. So if your vacuum fails after 10 uses like mine did, it will cost you another $118 to replace a faulty electrical switch on the brush head. Buyer Beware !!!",

That was a big plus. Also, the detachable hose works well for furniture and stairs. We have zero complaints. Great purchase.
