A: This product does include preparation of the federal and preparation of one state return. Additional state programs and state e-file are available for a fee. The state e-file fee is $19.95 per return. SO I purchased the Basic to do the State return only. But when I downloaded it, it only has the Federal Return. CHeating. No way to get it returned.",
