I followed other reviewers advice and purchased the Dream on Me 3 mini mattress and Carter's Easy Fit portable crib sheet. Both work well!",

He\u2019s in the 75% for length and still fits, though I suspect in the next 6 months he may be too long to fully lay down. BUT the lowest setting for the mattress is low enough that he is still unable to climb/fall out. The top rail reaches the top of his shoulders. It\u2019s very light weight and easy to move from room to room (both alone and with help). The light weight wood does, however, make it easily scratched/dented so you need to be careful.",

The instructions don\u2019t have many words though, mostly just pictures, and the hardware all comes in one bag so none of the pieces are labeled. There were a few knicks and scratches from the manufacturer but nothing too concerning. It does come with a mattress pad but it\u2019s very thin, like a changing table pad, I recommend buying a mini crib mattress.",

The most basic crib function of the front sliding lower to get baby out easier does noy exist on this, and the highest tier the mattress sits is so far down low that you are constantly bending at the hip to pick baby up, while leaning against the rail that doesn't slide down. This adds up to an impossibly painful lower back that does not go away. Very poor design.",

I read reviews before I bought it that warned the mattress is thin. They were right - it's also cheap. I bought a separate mattress ( a pack n play or portable crib mattress is the right size), and it's worked very nicely.",
