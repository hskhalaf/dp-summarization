She just used a cold rag to help with the redness/pain. We then moved on to her eyebrows. We cut them in small pieces (the strips, not the eyebrows).

I only needed 1 strip for his unibrow and IT GOT IT ALL IN ONE RIP! Baby smooth! I was so impressed and he of course was really happy he didn't have to be \"tortured\". I put the unused strips in a plastic bag for the future when it regrows. If they dry up I will update this review- if not, then you will know I still love them!",

These were super easy to use and a great size strip for the upper lip. It got all of the hair off and left the waxed area a little red for about 20 minutes, then it disappeared. It came with a cloth to use after you wax that was soothing to my skin and got the little bit of excess wax off. I will definitely be buying again when the time comes.",
