Two little children came along, and I felt that with my Nikon kit I was carrying a third child. Was not able to use my camera that much and really missing it. Bought this camera barely 3 months ago and it's like a new lease of life for my hobby. Extremely light , simply astonishing picture quality, the camera is very versatile and works well in poor light also. The controls are intuitive, the body and texture of the camera is simply gorgeous.",

The only downside is that a phone is more convenient, and you have to haul this rather heavy camera with you. Ricoh GR III has a more convenient form factor than this camera. However, Ricoh GR III pictures suck compared to this Fuji x100F (I extensively tried both side by side for several weeks). This camera punches also well above it's weight, see reviews on YouTube comparing it to cameras 3 to 5 times it's price. I highly recommend this camera.",
