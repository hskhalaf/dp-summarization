      "text": "My hair is a little past shoulder length and I ordered both the 1.25 and 1.5 curling irons to style loose curly waves. I think the 1.25 definitely works best to achieve this style. The 1.5 barrel was just too big and did not hold or maintain my curl throughout the day (Although if your hair is considerably longer, the 1.5 might be a better curling iron for you). I have had these curling irons for well over a year and they have held up extremely well. They are strong, good quality, durable, and work great. I would absolutely recommend them to others!",

Yes, the non-heated pointed tip is smaller than the usual barrel type, but I adjusted to it after only burning my fingers once!

The smaller barrel makes tiny tight curls and not what I desired. Gets VERY hot and makes beautiful curls fast...that holds. To get the best look, I have to blow out my wavy hair first then use it.

I guess it\u2019s something to do with its titanium spring, but I\u2019d be more satisfied if it was a little lighter.",

    "description": "Size:1 InchThe BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Spring Curling Iron creates loose waves or textured curls. The Nano titanium barrel uses far-infrared heat, heating the hair shaft from within for styling without damage. This iron has 50 heat settings up to 450F & has a turbo heat button to instantly boost heat output for faster results & more defined curls. It is available in 3/4\", 1\", 1-1/4\", & 1-1/2\" sizes depending on the desired curl size. This iron uses Sol-Gel technology which transforms nanoscale particles of titanium & ceramic from liquid to solid form, resulting in higher, more consistent concentrations of each. Sol-Gel barrels have a significantly higher percentage of titanium & ceramic compared to conventional barrels. As a result they are stronger, longer-lasting, & more resistant to chemicals.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBaBylissPRO is the world\u2019s leading producer of innovative, high-performance professional styling tools. Chosen by hairdressers, barbers, and clients everywhere, BabylissPRO styling tools are versatile and engineered to last.",
