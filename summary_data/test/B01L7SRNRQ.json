When I first got them one of them was already slightly warped but I didn't care since it was for the \"beef/red meat\" one which I rarely use. After putting them in the dishwasher for first time most of them warped which make them hard to use as it makes it hard for the food to stay on and to cut on an uneven surface. So if you buy them make sure to only hand-wash them yourself so you don't end up with warped ones.",

      "text": "Very substantial cutting boards that feel firm and are large enough to cut various foods with! Update (from 5 to 4 starts): Previous reviewers mentioned that the boards warp if put in the dishwasher. I must agree with this. After one time in the dishwasher, a couple of them are no longer completely flat. I can still use them to cut meat and fish, but they would be inconvenient to chop vegetables on, which would then roll off the board. Despite that, I like that they can be conveniently sanitized by putting them in the dishwasher, and are quite thick compared to other cutting boards. In all, I would buy them again.",

New product in color box. 4 large sized plastic cutting boards + 1 non-slip mat + 1 ceramic peeler. \n\nLocated in Irvine, California we spend as much time as we can entertaining with our friends and family. We are always working to offer quality and affordability and to improve in any way possible. We personally test each and every product we offer, and wouldn't sell anything that we wouldn't use ourselves. When you buy from Resort Chef International you are supporting a family run company owned and operated in the USA.\n\nProduct Features:\n- Red for meats, used to cut beef or pork on.\n- Yellow for poultry, to cut chicken, duck, or game hen on.\n- Blue for seafood, to cut fish or other seafood on.\n- Green for veggies and fruit.\n\nReversible / Double Sided:\nOur boards are designed to be used on both sides, which means you have twice the lifespan of a normal cutting board. No board will last forever, and the FDA recommends that cutting boards be replaced once deep knife grooves are cut into the board, as bacteria can more easily form.\n\nWhere to Use\nOur boards can be used anywhere a cutting board is normally used. Because of their size and durability, customers have enjoyed using our Resort Chef medium and large boards in: home kitchens, professional kitchens, restaurants, small kitchenettes, flats, apartments, boats, when camping, during barbeques (BBQ), and picnics. NASA might even use these on the International Space Station, due to their small and compact size.\n\n100% Satisfaction Guarantee:\nIf you have a question or concern, reach out to us here.
