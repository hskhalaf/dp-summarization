Everything is contained within and nothing left behind when heading out to fly our kites. The material is very strong and stiching is very good quality to hold heavy skis as intended. There are 2 securing straps to 'bundle' your contents tight together; limiting movement within. The bottom end can be folded over and secured for shorter skis/contents. We can verify the material is dust and water resistant as we carry it outdoors in a truck. This case should provide years of use, depending on how its handled of course. Glad we made this selection/purchase and I'm sure you will be also.",

Unfortunately, the way it's sewn on to the straps means that when the bag top is rolled and the buckle is clipped to hold it, the buckle stands at 90 degrees to the surface of the bag instead of lying flat against it. One side of the buckle seems to be attached upside-down, and because it is not symmetrical, both straps end up twisted quarter-turn, and the buckle stands on its edge. What am I missing?",
