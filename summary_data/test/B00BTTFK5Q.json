Update: the company ended up sending us a replacement part so we were able to use the scooter again!",

Several miles later, the scooter seems to be holding up to the abuse that an 8-yr old can dish out. The handle bar extends, and is easily tall enough for another year or two of use, before it's outgrown. My kid's happy, and that makes dad happy! I'll recommend this to anyone. If the handle bars folded down for easy stowage, I would have given 5 stars. If that's not an issue for you, then you cannot go wrong with this scooter.",

So far she has not wiped out once, and considering how much she rides it, that's a pretty big deal. I'm very glad we got this instead of the Razor scooter.",
