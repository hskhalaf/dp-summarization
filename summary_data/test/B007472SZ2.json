For that matter everything on this MacBook is supper fast. I was one of those long time PC owners that finally gave up because a quality PC laptop is now more than my MacBook Pro Retina. The Retina display is very impressive. I was most surprisee by web pages. They are so much better than clearer than on my 14\" Acer. If you are on the fence between moving away from PCs to Macs I can say come on in the water is fine.",

Quite a few actually since I buy them for the whole family, and usually upgrade to new ones and ebay last years models. It is way faster than my Dell laptop, mainly when starting up, or waking up. Same with updating software including the OS. I'm done with Microsoft - only reason I waited so long is this computer is EXPENSIVE. Oh, the latest OS upgrade is FREE from Apple, as opposed to the usual $120 or more for Windows upgrades that are usually buggy for quite a while",

Also like the fact that it has a solid state hard drive. Not so sure about apple ditching the CD drive but so far I haven't missed it too much. I am very happy with my purchase so far.",

This is a fantastic piece of hardware, but it is expensive and there are probably more cost-effective options for most people. I'm a photography hobbyist, and a sucker for high-detail, crisp images; after seeing my photos on the Retina, it really does make everything else (even 1080 HD) look like pixilated rubbish. Also, this is the first Apple computer I've owned, and I have to say I really like Mountain Lion. So, as with most Apple products, if you can stomach the cost then you'll get a beautifully designed, high-quality product.",

I can't tell that much difference between it and my I Mac I bought 5 years ago. So little difference I called Apple to make sure my serial # was correct for Retina display. Total hype as far as I'm concerned.",
