The real adventure was configuring the ISP's modem-router hybrid into a bridge successfully, but none of those travails were the fault of this router.",

He assisted with getting email notifications working (had to toggle enable authentication) and he agreed to include fix in the next firmware update to eliminate having to toggle authentication (current FW is 1.02). There is also a problem with recovering the internet connection after a power outage. The router requires a power cycle to recover internet connection after the modem powers back up (modem is Motorola SB6121 SURFboard). Also, they will address the router time being off by one hour (DST and time zones settings correct; however, time was not). Website filter feature works well and functions as expected.",

The D-Link admin interface is still as excellent and intuitive as always, and it just got set up and worked fine, including the separate printer driver for my ancient HP 1200 Laser Printer.
