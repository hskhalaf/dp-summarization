Thinking about it now, and I should take 2 stars! Lol! Anywho give them a try!",

These are still very comfortable insoles, however, the fabric acts as an anti-friction, with only the foam, the insole wants to pull from my boots when taking them off. I have emailed timberland directly, that was several days ago and no response. I just wanted them to be aware of the quality control issue.",

That\u2019s the intended purpose so I was okay with that. That being said they\u2019re extremely comfortable and dry rather quickly. For being so thick the insoles dry very fast. Excellent heel cup design. Shock and impact absorbing. When I walk I strike down my heel rather hard and the insoles handle it no problem. Great product.",

The Timberland is very close to the same construction but just a touch better at giving me more positive balance. Also it is just as comfortable. I've already ordered two more pairs",

Also important to mention, is that these boots have an internal metguard, which is protection for the top of the foot. These Timberland Pro insoles are great because they provide excellent comfort while maintaining a lower profile. Some insoles are too thick, which tends to raise the foot within the boot smashing is against the metguard inside. Super easy to trim, I used the original Red Wing insoles as a template and trimmed around with a pair of scissors. After only one day I can tell the difference.",

So I bought the timberland insoles.

He noticed a difference the very first time wearing them. He said his back pain was almost instantly relieved and after 2 nights it is all but gone. I will update later as to how long they last but for now we are very pleased.",
