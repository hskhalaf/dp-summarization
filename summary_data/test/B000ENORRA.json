I can definitely feel the increase resistance when using these gloves. good quality and inexpensive, compared to what others talked about. Also, make sure you look at the size. I have regular size hands and had a hard time fitting into the medium size. However, once I used them, my fingers were eventually fit.",

She used it about maybe 10-15 times the most and the right handed glove is already falling apart. The rubber coating has come off and now the material is flaking apart. The left glove is holding up like I hoped it would though. She of course uses both hands the same way, does nothing different with either glove and yet, they aren't the same. UPDATE: Sent a seller an inquiry about the warranty... they told me I need to contact the manufacturer. Well that wasn't very helpful now was it. Pretty disappointed!",
