I haven\u2019t needed to wash it yet since I haven\u2019t spilled any liquid on it. Anything else just stays off from the good ol shake before we fold it. Putting it on top of dewy wet grass is definitely dry on top and you can sit on it without soakin your tush.",

I bought this to use for picnics and never expected we'd rely so heavily on it daily. It's thin but sturdy, lays flat easily, and is perfect for a large floor space for a baby on the move.

We have used it to picnic in snowy areas and wet areas and haven't had an issue with water soaking through. It is also lightweight and folds up easily. I love the colors and design.
