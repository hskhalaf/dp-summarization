I have also tossed out the counter toaster, this one tool does most of the crisps-ing job done: toasts, grilled cheese (melt the cheese a bit in your microwave first), french fries, sweet potato fries (get those frozen bags from the store), grilled chicken, grilled fish, korean Kalbi BBQ, you name it! The product continues to perform the same after 2 years. The bottom bucket lining does have wear-and-tear chipping off but since it doesn't really touch the food, I don't worry about it much. I do wish they have replacement bucket only available though.",

      "text": "I have never been happier with the purchase of a small kitchen appliance. Not only does it make great fries with practically no oil, saving hundreds of calories, but makes great crispy \"fried chicken.\" It is also the best way to reheat a slice of pizza, leaving the crust crispy and the top bubbly. Gone are the days of the gummy crust produced by microwave re-heating. I recently used it to re-heat General Tsao chicken and was delighted with the crunchy texture and caramelized glaze. It has earned a permanent place on my counter.",

I followed the directions a number of times, but they never turned out great. They were \"okay\", but vastly inferior to frozen fries (prepared in the Philips).",

I've cooked steak, burgers, personal frozen pizzas, fish & chicken (both breaded and non), and it makes some pretty awesome grilled cheese sandwiches. It is fast, efficient, and easy to clean. Make sure to use some type of non stick cooking spray. I found an avocado oil spray at the grocer and it works well. The basket and tray are easy to clean with just a little soapy warm water. Pictured is a sirloin steak sandwich. Cooked on 390, 4 minutes on each side with salt, pepper, and butter. Put the bread in for the last 45 seconds to give it a nice crisping.",

Very easy to clean. And lasting a long time for what we put it through. We even bought a backup AirFryer in case the one we bought goes out. The 1st one we bought is still going strong with no visual loss in frying capabilities. We highly recommend this product!",
