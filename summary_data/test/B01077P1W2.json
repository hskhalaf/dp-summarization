I get that this is designed as an attachment but this product could benefit from a heavy base plate should you work out like I do-no power rack.

      "text": "It works well. The movement is smooth and easy to get the barbell in and out. Due to space limitations, it made more sense to mount it to my weight tree instead of the power cage. It lifts the weight tree slightly causing a slight wobble, but when I put the weight back on the tree, the wobble stopped. So, I'd this device is not as ideal as one purpose built for your particular power cage (and when I buy a Rogue or Force USA cage, I'll probably get their branded landmine), but for now this thing works great and the price is good.",
