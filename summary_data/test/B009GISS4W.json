I bought a set of Victorinox 4-3/4-Inch Straight-Edge Pointed-Tip Steak Knife, Set of 6 with Rosewood Handles along with a Mercer Culinary Genesis 8-Inch Forged Bread Knife to round out the set. She is thrilled with the quality of these products",

After using normal(??) carving forks with tines that are 3-4\" in length, the long tines on this fork is an absolute joy to work with. If you do not particularly care for the knife, buy the set for the fork, and relegate the knife to your junk drawer. I have never had a carving fork before like this, it is wonderful.",
