Then next if your dog has a blanket throw it in with the cushion and eventually the dog should be all comfy and snuggled up inside.",

      "text": "We adopted two young cats, one of which is a Maine Coon mix, so we needed to get a cat cubby that would be big enough for in the future when the Maine Coon gets bigger - she\u2019s not even a year and is already a big girl! The 19\u201d size is perfect - while our cats are young at the time of this review, and both can easily fit inside to snuggle, I have confidence that as the Maine Coon gets even bigger she won\u2019t have any issues fitting inside. The opening and the inside of the cubby are nice and big. Both cats love the softness of the cushion inside, and I catch them lounging in it frequently.",

The insert has fluff in it that starts to ball up within a few months of having it too, especially if you have a burrower.

      "text": "My older kitty has never been very social and when grandchildren are at my house, she feels very vulnerable and goes looking for a place to hide and be invisible til they leave. I bought this to give her convenient place to do that. I put it in a barely visible corner of my bedroom, tossed in a little catnip and a kitty treat or two and walked away. It took her a day or two, but once she discovered it, she loved it. I can\u2019t even tell when she\u2019s in her bed because she\u2019s dark and so is the interior of her world. She now has a safe, comfortable, inconspicuous place to hide out.",
