The seal retains odor of whatever you cooked. I smell curry constantly now. 2. All of the recipes for baked/roasted chicken just result in a mushy, grey-ish chicken with gooey skin. 3. It doesn't have a manual time option like the Insta-Pot brand one. 4. The trivet doesn't have handles so lifting out whole chickens is impossible.

I appreciate that this product is easy to use, includes thorough instructions and a recipe book with recommendations on cook times and dishes, and comes with all the features / programs of the popular Instant Pot without the high price tag. For all the options that the Instant Pot provides -- pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, saute, yogurt maker, warmer -- this product does, too. For half the price.",
