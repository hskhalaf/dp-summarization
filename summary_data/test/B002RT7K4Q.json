      "text": "A great tool for contractor use. As long as you have plenty of charged batteries these drills will keep up with what I consider medium to light heavy duty use. Sometime a corded drill is the only way to go. But in the HVAC trade 90 percent of the time this is all we need. Residential use is a bit overkill and Dewalt makes a wonderful 12 volt series. Go with the 20 volt if you are upgrading. We have so many 18 volt tools its hard to upgrade just because the 20 volt is the new fad. Make sure you check the capacity of the batteries. 20 volt batteries are not all the same capacity.",

No listening to my loud compressor in the back ground and being able to change tires (check your torque) and just general automotive work without all the hassle is well worth it. The thing that would make this the perfect driver would be an adjustable torque setting like a drywall clutch. Buy it. It will change your life if you don't have one.",

When you are in an awkward spot or pushing on a screw it can be hard to feather a trigger just right. It's a minor thing to over come and it has gotten easier to handle with time. Good balance and power, be cautious not to strip screws. With the correct \"bit kit\" this tool can do amazing things.",

      "text": "Buy this. It is SO much better than using a drill/driver combo to drive any type of large screws. It drastically cuts the time and effort required and I strip half as many screws and I did before. The tool itself is high quality and can get quite a bit of usage out of one charge (battery not included). Do note though that it can be fairly loud, as I'd expect with and impact driver.",

Powerful, day-long operation and quick-attach chuck make this impact driver a joy to use. Can use the newer 20v Li-Ion as well as the older 18v NiCad batteries. Just make sure to buy higher-quality driver bits since the torque and impact this tool creates will chew through lesser bits.",

I have now built multiple decks with it and many other projects. I don't know how I got along without it. Recommend getting the 3 piece extension socket set to make it even more valuable tool.You won't be sorry. .",
