I\u2019ve been trying to learn an instrument my entire life. It seems I\u2019ve tried everything. But this is so simple and easy. The bluetooth settings latched onto the ukulele immediately. The videos were clear and not too much to take in at once. And then...I was playing. Everything works perfectly, like magic. Very happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "Just started with this, it is a lot of fun, but I'm taking a star off because the app was difficult to load on my Amazon Fire tablet. If the app was available for download for the Fire tablet, I would give it 5 starts. Very good quality instrument, and I thought bag that came with the accessories pack was unexpectedly high quality. the search yields: We didn't find results for \"populele\" in Apps & Games. Since I bought this for use with the app, not having the app on the Amazon store is a concern. (note: The app runs fine on my Fire tablet, it is simply not available to download as one normally would from the Amazon Appstore)",

      "text": "Great gift for my (almost) teenage daughter. It slowly shifts her attention from her phone or iPad towards something more creative. Right out of the box the Populele sound amazing. Tuning it was a breeze with the help of the app. The many songs on the library are all famous hits of her generation. She spent the entire first day playing her populele. Just small breaks for charging - which was relatively quick. Great idea. I think I may get one myself",

The quality of the instrument as well as the packaging really impressed me. This is made to a much much higher standard than my friend\u2019s cheaper ukulele. This does not feel like a toy, it is a real instrument. The app has been great for me in learning and I haven\u2019t had any glitches like some other reviewers have stated. And the song library has a lot of popular songs. This is a great ukulele and I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in learning to play.",

My 10 year old and 8 year old really enjoy the game aspect of learning and chord lights, it makes practice something they enjoy. I just wish there were more songs and more depth to the app, and it would be great to have multiple users and time tracking for each users. But overall I highly recommend it for young and old.",
