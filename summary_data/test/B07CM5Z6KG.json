Original: I picked this one to see if it was a hobby I would enjoy. However, there were no instructions, all beads were loose in a big bag, so my first project was to sort them all into the acrylic holder. There was a separate clear bag with the wires and fasteners. I found several empty bags in the big one so I am not sure what was supposed to be in them. Not a good start with this company.",

If it were not for the plastic bag around the case, more beads would have been lost. I don't know if any beads were actually lost since there is not an actual inventory of how many beads should be in each section, but some of the sections were a little low after sorting out all the beads. The kit did have an assortment of beads and findings. I was just hoping for more than the one page instruction sheet for pattern suggestions.",
