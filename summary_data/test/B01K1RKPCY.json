However I cannot In good faith leave a good review because this grill broke when he opened it right out of the box on first use. When you try to adjust the knob to change the floating top plate and how high it hovers above the food, the cheap silver plastic in the back cracked. Everything looks durable except that cheap plastic in the back! Why make that part with cheap materials when it is going to be subject to the most motion and stress and near heat? De Longhi should look into making that part out of quality material.",

I made Persian kabob with it, tasting maybe even better than charcoal- barbecued by especially restaurants, I guess the tenderness is because it does not dry the red meat or chicken.
