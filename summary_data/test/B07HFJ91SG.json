This way there is more room for the important info and the tags are interchangeable between different dogs. I like this better than the dangling tags because it's silent and it's less likely for the dog to get its collar caught on something. Also I don't want a ring on the collar because we use harnesses for walks.",

Once it arrived, I was worried it wouldn't fit or break when trying to put it on the collar yet it pretty thick and stretched to fit over the buckles no problem. I only had 2 lines on the tag so you can see dog name/my phone number very easily. The dog doesn't even notice it is on. Highly Highly recommend.",
