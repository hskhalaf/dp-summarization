When i turned on the Xbox and loaded up the Razer app, i noticed right away this controller had stick drifting on the left analog stick. It was an unfortunate first time experience with this controller, so i am sending it back for a refund. May try my luck another time but I'm a little concerned with quality control, from my own experience and other reviews.",

Razer if you're reading this, I have a support ticket open for this and it's been 14 days and I haven't heard from your support team. My case # is 201003-001734. I don't recommend this one as the controller can't hold up to normal use and Customer Service has yet to respond to me.",

Having gone through four Elite controllers, I feel more confident in the Wolverine's design and quality than the Elite series. The Wolverine is not over engineered, which is why I think it is able to be sold at a lower price point than the Elites. The Wolverine is not some shoddy knock off, it is well made and sturdy.",

The weight on this controller is significantly less than the Elite so it\u2019s more comfortable. The button placement/style means almost 0 accidental pushes of the buttons (Elite owners know the pain). Wolverine is a corded controller but comes with plenty of cable to reach the Xbox. Wolverine requires an app to be downloaded to your Xbox to customize the controller. App is extremely easy to use and almost every minor detail of the controller can be custom configured.

I wish the cable was one solid link to the USB for that reason, but my point still stands that the controller still works flawlessly after I figured out that little hiccup.",

You have to push the power on the Xbox itself. I don't like having to get up to turn my Xbox one. They could easily fix this with a firmware update.",
