I had just opened my pool and it needed to be vacuumed. I added the leaf canister and I am one happy girl. With the additional hose, it gets to my entire pool and doesn't get tangled.

We then called in a professional pool service and they couldn't get it to work either. Save your money and sanity hire a pool service to vaccum your pool(my pool company charges $35.00 very two weeks) to come home to a chemically balanced clean pool.

I have found that if I put a skimmer filter sock on before I hook Wanda up, it improves her cleaning power because the sock catches even the fine dirt. Using the skimmer sock with Wanda decreases the number of times that I have to back wash the sand filter. I get up in the morning, fix my coffee, hook Wanda up, and by the time breakfast is complete Wanda has the pool ready for the grandchildren.",

My above ground pool is a little larger than most, so I needed some additional hoses. Instead of paying $15 per section, I went ahead and bought another complete system. When my original Wanda bites the dust, Wanda #2 will be ready. I purchased the collection canister system and glad I did, because it was needed the way Wanda connected to my pool. UPDATE: Starting season #2 and Wanda is going strong. One of the best purchases I've made in a long time.",

Backflush the pool filter, 2. Check the bottom of the device for clogs , and 3. Check the hose for air.",
