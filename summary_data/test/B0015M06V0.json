I love that the sheath comes with a built in sharpener, and the knife handle is very beefy and ergonomic. Knife blade as with most Gerber knives is sharp as always and retains an edge well. And you can turn this into a spear if a survival need for that ever arose. Super useful outdoor knife, and probably one of the best.",

Nothing else it wrong with it, perfect knife. Update: Basically all the paint came off, so I scraped the rest off. The little plastic supports at the base of the blade broke, but I don't blame them since I was using the knife as a hatchet. I should've just used an ax, but I was too lazy to grab one. The blade wiggles around just a little, but it is my own doing so the knife rates 10 stars. I would definitely recommend this knife to anybody.",

When does that ever happen? Thank you Gerber!! For the same price as a take-out dinner or couple of pizzas you can own a legacy, made in USA, premium knife. I say tack $25 onto the price and contribute the proceeds to a suitable Veterans charity. I'd be more than happy to.",

I clip it onto the MOLLE velcro at the lower end of the sheath so I can carry two knives in one place. Comes with a sharpener built into the sheath, but I recommend buying a Smith's as well for the serrated parts. Also it's kind of a drag to fit the knife through the small sharpening slot in the sheath with each draw, and hard to match the curve of the blade at the end with this method. Don't get me wrong... I like the feature, and I can see it would be good to have in a pinch.",

      "text": "This is an excellent example of a Fighter style of knife. The weight was surprisingly comfortable, and the full tang construction ensures the knife will never let you down in a pinch. Came out of the box razor sharp, and also includes built in sharpener in the sheath. Attachment options are plentiful, and it also came with a separate seatbelt cutter. Awesome grip purchase, easy to hold, and great integrated glass breaker.",

If I lost this one, I'd buy another one. For all the knives in this category, it's a coin flip as to which one is best. Sure you'll find a bunch of anecdotal reasons for buying this knife over that one, but in truth...it's mostly preference. Survival has a lot less to do with the tool and a lot more to do with the skill, knowledge, fitness, and cunning of the individual using the tool/s.",

At $67 (current price on Amazon) it's a great value for a 420HC full tang survival knife. If it weren't serrated, it would be my primary camping/survival knife.",

      "text": "Not being a knife expert the finer details or lack thereof won't be obvious to me, but first impression this is a heavy duty knife. Feels solid, balanced, and comfortable in hand. I didn't buy it for day-to-day use, but for in an emergency use. Holding it conveys a confidence that if needed, it would do the job without fail. The sheath is somewhat large and would take a beating without the knife being damaged. Multiple carry options with the straps or using other means with the eyelets.",

I am not a hunter but I have taken this knife on a few camping trips and used it lightly around the yard, but it is made to be worked hard and take the abuse if need be. It does have a couple of holes by the handle and can be used as a spear or a makeshift harpoon. Overall, would probably be most useful for someone in the field or a hunter as it is too large to be carried around or perform everyday task. Still, it is a very well made knife.",

Not a bad thing at all in either case. Can be attached to almost anything, including molle straps. Butt can be used as a hammer or a glass breaker. You won't be doing any framing with it, but seems like it would work for small nailing in a pinch. Handle is supposedly highly non-conductive, though I haven't and probably won't be testing this feature. It is pretty comfortable, however. Overall, I'm very happy with this knife and been showing off to everyone.",

The sharpener is insane (I cut myself real bad when I tried how sharp the knife was after sharpening it for the first time). 4 stars because of already mentioned problems: Pulling the knife out of the sheath is rather hard, so is putting it back in. Initially the straps around the handle were very hard to close, but they've stretched over time and are perfect now. I've tried to strap the knife around my calf (diver style), but getting the knife out and in is really tough. In Europe this knife retails for over 200$.",

If you don't mind the weight, this knife can be sharpened pretty good and will even work as a skinning knife if carefully used. When used for skinning, it really does well at opening chest cavities and quartering. Overall, it is worth the price.",

Former military man, Jeff Freeman led the charge to engineer this fearless new 10\" survival knife. And we field-tested with the troops. This knife is as adaptable as the personnel who carry it. Use it to cut through the skin of a fuselage. Or sever a seat belt. Or egress through the Plexiglas of a chopper. Plus, the LMF II does a slick job cutting firewood and building shelter. The over-molded handle successfully limits blistering. There is complete separation between the tang and butt cap, so the knife absorbs the shocks from hammering and prevents the shocks of electricity. Smartly situated grooves and lashing holes let the LMF II convert to a spear. The low-profile sheath facilitates movement, limits noise, works for parachuting, and attaches to a belt or MOLLE vest. The patented, integrated sharpener means edge retention in the field.",
