We upgraded our service to a 400mbps because we have a gamer in the house plus about 14 connected devices on our wi-if. The MB7621 is rated to provide up to 1000mbps as oppposed to 100mbps that the Motorola SB6141 tops out at. Every speed test I have performed since activating has delivered 375-395mbps. The difference is remarkable! Note: With Spectrum, I had to call them up and lt them activate and register the MB7621. It took maybe 5 minutes.",

The ratings on Amazon can be skewed and all over the place. There is no modem that doesn't have a few bad ratings. Some people have difficulties installing a modem, or making it work, and hop on Amazon and give it a bad rating.

Because according to Comcast, it only supports 800Mbps and was incompatible with my 1000Mbps subscription. My only options are to downgrade my subscription (which stunningly would raise my monthly bill, thanks Comcast), or get a new modem.

      "text": "Modem was shipped without a shipping box....it was shipped in its shrink wrapped packaging and nothing more...which was a bit odd. After hooking it up Charter would not recognize hardware as Motorola but as some odd off brand product and would not connect to it. After getting charter support on the phone, they were able to recognize the model of the hardware and remote enable it confirming that its max download speed is around 400 mb/s which seemed low. So far performance has been solid so I hope that is the worst of it.",
