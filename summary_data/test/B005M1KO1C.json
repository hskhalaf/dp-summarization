The sound quality is excellent, they are extremely comfortable, and I've had no quality issues at all - I've read some of the negative reviews, and I can't relate. I've got several other earbuds but I still really like and use these a lot. They aren't wireless, so I don't use them for exercising, but I use these for work and personal phone calls and listening to music and podcasts when I'm not moving around. No complaints!",

Beyond that, the app doesn't work with Sirius, Spotify, or my podcast app. Good hardware with bad software has ruined this product. I did not see anything about this not working when I made my purchase, so I hope this saves someone the grief. I cannot link to the app on the play store, but it is very easy to find.

Within 6 months the right headphone intermittently stopped working. Then it stopped for a month, and now it's back to an intermittent status. Since it is still under warranty I called Klipsch for repair or replacement. Before being allowed to return I needed to email the receipt along with shipping information and phone number. Once that information is reviewed Klipsch will determine if they will accept it as a return or repair. Consider passing on this brand for one that offers higher quality products.",

This has happened to many of my headphones so it's not atypical. However, Klipsh should figure out a way to prevent this from happening. Also I've tried running/jogging in these headphones, but they either slide off or get clogged with sweat (gross).",

The reason for this is the virtually useless app you're supposed to download to facilitate the control. It sucks. Click twice to skip tracks? 60% of the time it pauses. OK, so click once to un-pause? No. Doesn't work. I like Klipsch headphones and I will probably order more, but I don't see the point bothering with this gimmick again.",

      "text": "Bought these based on Klipsch's good reviews online. They were great for about 5 months. Then, the right ear stopped working. Klipsch has a two-year warranty, but would not return or exchange, because I bought them on Amazon from \"DirectDeals4U.\" They are not an \"authorized reseller.\" So, neither the seller or the manufacturer would provide a solution...not even an exchange, or willingness to repair. Don't buy these, and definitely don't buy from unauthorized resellers!",

My only issue with them is the wire is sticky which could be a good thing so it doesn't slide around but if you run the wire inside your shirt it sort of tacks on your collar and when turn you head it feels like they might pull out of your ear. The tackyness of the wire does not help with untangling either. I would definitely buy them again for the price and quality.",

The Klipsch isolate outside noise better, but the Bose are better fitting, more comfortable, and sound better. My ears are not the same as yours, however. Your mileage may vary.",
