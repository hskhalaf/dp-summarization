We are not the only ones to have this issue...clearly the company should address this issue!!!!",

Starting is easy. Push in the knob, hear the gas, turn knob to activate ignition and thats it. And if you want a taller flame, you can adjust the air valve on the neck of the supply tube in the area below the table. Shipping was easy, arriving in only 3 days. We give it 5 stars.",

So, I made my own out of a $20 box of porcelain tile from the hardware store. Also, the starter is pretty finicky.

Also, only ignited 1 out of 4-8 times so you get a pretty big gas light-off when it finally ignites. Called \"customer service\" . Arrogant and rude insisting the igniter is working fine. She stated it should ignite within 1-3 attempts. It takes much more than that. After over 30 minutes on the phone of arguing and counting the positive spark percentages of less than 10%, they agreed to send a new ignition cable.",

Once it was delivered, it only took me about an hour to put it together using the extremely thorough instructions. We were enjoying the table shortly afterward. We made a great choice, the table is well built and beautiful. We bought the glass guard that goes around the fire portion and that is also beautiful and well built. You can't go wrong with this purchase. I would encourage that if you are interested in a fire table, look no further than this one, you won't be disappointed.",

The glass remained securely strapped in place. Then after installing the bottom shelf and sides, I cut off the straps. Voila. Had a little trouble attaching the long side panels, one panel didn't fit well, so I just tried switching the panels and they fit perfectly. Can't wait to try it out now. Looks great.",

Assembly was easy, with only one or two decisions that could be confusing. Hardware is stainless and the fittings are very solid. All of the materials are of high quality. It took about 20 minutes to unpack and assemble. We hooked up a tank and it fired right up.",
