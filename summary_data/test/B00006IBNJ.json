My point is'\"don't expect 1 application, and the label will drop off, because it won't. An application of lacquer thinner or alcohol will work just about as well as this product, however using this product is safer. I'm satisfied with \"Goo Gone\"",

Sometimes, you don't want to advertise as a form of decorating! I bought this Goo Gone Adhesive Remover to remove the adhesive off of wine bottles. With this product, the adhesive nearly SLID OFF! It was a little messy and slippery, but after washing and drying the bottle, it was as good as new. I would definitely recommend this item for DIY-ers or anyone else who may need to remove adhesive off of any type of surface.",
