They have several clever methods for mounting them to most of the typical locations in a car/truck. They sound good, a touch bright and harsh( I'm a soft dome fella!) but with some tuning they do the trick. They're small and unbtrusive and that's what I was looking for. Classic JBL build quality was also expected and evident. Thumbs up!!",

Mounted inside one of the provided surface mount cups, they fit tight inside the original opening; only they do not \"snap\" in. 6 to 8 small spots of silicone, and they hold like a rock. Just spot them like the original speakers were done, and they really hold in there, with no modification - well, other than splicing the wiring. Did I already say WOW?",

      "text": "These tweeters are super harsh! Yes, they are clear, but definitely not soft or pleasant. If you want good quality without losing your hearing, you have to go with Morel tweeters. I am replacing these JBL's with Morel next week. On the other note: they fit easily in my Honda Accord 2016. Stock tweeter enclosures have to be slightly shaved in order to fit these with provided adapters. Sound quality is generally wonderful, but I just need something more balanced and less sharp.",
