The before picture is kind of frightening, no filter, no makeup and purposely trying to show off my uneven skin tone and wrinkles! So humbling.",

The slight hyperpigmentation at my hairline seems to be fading and the dark spots from my acne seem to be lightening as well. I am using this serum with my retinoid (Differin) and my skin seems to be more \u201cglowy\u201d and just better overall. I don\u2019t see a dramatic difference, I\u2019ve been using this product for a month, but there is a difference nonetheless. I don\u2019t see a difference in fine lines. *Mine came with an offer for a free bottle if I left a review.",

I was surprised to learn it worked better than the more costly product I had been using. Rather than scrimping, I now feel I can use the serum on my face, neck, and at times, the backs of my hands. A little goes a long way, but it's nice knowing that yes, it will last at least a month - actually more. It also makes my skin feel very soft, and I can layer with other products or wear alone. I plan to continue with this product! Many Thanks!",
