These cat treats are amazing, It has a slight calming effect on him but he does not freak out. He still gets all cuddly and purrs like crazy after having a couple. This was a good alternative for a needy, anxiety ridden little kitty! Would highly recommend!",

I just hope having 2 or more containers open won\u2019t allow them to go bad or lose flavor.",

      "text": "Temptations have been my cat's favorite treats since he was a kitten. He's 12 years old now and still meows for them every morning. He's tried all the flavors and likes them all, but the catnip flavor is one of his favorites. I love that these treats come in a 16oz tub with a easy flip top lid.",

Yet I can't afford freeze dried salmon for my fur babies.",
