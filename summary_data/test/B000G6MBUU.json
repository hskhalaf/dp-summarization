Halfway into the consumption after finishing about 6 bags noticed that the expiration dates had already passed by 4 months. So I checked the remaining 8 packets and they too were all expired over 4 months. Shocked and disappointed that Amazon could not check something so basic. My bad for being so trusting. Anyway checked local stores and found the same item in Who.....ds for 25 cents cheaper per bag. And expiration dates 6 months out. I guess I will be shopping there in future for this item.",

For me, the 5-ounce bags take two servings to satisfy, but that's plenty. I definitely recommend these for those who love spicy chips with the right mix of flavors.",

Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.",
