      "text": "Great looking toilet. I love the flat lid on the tank. It is smooth on the sides, as the trap is not visible. So much easier to clean w/o all those nooks & crannies that trap dust. This is in my guest powder room. It also flushes very well and quietly. I couldn\u2019t believe how quiet it is. Not at all like the cheap American Standard it replaced, that continually plugged up. When the plumber arrived and saw it, he said \u2018you bought a really fancy one, which is an great choice for guests\u2019. I got the slow closing lid & love that too:",

Terrible way to ship a toilet. If you buy this toilet make sure you have a large vehicle large enough to haul it from the post office to your home........",

Unfortunately, it took a second delivery because the first bowl was broken around the bottom edges where it touches the floor (the decorative area). Amazon was easy to work with to get a second shipment delivered. The second shipment was packaged very differently, with the more fragile edges protected with better packing materials. Overall, this design works perfectly, and looks great. Amazon was able to deliver four days sooner than any other supplier we found.",

The height is necessary for lack of physical capacity to use lower-height toilets. When the product arrived, we observed the toilet received was a 17 inch model. We called customer service and explained the problem and we were veery cordially treated and appreciated the help. We were obliged to re-pack the item and return it which we did. The supposedly correct replacement was sent but it was again the wrong model so we declined to accept it and it was returned. The problem appears to be in the product coding by the manufacturer, Koehler.",
