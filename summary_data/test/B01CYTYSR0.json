      "text": "I may get all sorts of crap for this but whatever.. I bought this for my 14 pound Jack Russell. She\u2019s my first dog ever and the aging process is harder on me than it is on her. I didn\u2019t know how she would react when trying to put her in it but it was no problem at all and within 4-5 minutes, she was totally asleep! I like to think she fell asleep so fast because she\u2019s close to me but more than likely, it\u2019s becwuse of the warmth. I love listening to her little heart beat! I highly highly recommend this for any dog mom or dad!!!",

Sometimes I even use just around the house when baby is fussy. The only thing I have to say is that the directions that came with the wrap were not clear, but I easily found a YouTube video which showed me how to use it correctly. Great purchase this is a must have item :)",

I tried making knot tighter so material will have room to stretch And still stay tight but I didn\u2019t like how uncomfortable and flat baby looked in.
