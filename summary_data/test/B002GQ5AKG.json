There are couple of reviews on here about them being unable to drill through stainless and the bits were ruined when used on a keg. But after using these bits \u201cthe proper way\u201d they will drill like higher end step drill bits. Drill a pilot hole, use a slower drill speed, cooling oil and firm pressure these will drill through almost anything and will last. I have made 10 holes in 304L stainless varying from 7/8\u201d to 1-1/4\u201d and bits are still in great shape.",

If you're a residential electrician who has to make the occasional modification to a box and you have no step bits... these are more than enough. If you're a commercial electrician who debates sending a particular common used metal box to a metal fab, in bulk, for a common punch out modification but wonders if a step bit will get you by, you 'might' want to try these, but one of those seemingly expensive sets might be more in order for remedying an issue in the field. Though, if you're the latter and successful, you're not gonna quible over price, are ya?",

After only a few seconds of drilling the bits were dull, bent, and smoking. My sheet was coarsely disfigured and smoking as well.

I've used them on plastic and up to 20ga steel and aluminum plate without issue. I get clean holes every time and the case is a great addition where many others just send you the bits in a blister pack. I'll recommend these to anyone.",

The one thing i will say is that they are titsnium coated bits, and will probably dull a little quicker than a higher priced bit, but at this price replacement is very affordable. Great set!",

The bits looked new so I decided to keep them. The case would have been beat up in a month anyhow so I kept the whole thing. The largest bit in this set sells for 50$ at Home Depot and it does not come with a case so I am pleased with the 30$ I paid on Amazon. I just wish they would have described the case as \"used\" because mine was definitely just that. The bits are a 5star but the case is a 1star.",
