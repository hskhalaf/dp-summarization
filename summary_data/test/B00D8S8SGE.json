The body hair shaver seems to work correctly since it doesn't have the same exposed blades but uses another attachment instead.. Really disappointed about it since i thought switching to this brand would be quite positive..",

It is relatively effective (not great) for shaving my head without the attachment but the minute I try to groom my beard with he attachment beard hair quickly (within one stroke) clogs the shaver and limits its effectiveness. Even after cleaning (after every stroke) the razor does not trim uniformly to the setting (3 & 4 are the worst).
