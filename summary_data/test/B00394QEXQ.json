      "text": "I purchased these March last year. They have been on the roll cage of my jeep for a year now and are still working great. I'm driving them with a 45 watt/channel marine head unit, no external amp. They sound good. I was caught in a heavy downpour with the top off. Water was dripping off the radio and everything was soaked and through it all, these speakers kept on keeping on. The housing is a heavy plastic. Speakers can be replaced reusing the pods if that one day becomes necessary. The clamp is aluminum and it bites in good. They don't vibrate or move around.",

The sound is is a great improvement compared to my factory speakers, but I will need to add an amp to really enjoy the capabilities of these 600w speakers. Wiring is easy, and the billet aluminum mounting brackets are very secure. The wireless remote is needed to select and synchronize LED lighting effects, but once set up the light show begins automatically whenever the speakers are powered on.",

With two speakers mounted on wakeboard tower, we can comfortably hear music 65' behind boat when riding wakeboard. It's confusing that they say system, as there is only one speaker per purchase, but still a great value. I'm sure the name brand wake speakers are great, but for the money, you really cant beat these things! And the newest model with the big silver attachment clamp fits a 2.5\" Monster tower with no problem. Edit: 1.5 years after purchase with no issues whatsoever, still sound great.",

The bass and clarity of the highs and mids were Satisfying. I had high hopes for these speakers and I am not disappointed what so ever. 7/7/15 Update: Speakers are still doing awesome! They have been pressure washed and covered in mud and dust many times. Still impressed, Although the amp i paired them with is going to get replaced for poor efficiency. Takes wayy to much power cuts out. Going to try a MTX amp and see how that goes.",

    "description": "Style:6\" x 9\" Black Tower Speaker\n\nView larger FULLY MARINIZED (WATER RESISTANT WITH UV PROTECTION)\nThis product is fully marinized but not waterproof. Since the MRWT69 lives near the water almost all the time, all of the major components such as the spider, surround, etc. have been specially coated to have the protection that they need from corrosion that is present in a humid and salty environment. The outside shell also has an ultraviolet coating to protect it from the damaging effects of the sun by maintaining material integrity and keeping them looking new.\n\nCONE \u2013 POLY INJECTION\nPolyurethane, categorized as a polymer, is a resilient, flexible, and durable manufactured material that can take the place of paint, cotton, rubber, metal, or wood in thousands of applications across virtually all fields. It can be hard like fiberglass, squishy like upholstery foam, protective like varnish, bouncy like rubber, or sticky like glue. In the specific case of our cones, this material allows for maximum flexibility that produces great sounding speakers lasting you a long, long time.\n\nSURROUND \u2013 BUTYL RUBBER\nButyl Rubber is a synthetic (man made) substance and is valued for its chemical inertness, impermeability to air, and the ability to endure or resist exposure to many types of weather fronts. Butyl rubber has applications from sports equipment to automotive parts, the medical industry, and more. We use them for the surrounds that connect the cone to the basket. Did you know that most modern chewing gum uses food-grade butyl rubber as the central gum base, which contributes not only the gum's elasticity but an obstinate, sticky quality? Just like that chewing gum, the Butyl Rubber Surround in our speakers can take the equivalent amount of abuse without quitting on you.\n\nVOICE COIL \u2013 HIGH TEMPERATURE ALUMINUM\nOne of the most abundant elements on earth, Aluminum is remarkable for its low density and for its ability to resist corrosion. It is nonmagnetic (does not have any magnetic properties) and does not easily ignite. This solid material has the ability to perform under stress in both high tension and high compression environments. Aluminum is relatively soft, making it one of the more ideal materials to use in voice coils.\n\nMIDRANGE & TWEETER \u2013 MYLAR\nFor a modern edge, the best car speaker could be the high tech Mylar tweeter, as it generally has more ability for a wider variance of sound modifications and channel handling. Unlike paper cones, the Mylar has a higher rate of durability, as the cone is made of a plastic poly material, which does not rip or tear easily under abnormal frequency changes.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n * 6 x 9 inch, four-way Marine Waketower speaker system\n * Midrange: 2-1/2 inch\n * Tweeter: two 1 inch\n * Peak power: 550 Watts\n * RMS power: 275\n * Impedance: 4 Ohms\n *  Frequency response: 40Hz \u2013 20kHz\n * Sensitivity: 95 dB @ 1 W/1 Meter\n * Dimensions: 12.5\u201d L x 11.6\u201d W x 9.25 H\n * Is not sold in pairs\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nKeep the party going on your boat deck with this single Boss Audio MRWT69 6 x 9-inch four-way speaker, optimized for waketower use.
