It has enough power to wash your house siding, motocross bikes, cars, you name it, it does a great job. Especially like the soap dispenser. Just load the soap of your choice, lather the car, and rinse. My family loves it. All the different attachment heads can accomplish whatever your needs are. When you first hear it run or carry the unit you will notice the quality. Not something cheap like you find at your local discount store. The colors to choose from are also attractive.",

It was very easy to put together. The unit is very light and easy to move around. For normal household uses, this one will work great. We used it to power off the moss, clean my driveway, my car, house, and garage. In fact, very good cleaning the bricks of my garage. I feel like this has enough power to handle these jobs well, with the right price. Easy to carry, easy to use and the motor is very quieter. Thumbs up! I recommend it.",

And you will NOT pay more for that!",
      "IMPORTANT FEATURES: The next generation of power washers come with a 30ft long power cord and 20ft long hose. It also includes a soap dispenser (not built in, tough). This pressure washer is equipped with a micro switch sensitive to water flow. This Total Stop System (TSS) senses water flow in the pump.
