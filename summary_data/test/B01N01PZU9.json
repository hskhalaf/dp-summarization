No instructions as to where the monitor power supply should plug in to the monitor .. Says you can find video's for installation on youtube but I never found one and the ph number for them is a China number, Good clear pix but good luck on your hook up !!!",

The reverse light had a normal connect and so I crimped two spades and just pushed them. I could have attached to the wires instead, but I had the spades. The receiver just plugs into the cigarette lighter jack, so I coiled the excess wire and zip tied it and then pushed under the ashtray to look neater. Was quite quick. The whole things works very well.",

I loved the Option to hardwire verses just Wireless. Things I think could be better: I'm a Computer engineer, so splicing in power was simple, however my recommendation to the average Joe would be to buy some quick taps.

      "text": "This is a great set up,super easy to install. The kit comes with everything you need. It comes so you have your choice of hardwired or wireless. The only thing is,I wish I had gotten a bigger screen. But it will do great with the 4.3\" screen. The LED lights on the camera makes it easy to see at night. Overall I am very happy with my purchase,and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a back up camera.",

The license plate camera installs very easily. Finding and getting to reverse light wires in the trunk lid was the most difficult. Certainly, for cost it was well worth purchase. The instuctions could use some refinement. Other than that, I am very happy to know I will be safer when backing out of a parking space.",
