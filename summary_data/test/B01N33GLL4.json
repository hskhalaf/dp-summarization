My other travel bowl collapses to easily spilling (and wasting) the water that I carry for them. I like the Ruffwear bowl and two medium large dogs can drink at the same time (if I hold it). It is light weight and easy to carry in its folded position.",

She always pushes it closed and dog food always gets stuck in it while I'm opening or closing it. It's just okay in my opinion. I almost wish it was thicker material or something so she wouldn't crush it as easily. I wouldn't mind having a harder time closing it if it meant she wouldn't. I throw it in her dog food travel bag but it's really not my fav.",

It holds like 4 x 18oz bottles of water and is large, so perfect for big dogs or dogs with big noses. Highly recommend!",

There is a small cloth loop on the bottom to attach it to a small carabiner, but it isn't actually very practical. Not worth taking off a star since I keep it in a tote bag anyway. The worst part about it is that it's such an attractive dog bowl, if I accidentally leave it unattended, people will steal it (true story, this is my 2nd one).",
