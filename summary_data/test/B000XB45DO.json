      "text": "Bought this because my family tends to eat a lot of hamburgers, and I'm tired of hand-forming patties all the time. The pre-made patties at the store are usually made with crappy, cheap hamburger meat, so I buy the good stuff and make the patties at home, season them up, good stuff. I used a press like this 30 years or so ago as a teenager working in a restaurant, so it was a familiar experience getting used to it. Just make sure you also buy some of the \"patty papers\" to go with it so you can store them separately in the fridge or freezer.",

It just makes the burgers look so much better.",

I placed the ball between pre-cut wax paper sheets and backed off the adjustable screw by 1/2 turn. So easy and quick to pre-make a match of burgers that are all uniform in size. Makes for easier cooking, as they are all uniform. Place the sandwiched patties between wax paper sheets into the freezer for later. Frozen patties are easily separated and then cooked to taste.",

It is important to put the correct amount of meat into the press [it is adjustable] otherwise you may end up with something thinner on one side than the other. It takes some good amount of pressure, but that is to be expected with a light weight press. No sticking because I use burger paper on both top and bottom. Easy clean up because with the paper you don't \"press\" raw meat into the device. If you can live with a simple press then this could be just what you are looking for. Good value for cost.",

Further, the plate in the top that is moved by the ratty cast screw isn\u2019t even close to parallel with the bottom base plate and cannot remotely come close to producing an even patty thickness. Cannot recommend this product. I\u2019m returning it immediately without even trying it.",
