Spend a little more and get a 7000 series.",

The only disappointment is that the camera body is smaller than the D70 and there is not quite enough camera there for my average size hands to grasp. I prefer the size of the D70 in terms of how balanced it feels with a lens attached. That said, the camera works well and has a number of welcome features not on the D70. I will adjust in time.",

      "text": "This camera is just fantastic. I paired it with an 18-200mm lens, and while traveling through Alaska, it was great. It is much lighter than previous generations. My favorite feature, however, has to be the flip-out screen. While it is not needed 90% of the time, the 10% of the time that I use it, it allows me to get shots I couldn't otherwise get. Although the reviews say it doesn't handle as well as the D3100, which is true, it still handles very well, and feels at home with either my huge 18-200mm lens, or my small 18-55 lens (upgraded from the 18-55, but I still have it if I want a smaller lens or better macro).",

It has a lot of features I don't expect to use but that's what you have to accept to get the ones one wants. I was deciding between this and the D3200. The key features this had but were lacking on the D3200 were AEB and the movasble LCD screen which lets me avoid \"belly photography\" in some circumstances. It is an upgrade to my D60. Image quality nod definately better -- it's not just the pixel count -- specifcly lower noise (it doesn't change much from ISO100 levels ontill you approad ISO400), and EV range is about 2 stops greater.",

The Camera itself is a great step up from what is now my secondary camera, the D60. Focus is nice and crisp, and even on the Sports setting, the camera is lightning fast. There is a lot to this camera, so read the manual first ! ! I also purchased a battery grip for it, and you will find that does make up for the camera's compact size (the only drawback I have encountered so far). Great job Nikon.",

I'm not a professional photographer, this is just a very passionate hobby of mine, so this DLSR fits my needs perfectly in affordability and function.

CONs - Doesn't fly? RATING - 5 stars because there aren't anymore to give RECOMMEND - YES, I use this camera for everything taking pictures/video of the moon, California beach, road trips, hiking, family functions, holidays... practically everything you take pictures of and learning more every time I take it out.",

I considered the D7000, but in reality, I would never use the added feature set and have instead bought a 35mm Prime lens and an extra battery and am still $300 ahead!

At the default settings the jpegs are kinda soft, but if you shoot in RAW you can sharpen them up in ViewNX and they come out looking excellent.

The only bad thing about this cam is that the color is not as good as my old nikon d3100, maybe its just the settings, but other than that its amazing :)",

I'm used to a larger, heavier camera, so this one seems very light and about a finger's width too small; I was able to remedy that with a battery grip. Be aware that if your lenses aren't AF-S type, they will work with this camera but you will be limited to manual focus.",

I thought I had mastered everything I needed to master in the photography world. Then my shutter motor died. I was devastated. I bought this model after doing some research and have not been sorry. The only thing I don't like is it does go through the battery rather quickly ( when shooting long exposures) I will buy an extra battery and be hap hap happy!",

    "title": "Nikon D5100 16.2MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch Vari-Angle LCD Monitor (Body Only)",
    "description": "Style:Body Only| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nikon D5100 offers a host of new photographic and video tools that deliver superior performance and exceptional image quality with surprising versatility. With 16.2 megapixels, a swivel Vari-Angle LCD monitor, full HD movie capabilities, new EFFECTS Mode and new HDR setting, you hold the power and performance to capture beautiful moments and the freedom to get creative.\n\n\n\n\nVARI-ANGLE LCD MONITOR\nCREATIVITY FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW\nTake pictures or record movies from a unique viewpoint, the D5100\u2019s 3.0 inch, super sharp, 921,000-dot Vari-angle LCD monitor allows for versatile high quality viewing and playback. Explore every angle, with overhead shots, waist level candids, ground level and fun self portraits; you will never miss a shot. This Vari-angle monitor allows you to be creative from any point of view.\n\n\n\n\n\nEFFECTS MODE\nMORE FUN AND ARTISTIC PICTURES AND MOVIES\nThe D5100 incorporates an amazing array of special effects for use when taking still pictures or recording D-Movie Full HD movies. Selective Color isolates any color within the scene, capture details in places too dark for your own eyes using Night Vision, create bright, glowing images filled with atmosphere with High Key, emphasize the mood of a scene using Low Key, Miniature Effect makes a scene look like a miniature scale model and Color Sketch creates color outlines of the subject that are played back as a series of stills in a slide show.\n\n\n\n\n\nTELL BETTER STORIES\nFULL HD 1080P D-MOVIE WITH SOUND\nThe D5100 delivers exceptionally high-quality movie performance due to its full HD capability while the latest in full-time autofocus takes the guess work out of tracking your subjects while in motion. Effortless moviemaking is at your fingertip thanks to D5100\u2019s ergonomically placed Live View and Movie start button. Your D-Movies will come to life thanks to D5100\u2019s sound recording capability \u2014 get stereo sound with Nikon\u2019s optional ME-1 Stereo Microphone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDR (HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE)\nEXQUISITE DETAIL IN HIGHLIGHT AND SHADOW\nIn scenes with extreme contrasts, such as bright, sunlit clouds and a foreground deep in shadow, it was once quite difficult to render the textures of both equally. Not any more. D5100 combines two exposures to create an image revealing an extremely wide dynamic range, but with less noise and richer color gradation than ever before.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTUNNING IMAGE QUALITY\nIMAGE QUALITY IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN\nIncorporating the latest Nikon D-SLR technologies such as the 16.2MP DX-format CMOS sensor and EXPEED 2 image processing engine, the D5100 delivers outstanding image quality. Its CMOS sensor offers a remarkably wide ISO range (ISO 100 to 6400) with reduced noise which enables you to shoot at faster shutter speeds and capture scenes and subjects with less blur. Handheld shooting and full HD movies come out looking great even in low light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPEED AND PERFORMANCE THAT DELIVERS\nWith high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 4 frames per second, you\u2019ll never miss a moment and with D5100\u2019s large optical viewfinder providing accurate and realistic composition, you\u2019ll get a precise view and focus in every situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPTURE YOUR SUBJECTS PRECISELY\nD5100\u2019s 11-point AF system provides flexibility to compose the shot you want ensuring your subject is captured sharply wherever it\u2019s located in the frame. Working together with the Scene Recognition System, the camera can keep your main subject in focus even if the composition changes using Nikon\u2019s exclusive 3D-tracking.",
