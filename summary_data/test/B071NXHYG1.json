I would not expect it to stand up to harsh treatment. It comes with nice accessories and the case is well-made if a little small to fit all the things that come with it. I know they were in the case when I got it, but I was not able to put them all back in again. The flute and most important things fit just fine. I am a beginner so I can't say anything about how it plays or the sound yet. I have not received incentive to write this review.",

Her instructor suggested we get it replaced by the company with an upgrade due to the unconvince of her being without an instrument and an upcoming parade to attend !! I would not recommend this flute as it is made poorly and is not reliable as a school instrument !!",

One of the screws came lose and was lost, therefore the tubing was detached. Also, one of the keys was curving upwards. I contacted customer service and received a response fairly quickly. I was told to use some pressure and pushed the key downward, so that kind of solved the issue. As for the lost screw, I was told that I will receive a replace screw in one to two weeks, which was unacceptable to me. As another reviewer stated, the quality is not that great. The flute was not even used on a daily basis.",

Since it is for a child, I opted for the extended warranty for peace of mind. It came with several accessories and the case is sturdy. Regarding the case, the only reason for the loss of a star is because the Velcro on the top has already ripped away. It appears that the Velcro edges just simply unraveled and pulled away from the stitching with the constant opening. All accessories don't fit in the case (like the stand) but the important things do very easily. Would recommend for beginners.",

After assembling and disassembling a few times, the issue went away, somehow the fit loosened up. I did not need to call about the warranty to have the flute replaced. The flute cannot be properly assembled, one part is too tight and does not fit well. A flute repair shop refused to repair it and said the repair would cause more damage. I could not return the flute because kid's lesson started 1 month after I bought the flute, we only discovered the problem once the lessons started. It didn't occur to me that there would be an assembly issue.",
