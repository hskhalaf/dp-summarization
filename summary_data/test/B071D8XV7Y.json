They\u2019ll dim or brighten just from a person walking nearby and their shadow changing the amount of light getting to the sensor. However, they do get pretty bright when it is dark - I have to shut the bathroom door at night to block the light from coming into the bedroom and keeping me awake.",

It's TOO BRIGHT for a bedroom, but it might be perfect for a hall or kitchen light. They go on fine, they go off fine. The design and shape is good. So overall, give them a solid 3 stars.",

These lights were a lifesaver and such a simple solution. They emit enough light to help navigate through the house at night without needing to turn on any additional lights which is exactly what we wanted. We use them in the bathroom and kitchen too. We\u2019ve never tried them in a bedroom but I think they\u2019d be too bright, at least for us. I love these. Highly recommended!",

The LEDs should be long lasting and energy efficient, which I like much better than traditional nightlight bulbs. And the price for the 4 pack is excellent.",

Also in the box there was a note that once these burn out, they are done so you cannot just replace the bulb you must buy a whole new one.",

Each light is designed to be discrete and blend into the plug/ wall outlet. It has an accurate sensor that comes on if lighting is dim, and adjusts the brightness of the LED light according to how much light is available in the surrounding space. Overall a great value and I'll be looking to buy more for the house.",

My old one blocked both outlets, the light was too dim, and it didn't light the floor as this does. I wholeheartedly recommend these for any place other than a bedroom where the sleeper needs darkness (in which case maybe you should consider a motion-sensitive night light instead this type).",
