To say I am impressed is an understatement. Arrived quick, assembly was simple, and the performance is out of this world. This thing picks up stuff my other sweeper would never be able to. The height level never slips like other brands, and the adjustability makes it easier to use. It picks up leaves, pine straw, pine cones, and anything else in its path. I am thoroughly satisfied and hope to get years of service from my sweeper.",

That said - it still worked and did a great job on the grass. I did not contact the seller about the damage as it was not bad enough for me to want to start over with the assembly. Even with the damage - I still give this a 4 + star rating.",
