      "text": "Quality and comfort are just OK. Bluetooth range and battery life is very good. Stylish. Great headset for phone calls, short periods of listening to music at lower bitrate. As other reviewers mention, these get uncomfortable after a few hours, especially while wearing glasses. Quality for hands-free calling is great; I've never gotten any of the \"are you on speaker\" complaints when using this as a hands-free device. The mic is good quality and you can wander a good distance from your phone and stay connected. **Update** After 3mo use. Bluetooth connectivity is not responsive. Takes multiple tries to connect to iPhone and PC while other Bluetooth devices connect without issues.",

      "text": "I bought it as a Xmas present for my teenage son who likes to listen to loud rock -- his earbuds were always leaking. Within a few days the \"+\" button was broken and we had to get an exchange. (This went smoothly, thank you Amazon.) He enjoyed it very much, was the \"cool kid\" on the train, we never had to hear his music, and the unit looks and sounds great. Bluetooth connection is very easy. But... It's now three months later and the micro-usb connector through which it charges is broken, so it's basically useless. Maybe he's been a little rough with it but still this points to inadequate manufacturing quality or flimsy design.",

The battery life is decent; it can easily last through my 8 hr work day in which i use this on and off. It is quite comfortable to wear even for more big head. The built quality is decent; the material does not feel cheap. Only downside is that it is not foldable, so it is not as easily to carry around in the bag. Overall, I really happy with this purchase.",

There is a lot statics when the unit is fully charged, very close to the source. And I tried with different sources (Macbook Pro and iPhone) too. None worked. Once I plugged in the audio cable, the sound quality bounced right up 2. It was too tight for my head - I don't have a big head at all. Yet after two days, I still have to take it off after 30min or so.",
