We used it nearly every day, so much better than a standard wooden high chair that you see at any dining establishment. Our little girl is 9 months old and we do baby led weaning so she needs to be table height to eat during meals. This was perfect! Easy to set up, easy to pack for travel. One downside is that the seat is not totally removable for machine washing. That would have made it perfect. But for the price, worth every penny. Will be on the top of my baby shower gift list going forward.",

There is a wide gap when you connect it right out of the box but you need to read the directions. You must unsnap the front and move to another snap that pulls the material forward. After doing this there is literally no gap to the table. This is a great little chair.",
