      "text": "These are awesome .... Great sound out of the box , feel great, look great (red) and the ear clips work great at stopping cord noise ... I am comparing these to the the klipsch s4i , monster beats tour, and Bose in ear mobile headphones (I also own all of these so it is not just a quick in store check) and the sound is by far better than all of those .... Not sure why vmoda went away from the cloth cable back to rubber (maybe to decrease noise) ... But overall a great set of earbuds ! Thanks vmoda",

Im not into heavy bass and prefer clear mid and high ranges like vocals and pop but it has enough bass to enjoy my dubstep. The silicone ear piece (small) fits perfectly in my ear and comfortably without popping out during my gym, mountain biking, or running workouts. If you wet the silicone ear piece just enough to create a suction type seal so you can isolate 100% of the outside noise.",

They have amazingly deep bass, crisp clear highs, and even when I crank up the bass all the way the bass does not muddy out any other sound. I love the high quality durable built too. They are full metal, lightweight too, must be some sort of alloy. The cable is Kevlar, but its coated in a layer of a soft rubbery material.",

There are no pop or fizzes with these and the high's mid are clear and crisp. The bass feels like I have my own perssonal subwoofers in my head.

You can, it's compatible with the latest Mac products, including the iMac, Mac Pro, MacBook or MacBook Pro and can be used for iChat, iTunes, Skype, VoIP, and other audio recording applications.\n\nUltimate Ergonomic Comfort\nYour headphones are supposed to be comfortable. With rigorous ergonomic research and development, the Remix Remote gives you an incredible fit for the ultimate music experience. The newly designed medical-grade soft silicone ear tips come in four sizes and are designed for a comfortable and secure fit. For the active lifestyle, the detachable sport earhooks feature patent pending Active Flex technology for maximum stability. \n\nBuilt to Last\nWe're passionate about sound and providing you a durable product. We've spent years of diligent engineering to insure Remix Remote is multiple times stronger than many headphones sold within the same price range. Each component was dissected and analyzed by a team of seasoned engineers to create a high-quality headphone that could withstand the extended use by V-MODA's dedicated listeners. With the dual functionality of today's headphones as headsets, it is paramount that the cable and plug are as precisely engineered as the ear buds. Special attention was given to a custom cable construction comprised of a strong Kevlar core to relieve tension and a uniquely braided copper material that is specially designed to increase flex during use. The gold-plated plug and stainless steel core feature a 45-degree extended strain relief to withstand stress.\n\nWhat It Means to be a \"Lifestyle\" Headphone\nAt the gym, heading to the venue, or walking down the street, the Remix Remote is designed for your mobile lifestyle. Weighing only 17 grams, they are lightweight for comfort. Featuring all-metal construction, the Remix Remote combines sleek design and durability. The patent pending detachable sport earhooks insure you don't miss a beat, even when you're on the go. With the Remix Remote, the pinnacle experience of music is interwoven with supreme style in these premium fashion-phones that sound as amazing as they look. \n\nWe put years of extra thought and research into the cable. Why is the cable so important? The main cable diameter of 2.2mm and overall cord length of 44\"-46\" work best to prevent \"earphone fallout\". V-MODA's cables are rigorously tested with weights to withstand abuse.\n\n\nIf you're rough on your headphones, don't worry. We've designed a replacement program just for you. With the exclusive V-MODA Replay Replacement Program, you get a 50% off lifetime replacement guarantee. Of course, that is in addition to the two-year V-MODA premier warranty. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nV-MODA Remix Remote headphones, four pairs of clear ear tips and four pairs of black ear tips (XS,S,M,L), patent pending detachable sport earhooks with Active Flex technology, and a premium carrying pouch for easy storage.
