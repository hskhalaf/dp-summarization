Keyboard feels like cheap plastic, it IS plastic. The only good thing I will say is that it does seem fairly quick, though no quicker than my old laptop which I am on right now. Fan is always running and noisy. I don't understand how it got any good reviews.",

The touchscreen is responsive and works as expected. The display is vibrant, nice color and resolution. It's even an attractive little machine. If you're looking for something to meet your computing needs but don't want to break the bank, look no further and just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",

It is blazing fast, extremely light and well crafted. Now if you\u2019re looking for a backlit keyboard and an alloy case(it\u2019s plastic) don\u2019t get it. So if you are rough on your laptop, it might not be for you. But if you want performance and elegant design, this is definitely the best bang for the buck I have seen.",

I tried to replace or return, and only God knows where they are now. Still working on returning it though. If you don't want to be in my position, don't try you hard earned money on this garbage.",

It's fast and the touch screen is cool, but these other problems make it not worth it. When I tried to contact HP support to resolve my webcam issue, I was told that the one year manufacturer's warranty this product was supposed to come with will be up in three months. In other words: this laptop is not new as advertised!",
