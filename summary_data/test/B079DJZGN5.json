Fits on round Olive Garden tables and family diner tables. Our daughter has down syndrome and has a hard time using restaurant style high chairs. This is perfect for her. No way to slip out. She can slouch without getting hurt. And the back is high enough that I don't have to worry about her stability. Did I say yet how much I love this thing. PS... Written by the wife but hubs was sold when he read it holds up to 60 pounds!",

I like that the seat seems sturdy. My baby weighs 28 lbs and this seat holds him just fine. There is a buckle to hold him in securely. The way the seat hooks onto the side of the table or counter is unique from others I\u2019ve seen but I feel that this seat is very secure because of that. One cosmetic flaw is that the item name is upside down on the chair but that didn\u2019t bother me.",

Now he can sit at the bar and have a snack while he watches me. I love that I don't have to drag his big highchair into the kitchen every time I cook. It works perfectly. I was nervous my bar top was too shallow because we have cabinets underneath and I didn't think his legs would fit, but there is plenty of room for him to grow. Overall I love it.",
