If you have always struggle with many blackhead and whitehead it doesn't hurt to try. These nose strips will not make you disappointed.",

Biore strips are pretty flimsy and whatever adhering agent they use seems to be able to get too watery/milky and not bond or conversely not be saturated enough with moisture to bond. These are much thicker and have a thick shiny solid gel on the side you stick to your skin. I think that's why they bond better. They seem to cover more area of the nose and also the design seems to adhere to the 3-D shape of the nose too. My nose is not small, so that's good.",

(The Neosporin will, of course, clog those pores right back up, as if I cared at this point...)

Also, they aren't pliable like biore pore strips...they crack and crunch when you peel off the plastic liner. Also, some seem to be \"dried\" out because they are completely detached from the liner. Each strip I've used has not been like the last. Quality control is none existanT. Really bummed I missed the return window. Trash. DO NOT BUY",
