      "text": "Came from the Nikon 1 J3 for a few years. Love the new added features though the 15FPS at 4K is too low. To those familiar with the specs, this camera is a performer especially for its size. The only down point is that its stock battery overheats randomly while filming video (this is my primary use for this camera) which forces the camera to shutdown after the sensors trigger this danger. Looked into the forums and from time to time certain batteries had been recalled. Thank goodness I found two replacement batteries on Amazon. They work better (longer too as the cells hold more charge) and haven't seen any overheating issues.",

The J5 does the same thing, albeit only for 3 seconds (J1 did 5 seconds). If you're using the 400fps for forensics (we use it for impact tests) with manual shutter release, 3 secs can be pretty short to time your movie. Outside of the 400fps video this is pretty unremarkable camera; we returned it.",

      "text": "Small, great design and easy to carry. Picture taking and quality was good. We bought the camera for the versatility of being able to shoot HD video. However after about 12 mins the camera would overheat and shut down. This happened twice during my first video shoot during my daughters school play and it was repeatable under testing after. I read on-line that mirror less cameras have an video overheating issue, so this isn't isolated to the Ninon 1 J5. I've read that future generation cameras will fix this, but for our families needs we can't go with it under these conditions. We have returned the unit and will keep our eyes out for the next gen.",
