For a heavier smoke, let the smoke linger until smoke finally begins to clear. An even heavier smoke flavor, repeat the process. It depends largely on your likes. Have fun and don't be afraid to try different smoking techniques. \"Bon Appetit.\"",

The filling process was quite easy (Be sure to buy the butane cans with the long nozzles). The fill gauge comes in handy especially for a first time user. The child safety features are a smart addition making it safe to have. This little torch has some power and the flame is fully adjustable making it awesome to use for cooking, paintings etc. I'd definitely purchase this torch again.",

When I stopped and turned it right side up, I heard a continual hissing sounds because the fuel continued to leak out. I'm afraid to use it now because of the leak. Too bad I didn't test it more when it was still in warranty. It's going in the trash as soon as it stops hissing.",

Keeping the prolonged flame certainly allows for a longer opportunity to heat whatever you use this torch for. I was disappointed with the price increase, but oh well. Overall, great purchase!",

There are directions in the box, these were more detailed. The items arrived, but unfortunately, one had a defective valve that leaked. I contacted the seller. They quickly responded and had another shipped out. It arrived in a few days. Great customer service! The torch itself is easy to fill and use. Great for in the kitchen.",

My favorite thing about it is that the butane reservoir has a window so you can see how much butane is left. I use mine to heat a dab nail, and it gets it red hot very quickly, so that's a plus! It's a hefty size too. Unimportant bonus: green is my favorite color lol.",
