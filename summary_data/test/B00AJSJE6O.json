Of course we noticed this after we started putting together (which putting this thing together is a NIGHTMARE). If you don't like or are not good at putting things together- AVOID this product.",

Bouncing, balance, standing, teething, eye-hand coordination... it keeps her busy and active for about an hour at a time, a few times a day. It even folds flat for traveling. Some words of advice, the instructions SUCK. They consist of poorly written/ translated sentences and really unhelpful pictures. It took me about 45 minutes to assemble, and I consider myself pretty handy. I'd definitely recommend this Exersaucer, and my pediatrician did too. Just don't give up while assembling...your baby will thank you.",

The camera toy doesn't offer much entertainment. The bright blue light it displays when you push the button is almost too bright for the eyes. The butterfly toys that hang down aren't secured very well. The ribbon that holds them on isn't very heavy duty, it's basically silk ribbon you could buy at the store. It's starting to come apart where it's sewn to the fabric that wraps around the bar. Other then that though, our daughter loves it. We love that it collapses and makes it easier to take with us.",

I also wish that when it was converted to a table top it were more stable for infant to walk along. As a table toy it tips very easily.

The package literally contained 100+ pieces so assembly IS required. But it's totally worth the effort and the little man LOVES his toys. As he moves around, the chair moves around with him. It's very energy consuming for a 5-month baby so in the beginning, he could only take 20-30 minutes of exploration. This is an absolute favorite among his toys and I highly recommend to everyone.",

Thought it would be the tone-down green color as in the pic, but in person, it is just as bright green color as other baby items are. not that it is bad..but wanted to take some break from those blindingly bright colors. No biggie for me, but if the color shown in the pic is THE MAIN reason you chose this item, you'd be surprised. Some of the customer pictures will give you better idea.",

The monkeys that slide along the bar frustrate him because he can't slide them up very far, but we just divert his attention to a different toy when he gets too frustrated. This definitely keeps him occupied enough for me to get some things done around the house. Hoping we can get at least a couple years of use out of this, and who knows...maybe in a few years we might be able to use it for our next child as well :)",
