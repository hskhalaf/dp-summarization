The touch features don't cause any lag at all during gaming or other uses (ofc I do run 32gb ram ... Disclaimer lol) anyway I was totally not expecting to be able to do a two finger screen zoom like on a cell phone ... But I can! I don't use the functionality of the touch screen a lot , but when I do it's there and it works great! Thank you ACER for an affordable, nice looking and smooth operating product!",

The speakers are not that good (tinny sounding) or loud. Touch is very responsive. You must use the included USB cable to make touch available to your computer, you do need an avalable USB port on your computer. Windows 10 recognized the monitor and touch capability immediately, no drivers necessary. VESA mount on rear allows for wall mount. Comes with HDMI cable!! I wasn't expecting that. Unfortunately it uses a proprietary adapter/transformer for power. Wish it accepted a standard computer power cord.",

      "text": "I wanted a touch screen monitor as a replacement for my old monitor which failed after 10 years. The replacement monitor was to be used on my new Windows 8 system by Dell. I liked it so much I ordered another one for my wife's Windows 7 system. I don't like the replacement or repair process which Acer uses. The warranty is for a three year period, which I found to be excellent. But the purchaser pays the freight to the repair center, if they find the monitor defective they will repair or replace it and return it at no charge. Meanwhile you have no monitor until the replacement arrives. Thanks",

On the 2nd monitor I have plugged in my cable box so I can switch to tv. Speakers do the job.

It also works fine with Windows 7 although this application is extremely limited. Just remember, if you want the touch feature to work, the USB 2.0 cable MUST be connected to the computer as this is how touch sends commands. The price is excellent for a wide screen monitor with touch. If you want proof, just look at the prices of the competition and they don't have the Acer name behind them.",

Since it is a touch screen, a USB connection port needed to be available on my Linux/Windows PC and it was. The size does put most tablet touch screens to shame and it is much easier to read from.

Overall the price is good and its a pretty good monitor. I don't like the way it stands very much, wont go totally vertical, so in my multi-monitor array, it looks strange",

Four stars instead of five because the sound is a little weak. But since it's for our kid in her bedroom, we'll be glad the built-in speakers won't blast. Praise for Amazon for cheerful, no-hassle acceptance of return of second monitor I accidentally ordered and couldn't cancel, even though I saw the mistake and started trying immediately. Highly recommend.",

I was looking forward to the \"full windows 8 experience\" Now I am still looking for a way to make this work!! Monitors should be plug and play!!",
