      "text": "To study for my PMP exam, I used Rita's PMP Exam Prep in conjunction with referencing the PMBOK and then writings the tests from Christopher Scordo's, Oliver Lehmann's Exam Self-Assessment Test (this is a free web-based timed test and has great resources at the bottom of this webpage as well), and Oliver Lehmann's free 175 Prep Questions. After 3 months of dedicated study, I passed my PMP examination. Rita's text is great as a foundational read and is the only study aid I used that had good Critical Path questions, but it's not an end-all-be-all. Use the other cheap or free aids I mentioned and in my experience, you'll have a great set of tools to prepare for your examination.",

I can tell you one thing for sure - this book is a game changer. You've to realize the importance of the questions in the back of every chapter to really master the book AND the exam. I did witness couple of questions directly lifted from this book. The concepts are pretty nicely explained in this book.

The tips, exercises, and practice exams were extremely helpful in improving my understanding of the material. For anyone studying for the exam, this guide is a must-have. My recommendation is to follow the advice in the book, do all the exercises, and complete the practice exams according to the instructions in the book. Excellent guide!",

Use only these 3 sources, if you study more than these 2 books, it will be way to much of the same and its not effective at all.",
