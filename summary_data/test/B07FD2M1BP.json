I realize if you\u2019re from off, you don\u2019t know what that is. I can\u2019t give it 5 stars due to inaccurate sizing and the slip factor.",

The only thing I don't like about them is the lack of a more sturdy sole. The soles are made of the same soft foam rubber as the rest of the shoe. Sharp rocks or other objects could easily tear through this material. I expect the soles will wear out more quickly because there's no more sturdy material there.",

I did do a 4 mile hike with these (on the sidewalk)with a light backpack (20 lbs) and they held up beautifully. The soles are very thick and they have a nice interior contour that hugs the feet--unlike the flat bottom of a Croc. I think I may have found my everyday AND Hiking shoes!",

And even then, it's not clear they will refund to money, since Peltz return requirements for defective items are basically BS. So, rather than pay the postage and then be denied a refund, I'm just gonna suck up the loss. Lesson learned: Don't purchase anything from Peltz!",
