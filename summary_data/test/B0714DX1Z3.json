The controls take some patience and getting used to, but after some use become less cumbersome. I like that you can stop a CD, even turn it off, and when you start up again it keeps playing right where you left off. Also I like loading music on to a flash drive and letting playback for hours without hearing the same song. Love that it plays MP3s! Very good sound! Hope it lasts!",
