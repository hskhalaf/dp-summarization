Unless you're going for the full on shop lift in your garage...this is the way to go. Heavy duty and well built.",

Bike has been on the lift with the emergency stop bar engaged for 2 weeks while parts are out for powder coating. A little extra care needed with placement because I elected to leave my center stand on. Recommend disconnecting jiffy stand spring though to get it out of the way.",

Only gave it 4 stars on stability as this type of lift is inherently a little wobbly - more so than a full-length garage lift. Just spend a couple minutes checking the best location points to lift the frame and no problem. Some have noted the jack lowers too quickly. I was able to snug-up the oil release screw on the jack and that slows the bleed-down. Very happy with this lift.",

It works fine , Just seems to me that the bike comes down FAST... Overall , I am extremely pleased with the purchase , and would recommend to a friend or colleague...",

Not sure how people are stripping anything with the handle, there's no reason you should be pushing a motorcycle around by that handle, you should lift it, strap it, and the push by the bike itself. Now be careful with the straps though! The straps anchor to the base of the jack, so if you strap down the bike tightly and later decide to lift the bike some more, you will be putting a ton of force on those straps and could break them or something on your motorcycle.",

It does not roll about as easily as I would have liked when my bike is on the lift. It does not always collapse all the way down as it should but these are minor inconveniences for me. Otherwise this lift really does the job.",

The jack is decent, well made and rather heavy, as it should be. It is not as stable as I hoped it would be to hold my 750# Harley. It tends to rock front to back even if balanced properly. My only suggestion is that you make sure you are on absolutely level ground and don't raise the bike higher than 12 inches off the ground to assure that it will be stable.",

The paint on some of my components (primarily the jack)was terrible.It looked like melted crayon and was chipped badly showing the red paint underneath and covered with grease. The straps are great once the bike is in the air especially if swapping tires or shocks. Now the lift. It WORKS perfectly. The lock at different heights is dependable and defies it's delicate appearance! Operation is smooth and the jack does not leak. I am VERY impressed with the operation of this lift. It handles not only my lowered FXSTD but also my buddies Ultra as well.",

The one fault with the product was the two bolts that hold the handle bracket had very poor threads and just backed out of the holes. I went to a local hardware store purchased two more bolts with better thread, and everything is now perfect. I have already used this twice and it is very convenient and easy to use. I highly recommend this product and the company I purchased it from.",

Not the best construction crude but it will work ok I'm sure. Buy American its better.",
