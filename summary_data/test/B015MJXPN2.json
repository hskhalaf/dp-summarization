My son who is 250 lbs. Loves this product also. He is in a very intense college program and has tried yoga, meditation and other methods of clearing his mind. When he gets on the slack line, I can see the stress literally leave his body. He has lost 2 inches off his waist in just 2 weeks. GREAT FUN FOR THE MIND AND BODY! great job for making an affordable, quality product.",
