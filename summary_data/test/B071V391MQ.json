      "text": "Excellent tripod bag. Fit and finish is exactly what I was looking for. Able to hold my Induro CLT303L carbon fiber with ease. This is an almost 6-foot tripod with the center column retracted but it folds down to 27 inches. I bought the 70cm and the fit is snug with a 6\u201d slack, which I love. There\u2019s nothing worse than lugging along a tripod whose bag has too much room to spare. The bag has tie-downs inside to keep the tripod in place and has a net pouch for storage. Very secure. I\u2019m happy I found this on Amazon.",

Would have loved a bit more wall padding; however, I decided to use it with a lighter synthetic tri-pod and switched out my heavier case for a more sturdy and heavier metal tri-pod. Is an excellent product for my lighter tri-pod and will work well with the heavier one, any day. The strap and shoulder pad is better on this one than my more expensive carry case. Am a bit spoiled with another discontinued product procured on sale about a year ago.",

Given that this was the cheapest bag I could find, I'm frankly surprised by it's high quality. The fabric material feels nice in the hand, the zipper is very smooth, and the padding is generous without being bulky. The included shoulder strap seems adequate. But again, and most important, my particular RRS combo fits nicely.",

I ordered the 90cm case to hold my large Manfrotto tripod with RRS ball head attached - I still have about 6-7\" left to spare, so the smaller size would likely have been optimal. Thick padding, double stitching, all metal zippers and pulls. Good, solid quality for a sane price. Couldn't recommend more highly.",

It's not the lightest or fanciest, but the materials feel sturdy where I think they should be (zipper and fabric). All sides are padded but the padding doesn't go all the way to the corners at either end so hard pointy corner bits might not be protected where it's more important.",
