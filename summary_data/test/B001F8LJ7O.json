They do work, they do stay in place and they are warm enough! I do wear hearing aids so they aren't the perfect solution as they tangle a bit with my hearing aids, but that really isn't surprising or unexpected so all in all, I say they are a solid purchase for me.",

      "text": "When I received these, I was surprised that they are two separate muffs, with nothing connecting them. Guess I didn't read the description carefully enough. They go on the ears like socks go on feet - one at a time and the ears go into the muffs.. After using these, I think they are better than traditional ear muffs that just push against the ears. It takes a little practice to get them on but they look good and keep the ears warm.",
