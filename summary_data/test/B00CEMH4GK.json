Upon first wash (cold water, hang to dry), the pillow topper came out with rips in the fabric and seams all over and stuffing just pouring out. Much of it left in the lint filter. Don't expect it to survive more than maybe two or three washes in total. Spend more money on a different pillow topper or save yourself money and buy just the gel memory foam topper.",

      "text": "Bought the Sleep Innovations Gel Memory Foam 4-inch Dual Layer Mattress Topper because my really expensive foam mattress was killing my back. We've had it 7 yrs and its starting to break down, even though every day it comes back to life it just wasn't holding it shape when we slept on it. So we've place this mattress topper on it and WOW, problem solved. Its not perfect, but now I believe I can get a few more years out of my mattress without sleeping on the couch. I recommend it and would buy it again!!",

Regular use causes sinking where you lay and it pitches me toward the middle or to the floor at other times. It feels good on the first night you flip it and then after a night or tow your back to having your own indented cocoon. It is better than nothing and it is a quality piece. Maybe I just need to lose weight. Needless to say, I\u2019m still in search of that good nights sleep.",

We let it air out for about 5 days before using it (which was disappointing) and there is no lingering smell. I have double fitted sheets, 1 that is a protector, on our bed to protect it so we hopefully won't need to watch it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for anyone that suffers from back/hip pain.",
