It has met my expectations, they are sturdy and there is no movement or slippage if installed properly under the mattress. Be sure to read inserted instructions. I have a king size bed and when lying down on the bed I cannot tell there is an4 inch head elevation. It is a 2 person installation job as mattress has to lifted. I highly recommend as it is a very good quality product.",

      "text": "I raised my heavy outdoor metal table 3\u201d to make it dining height instead of conversation height. The foam spacers fit at right angles on two sides of the table feet. So they did not sit in the middle of the blocks but they work perfectly anyway. The rubber pad bases even work as shims on the slightly uneven concrete so that it doesn\u2019t wobble. It looks pretty good even with the offset foot since the table is hexagonal, but it would be nice to have other size foam pieces so the table foot could be centered. Still, it\u2019s rock solid so I am happy.",

I did not need the other inserts that came with the product that change the opening from square to rectangular (used for bed rollers). I feel confident that my mom will be safe on her now-taller sofa. I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again. AND they are made in the USA!",

Also, they make it so much easier to watch TV as I fall asleep.",
