Power reserve is around 44 hours, winding is very comfortable, and it passed the ritual diving test few times already, so no issues there.",

Invicta pro diver watches are the pick of the Invicta range for me and the accurate Seiko automatic movement is a proven winner especially when you factor in the amazing low price.

I don't really love that the Invicta branding is so prominent all over the watch (dial, side of the case, clasp, etc), but it's hard to go wrong with for around $100. Buying the movement by itself would likely cost half of that. At 47mm, this watch is BIG, so if you have a small wrist, you might be better off looking for something a little smaller (perhaps the Invicta 8926ob). Invicta gets a lot of flack from higher end collectors, but if you're looking for a solid watch with Submariner-esque styling that costs roughly 100x less than an actual Submariner, this is a pretty good option for you.",

This watch is much larger than my Pro Diver and resembles more of a classic diving watch. I am 6'0 and weigh over 240. this is not the watch for a smaller man below 175 lbs. It would look too big. My only suggestion is that Invicta put a band on these watches that has a wetsuit extension like the Luminox Navy Seals watches. The case is big, the automatic time piece keeps time well and the face of the watch is sporty yet classy. I highly recommend this watch!",

    "title": "Invicta Men's 3044 Stainless Steel Grand Diver Automatic Watch, Silver/Black",
    "description": "Quality Japanese Automatic movement; Functions without a battery; Powers automatically with the movement of your arm Mineral crystal Case diameter: 49 mm Stainless-steel case; Black dial; Date function Water-resistant to 300 M (1000 feet)\n\nClassically styled with powerful lines and featuring a precise Swiss-made automatic watch movement, the shock-resistant Invicta Grand Diver men's stainless steel watch is made for serious scuba fanatics with a water resistance rating to 300 meters (nearly 1000 feet). This large, round watch measures 47mm wide (1.85 inches) and 17mm thick (0.67 inches) and it's made from solid surgical grade stainless steel. It also offers a skeleton see-through caseback and molded diving helmet logos on the end pieces connecting the silver stainless steel bracelet band as well as on the screw-down crown. It's topped by a black unidirectional rotating elapsed time bezel with white markings. The black dial face is supplemented by Tritnite luminous dotted markers and arrowhead-style hands (with seconds hand). Other features include an anti-reflective crystal with magnifier, date function at 3 o'clock, and diver's buckle with safety clasp.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Watches\n\nAutomatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.\n\nAlso referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).\n\n\nAn automatic watch is a mechanical watch that is self-winding. the movement of your wrist and body causes the rotor--a weight attached to an automatic winding mechanism--to wind up the watch. This automatic watch has 21 jewels that the gears turn on to protect the metal parts from grinding together. it needs no battery, but it will stop if you have been physically inactive for an extended period of time. If this happens, wind the crown ten times clockwise to start the watch and give it some reserve power.  Tritnite is a luminous material with an extended glow exclusively developed by Invicta in Switzerland and added to their timepiece hands and markers. When exposed to regular daylight, it will hold its glow for about 20 hours. \n\n About Invicta\nLatin for \"invincible,\" Invicta was founded in La Chaux-de-fonds, Switzerland in 1837 by Raphael Picard, who believed that fine Swiss timepieces could be offered at modest prices. For more than a century, the company has created distinctive manual and automatic-winding pieces. In 1991, descendants of the Picard family reaffirmed the company's founding principle, and the invigorated Invicta has been growing ever since with one of the most widely diverse collections of precise Swiss timepieces on the market.\n\n\n\n\nWith its most inspired creations yet, Invicta demonstrates its technical and design prowess, offering timepieces of style for extreme value.\n\n\"We have long held firm to the belief that supremely crafted timepieces can be offered for extremely modest sums. It is the founding principle of our flagship and the radical notion that still drives us today. By being true to our convictions, we will continue to turn the balance of power, and deliver true Swiss luxury to anyone who desires it. Let all those who possess our timepieces and pass through our doors witness the quality, value and care in every piece we create, and the spirit of never-ending possibilities in everything we do.\"\n\nThese are the words that greet visitors and motivate team members inside the Invicta Watch Group's new worldwide headquarters. Emblazoned in stainless steel, it has been the Invicta message since Day One.\n\n With each new timepiece, the company sends up a flare for those looking to be defined not by how much they spend, but how wisely they spend. With its strong collections, the gutsy Swiss brand is guaranteed to keep attracting followers. \n\n The art of the craft. Inside an Invicta Workshop\n\nIt takes years of training and a great deal of pride to achieve glorious Swiss timepieces by hand. But it takes guts and the courage of your convictions to make those timepieces affordable for everyone who appreciates them.\n\n At our Swiss workshops, we mix time-honored traditions with a little bit of horse sense every single day to produce the greatest values in the watch-making world. \n\n\n\nSee more \n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n *  User Guide [PDF ] \n * Is Discontinued By Manufacturer :No\n * Product Dimensions :0.47 x 0.51 x 0.51 inches; 12.35 Ounces\n * Item model number :INVICTA-3044\n * Department :Mens\n * Batteries :1 Lithium Polymer batteries required.\n * Date First Available :February 12, 2006\n * Manufacturer :Invicta\n * ASIN :B000FVE3A2\n\n * .zg_hrsr_item {list-style : none};\n * Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #55,535 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry (See Top 100 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry)  *  #241 inMen's Wrist Watches \n    *  #14012 inMen's Shops \n   \n   \n\n * Customer Reviews:4.6 out of 5 stars1,241 ratings Quality Japanese Automatic movement; Functions without a battery; Powers automatically with the movement of your arm Mineral crystal Case diameter: 49 mm Stainless-steel case; Black dial; Date function Water-resistant to 300 M (1000 feet)\n\nClassically styled with powerful lines and featuring a precise Swiss-made automatic watch movement, the shock-resistant Invicta Grand Diver men's stainless steel watch is made for serious scuba fanatics with a water resistance rating to 300 meters (nearly 1000 feet).
