I'm 5'9,\" 150-ish pounds, and athletic and trying to keep up with my kiddos on a hopper ball is HARD!! It also holds my 200-ish pound husband just fine. You can get some serious air on these hopper balls, which was an AWESOME surprise! They're also multipurpose, so you can do ab workouts as well on them. My only complaint is that the handle rubs on my inner thighs and creates minor discomfort. This may be related to user error (when I'm frantically trying to hop faster than my kiddos, hahahaha). I wish I would have found out about adult hopper balls sooner!",

I did as directed, waited and added more air, etc, but the truth is this thing is no where nearly the size of my exercise ball. If it were, that would be fantastic. As it is, I just have this blue ball and an air pump. I guess I'll save it for when little children may visit. A complete waste of money because it is no bigger than the child size ones you see in the stores.",

      "text": "This hopper ball has been used daily indoors since Christmas by my 8 year old with no problems. Well, there is one problem I guess. It's hard to see the TV with my sons head bouncing up and down in front of it. But at least it is keeping him active even when he is watching television or playing video games.I bought two hopper balls from Xino sports and they both went flat the first day after only a short time of use indoors. This one, however, has stayed inflated. My son doesn't walk anymore, he bounces everywhere.",

Some of the moms had even offered to buy them off me. The pump works as detailed however you will need some arm strength to get them pumped to the maximum capacity. Luckily my husband had an air compressor and filled them with air in less than 10 minutes. These will continue to service school parties for years to come.",
