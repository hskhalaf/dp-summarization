These have only cloudfoam on the sole and no rubber. So the grip is really good only on rubber court, I think. These are low style shoes so do not expect high protection on the ankle zone. But I play in them for 3 weeks - I like the stability, duarbility and weight. Also these are great as casual shoes. Pretty soft and light.",
