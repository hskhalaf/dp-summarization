When they were put on the signature sleep metal box spring, they were extremely hard. Can't figure that one out. When the box springs started sagging(3\"), the mattress obviously did too. I replaced the box spring with wood slats in November 2016, and that made it a little more comfortable, but not much. Unfortunately, the 3\" sagging to the mattress was not fixed by the slats, and they both had to be replaced. Of course it's not covered by warranty either and there's $320 down the drain for a little over a year of use. Such a bummer.",

So with that said, I\u2019d say this mattress has been one of the best purchases of the past 5 years for me. Even today, it\u2019s still incredibly comfortable. I\u2019m only writing this review because I\u2019m thinking about moving up to the queen size from the double and thought people might like to know how the double has held up. It\u2019s seriously a great, great mattress.",

      "text": "We had previously purchased this mattress for our son 5 years ago, and were very pleased. So, when we needed a mattress for our daughter, we bought this one again. It's well made, very comfortable even for an adult. It's on the firm side, but it does have a little plush on the top. It's definitely a mattress I would buy again and recommend. Side note: it is an inner spring traditional mattress with foam around it, etc and it is heavy for a twin. It comes completely compressed in a box. This does not take away from the quality or comfort. In fact the last mattress we bought for our bed was also in a box.",
