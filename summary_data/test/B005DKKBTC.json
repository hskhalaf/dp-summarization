As of June it began declining. It's now good for a shave and a half at best. Very disappointed.",

Could not be simpler and cheap to clean it. No need for cleaning apparatus or expensive cleaning solutions. Charge lasts over a week. Trimmer works great also.

After 5 years, it still worked fine, but the seals failed, allowing water to enter when cleaning or shaving. After reading many reviews, I purchased this model for use while travelling. Sort of a let down. The battery doesn't last nearly as long as the 5 year old Panasonic, and the shave is only marginally more comfortable. Doesn't seem to shave either closer or faster than the old unit. I will probably keep it for trips, but it is never going to be good enough to function as my only shaving device.",

      "text": "I have owned a number of electric razors and have never been happy with how they work and end up going back to a blade for a closer shave. This razor was a gift and I was ready to be disappointed yet again but to my surprise it shaved better than any blade or electric razor I have ever used. A great clean close shave that will not disappoint.",

    "title": "Panasonic Razor, ES-LF51-A, Men\u2019s Electric 4-Blade Cordless Shaver, Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head",
    "description": "The Panasonic Arc 4ES-LF51-A men's electric razor delivers a close, clean, quick shave with four ultra-sharp stainless-steel Nanotech blades. Each Arc 4 blade is precision honed to a 30\u00b0 edge, and an ultra-thin Arc4 foil gently and closely conforms to the individual contours of the face, neck and chin. This men's shaving machine includes a flexible pivoting shaver head to effortlessly guide blades and foil along the skin for outstanding electric razor comfort. Its Panasonic high-efficiency 14,000 cpm linear drive motor maintains peak mens electric razor power until the end of each battery charge for consistent, even Arc4 shaving. This exceptional electric razor for men includes a pop-up trimmer to add the perfect finish and detail to beards, mustaches and sideburns. The Panasonic Arc 4 is 100% waterproof, too, and can be easily used with foam or gel in the shower or used anytime for a smooth dry shave. A 5-stage LED in the sure-grip ES-LF51-A handle shows battery and charging status. Cleaning your Arc 4 is quick and simple. Just rinse the electric razor under running water to remove stubborn gel and stubble, leaving the Arc4 blades and foil fresh and renewed. And for electric razor shaving and grooming away from home, the Panasonic electric shaver comes with universal voltage, AC adaptor/charger and a durable travel pouch. The outer foil is very thin and can be damaged if not used correctly. Check that the foil is not damaged before using the shaver. Do not use the shaver if the foil is damaged as you will cut your skin.",
