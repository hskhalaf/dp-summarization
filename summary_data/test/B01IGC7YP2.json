I will only buy fitted shirts and I typically purchase a large to accommodate my neck, chest and shoulders. Length is always an issue because I am less than standard height. This shirt is not too long, (although it is borderline). The sleeves fit well and the body is perfect. The fabric is somewhat light, which makes it perfect for the mid-west plains states that don't have extreme temps. As soon as I received the first one I immediately bought another.",
