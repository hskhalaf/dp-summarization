The suit is put on easily and the zipper is strong and has a nice long string. The velcro on the neck is also large and strong. The problem was the bunching on the arm/shoulder/arm pit area. I by no means have twiggy arms but for some reason they must think a XXXL person must have logs for arms... That alone brought it to 4 stars for me, others it's a 5 star suit.",

It's a pretty decent quality neoprene suit! It worked well for what I need it for, working in pools during colder weather. Take care of your suit by hang drying it inside out overnight and it'll last a lot longer! When you store it, fold it in half and hang it like you would a pair of pants, not like a shirt! Super happy with my purchase! It definitely met my expectations!",

The red accents look really sharp, and the tailoring is excellent. Feels very solid, well proportioned for my frame, and is quite comfortable most everywhere. It is a bit tight in the arms, probably assuming most surfers and paddle-boarders are more toned than muscular. If you have big arms, I'd suggest a larger size. All in all for the price it's a steal. I paid full price. I was not provided a free sample or discount. I just like it. I'll update after hitting the water.",
