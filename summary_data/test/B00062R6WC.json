      "text": "Was replacing a workhorse pasta machine that I should have returned when I got it since the linguini roll NEVER worked but loved nonetheless. And when the clamp stripped I needed a new machine. This machine was truly a disappointment because we all have trouble changing the thinness dial. For whatever reason the dial part is not well made and easy to manipulate. That being said the linguini roll part works so I bought a new clamp for the workhorse machine and use this machine to roll out the linguini. But to buy this as your only machine would be a disaster!",

The main roller's connection to the handle is plastic as shown in the picture. Unlike the other two connectors (to make pasta) are all metal. No wonder the dough comes out uneven during my earlier use because of the plastic interior of the main roller, it make it wobbly. It broke after only three use. There is no option to return this since its been three years but I have only used it thrice so far. Bottom line if you are looking for a sturdy pasta maker better check out some other brands.",

When it came time to get a second, I wanted something a bit more compact. The Titania is that, with the two cutters one must often uses built in (Fettuccine and Chitara, the latter being square-cut spaghetti). The machine is still extensible and can take attachments for other cutting dies, but because the basic ones are built in, it is more stable and has a lower center of mass and smaller footprint. This is my new favorite!",
