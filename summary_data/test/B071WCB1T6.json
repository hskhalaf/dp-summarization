      "text": "This model has very easy to use and convenient control features. 90% of the time, we push one button to start the microwave. we really like that the finish does not show fingerprints like our previous stainless steel microwave did. The unit is powerful enough to be reasonably fast, yet space saving size and tall enough inside for anything we want to use it for. The only negative so far is the custom defrost cycles are way too aggressive, actually starting cooking both beef and chicken about 1/2 way through the recommended time - not good. If I enter about 50% of the actual weight of the item, the recommended time is about right. Very good value at $110.",

CONS: About 4 days before the return period is over (and thankfully not any later), it began making a sound like a huge, rusty gate being opened shortly after being started. Seems the motor that spins the platter inside just couldn't take it anymore and started to give up, evidenced by removing the platter entirely and running it resulting in much softer or no motor screeching sound. This, in combination with the subsequent smoky smell that came from the rear vents, led to an immediate return. Gonna find a microwave that's hopefully less prone to roaring like Godzilla.",

Toshiba's 1100 watts of today exceeds in performance, in my opinion, the 1500 watt rating of my old unit. It's scary effective, and apparently a best seller. Instructions for use are a tiny bit complicated, though well documented. And only Four Stars for the clunky, bang-shut door when closing.",

I really like the front handle and the intuitiveness of functions most of all. I can do a quick start in :30 increments or a customized time, and the pre-set for potatoes is perfect for a small-to-medium sized Idaho potato. I had to add a little more for a big potato, but it came out very evenly-cooked. No tough or black ends. Potatoes and reheating is my #1 use of a microwave. It's even easy to set the clock and start or mute the touchpad beeping. So far, very good!",

So if you started to type the 2:17 above, the microwave is going to turn on as soon as you hit \"2\" for 2:00 minutes.
