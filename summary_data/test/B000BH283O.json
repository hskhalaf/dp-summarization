If you have a 1\u201d x 4\u201d piece of lumber, a couple of wood screws and some glue, you can fix that. See the photos. I made mine about 6\u201d long. The length you use will determine the angle of the inclination. I was too lazy to actually pull out the protractor, but I think it\u2019s pretty close.

While other benches have more increments, the 4 (straight up, 45 degree, flat and negative/inverted) are all that I've ever needed.

It\u2019s so difficult, in fact, that I\u2019ve given up. So, 2 stars because it does a third of what it\u2019s made to do. Frankly, I\u2019m really disappointed and completely regret this purchase.

The only downsides are that it doesn't fully fold to be stored easily, and the exposed metallic frame in the lower-back area when opened to horizontal or decline positions (not sure if other adjustable designs have full coverage). Still, the product has very good quality, and is very well priced. (Review Subject To Revision With Further Use)",

      "text": "I ordered this bench to use with a Beachbody program I am doing. I am very pleased with it so far. It is very sturdy and stable. I can step up and down on it and it doesn't move and feels secure. I just leave the foam roller thing on it and I use it as a foot rest during certain exercises (I'm short). Or my feet rest easily on the bench when laying on it. Some people commented that the feet of the bench get in the way, but I dont have any issues with that. My husband uses it as well and likes it. Assembly was easy enough. Very happy with this purchase.",

The wheels on the rear make it very easy to move around as well. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone. It's more versatile than the benches at my gym , and those cost over $400",
