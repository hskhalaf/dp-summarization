Wish there was a small button or something he could tie his mask to it but seeing that it is not meant for work but to ski then it makes sense it doesn\u2019t. Now everyone in his job has asked where he got his mask from and we always send them here. Cap has to be put on first then the face mask if you have hair and don\u2019t want it everywhere.",
