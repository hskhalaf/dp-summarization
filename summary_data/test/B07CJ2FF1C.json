Its effective waterproofing and grippy outsole wowed consumers and critics alike. On the other hand, some might get turned off by the gear\u2019s faulty seam construction. All in all, the Danner Mountain 600 Weatherized remains to be a good choice for winter hiking if insulation and comfort are the top requirements for potential buyers.",

        "A critic praised this boot for delivering sufficient traction on slippery ground",
        "Its waterproof liner was successful in keeping a reviewer\u2019s foot dry",

      "title": "Excellent Winter Boot",
      "text": "Very happy with these boots after a few days. Haven\u2019t used them for hiking yet, but as a general winter boot alternative to my Sorels, these are surprisingly good. Excellent grip, small profile makes them easy to drive in, good ankle support, and kept my feet warm in 0F Wisconsin winter weather while shoveling this weekend. I typically wear a 9.5 and that\u2019s what Danner recommended. I find these are maybe 1/4 size too large, but are almost perfect with thick wool socks, which I\u2019ll almost always wear with these boots. 9 was too small.",

I rarely take the time to write reviews - but I have been so impressed with these Danner's, I felt compelled to.",

So far so good though testing them outdoors in 23F weather. Very light weight and stylish. Just dissappointed that these are not from Oregon like many of the other mountain series boots they make. Great looking colors and design except for the 1990s 'waves' design at the sides of the sole. Really? Looks cheap. Don't pay retail for these - look for discounts or sales as they do not command the made in America price.",
