I got the blue (light resistance) and after just a few minutes find the muscles in my hand are worn out. Will it get better? I'll bet on it, but why buy one that requires weeks of training to fully utilize? I think a medium or light to be best.",

Considering that the optimal use may be with the tips of the fingers, this is a fairly heavy gripper.
