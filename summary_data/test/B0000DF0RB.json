You really have to scrub with the brush to clean anything and yes, the steam does help lift dirt when you do that, but it's not a point-and-blast steam cleaner by any means. Using the provided microfiber mop head on a tile floor, I was unable to lift any stains compared to scrubbing manually, and the floor would be cool to the touch (and wet) immediately after passing over it. I would not call this \"heavy duty\" and don't really see a use for it.",

Locking button on the handle is difficult to lock into place but it does lock. Nylon brush heads can't stand up to the heat of the steam and curl/bend and become useless. Brass brush head is pretty good. Bought to try to clean tile grout. Will need to buy a replacement set of brass brush heads but they are 5 for $30! Recommendation to maker: Make a stronger brush head and include more brass ones. Design a cord wrap at least.",

It comes with a variety of attachments, way more than I ever needed. Takes about 10 minutes (full tank) to go from cold to having usable steam pressure. If you use the more demanding attachments, it will have a little trouble supplying a 100% constant pressure supply. However pausing even a few seconds every few minutes allows it to catch up pretty quick. Tank can last 30-60 minutes of heavy steam use. Definitely a worthy investment, I'd definitely go with this one over any handheld version.",

      "text": "This is AMAZING, my father had one similar many many years ago and I am glad to have found a wonderful replacement. This cleaned the grout on my floors with little to no effort and the constant steam flow lasted for a good time before I had to refill. The only downfall is you can lose momenteum while you are waiting for it to cool off to add more water if you have doing a bigger job. When I first got this I used it to clean everything I could think off, kitchen cabinets, crevices of the oven, grout in my kitchen and laundry room, to corners of every wall in my house. This is nothing short of amazing!!!",

I would say buy it knowing that you are still going to need to scrub and there a chance it will explode and/or break.",

The problem is that the steam output is very hot for about a minute before it weakens and has to reheat for a few minutes. Cleaning ends up taking forever! I find it much faster just to clean using cleaning products and a scrub brush and also have the bonus of not looking like a drowned rat when I\u2019m done. The handle also gets very hot while in use.

A poor handle to carry on handheld mode (a shoulder strap Would have been nice). The steam tube cannot Be shortened for hand held functional which feels like you are carrying a small vacuum all around. It is a back breaker vs stand up steamers So overall at the exception of the steam power. I was very disappointed with the design and functionality of the product.",

      "text": "After buying a new home that needed some deep cleaning I decided to give this a try. It has a learning curve and still requires the use of elbow grease, but man does it clean! I\u2019ve used it in the oven (worked ok) to the bathroom tiles (AMAZING) and keeping looking around for other things to use it on. It also got some dark scuff marks off the old linoleum in the kitchen fairly easily and just that was enough to sell me on it. Turn your heater down and thrown on shorts and a tank though-the combined heat of hard work and the steam from the machine replicates hot yoga.",
