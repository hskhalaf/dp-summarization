I used it to make some spicy Indian food: it was just the right length for stirring inside a big (8qt) pot, and even better, it came clean easily in warm soapy water with no fuss, with only light staining from the spices. (Turmeric will stain just about anything, so this is an expected and acceptable result.) I can recommend it highly, it's way better than my older 14 inch large wooden cooking spoons. I haven't found anything better for my use.",

I rarely make actual spaghetti noodles, preferring instead smaller pastas like shells, penne, or rotini. For these pastas, this spoon just doesn't work. It won't pick up any of the pasta, and when you do manage to get something on the spoon, it's a balancing act to keep it there until you plate it. If you want something that looks good, by all means purchase this as a decorative piece. If you want something that works, look for something with more depth to it to make grabbing your pasta easier.",
