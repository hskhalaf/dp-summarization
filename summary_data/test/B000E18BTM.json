      "text": "This was my first digital camera, but I have found it to be fairly easy to use (at least in \"Simple\" mode) - haven't investigated all the features that it does have, which seem to be voluminous. The stabilizer seems to work quite well. In my first 125 pictures, only about 3 or 4 were at all blurry - while most were crystal clear. The only negative is true of all digital cameras, I imagine, with just the LCD screen (no viewfinder) - in bright conditions, you just have to guess because you cannot see the picture to preview. I look forward to investigating the features in the upcoming months. I would definitely recommend this camera.",

While taking pictures a message of \"turn of and off camera\" appeared, I checked the manual and it said that when that happens you should take it to repair or call the dealer, because is not working properly. What I think is that they know about their poor quality that they put that on the manual. So, if you want a reliable camera stay away form this one. I got it because I was going to a cruise, but after that of course I couldn't take any photo with this thing, if you can call it camera.",

I already have sets of rechargeable from my old camera, so I didn't need to spend extra for proprietry batteries.",

The only way to move around the files is to export them back onto your photo card and then move them to a destination. I have since found another program to manage the files. Get the camera and the cannoli s, leave the software.",

The macro function works well the flash is very bad for close up shots where you really want good color representation. Instead this will probably end up as the family camera for travel, recreational shots, etc., for which it is a good camera and an especially good value for the price.",

I have experimented with the many modes and settings, and yet three out of every four pictures I have taken are blurry or out of focus. Even in full sunlight!

It's got 6x optical zoom when most cameras under $200 have 4x max and if you change the aspect ratio you can get a total of 7.5x optical zoom which is very good to say the least.
