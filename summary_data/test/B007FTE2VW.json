Some things about the interface are very nice, although some of these design choices are limiting too. The biggest criticism is that the Glassbox engine, supposedly based on the idea that each agent is represented, is flawed in execution if not in concept. A dedicated balanced RCI system has been abandoned for arbitrary and illogical rules. EA is taking far too much time fixing known bugs while continuing to introduce new ones.",

Servers were always down or full, so I could not play the game for which I paid all that money. I will NEVER buy another EA game. EVER.",

DRM is fine, but being forced to always have internet past the initial connection to force social interaction with your city is the failing of EA and Maxis at this point.
