I\u2019m sure it goes with nobody\u2019s decor. Two and this is a big one for me. It is creaky every time you open and close it. I have tried to put oil and WD40 to reduce the squeaking but to no avail. It\u2019s distracting to the person on the table to keep opening and closing the cover. Does the company have any ideas on how reduce the squeak?",
