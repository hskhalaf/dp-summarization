      "text": "The most recent review says \"My 11 year old son loves it\". Well...this 48 year old grown man loves it too! :) It took the place in my office of my beloved Lava Lamp which gave up the ghost. Turns out...I like this MORE than I did the Lava Lamp. It makes ZERO noise, and is incredibly soothing to watch. The colors cycle smoothly and its sleek, geometric cylindrical design and a great contrast to the organic, twisting shape of the tornado inside. So happy with this!!!!",
