      "text": "We really like the size of this sink (which fits into our small bath area). Our older home had a huge pedestal sink taking up too much space, so we pulled it out, attached planks of wood to the wall, then had the Barclay installed higher up (for taller people who want easier access). We installed the HOOPLLYS single handle antique copper faucet, which fits nicely and looks vintage. Giving the sink 5 stars for those who want an old-fashioned look in a smaller space.",

      "text": "Just enough room to get your hands in the bowl however its enough to shave and wash your face. It was a must for the space we had. Finish has lasted well and it solved our problem. Get the sink first then wisely choose a faucet as you don't want anything to intrude on the bowl space. The only negative is its so small you drip a little water on the floor occasionally. I would buy this again but it is tiny.",
