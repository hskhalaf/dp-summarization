I would typically change batteries every 6 months when I worked security. Have dropped these many times and they continued to work.

I'm still upset I lost my other surefire with a beveled edge three years ago. This model is cool because it has two light modes. One click is sufficient for most purposes but when I need more light I just give it two quick clicks. This helps to save battery life I know because I haven't had to buy new batteries yet. My old surefire only had one super bright mode and ate up batteries like cookie monster at a the keebler factory.",

As to the light itself it appears to be durable and the illumination pattern is typically Surefire bright, but on my particular example the button requires about 2 or 3 times the pressure to actuate that my SureFire G2 Nitrolons require - in my opinion, too much for convenience.

    "title": "SureFire G2X Series LED Flashlights with Tough Nitrolon Body",
    "description": "Specially designed to meet the needs of law enforcement professionals, the SureFire G2X LE is a higher-output version of our best-selling G2X Pro that leads with high output on its first press or click. It features a high-performance LED that generates a max output of 400 lumens of blinding white light focused by a parabolic reflector into a versatile beam with significant reach and ample surround light for maintaining good situational awareness, crucial in law enforcement. At its lower output the G2X LE produces a useful 15-lumen beam that provides extended runtime on a set of batteries, for tasks that don\u2019t require as much light. \n\nA click-style tactical tailcap switch controls the light\u2019s output--simply press or click to unleash all 400 lumens in momentary- or constant-on mode, an important feature for law enforcement applications where instant access to maximum output provides a tactical advantage. Return to off and press or click again within two seconds for G2X LE\u2019s lower-output 15-lumen beam.\n\nFeaturing a lightweight, durable Nitrolon polymer body designed for a secure hold, a Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum head, and O-rings and gasket seals to keep out moisture and dust, the G2X LE is as rugged as it is functional. It makes an ideal duty light for anyone who wears a badge-or a perfect everyday-carry light for anyone who demands a professional-grade flashlight that\u2019ll take on just about any situation.",
