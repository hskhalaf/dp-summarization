I decided not to take the instructions out of the box to avoid frustration, so the kids just build their own structures with dad's help. Wish it came with a drawstring baggy for the beads and another to contain all the pieces. And I wish it came in clear and/or neon and/or pastel colors as well. I'm so over primary colors.",

Fantastic \"toy\" for learning through experimentation and creativity. Also there was an issue with one piece of the Booster set not working well and the seller's president replaced the entire set overnight. Fantastic customer service.

Yes its fun to do your own thing but get the base model done right first. Really a poor job of assembly instructions",

Also, he is still learning how to make the marbles go through the run the way he intends. I think this is a really good activity for him to engage in, as it makes him consider and choose his options for the desired outcomes. He is also learning patience in the process.

The pieces fit well together, it is very sturdy and stands up well even on carpet. There are an infinite number of ways to build these runs, and this toy never gets boring. Highly recommended.",

There are not enough straight pieces to support the more interesting pieces making it unstable and more likely to fall especially when King Kong (2 year old) comes around to play. Overall, good toy that has captured the attention of very active 5 year old for hours! You will probably need additional marbles also.",

But then my toddler is all like, \"Mom, I want to play\" and ends up knocking it over and wrecking the whole thing. Seriously, he's not old enough to put it together himself yet, but he loves playing with it once I do. Great for all ages, just be cautious of the choking hazards of the marbles.",
