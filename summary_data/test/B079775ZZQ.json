Yes, it is a dimmer and works great with the Kasa app and Amazon Alexa. Very easy installation and setup but you must have a neutral wire at the switch location for this to work. Alexa integration is also a snap to configure. Be advised that this is only rated at 300W incandescent which is pretty low if controlling a bank of incandescent ceiling can lights. LED is a hefty 150W though. I also have a TP-Link Smart Switch (HS200) and 2 Smart Plugs (HS105) that work equally as well.",

I have older romex wire, so very still and I think I may invented a new curse word or two while trying to make it fit. It did go in though and connects easily enough. Just make sure you have dimmable bulbs and may be wise to check behind your old switch before upgrading! You will need both hot and neutral for this to work back there.",

      "text": "This is a very attractive dimmer! We just installed 3 other dimmers with our new LED lights. We received this item and were perplexed that only 2 wires were attached (all the others had 3, and worked GREAT). The instructions show 3 wires and I contacted the company to confirm. Rather than wanting to send me a Non defective product, they told me to Consult with an electrician. I do NOT need to pay someone to tell me what I already know! I would be happy if there was better Customer Service.",

However it operates by simply pushing the button until it makes contact and then the switch returns to its original position. Probably a dumb misunderstanding on my part, however none of the videos or instructions explain or show this. Once I figured this out I was able to get it working. As others have noted, LED lights do not get as dim as I would like them too, but the dimming is adequate. Customer service is slow and you will be responsible for the cost of returning a warranty item.",

I have bought and installed several different brands of switches and plugs over the last few years and this one is by far the finest. I am a professional designer myself and I must to the team who developed this well done!!",
