I thought I'd trial a different brand (B&O) terrible idea, their quality doesn't come close to V-Moda. I sent them back and got a pair of these, one of my better decisions. If you like good quality audio and want wireless I'd recommend these.",

Plus they look nice, are built well, very comfortable and easy to use. They sound as good in Bluetooth mode due to some special engineering. I've read about this company's obsession with quality engineering and quality assurance and control of the production process. This rings true and the proof is the sound! Buy these.

Definitely get the XL earpieces as it adds to the comfort and use of these for extended periods. They really should make the XL earpieces standard as opposed to optional.",

Another issue is that you cannot listen in wired or wireless mode while charging due to static and feedback while the usb chord is plugged in. Other than that, the build quality and packaging are excellent. I have to wonder however, how much of the deluxe packaging is baked into the price. The zippered case is pretty neat, and it's nice to have a 1/4\" adapter and a fun little key-chain, but these should be optional.

The carrying case protects the headphones well although scratches easily. The Bluetooth is strong and delivers great sound quality. There is no noticeable difference between Bluetooth and cable connection. Battery life is plenty long. Only issue is that the ear pads are too shallow for me. I bought the XL and it helps quite a bit although it still hurts my ears if I wear them for long periods of time. The sound is clear with a good amount of base.Overall great well balanced headphones although not the best for those with big ears.",

I plan on keeping the Sony's for backup casual work listening but these Crossfades are amazing for studio and intense listening. CREAMY bass, brings so much flavor and interest back to music listening. The build is super cool looking as well, love the details. Lightweight braided cable with a hard case for travel, I am completely happy with my purchase.",
