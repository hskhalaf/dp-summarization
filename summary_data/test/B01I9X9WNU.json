The instructions were clear, so setting the combination was easy. The lock seems to be well designed and constructed, and functions smoothly. My only complaint is that it does not come with a bicycle mounting bracket, but, since I was aware of that fact prior to purchase, it would be unfair of me to let it influence my rating.",

On occasion, be difficult to lock up so that it holds the railing, front tire and bike frame at the same time. However, this is rarely an issue, and in my opinion doesn't detract from the usefulness of the product.",

I don't really use it to keep anyone out so I can't speak to how well it secures things from potential theft. But it's extremely easy to use.",
