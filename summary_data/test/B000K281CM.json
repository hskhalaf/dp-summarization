I bought myself a pair ($100 plus, forget exactly) last November 21, 2014. They fit and looked great for about 3 months...then the stitching started to fall apart on one shoe. A month later, the stitching on the other side began to unravel. The sides of both shoes have now completely separated and it's too late for Amazon to take them back. If someone from Keen is reading, I'd be interested to know if my experience is something of which you already knew.",

Now, stitching is failling, and the grey footbed on this most recent purchase really sucked in that my foot got sore under 10k steps. Keen needs to employ some QC on their product, since these newports are not cheap! Plus the plastic footbed is much sweatier than the old leather footbeds which I loved. Plus, somehow, it's affecting the arch support as well. Keen, stop resting on your laurels!",

It's just that the size is mis-stated. It is a good thing (for the customer) that Amazon's return process is so efficient and painless.

I also wore them with & without socks on airline flights. Yes over time your feet will smell, but that's easily fixed by... washing your feet. That being said, these are waaaaay better than the Solomon shoes I was previously wearing for Asian travel. Great pair of shoes!",

When new, its sole is flexible, providing a good grip on otherwise slippery and wet surfaces such as a boat deck. After a year or two the sole becomes stiff and traction declines considerably, but this happens with every boat shoe I've ever had. The sizing is tight and I found that 1/2 size larger than normal gives me the correct fit.",

I had specifically chosen these over another pair I was considering because of the closed toe. That turned out to be a good decision--he did a last minute zip line experience on an excursion and you had to have closed toe shoes. :-)",

In addition to not fitting me, the particular pair of sandals that I received were poorly made. The stitching and liners were not symmetrical or matching. The label read Mexico.",
