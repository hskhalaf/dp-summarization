Once I closed it, it didn\u2019t stay shut the clasp is very easy to open, a slight touch or if it hits something in the diaper bag it\u2019ll instantly open up. It was very much of a hassle to keep it closed which caused the wipes to dry out very quickly. After about 4 days it broke in half. The plastic that was holding both pieces together was thin and it easily broke apart. Don\u2019t recommend this product even if you\u2019re looking for something not as pricy, because you\u2019ll end up having to buy something else after a few days.",

This may be made better by adding a rubber gasket beneath the lip, like those found on glass Tupperware containers to create a solid lock, but with its current design it simply doesn't do the job it was designed to do. .
