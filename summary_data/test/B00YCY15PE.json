      "verdict": "Asics adds a new line to its fairly limited trail shoes in the FujiEndurance. The shoe is moderately cushioned with average lugs that enable runners to transition from the road to the trail. Runners will really like its responsive ride with very noticeable ground feedback and water-repelling properties.",
      "pros": [
        "The 6mm sockliner and the soft fabric lining deliver the kind of comfort runners look for in any shoe",
        "The FujiEndurance\u2019s durability is simply incredible, based on most comments",
        "A good number of reviews consider the price tag is decent enough for a shoe of its kind",
        "The traction of the FujiEndurance is very sticky and designed for wet conditions on mud, rocks, and technical trail",
        "Asics designed the lugs that allow runners to take this shoe for a ride on the road",
        "The flexibility and ground feedback of the shoe are moderate enough, despite the lugs and the rock protection plate",
        "The Plasmaguard technology repels water and mud without sacrificing breathability"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some runners found the heel counter as too stiff",
        "The external heel counter and slightly firmer sole is a bit much on flat surfaces, according to some testers",
        "A handful of testers considered the fit a bit too narrow"

      "title": "GREAT RUNNING SHOES!!",
      "text": "Bought these for my husband, who works out and runs 5 times a week. He wanted something that would keep him from having soggy feet since we live in a relatively rainy place. So far these have done the job. This brand was recommended by my aunt, who does regular marathons. I have a pair of Asics myself and they fit great. The rock plate prevents pain from rocks/gravel, the the lugs do not pick up gravel, and the lace garage (in the tongue) prevents them from coming undone. He thinks they are amazing and couldn't be happier.",

      "text": "The rubber that protects your toes from getting wet rub against my toes and make them feel as though they are on the verge of blister after only a 5 mile trail run. If that issue were gone, this would be my new favorite shoe. Using thicker socks helps, but if your feet ever got wet, they would not dry. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but it was my first pair, and these shoes are too expensive to experiment with.",
