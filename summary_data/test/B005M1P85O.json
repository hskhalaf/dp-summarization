Sometimes the heart rate monitor slips when you\u2019re doing an intense workout and it stops working. I don\u2019t like that because I need to keep track of my calories burned.",

I find it is so much easier to be motivated when you are seeing the numbers climb on this counter.

      "text": "I am a novice distance runner in training for my first 1/2 marathon. I've been looking for a product to measure my heart rate (HR) during the various stages of my training. Prior to purchasing this product, I'd considered a pricier Basis B1 (to the tune of $150+). But I don't require the bells and whistles of the latter. And the Basis does not allow real-time HR monitoring - you have to come to a stop before it will register a HR. I'd been turned off by chest-strap HR monitors in the past (the neoprene or plastic chafes and is uncomfortable). But this chest strap is FABRIC! Awesome! I actually forget that I'm wearing it. Highly recommended. Excellent value.",

It syncs up to every machine at the gym and projects your rate heart in front of you. It counts calories very accurately which I certainly appreciate. My only complaint is that the actual heart rate belt is pretty large. It's a one size fits all belt because it's adjustable (like a bra strap). However, I'm 5'2 110 pounds and pretty tiny and it often slips down off of my rib cage even on the smallest setting. Kind of annoying - would hope Polar may make a smaller band.",

But once I get in shape and start working out beyond going for walks, I'll definitely bring this out again.",

The functions are easy to figure out, and the display is easy to read. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase.",

I dreaded setting up zones, time, date - but it was a total cinch! I didn't even need the instruction book - it was just completely obvious on how to set it up. Very easy to use and it is reliable - unlike the H7. So if you like to see how your workouts are going and you need a unit you can count on - order this!",

My only gripe is that I got it in pink but out of all the colors it had the lowest cost. This didn't keep me from giving it 5 stars though.",
