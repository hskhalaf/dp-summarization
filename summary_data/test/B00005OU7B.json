I recommend at least 1 in the upstairs of your housing unit in a place that is easy to get to. This ladder is well made and easy to deploy if necessary so that even kids can do it if left at home and the worst happens. I would certainly recommend this product to others.",

You can't decend a knotted rope if you can't tie it to something and who has time in a smokey room to figure that out. Besides go price a 50 foot 1/2\" rope that will hold 500 lbs, and this ladder holds 1000lbs!",

      "text": "... but am confident it will save my life if I do. This is a great ladder. It has rungs, and straps, and other little doohickeys on it. I'm a big buy (265 lb) and have no doubt this ladder will hold me. The instructions are clear, there's a nice velcro strap that holds it all together (very strong strap). The clamps that go over the window appear to be very strong, and I'm sure will stay in place when deployed. The rungs are also grooved, so it's non-slip. I'm very pleased with his product, but I hope I never have to use it.",

We just couldn't drop the ladder. It is a bit heavy, so I'm not sure how easy It would be for a very small child. It is still very much worth it to me.",
