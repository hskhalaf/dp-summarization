The screen is large making the images easier to see in most any light and the camera adjusts itself to make picture quality better. It can be hooked up to a TV and view the pictures there and of course they can be e-mailed and downloaded quickly. Great buy. Good price.",

Lightweight, very easy to use, takes AWESOME photos. Focus is slightly delayed from newer models but totally acceptable for stills. Video is so-so (grainy), I don't use the wifi feature. Sturdier design than 2nd favorite model Nikon Coolpix s51 - which used to be my fav for lightweight easy PhD (push here dummy) camera. I have 2 Coolpic S51c cameras and am looking to purchase another :) Can't have too many of such a terrific little camera!",

The pictures are so clear. In Vibrant color mode it's even better. Now, I have a very unsteady hand. But this camera does a very good job of NOt showing it. The videos are really nice and I just love this camera. Hope this helps you decide to get this.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S51c 8.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Vibration Reduction Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Nikon Coolpix S51c is an outstanding new compact digital camera combining Nikon's distinctive wave-surface design with advanced features that make it easier to take beautiful photos and to share them with friends and family. Built on a custom application of Nikon's innovative EXPEED digital image processing concept and incorporating the precision optics of a Nikkor lens, the Coolpix S51c is built to realize optimum performance and maximum image quality.\n\nThe Coolpix S51c teams 8.1 effective megapixels of sharp resolution with a new high-performance digital image processing engine and the precision optics of the built-in \"right-angle\" optical lens shift VR (Vibration Reduction) 3x Zoom-Nikkor lens to produce photos with clarity and true-to-life color. Extended light sensitivity as high as ISO 1600 prevents blurred shots when shooting in lower light or when capturing fast-moving subjects.\n\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi support brings Internet connectivity to the Coolpix S51c for even greater fun and freedom. Upload shots directly from the camera to Nikon's my Picturetown server for anytime access using Nikon's Picture Bank function, upload them directly to a blog, or use Picture Mail to trigger an e-mail notification to friends anywhere when new pictures are available to view and download. It also includes Pictmotion, which allows users to create audiovisual shows anywhere by simply selecting favorite images and movies and adding music and visual styles.\n\nThe 3.0-inch LCD monitor offers a bright and large image that eases composition and viewing, even out in the sun. Control buttons and the user-friendly rotary multi selector are carefully positioned to provide intuitive operation. The smooth contours and refined finish of the aluminum face panel fit comfortably in the hand--both models feature a metallic finish with ultra-violet coating providing a brilliant outer sheen.\n\nNikon Coolpix S51c Feature Highlights\n\nProven optical lens shift VR image stabilization\nField-proven technology originally developed for interchangeable lenses used in Nikon SLR camera systems, optical lens shift VR image stabilization provides the ability to shoot at shutter speeds as much as three steps slower without blurring the image, while also realizing a smoother viewfinder image that aids composition. A thin VR unit was specially designed to fit the slim dimensions of the Coolpix S51c.\n\nISO 1600 capability for extended shooting range\nManual sensitivity settings as high as ISO 1600 make it easier to take great-looking pictures in lower lighting conditions or to capture fast moving subjects with outstanding clarity, while the high-performance image processing engine preserves high image quality even when shooting with high ISO settings. Also available is AUTO ISO control, which automatically selects the optimal sensitivity for the shot across a range between ISO 100 and ISO 800, and up to ISO 1600 in High-Sensitivity mode.\n\nmy Picturetown for wireless sharing\nThe Picture Mail button makes it easy to send shots directly from the camera to Nikon's my Picturetown server, allowing instant sharing to friends anywhere. Utilize Picture bank to upload and save pictures with ease onto my Picturetown's secure server.\n\nExpansive 3.0-inch LCD monitor for quality viewing and menu operation\nThe bright, large 3.0-inch LCD monitor almost defying the compact body proportions features 230,000 dots of high resolution, a wide vertical and horizontal viewing angle of 160 degrees and anti-reflection coating for better display in bright situations, and a new acrylic panel that prevents scratches and fingerprints.\n\nOther Features\n * Three unique Nikon image innovations: Face-priority AF with improved speed and efficiency, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix, D-Lighting \n * Light weight with highly compact dimensions \n * Macro shooting from as close as 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) \n * 4x digital zoom extends compositional freedom \n * Improved menu interface, available in a choice of 23 languages \n * Time zone function for easy setting of multiple locations \n * Approximately 13MB of internal memory \n * SDHC card compatibility \n * USB connectivity \n * PictBridge compatibility \n * Stop-Motion animation for more creative fun\n\nWhat's in the box\nNikon Coolpix S51c digital camera, EN-EL8 rechargeable li-ion battery, EH-64 AC adapter , UC-E12 AV/USB cable, strap, Printer Dock Accessory: Dock Insert PV-12, Software Suite CD-ROM",
