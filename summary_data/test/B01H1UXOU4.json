This way the hot dogs get hot and the buns don't burn. Tip 2, if using bun length hot dogs, flip them over when you add the buns. They are just a bit long for the toaster. Easy to take the hot dogs racks out and put them in the dishwasher to clean. And I love the old fashion look. I would recommend it for someone who loves hot dogs.",
