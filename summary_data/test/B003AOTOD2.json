      "text": "I really like this fitted mosquito cover (that's what we use it for more than a sun shade), but it does have a few areas that remain accessible even when snuggly zipped. It's nothing a little clamp on the sides can't fix, though. Not a big deal. There's also a very small open area right at the bottom near the foot rest. If you live in any normal kind of environment, this is not a deal-breaker. We live in a marshy riverside area and it does see some significant bug life. Even so, he's never been bitten. I just stuff a small blanket or t-shirt down there and we're good to go.",

It also somewhat functions as bug protection, but there are a number of gaps. My only complaint is that the stroller will not fold up unless you unhook the bottom of the cover. I see no need to ever take this off, so that is a bit of a pain.",

The sun cover does a decent job of cutting down on sun exposure. Enough that it makes it worth it. The only negative I can find is that it creates a noticeable amount of extra wind resistance. We still use it because it's worth the extra sun protection.",
