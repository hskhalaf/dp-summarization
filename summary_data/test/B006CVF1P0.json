They aren't immune from the sound you hear with almost all earbuds when the cable is bumped. They stay in my ears well when I'm sitting still, but tend to slide out when I'm up and about. The noise isolation is great. So great that when I wear them at work and have music playing at a normal, non-damaging level, people have to make ridiculous motions to catch my eye. It's awesome.",

I love clearly defined sound and I try out almost all earbuds due to the fact that I wear them out or I'll lose them. I have bought most everything, from Shure to Klipsch, and these are right up there among the best of them. Actually, I enjoy these more than the Klipsch and just as much as the Shure(which are a tad more clear) except the bass is more prominent with the Velodyne vPluse, in my opinion, and they're much less expense than the comparable Shure model. If you want great sound inexpensively, I highly recommend these earbuds.",

They always seem to start to hurt after about a couple hours...and I constantly find myself having to push them back in my ear, but when I first put them in my ears, it's an awesome experience as they really block outside noise even with low volume. But within 5-10 minutes they slowly start working their way out and it does become annoying. I'll still be searching for a better pair.",

The small rubber bits are too small and the mediums are slightly too big, meaning I have to periodically push them back in to get a good seal.

I don't do anything beyond normal use. I've tried to contact the seller from whom I've bought them, but I've yet to hear anything. Sucks.",

The version of the controls that came with my pair have a volume toggle switch with a slightly raised rectangle in the middle for pause\\skip\\replay.

I have been using Klipsch S4i for the past year, and for the same price i think Vpulse has better clarity and the lows are much more distinct. that being said i cant get them to stay in my ears. No matter which size tip i use, i am constantly fidgeting with them to get a good seal. Needless to say its an never ending battle that i always lose. That is when i am sitting down, its impossible to get great sound when i am walking around. I love the sound of these headphones, but the fit is bad enough that i have gone back to my Klipsch set.",

I seriously considered buying a second pair just in case I ever lost the originals. Unfortunately, after 5 months of use (with very good care) they now crackle with the slightest bit of movement. It's very sad to me, as they were my favorite. I might end up buying another pair, even with the expectation they'll only last 6 months, because I miss the sound quality so much.",
