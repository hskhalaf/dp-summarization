This comes with 1 battery that has as much power as the other two combined and it's about half the price.",

Plus, the battery charges super-fast, and is interchangeable with the ones for my(or any other Makita 18V Li-Ion tool, for that matter), so no worries about ever running out of charge and having to wait. Also, I'd highly recommend getting theat the same time.",

There is a difference in specs somewhere, but the lower price of my impact gun had no negative feedback from someone using the next step up as their daily driver at work. Wish I would have owned this earlier as it is very handy to have on hand. At $99 this deal has paid for itself over and over again",

I bought a 3/8\" socket adapter and drove 5\" 5/16 lag bolts into house framing no sweat! No worries about battery memory - and it keeps its charge for a very long time just sitting on my bench. No rounding out a Phillips screw unless you really try to. Very impressive.",

      "text": "This is a great tool well worth the 99 bucks we paid for it!!!! I can't believe how many projects i have gotten finished in the last few days since i purchased it. I debated back and forth between Dewalt and Makita and I know I made the right choice going with Makita. I don't need to use my cordless drill any more as this will handle everything i need it for. The big thing i notice about it is the chuck very easy and solid no give at all when changing bits.",

      "text": "Ive been looking to buy a Makita for awhile now but most local stores want $300+. Found this deal and thought there must be something im not seeing, waaaay too cheap. However, upon receiving my Makita, I couldn't be happier. Amazing ergonomics, light, well balanced, and powerful. Cheaper than my Craftsman I bought from Sears, and definetly higher quality. Im going to buy another for a friend.",
