While I loved the 200D, this camera is light years ahead in every way. Very rugged, excellent build quality and fit and finish, amazing features and lots of buttons means less fumbling around in various menus. A GPS receiver replaces a built-in flash, but that is ok, I use an external flash anyway and the GPS is very helpful if you want to return to that perfect spot. Excellent camera and great price!",

I purchased it for hiking, I carry this plus a few small primes or a small zoom depending on the hike. The solid build quality and weather resistance means I am not worried about the equipment when I am hiking. Pair this with some good lenses like the DFA 100 Macro and the 15 limited and you have a killer set. I plan on taking this along with 3 primes on a 200 mile hike in the Sierras this year.",

I generally prefer built-in geo tagging(depends on what you shoot, I shoot street and landscape)than the flash cause I never really use the built-in flash. This camera is best for outdoor photography(hiking, beach, street, forest, wildlife, etc), and it doesn't give a damn about the weather. Durable body, you could shoot with this camera all day.

The new AA simulator - a highly innovative function developed specifically for the K-3II - allows the user to effectively minimize moir\u00e9 without actually installing an optical AA filter in the camera, providing a choice of filtered or filter-free shooting for a given scene or subject. The K-3II also offers pixel shift resolution technology that moves the image sensor unit in minute increments, a single pixel pitch at a time, to capture four shots. Pixel Shift Resolution merges those shots into a single image to generate an ultra high-definition image. This difference makes it excellent for detail and color reproduction, creating super high-definition images. The time-proven dustproof, weather-resistant body construction ensures dependable, flawless performance in the field.",
