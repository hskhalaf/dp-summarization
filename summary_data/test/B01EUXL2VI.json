The case kept saying that it was \"not connecting\" to my phone and would not let me download any of my music onto the app. Also the case breaks very easy. I dropped it on carpet and when I picked it up there was a crack about 2 inches long. And the top of the case is supposed to be removable so you can take it off of the phone, but after you take it off a couple times it becomes loose and will then keep following off all the time. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!!",
