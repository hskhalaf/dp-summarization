The mount tilt adjustment (in the photo) that attaches to the back of the tv is not a sturdy design. After a year of use the tilt adjustment/lock Bracket has bent. This doesn\u2019t hold the weight of the tv only the weight from the tilt. This just means that over time this mount will slowly tilt your tv forward. My tv is within the limits. This is a little disappointing besides this issue I would give 5 stars.",

      "text": "This is my third Cheetah TV mount, and I\u2019m just as pleased with it as all the others. The only tiny inconvenience is that both of the tightening screws are oriented in the same direction, which means one of them is behind the mounting framework after you\u2019ve mounted the TV. A short screwdriver can reach it, but it\u2019s a little tricky. Ultimately, not enough to knock off a star. Phenomenal product. Be warned: measure your studs first. If they\u2019re not exactly 16\u201d on center or less, get the 24\u201d model, not this one. The product works great, but it is specific to that size limitation.",

Use light color packing plastic and shipping so that it\u2019s easy to get handle on various parts and small screws. All black packaging makes it very hard to hunt for right parts and follow instructions. 2. I would prefer a one piece frame bar rather than joint in between for larger TV. Joint in middle limit the lateral adjustment flexibility of the TV due to hindering screws. It also limits the choice of wholes for mounting to stud. Overall I like it and may buy it again for small tv 55 or lower but for higher sizes do not recommend.",

      "text": "I have a Vizio e43-c2 (43\") that I used this mounting bracket with. After looking up the VESA mm for this model tv (which is 200mm x 200mm), I didn't think this was the correct mount because the instructions don't list it but it fits and the included M6 screws work with this television for the bracket, so you're good. I affixed the magnets to the release paws and can't get them to stick to the metal brackets for whatever reason. My only issue is I wish the tilt things on the brackets had some sort of click feel so I could match both sides up to the same degree of tilt instead of eye balling it.",

      "text": "This is a sturdy and tilt-adjustable mount perfect for our 55\". We've used other types of TV mounts before, but the instructions for this model was easiest to follow. All pieces needed to assemble and install were included. I would recommend this to anyone. One thing to note: the gap between the back of the TV and the wall was a bit larger anticipated. We did read the clearance space on the product description, but it did not seem like it would be as pronounced when holding a tape measure to the wall before purchasing. For anyone looking for the most narrow profile may want to look for another option, but will likely not find anything that tilts.",

    "title": "Cheetah Mounts Dual Articulating Arm TV Wall Mount Bracket for 20-65\u201d TVs up to VESA 400 and 115lbs, Mounts on Studs up to 16\u201d and Includes a Twisted Veins 10\u2019 HDMI Cable & 6\u201d 3-Axis Magnetic Bubble",
    "description": "Size:VESA 400 Dual ArmFits TVs up to VESA 400 (NOT VESA 600)\n\nThis mount fits TVs up to VESA 400. Most TVs 65\u201d and smaller use VESA 400 or smaller. But some TVs 65\u201d and smaller use VESA 600. This mount will Not fit VESA 600 even if the TV is 65\u201d or less. If your TV has a VESA 600 hole pattern, we suggest the APDAM2B.\n\nFits 16\u201d Studs (NOT 20\u201d or 24\u201d)\n\nThe wall plate for this mount is 17\u201d and will fit 16\u201d wall studs. Once mounted on two 16\u201d wall studs, the TV will be centered between the two studs. No side to side adjustment is possible. If your walls have 20\u201d or 24\u201d studs, this mount will not fit. For 24\u201d studs, we suggest the APDAM2B.\n\nTV Screws\n\nMany TVs require no screws because they use the same screws from the TV stand. This mount ships with one set each of 4mm, 5mm, 6mm and 8mm TV screws. It also includes spaces to adjust for screw length. These screws support most TVs but Not All TVs. If your TV requires different screws, Cheetah Mounts stocks hundreds of TV screw sets at their US warehouse which they will ship for free.\n\nTV Leveling\n\nIf you mount the wall plate level on the wall, the TV plate may still not be level. To correct for this, there are four screws where the arms attach to the TV plate. If you loosen these screws you can rotate the TV plate to level it. The amount of rotation adjustment required can vary as the arms are extended.\n\n14\" Extension, Low 2.7\" Profile, 130\u00b0 Swivel, \u00b120\u00b0 Tilt, \u00b13\u00b0 Rotation Adjustment\n\nThe articulating arm extends up to 14\" from the wall yet collapses to 2.7\". The mount allows for up to 130\u00b0 swivel, \u00b120\u00b0 tilt and \u00b13\u00b0 of rotational adjustment. The amount of swivel is limited on larger TVs as the edge of the TV hits the wall.\n\n10' Twisted Veins HDMI Cable and 6\" Magnetic Bubble Level\n\nThe mount includes a 10\u2019 Twisted Veins High Speed with Ethernet HDMI cable featuring 4K 60HZ HDR signal support and a protective braided jacket.",
