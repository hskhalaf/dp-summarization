The each letter was separated and it didn't stick to my wall properly, took the paint off my wall in a few spots, and it was just overall a HORRIBLE experience. I must add that I followed the instructions to a t, but it didn't help. I REALLY wanted to love this decal because we're decorating our first purchased home, so this was a big deal to me, but I was more than disappointed, and that doesn't happen too often.Unless my item was defected, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product for purchase.",
