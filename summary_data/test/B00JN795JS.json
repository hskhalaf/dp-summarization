Tried shaving the plastic and Vaseline and neither worked. Can not comment on screws and lid as I did not get that far.

Since Suncast products are built to withstand the elements, I figured this would last another twenty yrs plus, since it is inside in the master bedroom. It is bigger than the previous unit, so it holds more bath linen and bed linen. It was easy to put together without hubby\u2019s help! The white color brightens the corner area as well as makes the room look neater and bigger. And the price was better than the Big Z! Thanks, Amazon, for offering this very useful, yet stylish product!",

By loosening them a little, it shuts and latches just fine. It stores cushions just great. I don't have it out in the elements, but just in case of water getting near the table, I placed a sheet of 5 mil plastic around the bottom and inside. I've only had this a week and this review is based on that. If it changes, I will amend.",
