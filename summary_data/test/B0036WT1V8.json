Simply turning on the BluRay unit caused the plasma to turn on and select the proper input. Though I still included the discreet IR commands in the main system program, just to be sure, it seems that for most, they will find this the easiest setup ever. WiFi integration, for downloading to HD, or streaming, was quick and the user interface is excellent. It delivers on image quality too, worth the setup to enable THX color calibration on the plasma, as well as a modified version also, for those who have the skills to tweak the factory settings.",

Now 14 days after receiving it and three more phone calls to the factory in Huntsville, AL I'm told it will be another 30 days for the part to arrive. So I have been without it for 1/3 of the time I've owned it. (Now that is saying they will actually fulfill their statement ....I'm not holding my breath.)",

My WiFi is not real fast so the hard drive came in handy when I downloaded some added features from an Avatar bluray dvd vs streaming which probably would have been choppy. It took quite a while to download to the dvd hard drive but playback is fine. It was also easy to check for firmware updates since there is a icon for that and I downloaded an update thru the WiFi.",

It was so easy to connect to my WIFI system and now I can watch my families posted Youtubes over my TV, watch any movies I wish off of NETFLIX, listen to Pandora and enjoy my music, I couldn't ask for a better system. I don't notice any delays watching DVD's or Blu-rays.",

I just got the unit out of the box and expect the other reviewers comments to hold true. Therefore I'll give this unit 4 stars unless I come back to amend this review. PS -- Be sure to run the update to get the latest firmware after opening.",

No Amazon videos on this and no option to add Amazon, which has almost replaced Netflix (which we recently swore by) in our house. On the LG, there is no Netflix SEARCH capability so you have to go to a computer to search and add Netflix videos to the LG's \"instant view\", then you may select. With the Roku, we could search on the television without a computer. I've only had this for three weeks, but I am very disappointed that it does not have obvious and expected capabilities.",
