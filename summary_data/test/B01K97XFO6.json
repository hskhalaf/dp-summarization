The Chill Pad is very lightweight, stores much more easily, and doesn't end up getting the funky musty odor after a weeks worth of usage like we experienced with the Frog Toggs brand.

It is a nice lightweight towel, so there's some value there. But I don't find it to be particularly cooling. You soak it in water and you have a damp towel, the colder the water the colder the towel. So there is some cooling while it's damp, but I don't get the sense it provides any more cooling than any other damp towel would. Maybe it stays damp longer than other towels? But it really didn't stay damp for very long so I'm not sure that's the case either.",

This mesh one is easy to wash and dry and keep sanitary.",

I have other similar towels which may cost a few dollars less but these are better because they are longer (40 inches instead of 32 inches). This is key because longer towels offer more surface area for cooling. The longer towel is more versatile as it can be tied and worn around your neck during a match if the conditions mandate. Kept mine in a large ziplock with ice + H20 and it was the first thing I grabbed during changeovers. We won!!",

It stays cool for SO long without needing to re-wet it. (Usually about 4 hours). You can leave it on without needing to take it off to \"snap\" it like a lot of other brands require.

      "text": "The Chill Pal absolutely saved our sanity when my family and I went to the Disney theme parks in the dead heat of July. The cloth is soft and easy to store (the packaging that it came with was perfect for keeping our stuff dry when on the water rides). It was AMAZING how cold the towel was after snapping it a few times. I bought both the Chill Pal and the Frog Toggs. I ended throwing away the Frog Toggs because it was too much to maintain and it barely worked. I will definitely buy another Chill Pal. Worth every cent!",

So this towel comes in very handy. Just wash first with your regular laundry, wet and wring out before use, snap and ready to use. Snap again to reactivate to cooling power. It helps me keep the air conditioner on a lower speed. Great for if your exercising or any activity where you sweat and want to cool down. I love the size. It's 12\" by 40. So about as long as 2 dish towels in you sewed them together. Fits nicely around the neck. Highly recommend.",

      "text": "I was in Baltimore this past weekend for a baseball game and the heat index was at 112 degrees. I brought the cooling towel with me and dunked in our melted ice that was in the cooler. It helped so much! Had to dunk it again only once more during the game. The key is really if there is airflow/a breeze. If it's not breezy at all or you aren't using cold water, it might not feel as nice. Definitely will use this again for another hot day!",
