From reading the other reviews, I think I may have gotten a bad batch because other people describe the scent as smelling of \"black licorice and wood\". Also, the ingredients were separated when I received the order. I'm thinking of contacting Amazon and asking for my money back being as these items (the balm and the oil) aren't returnable for hygiene reasons (which is understandable).",

I still recommend this, but I would not recommend it for a starting beard. The smell people tell me is like a Vaseline scent (however I do not smell it when I use it).",

The product is a bit oily and if you touch your beard at all after applying you can feel it on your hand. It does a good job of rubbing into your skin though and isnt so oily that you feel like you need to wash your hands. The balm doesn't quite seem to have the hold I would prefer and it really isn't meant to have much hold. I may try the wax once this can runs out and see if that suits m preference.",

The real downside is that anything your touch with your beard will be oily (phone / hand / lady you just greeted). Therefore its better be used as a night time conditioner than a day time product. Also it'll make your beard shine - A LOT. Its a matter of taste I guess, but its not my taste. Wouldn't recommend not buying it if you like it that way. Definitely moisturized my beard, but other palms do that as well without being so runny.",

I brush it through with a boar bristle beard brush (say that five times fast) from Smooth Viking, which I also love. I will say that it doesn't shape your hair in anyway, seems to be more of a conditioning product, so if that's what you need keep looking. Very good quality product, will definitely purchase again.",

You only need a couple of penny sized finger full, so it goes a long way, and on the site they even recommend using every other day instead of every day. I use it on my damp beard after coming out of the shower. Scent is neutral to me, some may like it more than others, but either way it\u2019s barely noticeable that it even has a scent.",

As for how it WORKS, I've only been using for a few days, but it already seems to be tackling that dreaded \"Beard Dandruff\" problem and has made the beard softer and more manageable.

If you dig through the layer of clots, the original balm fabric can still be found below, but with the clots on top, it's challenging to use.. The clots cannot be easily flattened out so some clots will definitely end up in your beard... I will not purchase this product again...",

    "title": "Honest Amish Beard Balm Leave-in Conditioner - Made with only Natural and Organic Ingredients - 2 Ounce Tin",
    "description": "The best for your beard we guarantee it. Honest Amish Beard Balm is created from the finest organic ingredients available. We start with a proprietary blend of hair strengthening botanical infused in a base of Virgin Argan, Avocado, Almond, Virgin Pumpkin Seed, and Apricot Kernel Oils. It is then masterfully crafted with fruit and nut butters (Shea, Aloe, Cocoa, Kokum, to name a few), and hair enhancing essential oils. Subtle scents of Cedarwood, Anise (licorice), and Clove. We recommend that people with nut allergies avoid this product or test a small amount before application. Honest Amish Beard Balm will help soften, condition, dry splitting hairs, and nourish new growth. Our balm is also very conditioning for your skin and will stop the itching caused by new growth and wild rogue hairs. Due to the use of only natural ingredients in our beard balm, separation of the product may occur when exposed to fluctuations in temperature. The beard balm will continue to work as normal; it will just require a few extra seconds of manipulation when melting in your hands. However, to return it back to a smooth consistency it can be melted back down by placing the beard balm in a warm place (direct sun light, in car, heater vent, etc. Do not use open flames, microwaves, or stove tops) Once melted, secure the lid on your beard balm and shake it up, mixing up all the oils. Then allow to cool to room temperature or place in refrigerator for faster solidification. Beard Balm may liquefy in transit USE CAUTION WHEN OPENING. We use absolutely NO man made chemicals or preservatives and NO fake fragrances or colorants in any of our products. Packaged in a 100 percent recyclable tin. Made in The U.S.A. by hand for an honest wage. If you are not 100 percent satisfied with your purchase for any reason, please return it for a full refund.",
