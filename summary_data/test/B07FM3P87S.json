I would recommend renaming the switches from their default names for more natural voice commands that more clearly identifies a device.

When I went back to my other router it worked fine. I'm not sure if this is true of all smart powerstrips or just this brand.",

Downloaded the app, plugged it in, connected to my wifi, Alexa found it immediately and that was it. 3 minutes tops! I will be buying more.",
