It also has the added bonus of keeping ingredients separate, since the spoons don't have to rest on each other (I like to keep my spooning in the bedroom or the couch, not the kitchen).

This isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but it makes it difficult to cook more than a couple things at once, for instance if you want to have your ladle for a pasta sauce and a spoon for stirring your pasta it's not very possible to keep both off your stove or counter with this.",
