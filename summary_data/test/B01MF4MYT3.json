After a few months of use, the X3 are worthless for working out or running. With a full charge, so much as a tiny bump to the volume controls, the headphones turn off. I stop running, I turn them back on and the overly perky robot voice tells me they need to be charged. I turn them off for 10 min, and the magically are changed again.

Honestly if it was 2016 2017 these would be great, but since it's 2020, wireless is much more convenient now than ever before. So I recommend that if you can save up for some wireless earbuds I would say do that instead for getting these. There great just not wireless.",

You need their proprietary connector which they only give you one of. They don't have a pack you can buy for a few dollars you have to buy the entire accessory kit to get another connector. I contacted their support we'll see what they do before I return them. For over $100 they should use standard USB or they should at least give you three or four of those tiny connectors.",

      "text": "iPhone users beware, this pair of earphones have a 500-600 millisecond audio lag on my iPhone 8. This makes it quite unbearable for me when watching videos or playing games on my iPhone 8. Listening to music is fine, though. However there is no lag when I am using these earphones on my windows PC and it seems that this issue is only present in iPhones as my android phone did not have any audio lag.",

Overall, I am not disappointed in my purchase.",
