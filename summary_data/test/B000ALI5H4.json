He just had surgery on his elbow and it appears that he will always walk with a limp. These pills may be a good idea and the dog will eat them no problem; however, they are expensive and just come in a bag with a twisty.",

She could barely walk!!! She felt really bad the whole day, we were thinking to bring her to the pets emergency room, but in the evening, we saw a progress to getting better. The second day, she was still recovering and third day, she was OK again. We are returning the product and we have to try to find some other source of glocosamine. It is very dangerous product!!!",

The price I paid on Amazon is a significant savings over the vet.'s price too. My dogs also love the taste. They wait every morning for their \"vitamin\" and think of them as an extra treat. Definitely worth a try if you have an old arthritic dog.",

The only reason they got 4 stars is that the chews used to be very soft and appealing, but changed and are now drier and it's hard to squash pills into them. Still an effective supplement, though!",
