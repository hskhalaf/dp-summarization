There is a little sting but nothing to say ouch over just another point to someone new to this. It works like it says and stops bleeding from small cuts. Alum should not be consumed since there is a possible link to cancer but i figure for my skin it should be okay. This is my first time trying to jump on the saftey razor wagon and a coworker said i should get this. I am NOT disappointed with my purchase.",

Sure, it's nice to get more bang for your buck, but applying the alum is cumbersome and awkward when compared to the nice, compact size of the RazoRock. And considering *all* alum blocks last an eternity (or at least until you drop it), I don't think bigger is necessarily better, so I won't be purchasing this one again.",

Many less expensive bars are from chemically derived components. This alum block is superior as an aftershave treatment with antiseptic properties. To use, simply wet the bar in cold water and rub the bar against your skin. Wait 30 seconds or so, and then rinse. You will feel the antiseptic in action. This bar is great for treating minor shaving cuts and nicks as well.",
