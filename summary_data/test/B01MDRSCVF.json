With this, my favorite part was the attachment hose sealer in combination with the resealable bags. Perfect for leftovers and cheeses. What I didn't like was 2 months in and the pump started to go haywire. All of a sudden the vacuum pump was twice as loud and barely removed air. i.e. stopped working. I DID buy the extended warranty on it through Asurion but am having some difficulty getting that fixed. If it's within the manufacturers warranty you're supposed to go through Foodsaver. So I'm trying to get that resolved.",

It is very unfortunate but these are just mass-produced cheap Chinese made machines with a fancy looking exterior. The first 3 units I had a much louder motor that lasted about 6 months before no longer suctioning. I presume after receiving a tremendous amount of returns due to motor failure, they finally started using a lower torque motor. Nevertheless, the new motors, while quieter, still do not hold up to daily use for any more that just a few months.",

There are only two of us, in our household, but we prefer to buy food products, especially meats, in the family size containers, as it is usually more economical that way, and then divide it up into the size portions that we need. And, these Food Savers have saved us so much money! This is the second one that we have purchased, and it is differently worth what we paid for it. But,one of the best features, is that it has a place to store the bags in it, which saves on having to find additional storage space.",

      "Save more, waste less: Meat preserved with the foodsaver system in the freezer can last up to 3 years and still taste fresh, flavorful, and freezer-burn free. Prep-ahead meals, leftovers, and produce stored in the fridge will stay fresh up to weeks later instead of spoiling in days",
      "Express bag maker: The express bag maker reduces bag making steps by 50% compared to foodsaver V4000 models, thanks to a unique second heat-sealing bar to automatically prep the next bag",
      "More convenient to use: Easy view vacuum window lets you easily control where you seal while the open roll storage design lets you see when you need to replace the roll. Plus, led light indicators easily guide you through the vacuum sealing process. Just press the vacuum and seal bar to remove the air that causes freezer burn and spoilage",
      "Very consistent sealing: Equipped with dual heat sealing strips, it's to reach an optimal vacuum level and airtight seal. The fm5200 is durable, high quality, and backed by a 5-year limited",
      "Automatic moisture detection: Smart technology automatically detects moisture and switches to the correct mode to ensure an airtight seal is achieved. The patented removable drip tray will catch any overflow liquid and is dishwasher safe, making this kitchen appliance easy to clean and maintain 8 x 20 inches heat seal rolls and (3) 11 x 16 inches heat seal rolls"
