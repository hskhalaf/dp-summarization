Other apps as well, can't remember them all. But it has connected to every app we have tried on both iPhone & android, whether code readers or performance apps. I highly recommend for the price. This is WIFI and not Bluetooth so sometimes it can take an extra step or two to set up, but always works, eventually.\ud83d\ude42",

After an hour it usually works when plugged in again. Would not recommend. 9/7/18 I drilled out the melted pins on the device and discovered a possible reason for its loss of connection. The top board was loose from the main chip. Some sealant to hold it in place, and voila, it works. Good because I needed to clear a code.",

I suspect that interference with other 2.4 ghz signals around the house had something to do. Attached are some screen shots from OBDCarDoctor. Over all device is definitely worth $20. Itsso much better to be able to use app on your phone than regular OBD reader.",

      "text": "Really like the scanner. I would recommend purchasing the Dashboard app to get the full use of this great tool. Only thing I don't like is that if you are driving with it on and it's connected to wifi you really can't use your phone for anything else. Such as if someone is with you and wants to use the interweb, gps in searching for a hotel on the road you have to disconnect and turn your wifi off to use other functions on the phone. Also it would be nice to interface the scanner information via wifi to a computer program. Other than that I love the scanner. Highly recommend.",
