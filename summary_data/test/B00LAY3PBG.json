It's not bitter and the beans are not burnt , instead they have this pleasant toasted flavor. I've had such a pleasant experience with this brand that I plan on trying some of their other varieties. The beans arrived fresh and the expiration date was a good ways out.",

I was buying Kicking Horse coffee (Grizzly Claw) and thought I'd get a better bang for buck with Pete's only to be waiting on another bag of Kicking Horse to arrive. Even at 4-5 tablespoons per cup it's just not as strong as what I like in flavor, aroma and mouth feel. It's just not there.",
