You definitely need backup battery in order to continue working on your medium size yard (LB2X3020) which is very hard to find and expensive ($59.99 on amazon 7/14/18) ans has no generic version like other models that you can find for a fraction of original cost. 3. Power switch has no \"lock\" option and it's so tiring to hold it for 15-20 mins.",

      "text": "Unfortunately this string trimmer kept breaking at the trigger handle. A crack started to form (inside) causing the trigger handle not to fully engage with the switch to power on the trimmer. I know the batteries are good because I have 3 separate batteries. I was able to hack the inside to get it to work for about 1 month longer and eventually the crack in the trigger handle got worse. This string trimmer was great, lightweight, pretty powerful but the design to the trigger has a flaw. I ended up going with the Husqvarna gas powered. All the money I spent (batteries, and 2 string trimmers) I could've just purchased the Husqvarna.",

I saw this online in YouTube and the guy says it works well but I wasn\u2019t sure but the price was cheap and I\u2019m low on money so bought one. Damn this thing works good! The charge with little battery is surprisingly plenty even on full mode. The best part is the line being fed properly and ease of cutting pesky grasses on the driveway. I don\u2019t have to wear ear plugs either! Clean as hell with no more oil and gas mix! Highly recommend this thing.",

Don\u2019t bother with this edger. I use it on a small yard with basic blades of grass (NOT using it for big weeds or thicker St Augustine grass) and I had to go over it back and for 2-3 times to get this to cut. Very weak, zero power and doesn\u2019t get the job done.",

I am impressed by the efficiency and it just handles better than my other black and decker trimmer. Highly recommended after using it twice. I'll update my review if anything should change.",

It's button-controlled cord release might be an improvement on the classic \"bump\" style, but it's rather awkward to use and sometimes you can end up without string and having to dig it out of the spool - something the automatic dispenser never permitted to happen. Other than that, it's your basic BD nicely ergonomic weedeater.",
