The base doesn't seem strong to keep books or anything heavy... but it is great for kid's toy, pillows, blanket. Also the fabric on the top lid is odd. I was expecting it to be seamless but there is a X like seam (see the pic) centered on the lid. The images don't align across the seams on the top. So if that bothers someone, it may not be a good purchase.",

      "text": "Just got our Linon Stephanie script ottoman yesterday. Packaging was A+ and assembly\u2014attaching the legs\u2014was easy (hardware and Allen wrench included), and the illustrated directions were very clear. Each leg is attached in 3 places, with mounting brackets, making the ottoman very sturdy. Kudos also for the hinges and the vent holes on the bottom. We got a discounted price, which is always nice. Gray color matched the photo. The underlying material beneath the fabric is stiffer than I was expecting, but that may soften up over time. If you want a cushy ottoman, best not get this one. Otherwise, thumbs up!",

The legs are easy to install and each leg has 3 bolts...I think they will be and will remain sturdy and stable without becoming wobbly. I thought from the sellers photo the top was tufted but mine is not...small detail and I am still pleased. Highly recommend this ottoman.",

The company could have debated me a few bucks because they couldn't just send me a new lid. It was around the holidays so I chose just to keep it and take a loss.

The cushion on top is a little soft, it indents but reshapes easily . The fabric is nicely decorated with writing. Good value for the money. Others I looked at were a $100+",
