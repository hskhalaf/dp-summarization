I was a little concerned because it felt weak and I've had problems with LG brand products in the past (my dishwasher didn't last more than a month and the fridge has problems) It burned by discs great up until right about now. Keep in mind that although I've had this for almost 7 months, it never leaves my desk and I've only burned about 10 discs on it. Needless to say, it won't read any discs I put in it. At least it was cheap. Shop for something worth your money, please. I've made my mistake with this one.",

After doing a lot of research, my conclusions are that the Surface Pro 3 and many other ultra thin laptops have insufficient USB power to drive most portable DVD/CD drives. I have purchased a Y cable to test this theory. Meanwhile, LG, who typically provides excellent product, should find a solution and make it available (extra cost is OK) and describe the solution in its listings for low powered USB computers.",

Despite not being able to view the device in \"finder\" you can stick in a disk and it will operate on the MAC OS. This product lacks proper instructions and disclaimers. It only provides information for Windows, which is why it is confusing whether it is even compatable. However, it is compatable with MAC OS.",

I probably won't use it that much, but it is a great investment to have in the event I need to read a disc. I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in one.",

      "text": "I was so excited to get an external CD drive for my computer. I don't need to play cds or dvds often and this seemed like a perfect tool. Even though it was hard to open and sometimes was glitchy, it was OK for occasional use. I played cds maybe a dozen times in the last 7 months. And now it simply won't work, won't even boot up. I guess it's the same old story - you get what you pay for.",

I only used it once, to install software and it was fairly loud, I don't know if it runs constantly like that during a movie but the sound could be quieted by firmly placing my hand on the top of it. It feels a bit flimsy and I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use, however, if it's just for the occasional software that requires a CD/DVD then this does the trick and installs easily on Windows 10.",

My PC is recognizing the drive, but the drive won't read any disks and it will only open via the emergency eject hole. It won't even read the set up disk that came with it. I have no idea why it suddenly stopped running other than that it must not be a quality product.",
