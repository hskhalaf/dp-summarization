Chips of ice do end up mixed in with the shaved ice as a result of the cubes being shaved down small enough to fall through the blades. Making larger blocks of ice that fit the \"D\" shaped opening reduces the chips significantly. It would be nice if the unit, especially the crank arm and handle, were sturdier. There's a lot of flex in the arm and the handle comes loose easily. Given the price it's understandable, though.",
