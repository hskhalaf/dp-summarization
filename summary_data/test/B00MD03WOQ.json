And I don't mean just the ones on the outside of the case, even the ones in the center which should be protected by the other cans are dented. This is kind of poor quality control from this vendor. I know its just dog food, but dented can can get contaminated due to the structural integrity and I don't want my dog to eat rust. This food gets high ratings, my dog loves it, but the condition of the cans leads to this middle of the road review",
