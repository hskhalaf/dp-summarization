However while testing all plumbing connections with clean water, I found a small flaw/crack in the plastic mold of the ejection line which was allowing the water in the tank under the unit to leak. Thank goodness this was discovered before this toilet was put into use as it would have been sewage leaking onto the floor. I have requested a replacement and they want me to ship the old one back. So far, not so happy. I will update.",

I have had it in since March 2ond and today is the 9th and so far it's great. Seems to work just fine. I have only had it in use for a week so in several months I will follow up this post. But as of now this is a product that I highly recommend, I looked at a good many toilets before ordering and this is the one to order!!",

Now there is space to move around in this tiny bathroom. The only issue is that after a flush and after the bowl fills with water it makes a very loud noise (the nature of the mechanics) but it is brief.",

Yes this is expensive, but the cost of this toilet is far less expensive than having your basement floor dug up for standard plumbing. Just started using it, but so far so good. The small size makes it ideal for smaller bathrooms and makes it easier to add a 1/2 bath where space is at a premium, like a basement. Our plumber really liked the unit and was quite impressed with the quality of the unit and said that he'll tell his other customers interested in basement bathrooms about it. I have my much needed basement bathroom and could not be any more thrilled!!!!",

    "title": "Saniflo 023 Sanicompact Self-Contained Toilet",
    "description": "The SaniCompact is a self-contained system that is used to install a half-bathroom up to 9 ft. below the sewer line, or even up to 120 ft. away from a soil stack. The SaniCompact can handle the effluent from a toilet and sink for residential applications. The SaniCompact is a combination of a vitreous China toilet bowl and macerator/pump built into 1 compact unit. This modern shaped self-contained China toilet is especially designed with several ideas in mind: For situations where there is not enough space. As a toilet that uses a minimum amount of water. As a toilet for use with people that have physical limitations. The SaniCompact needs no gravity flow tank as the flushing action and macerating pump cycle is automatic after pressing a push button on top of the bowl. The flushing mechanism is electrically timed to allow water to pass through the toilet. By pressing the push button, this activates a timer and a solenoid valve in order to fill and wash the sides of the bowl. The motor starts and the waste and paper are sucked inside where it is macerated and pumped away. The motor stops after approximately 10 to 15 seconds and the timer programs the refill of the bowl with fresh water. The standard dual flush version uses 1.28 GPF (4.8 LPF) and 1 GPF (3.8 LPF).\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe SANICOMPACT is a self-contained toilet that's ideal for fitting into tight spots where conventional toilets can't fit. This modern shaped self-contained macerating toilet is very water efficient, using just one gallon of water per flush. It was designed with several purposes in mind such as limited space, green conscious users that want to save water, and for people with physical limitations requiring easy access to a toilet. The SANICOMPACT can be installed in many locations such as a loft/attic, upper floor, ground floor, basement and even a garage. It's very easy to install in areas such as under the stairway for a half bathroom or an additional half bathroom in a bedroom or garage conversion. It can handle the effluent from a toilet and sink. It needs no toilet tank as the flushing action and macerating pump cycle is automatic after pressing a push bottom (air switch) on top of the bowl. The flushing mechanism is electronically timed to allow approximately 1-Gallon of water to pass through the toilet. The discharge elbow on the back of the SANICOMPACT can be rotated 360 Degree to fit any type of installation requirement. A non-return valve, which comes already assembled on the discharge elbow, prevents back flow into the unit. The SANICOMPACT is a forced main and does not need to be vented and connected to a vent stack. Other fixtures may need to be vented as per local plumbing codes. It is also highly recommended for the macerator/pump to be connected to a Ground Fault Interrupter circuit. Remove the bowl and then mark the position of the fixing brackets \u00bd inch inside the traced",
