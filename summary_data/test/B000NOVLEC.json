She ran video and put 1440 photos on my SD card! So, I gave her mine and ordered another one from Amazon! I used mine for close ups/videos of operating machinery. I could e-mail the results to my Boss for claims adjustments. A neighbor kid dropped my daughter's Z885(1st) and broke it! I gave her mine(2) and have another Amazon Z885(3) on order. I kept my SD Card!!",

You can upload and share big picture files that they can use for free to see and down load. I tell everyone about this camera and that Amazon has the cheapest price.",

The absence of a view-finder is a serious problem when taking pictures outside-especially if the sun is shining. You absolutely can not see what you are trying to take a picture of. Its really too bad because I like the number of pixels and the zoom is excellent. The camera takes great pictures inside and outside. Inside you can see your target fine; outside-you need to take a lot of extra shots to ensure you take the picture you want. Can't do that with grandkids,etc. Ok for static scenes outside (with extra shots). So, I am now looking for another camera.",
