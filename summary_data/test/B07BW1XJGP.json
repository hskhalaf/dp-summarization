If you're a beginner drummer, or new to e-kits, this one will do the trick. While the sounds available in the 'brain' are not as high quality as you would find in the higher-end e-kits, they still give you a decent sound library to play with, and you can adjust them a bit. The training features are also good, even for more experienced drummers.",

Only thing I wish for would be the availability of an additional cymbal and mount....at a reasonable price. I found the mfg's add on unit, but the cost is almost $200 ....for one cymbal and short mount!!! The whole set is only $350. Dumb Alesis....just dumb.",

Sounds pretty good and is easy to play around with. One gripe I have is that you either need 1/4\" headphones or an adapter because your little ipod headphones ain't gonna cut it. Even then, it's only mono so expect to only hear in one ear phone while playing. Kinda annoying to be honest.",

My wife and I have been in bands with guitar and bass and wanted to give drums a try. We also always had problems at rehearsals because the drums are so loud. Everyone always turns their instruments up so they can hear themselves, and then puts earplugs in to keep from damaging their hearing. Lol. Electronic drums are amazing. They feel really close to acoustic drums, at least as a beginner, and they let you adjust the volume of the drummer so you can do practices without earplugs. It's a futuristic wonder world :-)",

The drum kit is okay for apartment use, but I would recommend purchasing a drum mat to reduce the noise of the kick.",

The drumming module has a ton of different sounds and tones to play around with and you\u2019ll definitely find your favorite set after going through it once or twice. I\u2019m not sure if my module is defective but every once in a while it WILL turn off or refuse to turn on. It may be a unit error but don\u2019t let it deter you from buying this kit if you\u2019re a beginner. 3 stars for now.",

I was truly impressed with the sound quality and the volume and punch with the amp.
