The little brush on the end of the nozzle is just a,problem, as it is on a swivel and is not always where you want it when you want it there. It pops up after you put it down and pops down if something gets too close. Or it just pops off. I guess I'll just use it around the house",

Makes it last a lot longe and you're mostly just cleaning that sock each time you go outside and clean it out. Beat the sock against a tree (or anything) and it comes clean. don't vacuum water!",

But one big problem is its battery life which gets drained in 20-25 minutes and takes a lot of time to get charged. Sometimes, it does not even allow me to finish the cleaning of the big carpet that I have. It is advisable to think about the other available options before you purchase this.",
