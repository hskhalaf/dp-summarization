      "text": "Was very disappointed that when I received my tea pot set that is had a really strong perfume scent/ fabric softener scent. I washed it three times and the scent would not go away so I called Amazon and they quickly sent out a new one. Amazons customer service was great! They even offered a refund but I chose to try again. However, the second one had the same scent. It must be a Green toys company issue. I called them and they said that they haven't heard of their teapots smelling like this before. Overall disappointed and don't feel comfortable using it or giving it away free. The colors and design are great but isn't getting any use :(.",

This is the third tea set I have purchased for my granddaughter in the past two years, and this is the first set where the lid on the teapot doesn't fall off when tea is poured. For that fact alone, I gave it five stars because so many sets do not have parts that fit together well. The colors are soft and work well together. The tea pot is a totally universal item because of its shape and size. It can double as a soup, ice cream, or cereal bowl from which a child can sip liquid through the pour spout.

      "text": "Our son plays \"tea cups\" at a friend's house and loves it, so we got him his own set. Green Toys' quality can't be beat. There is nothing cheap about this set. Everything that it is packaged in is recyclable and made from recycled materials, as well as the set itself. I found this set to be barely (if at all) more expensive than other, cheaper feeling sets. If corporate responsibility is something you champion (I'm not as concerned with it as I probably should be, but all things being equal, I default to the more environmentally friendly product), this set and company should be at the top of your list.",

I like that she's playing with \"real life\" things, ie tea cups, spoons, saucers, tea pot and that when she is older this toy will still be relevant for her and she can have \"tea parties!\" Functionally great too. You can wash them and the kids can even eat or drink from them. Very safe and green too...plus plus! Love it",
