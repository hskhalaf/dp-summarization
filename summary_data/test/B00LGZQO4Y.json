He has Beats, but overall, prefers these. They fit comfortably and look good. Price is reasonable.",

These headphones not only feel great and look amazing, they sound AWESOME! the bass is not heavy yet it doesnt hide. phone calls on them are great. the bluetooth connections is so fast! the on button is the same as the bluetooth button and it just needs one tap and itll turn on and connect to the last device it was connected too. The \"skip\" and \"back\" function works flawlessly. I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a GREAT quality feel and most importantly, SOUND.",

I'd say it's about eighteen hours. And their connectivity is nigh unstoppable. I leave my phone in my room in the basement and I can go to the second floor of the house with no troubles.

Again, these are BLUETOOTH headphones and will not give the full dynamic range of a pair of very good wired headphones.
