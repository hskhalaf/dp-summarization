      "text": "Just ordered this for my Granddaughter who is starting into the 6th grade this year. It arrived early ( today in fact) and is in great shape. I ordered it as it looked very sturdy for use and looks like it will hold up for a good long while to come. She is excited about having it ,though she may not need every feature this set holds . Anyway,if not now then may-hap in the future some of the others will come into being handy. I would definitely order another one should she need one as it is the best set I've seen advertised out there and does not cost you the house rent or car payment to buy, LOL.",

      "text": "I like most components in this kit, but find the compass to be a bit clumsy.. the arms have hinges, which is a good function, but they bend too easily, tried tightening them, dis t work.. wish it didnt have this function and would just stay straight. Aside from that, the wooden pencils have shoddy eraser clamp things, very loose and thus crap to use, lead breaks when sharpening.. all in all im not surprised, but this set got loads of 5star reviews... honestly you get what you pay for, this stuff is cheap.",
