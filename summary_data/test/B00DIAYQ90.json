I ordered the Pullman Load Pan with cover that makes a Sandwich Loaf of bread and I ordered the Foldable Bread Slicer to slice my bread evenly. There is a small, medium, and large area to slice the bread and I use the medium setting for a regular looking slice of bread. The larger setting makes thicker bread for like croutons, and the smaller make a very thin bread for toasting and making breadcrumbs . It is completely foldable and stores without taking up a lot of space. This is a great idea and I wish I had found it sooner. Sandy Hatton",

On the plus side it won't dull your knife because it goes through the wood....imagine your knife trying to cut through something harder. And I would rather ingest tiny bits of wood than tiny bits of plastic, if the shavings ended up on the bread. So overall I would recommend and if we end up destroying it in six months with all the cuts I'd buy another one. It is very handy and looks nice and works well.",

Loaves tend to slide around, which makes the cuts uneven. And it's hard to keep the knife inside the slots on both sides--it barely reaches across. Overall, I'm disappointed.",

Some guidance on how to deal with this would be very helpful. I plan to sand the scoring but this can only be done a limited number of times. Don't get me wrong. I love this slicer.",

Like most things, you just need to take care and you'll get many years of service. It folds nicely and I keep it next to my cookbooks on one of my kitchen shelves. Thanks for the fast delivery.",
