Mind you I am not an audiophile so I would expect a different opinion from somebody that is. I use these in the office just about everyday and they are still working just the same after 3 years. The only reason why they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because after 3 years of use the fake leather on the ear cups is flaking off. It leaves little black bits on my shirt and skin. Even with that I would still buy these again and I have recommended them friends.",

These Philips headphones are more comfortable and have good bass, electronic dance music sounded great out of the box. Rock music, however, sounded pretty bad- guitars sounded distorted and vocals were weak. I tried to \"burn in\" these cans with several hours of playing white noise and frequency sweeps and that did cause a noticeable improvement in the sound to the point that I am now happy with these cans.",
