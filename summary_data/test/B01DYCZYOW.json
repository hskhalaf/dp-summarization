The canvas part was actually pretty decent (ONLY reason it\u2019s getting 2 stars). It\u2019s not as oversized as advertised, essentially the same as a regular size. And worst of all, it\u2019s so low to the ground, there\u2019s absolutely no way it could ever be a \u201czero-gravity\u201d chair. Sorry Amazon, you let me down with this product. Also, mine came broken",

On the downside, the locks that hold the recliner position in place don't truly lock in place - they're just a friction device that creeps if you're laying all the way back. Also one of the elastic cords started to fray outside of its black sheath only a few weeks after purchase, and I don't remember anything scraping it. It doesn't affect the chair, but seems awfully early for this to happen.",

The seats will fly back but if u turn the knob on side to add tension it is still very easy to push back. The cup holder is solid but will only hold a shallow glass or plastic cup (not very deep). Otherwise it is very comfortable.",

I love that there are no handles or tricks to adjust level of recline, just use your own body weight--gravity will do the rest! The cup/phone holder is a nice touch, although I remove it when collapsing or storing. As for storage they fold like any other outdoor chair. These are used on an upstairs walkout balcony/porch, so I store one in each bedroom closet (small) with room to spare. Even though they are lightweight, they are bulky and save me from two flights of steps to the basement. Would definitely recommend and purchase for a gift.",
