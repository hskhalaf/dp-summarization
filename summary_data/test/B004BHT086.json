I am the only one that sits in this chair at my house and I am always careful with it. I do not wear jeans while sitting on this chair and I am always in yoga pants \"ha ha\" so I have no idea how this chair is shredding. I am not a heavy person either. I am disappointed and I will be dropping it off at goodwill. It looks awful in my house now and I am embarrassed when friends come over and see a bad looking piece of furniture.",

After several weeks using the chair, I see a need for some extra padding in the back and on the seat, but that's not really a big deal since there is a zipper on the back/seat component that allows adding extra padding. I'll buy a foam padding sheet, cut to size and insert for extra comfort. I'm not a big fan of the ottoman (it's a bit high for me), so I use a different foot rest. Basic, comfortable and affordable.",

The glider assembly wasn't too difficult, which was nice. However, the chair was not comfortable at all. There was one center spot in the upright cushion that was especially thin and uncomfortable. The cushioning appears to be very fluffy and soft in the picture, but it didn't feel that way. We found a similar but much better glider at another store for $25 less than this one, so we returned this to Amazon. This was a disappointing purchase overall.",

Assembly was a no-brainer; took about 30 minutes. Frame construction feels substantial and well-built. Upholstered components seem high quality. Chair swivels 360 degrees, chair and ottoman rock (glide) nicely. Both operate with no noise at all. If we're as happy with it in a couple of months as we are the day after it arrived, we'll have scored big-time. Excellent chair at a good price. Would buy again.",

That works ok. overall I do really like this chair.",
