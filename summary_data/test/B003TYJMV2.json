Also, the instructions tell you to use a 5/16\" drill bit however if you do the lag bolts have next to nothing to grab into considering the lag bolts are not much more than 5/16\" diameter. I would say it seems pretty sturdy and I'm tempted to attach the cross bar above the arms",

I also found that the plates were bowed up as much as 1/8\" at the ends when I placed them on a flat surface. The manufacturer needs to implement better quality control and improvements on the packaging.",

This may sound silly but trust me! You may need to use gloves when you actually use the bar, I do. This is a quality, long lasting product that will serve you well.",

Another factor is that the wall plates might not be super straight but once you tighten to the studs it doesn\u2019t matter. The only thing I\u2019m not totally sure about is the fact that when I do chin ups and pull-ups I sometimes hit the parallel bars that protrude. So that limits a bit how far up you can go. But it also gives you more hand positions. Overall, I highly recommend this product.",

Pros: 1) Very strong and well constructed. The bar does not creak even during kipping pullups 2) Numerous hand positions Cons: 1) After a year of use (3-4 times/week), the rubber grips are starting the wear 2) Read the other reviews on installation directions and required revisions",

The directions were easy to follow (the video review was even easier). The apparent error in the directions on size of drill bit has been fixed. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the grips are less than awesome. They will sometimes rotate and they are kind of abrasive. That being said your hand should not slip off of them, so ultimately they do their job.",

      "text": "This is an extremely well made product. I've bought and abused several over the door bars. This is SO MUCH better. Once mounted, it is incredibly sturdy. I've taken off one star because of poor assembly instruction. Also, if would be nicer if the bar was slightly further away from the wall. Otherwise, fantastic product. Well worth the money.",
