If you're wondering how it could be so much cheaper than the other units on Amazon, the answer is durability. As I said, its good, but its not the overbuilt toughness of changing tables found in public restrooms. It would not hold up well to excessive abuse and use by those who mistreat everything thats not theirs. Great product, I would recommend it for home, maybe a small church or other place where people would likely take care of things.",
