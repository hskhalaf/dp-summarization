It's easy to put together, which is important because I take it completely apart to clean and fully dry before storing it to make sure there's no issue of mold. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a grey color as the white is starting to show some stains from being outdoors for days on end, but hey, I didn't really expect it to stay that way. We don't have the faucet attachment as a hose and nozzle work just fine.",

I called them and they immediately apologized for the problem and asked me to send them proof of purchase, within a few days I received a brand new table with all the accessories and they allowed me to keep the first table I received! Outstanding customer service! I would highly recommend as the table is just as described and very sturdy!",
