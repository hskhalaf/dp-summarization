There is also a get started exercise guide and drawstring mesh carrying/storage bag. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a great basic set!",

These resistance bands are super strong and well made, the fabric that it\u2019s made with is very durable. I washed it about two times and let it air dry. The band fabric did not unravel, it snapped right back to its regular size. This resistance band is perfect since I don\u2019t have dumbbells. I just use this on my arms, hips and legs and it gives me a good workout.",

The latex/rubber (or whatever they're made of) stretch out in time and annoyingly roll up when you move, and eventually get holes. I've replaced them a couple of times and was hoping these would be a good replacement. Not so much... I like them for the thigh work though!",

The highest intensity band is very difficult to flex to max potential, which I love. I have had workout bands like this where the max band feels like stretching a rubber band, but this is perfect.

    "description": "#1 Best Fabric Resistance Bands!\nAre you ready for the most versatile, results producing workout bands on the market? \n\nThese bands are ideal for:\n- Sports\n- Fitness\n- Injury rehabilitation\n- body shaping\n- weight loss\n- physical therapy\n\nOur bands are the best quality among others. Why? \n\nFirst, our bands are made of the highest quality material (not rubber bands which are much cheaper and tend to break easily). They are stronger and able to stretch further. You will feel the same resistance after many reps. \nThese bands are free of non-natural materials such as Thermoplastic Elastomer (TPE) - TPE materials cost 30-40% less, are not gentle to skin and much less durable.\nMoreover, our bands are comfortable, soft and easy on the skin. Our bands are also made from a fabric like material which prevents rolling, slipping or pinching during your workout.\nBoth of these involve a higher investment for us but we think it's worth it to create a better product.\n\nWhat makes our resistance bands special? \n\nThese bands are rigorously tested to be snap, roll & sweat resistant.\nYou get 3 levels bands and you can combine multiple bands to find your ideal resistance. These bands are so lightweight that they make a great travel fitness kit! \nThis is also a great Christmas, Mother's and Father's day gift idea for men, women, dad or mom.",
