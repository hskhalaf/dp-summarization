The velcro straps are extremely sticky so sometimes it's difficult when I already have a glove on one hand because it goes all the way around your wrist.

I have no doubt that these could outlast any other glove I've bought, but because of the stiffness, flatness of the face, and the slipping, it just doesn't feel right.
