I want to comment first that I have used other brands of bamboo brushes before and never experienced this. The amount of bristles that fall out each time is appalling. It\u2019s not merely a cosmetic issue. It\u2019s a safety issue. I have had several bristles fall out in my mouth causing me to gag. I have accidentally swallowed at least two, which was extremely painful. I would never recommend these to anyone and am genuinely surprised that they have such great reviews!",

Much softer than medium in my opinion. I like firm for tongue brushing and this leaves my mouth feeling unclean despite having just brushed. They say firm is not good for teeth and gums but I have the patience to brush very gently and methodically. I need something that feels like it's cleaning. Perhaps I missed it but I didn't see firm as an option, if it were I may have given 4 stars instead of 3.",

Well attached (I've used other bamboo brushes whose bristles come out and get stuck in my gums or I swallow them), so this is great! The summary: If you're considering a more eco-friendly toothbrush, this is an excellent choice! Buy with confidence! Enjoy!",

The toothbrush is still functional, of course, but I now need to make sure I don't swallow any individual bristles. Otherwise--an excellent toothbrush, with very soft bristles that feel great on the teeth and mouth. The natural bamboo handle feels great in hand and knowing that we're impacting the environment less is a SUPER+ Thank you!",

I switched my whole family: SO, 11y/o daughter, and roommate, all skeptical at first, but then all on board the first time they used theirs. So very happy with this product and will order again in 3 months when it's time to replace our current brushes.",

    "description": "HOW LONG DOES A BAMBOO TOOTHBRUSH LAST?\n\nJust because we\u2019re natural doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t last as long as plastic toothbrushes. In fact, we last just as long before needing replacement (roughly 3 months). The Mother\u2019s Vault Bamboo Toothbrush is the right step to go green and reduce your carbon footprint while getting the same great results! Our BPA-Free bristles also protect the health of you and your children by not leeching unwanted hormone disruptors into your body.\n\nWHY USE A BAMBOO TOOTHBRUSH?\n\nYou know it, we know it, and the world knows it. Isn\u2019t it time we started to find better, more natural ways of doing things? Plastic toothbrushes pollute oceans and are composed of harmful by-products. A bamboo toothbrush is a sustainable alternative that naturally decomposes in landfills. Compared to a plastic toothbrush that takes over 400 years to decompose, you can see why buying a natural toothbrush can make you feel good about your health and the environment. A big part of switching to a bamboo toothbrush is to reduce waste. Therefore, the packaging needs to be eco-friendly as well which is why we don\u2019t include cellophane bags, plastic shells, or clear windows in the box.\n\nGUARANTEE\n\n We love this toothbrush, and we\u2019re sure you will to. If for any reason you don\u2019t, no worries! Send it back our way for a full refund of the purchase price.\n\nMOTHER'S VAULT\n\n A portion of every sale at Mother's Vault is donated to EarthJustice, the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit environmental law organization. EarthJustice was created to protect people\u2019s health, preserve magnificent places and wildlife, and combat climate change. We love what they\u2019re doing to fight for better environmental laws and protect this wonderful place we live in.\n\nBRUSH BETTER TODAY WITH MOTHER\u2019S VAULT AND CLICK THE \u201cADD TO CART\u201d BUTTON!!",

      "\u2605 GREEN LIVING \u2013 A bamboo toothbrush is a great sustainable alternative. Whether it\u2019s used for compost or the recycling bin, our biodegradable toothbrushes keep their value even when your mouth is done with them and will naturally decompose in a landfill. NOTE: The bristles aren\u2019t biodegradable. Use pliers to remove them from the head and then reuse or compost the bamboo handle.",
      "\u2605 ZERO WASTE PACKAGING - The packaging and materials return to the environment safely. The cardboard is 100% biodegradable and all wasteful materials, such as plastic windows and cellophane bags, have been removed from the packaging process. The box your bamboo toothbrushes come in is just as environmentally-friendly as the toothbrush itself."
