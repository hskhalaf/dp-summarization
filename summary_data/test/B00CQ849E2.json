I actually prefer Performix Pump. It works twice as hard and lasts for a few hours, sometimes on a good day it feels like it lasts half the day. But Performix products are expensive. So I buy this No3 Chrome to alternate with so I don't use up the Performix Pump so fast. You need the pump to get you to work harder and be motivated at the gym. You know that feeling when your shirt tightens at the gym.....OOOoh!",

Any stimulants usually make me feel drained and cause some G.I. discomfort, but these did not. I will say, though, I have had similar results from just taking agmatine alone. This product does provide a nice pump and some good energy when taking it on an empty stomach, but even just a little bit of food drowns the effects. This is a problem since I need to constantly eat. Its good for its usage, but too sensitive. I'll just take my own blend in the future.",
