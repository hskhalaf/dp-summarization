Anyway-taking 2 pulls a day gave me horrible diarrhea, until I figured out they were causing the issue and cut back the pills to one a day!

According to an article on bullet proof, an overload of histamines \"leads to increased inflammation and many other symptoms including: skin irritation, hives, throat tightening, increased heart rate, nasal congestion, migraines, fatigue, heartburn, reflux, and weight gain.\" I'm sure this can work for some people, but probably only despite the histamine-producing bacteria.",

I'm not convinced that this product does anything besides help make you regular, which any fiber supplement can do. I guess i was expecting to feel different/better due to the probiotics, but I don't. I've been taking it faithfully for 2 1/2 weeks. I'm going to finish up the bottle as directed, and will update this review if my final opinion varies from this at all.",
