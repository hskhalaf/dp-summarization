This is an incredible value - sound quality with depth and clarity, adequate noise reduction and good battery life! Sure, they look a little silly in the grocery store, but hey, you can't beat the cost for the sound quality. HIGHLY recommend.",

      "text": "These are poorly designed and will break within a couple months of use. There are screws holding the plastic earpieces to another plastic piece that holds the headband in place. These are held together by 4 fragile pieces of cheap plastic with screws in them. The sound is really good, but they are mostly made of plastic and made to break easily. I have owned four other House of Marley products, and they were built much stronger than these headphones. You can see the photos I've added, that the plastic holding these two together will break. I would recommend you choose a different item that is more durable. This one breaks very easily.",

When I chose to get these Rebels, I figured I'd be settling for a lesser quality product. NOT SO!!! These phones are the Soundlink's equivalent if not better! Needless to say, I am hugely pleased with the Rebel BT's. Time to start telling my family and friends about them! What a great surprise!",

Bluetooth range is quite long and excellent reception. Also On my iPhone, when paired it tells me how much battery it has. Amazing headphones for the price. Highly recommend",
