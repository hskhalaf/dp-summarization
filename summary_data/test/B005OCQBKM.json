It works without any hitch with both Linux and Mac. A minor inconvenience is the navigation keys are not in the usual place as on a sprawling keyboard. But this is a non-issue for folks who use the non-navigation keys for navigation. As for the price, it does seem steep compared to Microsoft 4000 Ergonomic Keyboard. However, if it lasts a few years with the moving parts, then its price would be fully recovered with the convenience it offers.",

I've used other keyboards with a similar bi-split which I did find even more comfortable than my Comfort Curve 2000, but they gradually sloped up from the front, meeting the desk surface, and the keys were just placed in a more natural configuration.
