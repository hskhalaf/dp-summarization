I purchased these to help my daughter study and found these cards are mostly \"tips\" on what one can expect to find on the GED. The information on the few practice problems there are, are too long for sight learning. I needed pre-test material for her to think on her feet during the exam. These are not the Flashcards you are looking for.",

They are good for telling you what to study and help you realize what you need to get better at by pointing out your strengths and weaknesses. I used mine to study for about two months before I took my test and they were decently helpful but I recommend getting a practice book or something that helps you practice. These do not have practice questions, just a bunch of test information and what to expect on the test which is all pretty straight forward really. Goof but not great. Keep looking.",

The little lines on the sides of the cards makes it easy to organize them back into subjects - I've dropped them plenty of times to know if those lines were not there I'd probably still be sorting them. They are very easy for me to understand, I was able to find my problem areas by going through each subject and studying the cards. Which led me to being able to find the right classes I needed. I will reuse these in the future to touch up on skills, and for my kids.",

I also planned on having students quiz one another with the cards. These will not work for that purpose. They did give me some talking points or areas from which to create a lesson.",
