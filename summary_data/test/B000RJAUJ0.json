Pretty sure these guys sold candles to the phantom of the opera, they\u2019ve been around that long! Seriously, these candles are awesome! Disclaimer: several other multi drip candles have been burned on this bottle, prior to this photo being taken. About 4-5 candles will produce this amount of build up. However, the first candle was burned on it 4-5 years, and 2-3 moves ago. So, A+ for wax durability and longevity!",

And because that's what they are made to do, they burn rather quickly. You will get a few candlelit dinners from them, but don't expect them to get you through a blackout. For my taste, there's a lot more dripping than I'd like, but my husband thinks they're great.",

They work great, drip fast and colorfully, but they drip a bit too fast. Make sure you place the bottle on a cleanable surface about the size of a placemat. I used an old school tray. Now that the bottle has been decorated, I use non-drip candles and get the best of both worlds. Oh, and the base of the candle will probably have to be whittled away to fit the neck of the bottle.",

Once the wick gets to a bead, there's a blurt of color, but then it's just white wax again until it reaches the next bead. It was my fault for not doing the research on these candles, so no use taking any stars off. There is no scent. Other than that very slight issue with the colors, the shipment was very fast - I ordered these on the 27th, and they were at my door on the 31st.",
