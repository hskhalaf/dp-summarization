My face hasn't been this soft & smooth since I started shaving, and that's the honest truth. If you have dry or sensitive skin, Musgo aftershave balm is worth every penny. Do a proper prep, use a good blade & cream or soap, then follow with this. Your face will give you a high five, and I guarantee you'll be rubbing your face & neck all day admiring how soft & hydrated you feel.",
