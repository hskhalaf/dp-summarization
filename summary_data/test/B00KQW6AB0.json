But once that I got this Phone I'm really glad I bought it. Is everything that I expect it and more. I don't see the use of writing down specifications, because you can look for that in other reviews. But for business use is perfect. It's a friendly phone, I love that I don't have to learn another technology, I'm used to windows and now I have a windows phone!",
