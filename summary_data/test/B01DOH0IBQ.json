I used THAT pump to inflate my expensive BOSA ball!? The ball itself is really fantastic. I haven\u2019t found anything else like it on the market. But if you don\u2019t have a way to pump it up, other than the horrific pump they provide, don\u2019t buy!",

It also comes with a foot pump for filling, although I had to have my husband help, not a one person job, for me anyway.

Also the ball has surface deformations from sitting in the box, hopefully they will go away with time. Lastly its covered in oily nastiness which picked up all the particulates on my floor and made the inflation process even more fun.",
