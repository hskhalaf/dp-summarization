There's some unnecessary resistance / stickyness - took literally 5+ hours for Windows update / setup - there's some coil whine type noise but not too loud - the webcam is a bad joke",

I did a bench test using 'novabench' and was surprised with the results. Was ok for a low end gaming computer but was so much better than a budget laptop. The onboard graphics hold it back from playing games but we didn't buy it for that! This computer is lightweight but doesn't feel fragile. Others have complained of keyboard flex, there is a little but nothing to be concerned about. I didn't see anything about Bluetooth or on board camera in the description, but it has both. So far we are very happy with this laptop",

This laptop is a great deal given the good hardware specs and nice looking 1080p screen. Many laptops in this price range only have lower resolution 768p screens. It's very lightweight and compact for a 15-inch laptop. As with any Windows laptop give it some time to install all the Windows 10 updates when you first plug it in. I think some people don't let it finish updating before trying to use it a lot and then they complain it's slow or unresponsive. It's easy to upgrade the hardware on the laptop yourself, such as adding an SSD. Overall highly recommended.",

Only thing that it is lacking is a Ethernet port but luckily I haven\u2019t had any issues with it picking up WiFi at school. Overall, I am very pleased with this laptop.",
