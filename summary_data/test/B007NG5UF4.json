If it was shown anywhere on a listing that you always should use cable for this to work , no one would buy it (or at least much less people) Bottom line , really disappointed in this !!!

      "text": "We purchased a inexpensive similar baby monitor when our first was born 5 years ago. Fast forward to today and we have 3, 5 and under. We keep our older unit in the room with our 3 year old so we can hear if they wake up at night and now that we have more kids we needed to be a little more mobile. This unit is extremely portable with long lasting battery. It recharges fairly quickly and has a nice belt clip so you can hear what's happening with your kiddos and be moving throughout the house, or even in the yard if needed as it has good range as well.",

They both were crystal clear, they have great sensitivity & range. They were super simple to set up and use. The \"parent\" unit has a speaker & mic, which was great because she was able to ask for help and we were able to use the \"parent unit\" to tell her we were on our way up to her. Sadly, she didn't live long enough to create a better review. I would recommend these.",

    "description": "The VTech DM221 Digital Audio Monitor with DECT 6.0 digital technology provides crystal clear transmission, eliminating the annoying white noise you hear from analog monitors. The only sounds you hear are coming from your baby. Totally digital transmission eliminates background noise and prevents interference so you can rest assured the only sounds you\u2014and only you\u2014will hear are your baby's. Make sure the Baby Unit is turned on. Move the Parent Unit closer to the Baby Unit, but not closer than 1 meter / 3 feet. If you are using the Parent Unit in cordless mode, the battery may be low and requires recharging. A full charge takes 12 hours. Reset the system by disconnecting power from both units, waiting at least one minute, then reconnecting power. Allow time for the two units to link to each other. Nearby cordless phones or other electronic devices may be interfering with the baby monitor. Separate these devices as far apart as possible. When you turn the nightlight on, if no sound is detected for 15 minutes, the light will turn itself off.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy VTech",
