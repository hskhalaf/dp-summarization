      "text": "Have order this twice before, and recently, I ordered another \"2-pack\". My flea infestation (another one) almost cleaned up after using 2 packs a couple of weeks ago, but I need to \"dose\" everything probably one more time. This stuff is REALLY the best. My vet had recommended it, and when I saw her yesterday, I thanked her. I've worked in cat rescue for 15 years now, I really had few problems (since my cats are all indoor) until I took in 2 rescue dogs about 3 yrs ago. They're on flea preventative, but we are having a bad flea problem (again) in my area. Anyway, can't recommend this product highly enough, especially since it's non-toxic to the animals.",

To get the powder under the beds I used a hair dryer on the cool cycle and shook the powder in front of it. I watched with a flashlight on and the coverage was fantastic. Use a push broom to work the powder into your rugs and carpeting and vacuum wood floors afterwards to contain the dust. Fleas seemingly disappeared overnight.",

Non-toxic We no longer use any frontline (not that it worked at all -for fleas- anyway.) Or any product for that matter. We vacuum often & still have never had any more flea issues. So happy!!

So that is 4 dogs in a semi rural setting and no more fleas at all!! So yes it gets my vote for sure.",

    "description": "Size:1For over 30 years, Fleabusters has been successfully used by millions of pet owners. Recommended by veterinarians and pet professionals, Fleabusters is a home environment product for the eradication of fleas. The product is easily applied to carpets, area rugs and baseboard areas of other hard surface floors. It can also be applied on upholstered furnishings. HOW IT WORKS - Fleabusters Rx for Fleas Plus attaches to larvae as they wiggle through and then dehydrates them. Its neutral pH of 7.0 makes it safe for carpets, but also resists repelling pests. Roaches, ants, fleas, and other household pests can sense and avoid alkaline or acidic substances, but crawl right through the natural pH of Fleabusters products. COVERAGE: One cannister will treat up to 1200 sq. ft. or an average sized home with 5 rooms! Because the flea powder is so fine it only requires a small amount applied everywhere to be effective. More is not better! Only a few microscopic crystals are all that's necessary to kill the flea larvae. WHAT TO DO IF IT DOES NOT WORK - The \u201cOne Year\u201d satisfaction guarantee is completely unconditional. Owners can return product for a full refund to the manufacturer if not satisfied, or for a replacement if the product fails to last an entire year. If the customer lives in areas with a local Fleabusters service center, then the manufacturer could also apply credit towards in-home services to treat pests associated with pets.",
