Even so, the strip still works flawlessly for everything I need from it.",

And then the schedules for all the equipment I needed. As mentioned it is setup on my aquarium. It controls 2 light bars, 1 air pump and a Hue Go. I use the USB's to charge my phone and a wireless keyboard. I normally do not give 5 stars but in this case. So far so good.",

I have it connected to Alexa so that I can separately control my computer power, monitor, desk lamp, and computer speakers with my voice or the Alexa app. The USB ports allowed me to power a lot of my desk devices that don't need data (Echo Dot, smart watch charger, phone chargers, etc.) without taking up USB data ports on my computer. Just remember that it is the power outlets that are \"smart,\" not the USB ports!",
