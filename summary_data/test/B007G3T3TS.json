As a Yamaha player myself, I knew that this instrument was a good choice. To put an end to the debate of where this trumpet was made/coming from, the trumpet was made in China, it was stamped on the second valve casing and it was shipped from Japan. Yamaha is a Japanese company. They must have their instruments made from other countries.",

Valves are nice, slides work perfectly, fit and finish is perfect, the sound is very good, and intonation is excellent.
