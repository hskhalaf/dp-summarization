The Lixit Heaven Metro cage tubes are perfect size and the play area is excellent. My hamster is extremely happy and healthy. The product construction and quality of materials are very good.

The plastic tube that connects to the \"hamster penthouse\" at the top is rather flimsy and easily snaps out of place when you're assembling or cleaning the cage. That said, the hamster loves it. He has built a nest in the penthouse and sleeps up there during the day. At night he plays in the main area below. This is about the minimum space that a hamster needs. We would choose this cage again notwithstanding the difficult assembly.",

For months I have been trying to order replacement parts and although i\u2019ve been promised on 3 different occasions that they would be sent to me, they still have not :(.

      "text": "The cage overall is really big and easy to set up. The wheel is a good size but could run a little better. But my overall problem with the cage is a 2cm gap by the main opening if only closed to the first bar... this issue is fixed if you latch the door to the second bar removing that 2 cm hole.. Unfortunately for my hamster the hole was big enough for him to escape and it costed him his life..",

I bought this cage because it\u2019s big enough for her to run around and she loves the different levels. The first cage broke because I tripped and cracked the floor but I couldn\u2019t find anything even remotely close to the size of this cage so I bought another. We don\u2019t use the green house on top but we just have a tube going from one side to the other. My ham loves it she\u2019s comfy she uses the little huts and it\u2019s very secure.",

So we purchased this large cage. She seems so much more content. She hits the only wheel occasionally now as the cage provides her with endless possibilities for activities.

Ive super glued a few of the pieces together so they dont fall apart but I still dread having to disconnect even a small part of it to clean them out. Other than that I love the size, the little levels and the houses. The wheel wasn't great and I needed to get a new one. Not a deal breaker overall. The tunnels are the biggest issue.",

So PLEASE do not waste your money on this OVERPRICED cage when you can get better cage for half.",

He now has this huge cage and no longer bites on the wires! He has all the space he needs for all the essentials, extra toys, and floor space plus platform left over to roam about comfortably as he pleases. He also nests in the penthouse and its so cute to watch him travel the tubes to get up there. This is truly a hamster heaven! <3",
