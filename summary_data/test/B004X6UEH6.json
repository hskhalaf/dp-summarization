They both adore hanging out on this in the late afternoon sun and they both use it multiple times daily for scratching. So 5 stars for utility, they both love it. Our beef with this item is it only lasted 90 days, and for the last six weeks I've had to pick up or vac up debris multiple times daily. So fair warning: your cats will likely love it but it's durability is disappointing concerning the price. I'm going to replace it with one of the cheaper knock offs as the quality is dubious.",

However, if your cat is like mine, and have huge claws (Believe me, he's a little particular with people trying to cut them), it will not last more than 4/5 months. I had it for less than 3 days and one of the sides is already crumbling. And no, this is not the only scratcher our cat has. Besides this, I think 49$ is a little too much for it. 35 or 39$ would be a more reasonable price.",

Bad News (but not really): They've stopped using the cat hammocks which I got them a couple of weeks ago because they love this cat lounge so much. I was hoping they would like this, but genuinely surprised how much they did. I immediately ordered another one for the bedroom and they took to that to, so now there's a lot less cat fur on the bed. Construction is dense and sturdy.",

She will not scratch a post covered by carpet - there is something about this compressed hardened cardboard material that makes her enjoy scratching it. A small bag of catnip comes with it to enhance the initial experience for your cat. I feel confident this will last quite a while since it is reversible and has a large surface area. When one side eventually gets worn out, I'll just flip it over and my cat will have a brand new fresh side to scratch.",

We replace the lounge every two or three years when the cat has shredded it, but it takes that long. This is a really useful and pleasant piece and our cat lives on it and loves it.",
