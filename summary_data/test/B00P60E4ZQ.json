You can beat the Amazon price too. The only part of this I wasn't 100% satisfied with that the fore and aft ties only have 1 hook to secure the boat each. Which means you have to tie a safe knot every time, but it's only a minor inconvenience If you have any doubts about this product, don't!",

There are better j racks but for the price this is unbeatable and very sufficient. Don't be conned by the cheapo no name ones you have to assemble yourself. They are poorly made. Pay the extra $10-$15 and get these Rola ones. No need to pay extra either. Rola hits the sweet spot between affordable and quality.",

So ya, they are easy to install. I did have to trim one bolt because it touched the sheet metal when attached to the roof rack, but that was a quick and easy hack saw fix. Better too long that too short, better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. I really do like these things in their price point especially.",

Unfortunately, the threads are tighter together on these and that didn't work either. Returning product. I think Rola should send these with both 2 inch and 3 inch bolts to accommodate the different rack heights - I'd gladly have spent the extra $5 in hardware. Back to shopping for kayak racks.",
