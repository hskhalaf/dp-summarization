I run 10km training trails in these, very, very nice grip. Light and drain well. Recently ran 62.5km in them over a two and a half day overnight fastpacking trek. It was hot, then windy, then very wet. These shoes worked well in all conditions and dryed out overnight when stored in my bivvy from my body heat so I had dry shoes the next day. Perfect! I am very pleased with these shoes.",

They are slightly tighter than the older model, which felt odd at first, but with some wear they are loosening up and I think they will actually be a better fit in the long run. Compared to Solomon shows they have a much wider footprint and a more comfortable profile in my opinion. They also don't smell as much as waterproof models as the material is kept light and easily washable. One of the best shoes out there for trail and hill running. Highly rated in my opinion.",
