Also, the little corners over the posts are padded and soft which was a pleasant surprise. Overall, a great design and quality.",

If your cat is like mine, they will like it so much that they command you to do this several times per day. Since the stand is not that tall, it's extremely hard on my knees to keep bending over and hugging him for any length of time!",

I don't think the top cradle is large enough for a large cat or they don't feel secure in it because it's not large enough. People might be allergic to the fur or the cats might be. My cat only went to the scratcher, and sat on the bottom platform, haven't climbed the stair or sat in the cradle, although I put him on it, he jumped off right away. Might have to get used to it. I will see and send back if the doesn't like it.",

Both cats like the scratching posts, and it's stable when one of the cats jumps up. There were no assembly instructions, but it's pretty intuitive. Just be sure to attach the posts to the hammock first, and then flip the whole thing upside down to add the base. You have to screw the posts into the hammock, so if you attach them to the base first, you'll have to start over. Not sure yet how durable it will be - will update.",

Super easy to put together also. I have two cats, one sleeps in the basket almost 24/7 she loves it so much! My boy mostly likes to hide in the bottom and sharpen his claws on the scratching posts. The little toy on the side is kind of pointless because the string is so short, but I bet if my kitties were still kittens they would play with it. Great buy!",

      "text": "I have 5 large cats (about 12-14 lbs. each) and four out of five of them cycle through sleeping in the cat tree/hammock at different times during the day. And even though I have a variety of other cat trees and beds around the house, this hammock is by far their favorite. The hammock is just the right size for them to curl up in. So with that in mind, I finally ordered two more to place strategically around the house. The cat tree/hammock is very easy to put together -- takes only minutes. It is also very sturdy. We've had the original cat tree for about 3 or 4 months and it is holding up very nicely.",

After her 8 hour nap, she scratches the sides like they owe her money and then reaches over the top hoping to reach a toy she forgot about from 20 seconds prior. The only downside is that she ripped that ball off within a day - due to the stare it gave her. Instead of the ball on the cat hammock, it now doubles as her fetch ball, so win-win-win as Michael Scott would say. Bottom line, A$AP Minkles loves this thing, and your cat will too.",

I think if you want to position this next to a stable furniture like the sofa, it may work.
