    "title": "Ped-Run Kids Pedaling Scooter - Exercise While Having Fun",
    "description": "The Bike Rassine Ped-Run kids pedaling scooter is powered by standing rider's driving force on dual pedals that operate much like the up-down motion of a stationary stair-climbing machine. The result is a riding experience that provides an enjoyable and fun free-riding activity with the benefits of an efficient, low-impact full body cardio workout that burns calories while you ride. Scooter propels at safe variable riding speeds up to 10 MPH max and comes to a stop with the hand brake. Scooter is 29\" long by 11\" wide by 40\" high with a weight of 14.8 pounds; it folds up for ease of transport to 29\" long by 11\" wide by 9\" high. Safely recommended for riders weighing up to 110 pounds maximum.",
