Samsung said I should call Spectrum but now I've had 6 people from Spectrum come over to my apartment to try and solve the problem. I've even had supervisors. They told me, no, it seems to be your TV. Now it looks like I can't return my TV after September 3rd?!! Well I've been trying to get it fixed all this time but nothing has been working. I just bought this TV!!!",
