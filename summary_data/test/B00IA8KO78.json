But please note this thing is HUGE, even bigger than I was expecting. I believe the interior diameter is 8 inches (rather than the exterior diameter) which makes this great to use as a serving bowl for guacamole and other dips, but a little big if you're just using it to grind dry spices and rubs.",

Another interesting thing is that the energy of happy pounding and grinding gets translated into the food, which is probably why salsas tastes so much better from one of these. The only down side is that it is not the greatest for medications, too much gets caught in the grooves. So I've kept my smooth little mortar, but tossed the pestle, and will use the tajolote instead.",

    "description": "Size:6\u201dCrush it! Made from ultra-durable natural granite, this mortar & pestle extracts essential oils from herbs and spices - dried & fresh. Granite's nonporous qualities prevent it from absorbing those oils, keeping the flavor in your food and not in the tool. The weight of the stone provides stability and makes pounding a cinch. This molcajete is large enough to grind up a party-size batch of guacamole, then mix and serve it in the same bowl. So break out the tortilla chips and let's have a Fiesta.",
