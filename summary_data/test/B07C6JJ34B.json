I don't have big hands (my palms are less than 4\"/10 cm wide), but for me these balls are way too small. Taking into account small size and small amount of material used, these two balls seem hugely overpriced. A fair price would be $4 for one ball, or $6 for two balls. I paid $15 for two balls.",

These balls look good, stand up well to a strong grip (I'm an adult male, slightly bigger and more muscular than average), and even bounce nicely off of walls if you want to do that while you think about something. They're not the stiffest stress balls I've experienced, but they strike the best balance of price, appearance, stiffness, and handfeel.",

After several months like this, my husband convinced me that exercising my hands and fingers to strengthen and get the blood moving was the best thing for them. So I ordered these fit balls and began with the recommended exercises and my fingers and hands feel so much better!!! I am very happy with them. I highly recommend. Good customer service as well! Keep up the good work!",
