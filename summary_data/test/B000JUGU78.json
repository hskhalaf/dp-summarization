The action is one of the best I have used over the past 40 years of trout fishing. I have not broken one yet, the guys that have broken them catching bass are jerking so hard to set the hook maybe they need to use a medium/heavy action rod. These are ultra-light. 6'-6\" perfect length if you were only on planning on one.",

This rod has nice soft action at the tip but enough backbone to set hooks. Some ultra light rods are whippy their entire length-not this one. At 6'6\" you're in control, not only fishing, but transporting this 2 piece beauty. Ceramic ferrules and a hook keeper completes one of the finest fishing rods at a great price. I will continue to recommend this rod to all my fishing friends. Thanks for a great product.",

If you break it, just order another.",

    "description": "The fisheries of the Northeast and Northwest have been in turmout to say the least. However the future looks bright. The lake trout have come back strong in the last few years and the Northwest rivers are seeing the strongest runs of salmon and steelhead in recent history. With input from some of the top fishermen on these waters we developed the Celilo series. Throwing modesty out the window we nailed these actions and developed the perfect salmon, trout and bottom bouncing graphite rods. Although beautiful, you don't have to take out that second mortgage to load the boat with them.",
