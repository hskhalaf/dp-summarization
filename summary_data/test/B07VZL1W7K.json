The staff at Verizon and T-Mobile all agreed this phone is amazing at a price of $399.99 in store, best price on Amazon. I am an iPhone user and once I got this \"mid-range\" phone set up and running, I think I'm going back to Android ;-) I need the $1,000 phone for my work, but seriously that A51 will do the trick as well. I'll probably downgrade to the Samsung Galaxy A51. I'm a fan! Very impressed.",

Another reason I settled on this phone was due to my son. About a month ago, I bought him an A10, which he said he is very happy with. I've owned this phone about 3 weeks now and so far, I'm happy. I hope I haven't jinxed it with a positive review ;-)",

      "text": "Love this phone. I had the A50 and decided to buy this one there is not a ton that has changed between the 2 however the fingerprint sensor is so much better on the 51 than the 50 and the 51 has double the internal storage and an extra camera. Otherwise I feel that they are pretty close in comparison. I've been a Samsung person for a while now and am pleased with this. My battery life is good however I have found that mid to late afternoon on some days I am having to charge my phone not to sure why with a 4,000mah battery. But overall I love it!",

I like using Bixby, no issues there, but what I really like are the Bixby Routines. These routines are highly customizable, very cool what you can do with them. This Samsung phone is a great buy!",

What a disappointment and complete waste of time. I use a Note 10 plus and we've had many other Samsungs over the years and never had an issue. Thank goodness we found this out within the return period or I would be out of luck.",

Only negative is it's a very slippery phone and I'm having trouble finding a case that easily fits. I recommend to anyone who likes Android.",
