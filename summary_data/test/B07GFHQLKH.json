The incline is high but it doesn't bother you like you'd think it would, very easy to use. I love that I can be pacing around and step on it for 10 seconds if I want. Folds up well and to let loose you just hit a button and it lowers itself. Doesn't take up a lot of room and is minimal so it doesn't make things feel crowded. Would recommend.",

The only drawback is there is not a water bottle holder or a place to put an Ipad. I would buy this product again.",
