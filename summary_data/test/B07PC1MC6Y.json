It's quite strange to hear your chosen soundtrack clearly yet still hear the world around you. I opted for the Alto which come up quite large. Perfect for my large head but my wife can't wear them. She has asked for a pair of the smaller Rondo frames though. All in all, really happy with my purchase.",

The software and simple off technique works well. FYI battery life when playing sound is about the suggested 2 hours - but battery life when just connected for satnav or waiting for phone calls is much much longer.",

The glasses were comfortable to wear and look stylish enough. Battery life could be better - half a day on the beach rather than a full one! Only downsides are a disconcerting reflection on the inside of the lens, must be the angle they sit on, and a loss of connectivity sometimes. All in all I'm glad I bought them.",

The glasses themselves look okay considering what you're getting but the sound quality is nowhere near as good as described online and more inline with what you would expect....like holding a set of small earphones away from your ear.

So not a headphone replacement but a very usefull additional head set. As sun glasses very good I have bought the extra mirrored silver lenses but standard are perfectly adequate.",
