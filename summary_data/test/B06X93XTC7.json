It's a natural antiseptic and will stop small weepers. It glides over the face slickly and if an area stings then you'll know to take it easier there next time. It's part of my shaving routine now. This is a good deal and arrived perfect. It'll last forever but I'll buy another one here when the time comes.",

I am looking forward to trying this out, as I have intentionally started shaving with a safety razor. Why? I got tired of the price, and the manufacturer mentality that has landed us at the place of \"More Blades, the More Better!\".. My beard is coarse enough to clog a razor about halfway through a full stroke... so, yeah, that logic doesn't work out too well for me. This is why I am returning to low-tech, more masculine shaving, the old school way.",
