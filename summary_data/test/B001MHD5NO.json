      "text": "Perfection!! Great price for an outstanding product. I wear a ladies 6.5 to 7 and ordered the big kids size 5 and the fit is SPOT ON!! Been wearing Uggs for 9 years and never have I actually paid the higher price for the actual ladies version. Unexpected bonus to these moccasins is that the leather laced tie is actually sewn in. If you've ever owned any other type of moc once they come untied they never look the same. Not to mention the leather laces eventually end up snapping from the constant tug of redoing the tie. Not ever going to be the case here!!! LOVE THEM!!",

The grippers on the soles are perfect for all surfaces and I can be anywhere in the house with them even in the garage laundry room changing a load. the color is great and they honestly didnt stain until this last year. I have been very happy with this slipper. The new ones I bought are these with a tiny ball of fur in the middle close to the ankle.",

Yes, arriving at the correct size could be a challenge, but when you find your size and wear the slipper for a few days, it conforms to your foot and feels wonderful. I have a narrow foot, so size can be a problem. This particular style seems to be more conforming and forgiving than some of their other styles. It comes up higher on the top of the foot, so it tends to slip on the heal less. I doubt this would be a problem for those who have a wider foot.",
