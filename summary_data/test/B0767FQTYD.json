If you don't get to the machine when it finishes, it will continue on a 10-minute refresh cycle which is annoying and stresses me out as it goes all night which isn't good for electricity and surely it could also overheat. It does dry the clothes well once you work the programmes out.",

It is not the easiest dryer to clean I ever use (this is my 4th dryer). I don't mean that the parts are not easy to remove and clean - the problem is that the parts are not collecting everything inside it so after cleaning the parts, I need to clean inside of the dryer too.",
