Getting a replacement strap from Armitron is possible but will cost you as much as a new watch! I recommend these watches, though, as it is hard to find a smaller, women's digital that isn't clunkly looking, etc. Also like the color selections. The navy with gold trim is what I just bought to replace the old one and it's very nice.",

Using the directions, I had no trouble setting up all the features the way I wanted them. Everything seems to work as advertised. After an extended snorkeling trip, I'll know about the water resistance. I cannot go along with the watch being \"unisex\" though. I asked my son if he would ever wear it or if he thought any of his friends would and he just looked at me as if I were from another planet. It's a fairly feminine watch, without being \"girly.\" I highly recommend this watch to any female!",
