      "text": "Wife dropped her original one into a full bathtub (for future reference, dropping a Xoom into a bathtub is a BAD idea). This one got here faster than expected, in excellent shape. OS had to update, it had an older version. That took 30 minutes. It took 15 minutes for the restore to put all her books, music and other stuff back in. It has worked as well as her original one (before it got slam dunked, that is). Hopefully won't have to buy from these people again, but If I ever need another XOOM, I will go back to these people to get it.",

You can down load several camera apps, but it barely compensates for the quality of the audio or video. Other than that, it works well for music and apps . Being this is Android....and Flash was not usable for so long, I finally found Photon Browser that allows you to use Flash. Several video sites require it and a pleasure to be able to use now. You will need to do research on Amazon to find all the extra needed connectors that make it way more useful.",

She also hates Android. So what to buy? In comes an Apple Ipad Mini 16GB. Wife seems happy with the simple IOS device. Happy days I got the Xoom! :) It just works. I love playing my Android games on the big screen. The Xoom has not missed a lick. To me this is like a hot girl that gets better with age. My wife and the Xoom she gave me. I don't deserve either but I'm just a very lucky guy! :)",

I was happy to find out it will automatically upgrade to Android 4.1.2 at no charge. I also bought the Speaker HD Dock which is great for recharging and used as a digital alarm clock.

This is the reason I went with Xoom, and after using it for several days, I couldn't be happier with my decision. The screen is super clear and crisp, the body is sleek and light - just feels great in the hands - and everything is where I'd expect it to be with great responsiveness. Lots of apps with many free ones available on Amazon and other sources. This is one of those purchases I really feel great about because the quality exceeds my expectations, and the overall experience is fun, productive, and very responsive.",

There's also something about the screen. I think the white balance is a little on the cool side, which bugs me. I think the 16x9 aspect ratio is only good for movies but everything else suffers.

Not only did it come close, it actually blows the phone performance away. I was totally amazed and absolutely LOVE it!!! The display is BEAUTIFUL and the performance is FAST.

But please communicate to seller that include and appendix explain that before use this item you should run factory reset and then go to settings and run the update function and download an install the four update. My tablet is used in the United State, if you don perform this steps you can't setup you Google account and did not recognize the external memory.

I'm still discovering things about the utility of this device, but it was easy to pick up and use right out of the box. This has replaced my laptop for everything except note-taking in college. (Waiting for an app that works like microsoft one note.) I highly recommend it!",

From what I understand Motorola will not honor the warranty on it. This description needs to specify this fact. Sold by UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC and fulfilled by Amazon.

The charging port is located on the bottom when the tablet is placed horizontally....so impossible to charge as you watch unless you have the dock for it. The button is located on the back of the tablet...not sure why? The picture quality is excellent and you get lots of storage. This is the 1st generation Motorola and you should never buy any 1st generation anything technology related....they only realize all the stupid mistakes after they build it. The second generation,(Xyboard???) I believe is much better. Invest in a newer model tablet....it's worth it.",

I'm led to believe that the second generation is not much different though. In any case, to each their own; I know how polarized the tablet debate is.",
