      "text": "This product is advertised as having low EMF in the max range of 10mGauss, however I used a Triifield meter to measure the EMF output and made sure to test both on and off to see the difference. I was shocked to see that EMF output is actually around 50-60mGauss while seated at the bench inside the unit. I understand that negative health risks may be associated with anything higher than 10mGauss. 40-50mGauss is pushing it. Altogether, I would say this is a nice sauna, easy to assemble, and definitely heats up and retains the heat, but am a little nervous about the possibile health complications from the actual EMF output measured on my Trifield meter.",

It is hot, makes me sweat, and feels great. The speakers work fantastic. One thing I didn\u2019t know is the sauna has blue tooth!!! No need for the audio jack cord.

Do yourself a favor and don't let the lower price to value of the DYNAMIC brand lead you to make the JNH mistake. I can't compare customer service, because I didn't need to call DYNAMIC.

I would t recommend people in cold weather to have it installed as N backyard because you'd have to weather proof it to speed up heating and Lai taking the heat. I am in California and it takes 30 min to hear it up since it is located in backyard. One of these days I will \"weatherize\" it and hen report back on heating time. Overall very happy with it though. Will buy it again in future.",

    "title": "DYNAMIC SAUNAS AMZ-DYN-6106-01 Barcelona 1-2 Person Far Infrared Sauna - Curbside Shipping",
    "description": "Dynamic Low EMF Saunas are constructed with the environment in mind which accounts for our efforts in using Reforested Canadian Hemlock wood. Our sauna walls are double paneled constructed with the thickest interior and exterior wood planks compared to others in the same industry. This all translates to a quality sauna that retains heat more efficiently, heats up faster and wastes less energy. Dynamic 1-2 Person model offers 6 Low EMF infrared Carbon Energy Efficient heating panels (including an industry leading foot heater) that produce a wider, softer heat that is evenly distributed throughout the sauna. Our Low EMF infrared Carbon Energy Efficient heating panel heaters are 30% larger than saunas heated by ceramic tubes and penetrate skin 40% more to maximize therapeutic benefits. Unlike ceramic heaters, you will never have to replace our Carbon Energy Efficient heating panels. Unlike traditional rock and water saunas (which heat at or over 200F and do not penetrate your skin), Dynamic Saunas operate at a much lower and safer 130F. In fact, Dynamic Saunas operate most effectively at 120F thus allowing you to enjoy the sauna longer and maximize all potential health benefits. Dynamic 1-2 person sauna is designed for ease of use and is an outstanding value. Assembly is a snap and takes less than 1 hour. Enjoy the convenience of operating a Dynamic Sauna with our dual (int. and ext.) soft touch control panel and LED display featuring sauna temperature and time functions. Play your favorite music through the saunas built in MP3 aux connection with speakers. The sauna plugs into any dedicated 15 amp 110 volt outlet so no special wiring is required and the sauna may be installed on carpet and at any indoor location including the basement, garage, master bath or walk in closet. Our sauna would be a beautiful and worthwhile addition to any fitness room. See and feel the difference today!.",
