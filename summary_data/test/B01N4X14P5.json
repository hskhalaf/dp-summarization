According to the products details 4 locks in the set are keyed alike but the second set of 4 locks is also keyed exactly same as the first set. This is not what I expected. I was expecting the 4 locks in 1st set to be keyed alike and 4 locks in the second set to be keyed alike but Keys for set 1 and 2 would be different but all 8 have the same keys!!! Makes me wonder how many same keys and locks they have distributed to others. All my 8 locks have code as 702 even though 4 orange ones were ordered later.",

He's been using them for several weeks now (preventing his tools from being \"borrowed\" by \"sticky fingers\") and they've held up well under frequent daily use. He's usually a hard customer to please so, since these have his seal of approval, I plan to order another set for myself.",

The set I bought had four sets, all matching keys (maybe good for you) wasn't a great security feature in general, in my opinion. Great locks, just want you to know what you're in for. :)",

Almost nobody uses bright orange luggage. It'll also keep out people that don't know how to pick locks, and don't have a saw or metal-cutting tool readily available.

It also keeps my nephews from trying to open the case :) My biggest issue is that (as other reviewers mentioned) the keys get caught in the lock and takes some wiggling to get it out.

Our locks were orange and, while small in size, another added identifier for our suitcases to stand out amongst others in baggage claim.
