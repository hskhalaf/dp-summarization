Set-up is super easy - far easier and understandable than HP. I recently had to use Lexmark Cust. support on a previous printer. Although the support was foreign based, it was comprehensive and knowledgeable (and polite). My previous Lexmark printer was a victim of a power surge (I had the printer about 2 years). Lexmark replaced it at no charge. Now that's a good warranty!. Excellent customer support, very functional products at a good price - Products that work! Beat the competition, hands down! What's not to like?",

Improvement was brief at best. After about 5 months it stopped working wirelessly altogether. Now all 4 members of my family need to connect by USB for all print jobs. Additionally, this printer will not recognize any print cartridges other than the more expensive Lexmark cartridges. I find myself evaluating other printers for purchase only 9 months after buying this Lexmark. Regardless of reviews I am skipping the Lexmark brand.",

It was fairly easy to set up and I am really not that great with computers. I think the thing that does bug me is the cost of replacing the ink cartridges-they are pretty expensive. Also, I think they should have better instructions on how to use the individual components, i.e fax, scanner. I had a paper jam and there were no instructions on how to handle it besides the confusing ones on the machine itself when it happened. Overall, it is a good buy at a reasonable price.",

Not only does it eat ink like there's no tomorrow, but the ink eventually leaked inside into the LCD button panel and the printer repeatedly issued printhead problems. We had an HP before this and it worked just fine. I would recommend Brother all in one over a Lexmark. Save your money and do not buy this one.",

I love the fact that it has an \"eco mode\" which allows for double-sided printing and auto black and white. Also, the fax is easy to set up. If you follow the CD guide it will set up fairly easily. The only issue I had was that my computer wouldn't talk to the printer and Lexmark had a patch for that. Oh, and it won't print from Google Docs, a major issue for me. I plan on complaining to Lexmark until they create a patch.",

Connectivity is inconsistent and unreliable; print cartridges are prohibitively expensive, and Lexmark put a lot of effort into locking out cheaper (and enviro-friendly) ink-replacement methods so the printer becomes useless if you run out of their expensive ink. YES, when working at its best, the quality is solid, but the machine doesn't overcome its problems to make it worthwhile. I'm done with Lexmark printers; looking forward to this one breaking more definitively so I can justify a different purchase.",

The only downside so far is the paper drawer, which requires a bit of a \"slam\" to close once you've reloaded paper. It also makes it harder to use the back side of a sheet (for example to recycle old papers that were clean on one side). On the other hand, it has a nice 2 sided print feature, so there are not as many scrap one-sided sheets around to re-use.",

    "description": "Put the robust Lexmark Prevail Pro705 Wireless All-in-One with Fax to work for your home or small office. Experience greater freedom with WiFi-n (3X better wireless coverage and faster transfer speeds) or connect via Ethernet. Be more productive with built-in full feature fax, and a large, 50-page auto document feeder to easily handle printing, scanning, copying and faxing jobs. Installation is fast and easy \u2013 requiring approximately 10 minutes, while WiFi Protected Setup allows you to sync the printer to a WPS-enabled router with the touch of a button. The Prevail Pro705 also features a 2.4\u201d color LCD to easily view and enhance photos. The Eco Mode feature includes an energy-saving feature and automatic two-sided printing, which can cut paper consumption in half. Print fast with document speeds up to 33ppm and 4\u201dx6\u201d photo printing in as little as 24 seconds. This robust All-in-One ships with XL high-yield ink cartridges which use Lexmark\u2019s own Vizix ink technology to produce clear and consistent results. The Vizix ink system uses individual cartridges which can be replaced one color at a time. The Prevail Pro705 also ships with Business Card Scanning software which lets you scan up to eight cards at once, parcel the information, and synchronize it with many popular contact management solutions. All of this functionality is backed by an industry leading 5-year warranty and lifetime, priority phone support!\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Lexmark Prevail Pro705 Small Office Wireless 4-in-1 offers business class performance at an affordable price. This robust office 4-in-1 printer/copier/scanner/fax provides advanced connectivity and paper handling capabilities for improved efficiency. It also saves you time and money with Vizix ink technology for crisp text and vivid images, automatic two-sided printing, and individual ink cartridges. \n\n\n\nPrint, Copy, Scan, and Fax with Outstanding Results\nDesigned to tackle a range of jobs quickly and efficiently, the Lexmark Prevail Pro705 Small Office Wireless 4-in-1, winner of Bertl's Best Cost-Effective All-in-One Device Award, combines a range of functions in one compact, space-saving unit. Finish urgent print jobs with speeds up to 33 ppm (pages per minute) and handle large scan and copy jobs easily with the 50-page automatic document feeder. Enhance and view photos with the vibrant 2.4-inch color LCD and then print them in just 24 seconds, and improve office communication with the full feature fax with 99 speed dials, junk fax block, and caller ID. And because this unit is Energy Star qualified, you'll save money and help the environment.\n\nTomorrow's Wireless Technology Today\nWith the Prevail Pro705, you can print from wherever you want without being confined to the printer's location. A fast and easy wireless installation allows multiple users to print from virtually anywhere in the home or office. Wherever you have a signal, you can print. \n\nAdditionally, the printer's WiFi-n connection provides up to three times the coverage of traditional wireless networks, and its quick transfer speeds ensure that your print jobs will always get through. \n\nLarge Capacity and Two-Sided Printing Saves Resources\nSpend more time managing success, and less time managing paper supply, with 150-page input capacity and a 50-page automatic document feeder. You'll also save both money and resources with one-touch automatic two-sided printing and the included high yield XL black ink cartridge (also included are standard-yield cyan, magenta, and yellow ink cartridges). \n\nScan and Import Business Cards\nStay organized and keep in touch with all your contacts thanks to advanced technology that allows you to easily scan and save information from business cards, such as name, address, and phone number. Rather than entering the information manually, you can scan up to eight cards at a time and sync it with your address book software. This saves you time and keeps your business running smoothly.\n\nGo Green Automatically\nTo help save energy costs, the Prevail Pro705 is Energy Star qualified, which means it meets rigorous requirements for energy set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. And because it uses less energy, it can help lower your utility bills so you save money. \n\nTo save up to 50-percent on paper and 8-percent on energy costs, this unit also offers automatic two-sided printing and an eco mode that's accessible with one touch. \n\nWarranty Information\nThe Prevail Pro705 is backed by an industry best five-year warranty (registration within 90 days required). \n\nWhat's in the Box\nLexmark Prevail Pro705 Small Office Wireless 4-in-1; print head; XL black ink cartridge, and one each standard-yield cyan, magenta, and yellow ink cartridges; quick setup sheet; installation software on CD-ROM; quick reference guide; fax guide; networking guide; power supply and cord; USB cable; service information; and warranty card.\n\n Printing in draft mode and excluding time to first page print.
