Sorry Chamberlain but that is pure BS... By the time you get the unit home and installed you find out when you actually have is not what your thought you purchased try and return it and you get \"PRODUCT INELIGIBLE FOR RETURN\" way to go Amazon. May be time to drop this supplier... Very disappointed...",

I do not want two keyless entry pads outside so will have to buy a universal one. I discovered later that the b970 has MyQ wireless but not universal remotes if you have an additional opener.",
