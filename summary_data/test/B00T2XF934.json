      "text": "We searched high and low for a metal loft bed with a desk for our 11 year old son. We came across this and figured for the price, it would be worth it. It\u2019s okay. The desk is a great size. Comes in a lot of pieces, took my husband and I about an hour to put together. Kid loves it. Honestly, my only complaint, is the legs are not as wide as I would like, so the bed does shake when going up and down the ladder. Just not as sturdy as I would prefer. Overall, a decent buy. It\u2019ll do for now, but I see us replacing this in a few years as he gets older and bigger.",

They set up a gaming station underneath and love their gaming bedroom! They are 13 and 14, around 70 and 100 pounds, 4'10\" and 5'1\". They always talk about how comfortable they are! The only downsides are how much the beds move. We have thought about anchoring them into the wall and that may help provide some additional stability. The ladder rungs are also uncomfortable to climb, especially in bare feet.",

I wouldn't put a child much younger than 8 years old because of how high it is. It doesn't have much side to side support to keep the bunk from swaying back and forth a bit. Not a big deal, but like I said I wouldn't put a very small/young child up on the bunk. It takes time to put together, but overall is pretty easy. It does look great and it does provide ample room for sitting or sleeping on the futon.",

Only thing we noticed on the desk top the front holes do not line up. No big deal the back ones do and it's not wobbly or uneven not a huge problem. It's not at all shaky like the others reviewd just make sure you go back and tighten the screws. Other then that pretty dang good item for the price! Buy away!",
