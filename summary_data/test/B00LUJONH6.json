Evidently you need different sized \u201ccollets\u201d to attach the different tools: Part numbers 480-483. This Dremel kit only includes the smallest collet \u2014 which ZERO of the included accessories use.

When we unpacked the silver, most pieces were virtually black, and almost impossible to polish by hand. I bought the Dremel tool and various polishing attachments, and managed to get almost everything gleaming in just one afternoon's work. The multispeed feature of this particular model was especially useful. I haven't used the tool for other things, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it for polishing silver and other metal objects.",

The new models are substantially more bulky than my old one but fit the hand well. The only reson i did not give a 5 star rating is the variable speed button has a little slop or play when you move it, especially on the first two speeds. Since I only use it occasionally, that isn't too much of a bother. There are other brands out there but I stuick with Dremmel becuase of the durability of the tool. My 30 year old model (no variable speed) still is going strong. Case and accessories are good.",

The Dremel 3000 is a really great option as a first rotary tool, and this particular kit is a really solid selection of bits.

      "text": "Very nice Dremel. I bought it to replace a very old one I had that finally burned out. My only complaint would be that the old one had a better case (unfortunately the new one will not fit in this old case). The old case had holes for the different drill bits/attachments to fit in and made it easy to see and find the accessory you wanted. The new one only has a cheap plastic box inside of the case that you have to put your accessories in and they kind of get piled on top of one another. So a good improvement to the Dremel itself, but not so much the interior case design.",

    "description": "Style:26 Piece KitThe Dremel 3000 is the result of upgrading our most popular rotary tool using user-requested features to improve the tool's design and ergonomics. The tool also features the EZ Twist nose cap with an integrated wrench that allows the nose cap to be used as a wrench to tighten accessories and eliminates the need for a separate wrench. A more efficient fan design and side vents provide a cooler running tool making it comfortable for extended periods of use. The tool also features a symmetrical design including a trumpet-shaped nose cap to facilitate a pencil-grip tool hold. The ability to use all existing Dremel rotary tool accessories and most attachments let the 3000 complete a wide range of applications including cutting, grinding, sanding, carving and polishing a variety of materials. The Dremel 3000-1/25 Rotary Tool Kit includes: 1 Attachments, 25 Accessories, and a rugged storage/carrying case.",
