On the one hand, it was considered visually appealing but, on the other hand, there were quite a few criticisms about various aspects of the trainer. While about half of the users were able to attain the right fit and enjoyed using the shoe for their workouts, the other half was put off by the pinching and chafing sensations caused by the trainer. Due to the controversies, the shoe has not become the customers\u2019 top pick.",

I gave them 2 stars because the heel is very rigid and ripped the skin around the Achilles\u2019 tendon. They might be good if you aren\u2019t doing anything particularly active in them, but if you plan on working out in them, I would try something else.",
