      "text": "K'Nex makes good toys but over-packages in the extreme. In this set, some of the individual pieces (such as the eyes and feet) were individually wrapped in plastic, then put into a larger plastic bag with other pieces, which in turn was put into a display box that was 2 or 3 times bigger than necessary. That had been shipped individually to Amazon individually in a snugly-fitting brown box, which Amazon shipped to me in yet a far larger box. Surely, if they wanted to, the companies involved could reduce the environmental cost of all this. That said, it is fun, creative, and mostly sturdy. (The eyes, less so.)",

When Legos are too advanced but you have a very tactile child who likes to build, these are an excellent choice. For us, we bought these for our 8 year old son who is developmentally delayed. He has excellent fine motor skills but doesn't have the endurance/patience for Legos or similar building kits. But he just loves these and they keep him engaged for hours. When I find an activity that engages my child for more than 15 minutes, it gets the highest possible rating!",

I feel that it gives my normally-quite-serious son a chance to let loose, think outside the box, and just get silly. This is a great starter set for someone who does not have any other K'Nex yet.
