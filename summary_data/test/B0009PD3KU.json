      "text": "The R2400 was a great printer while it lasted, but I purchased it in Feb of 2006, and by December of 2007, it has stopped accepting paper. In that time, it was rarely used, I had a second Epson printer (a cheaper all-in-one that I've had for over 4 years) for day to day stuff and the R2400 for graphic design projects, so needless to say, I'm a little surprised that in so little time, it has gone on the fritz. Obviously it's out of warranty now and I'll have to take it to a service center and pay whatever they ask me to pay since $800 is a lot to just throw away and write off.",

We were always happy with the prints from the 1280, but it was beginning to show some 'feed lines' and was extremely slow. The R2400 fixes all of that. The 13x19 prints that we make for our art business now take 5 minutes or less (over 30 minutes for the 1280) and the color reproduction is spectacular. The subtle blue/greens now look right and the prints look great. We've tried it on photos as well and it is just spectacular. If you are serious about large format printing, this is hard to beat.",

This printer outperforms the 2200 I use at work (and the 1280 I used to have) in every category. Start-up, ergonomics and print quality. I've had no problems with banding or clipping, as the gamut is quite wide for a device at this price point. Printing digital B&Ws is a particularly rewarding experience with this printer. All you need to do is find the paper that fits your look / style of photography, profile it, and away you go. It's not an exaggeration to say this puts out gallery quality prints. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I purchase quite a bit of equipment for my company and I have to say this was one of the more disappointing ones. The deficiencies in this printer are only exaggerated by Epson's non English speaking technical people. And on top of that, Epson agrees there are issues that reduce the unit's capabilities. Wait until you have to replace all 8 cartriges when all you need is black. The drivers don't let you specify. There is an after market driver available, but get ready to put out $600. Then you have to usually special order those 8 cartriges. I could go on and on, but it would just take less time to buy a different printer.",

What's more, I am deaf therefore I had to expect a communication breakdown with other students. So I ended up buying one for myself. They sent it and I got it the next day. It s so wonderful to print my homeworks! :) Doe",
