It's good for making sure that your bag stays closed during handling and flight, but like all TSA locks, that's about it. Please for the love of God don't use these on gym lockers.

      "text": "This is a great travel lock ! In particular, I like the flexible cable. It is also a bit longer than a regular hasp, so I can lock two or more adjoining zippers together. This means I can use it on a waist pack or anything else with zippers and an open pull. I also like the shape of this lock. When you fasten it on luggage, it lies flat. It will not get knocked around like a regular luggage lock can. The numbers are large and clear and changing the combination is a breeze. I also like the TSA red/green indication. No little lock will totally protect anything, but it is a deterrent and will prevent a casual encounter.",
