With this in mind, we set out to create a better yoga mat \u2013 one that is sustainably made and an absolute pleasure to practice on.\n\nVersatile \nAt 72\" long, 24\" wide, 3 mm thick and weighing under 5lbs, the Valka cork yoga mat provides just the right amount of support while still being lightweight and easy to carry. Suitable for all types of yoga, this yoga mat has the versatility to follow you wherever your practice may take you.\n\nGrippy When Sweaty\nOur cork & rubber mat offers amazing grip during sweaty yoga sessions. Thanks to suberin, a natural wax-like substance present in cork, the more you sweat, the better your grip becomes!\n\nBuy a Mat, Plant a Tree\nWe use Portuguese cork and 100% natural rubber, both of which are sustainably sourced. No trees are cut during the harvesting process. In fact, we plant a tree for every cork yoga mat sold!\n\nHygienic, Odor Free & Easy to Clean\nThe foldable cork layer will naturally keep clean and resist all bad odor. For best results, we recommend cleaning the mat once a week with a solution of water and vinegar. Just spray and wipe. Easy as.\n\nNon-Toxic\nMost yoga mats are made from synthetic materials which contain harmful chemicals such as PVCs, phthalates, and toxic adhesives. We use only natural rubber, cork and plant based inks. That\u2019s it.\n\nComplimentary Carry Strap \nEvery cork yoga mat comes with a durable yoga carry strap that can also be used for stretching and achieving some of those tougher asanas.\n\nAfter countless hours of testing (and sweating), we are confident that this is the perfect yoga mat for the sweatlife. Add to Cart to experience the joy of practicing yoga on a luxurious cork surface.",
