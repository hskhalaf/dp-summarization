We've had issues with our old doorbell actually ringing for years but I kept on with it because it was a fancy recording one. We have security cameras anyway so the fancy doorbell was unnecessary. I just needed and 'ding dong' and I'm so happy I have it now for cheap and basically zero installation.",

Animal sounds, lullabies, etc. Although the knocking one is weird because I specifically got a doorbell so I wouldn\u2019t have to hear loud knocking. I would like if it could get quieter, but volume control is good. Really loud for a big house, or if you\u2019re watching a movie. I switch it up now and then for a different tune. It\u2019s neat because people who visit get to hear the songs when they ring the doorbell. It looks nice too. Real sleek.",
