Like C\u2019mon now. I can\u2019t be the only one thinking this lol. Protection is solid. Chin strap could be a lot better also. I personally wouldn\u2019t spend anything over $110 for these mask.

    "description": "The Dye Precision i4 Goggle System is the smallest profile, lightest, and best field of vision goggle system available. The thermal lens leads the industry in optical clarity and provides a distortion and fog free field of vision regardless of weather. Dye's proprietary dual stage foam combines open and closed cell foam technology. Dual stage foam is specifically designed to 'sheet' sweat and moisture away from your face, providing an undeniably resilient boundary between your eyes and perspiration. The i4 features an industry first compound radius lens with thermal technology, giving the player the ultimate vertical/ horizontal peripheral vision.\n\nIt also has a revolutionary patent pending rapid lens change system, allowing lens changes in ten seconds or less. It is as simple as pushing on each interior tab arm and then sliding them forward, instantly freeing the i4 lens for replacement.\n\nIts precise blade angling and proven venting configuration allow heat and moisture to dissipate quickly. Scream Multi-Directional Venting makes communication with teammates effortless by carrying your voice farther.\n\nTiger Teeth buckles allow you to adjust your Invision woven rubber strap for a custom fit. Tiger teeth are designed to bite down and secure the strap during rigorous competition.",
