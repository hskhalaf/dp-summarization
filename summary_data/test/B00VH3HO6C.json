But do not dare to watch a movie with darker scenes or black bars, play a game with other colors than white or try to edit images using photoshop etc. in a darker environment. I've uploaded an image, so you can see for yourself. It should display an all black image. Well, it doesnt. To be honest, there's even more yellow than black. I do know that the manufacturers try to sell us a certain amount of IPS glow as normal. But this is madness. Cant recommend this display.",

And yes item both from Amazon warehouse so I got two extra power cables, and vga cable, yes vga, there is no vga port guys :D so I used my old HDMI cable until I received new display port cable. Getting this monitor was best choice of upgrade from 1080p, fast, colorful, big and way more emersive than 1080p buy it..",

This monitor comes with a control stick on the back of the screen which makes navigating the screens menus incredibly easy. The only draw back with this monitor I would say is that the size of the stand is quite substantial but if you are looking to put this on a monitor stand you will be fine! Overall this monitor looks great which the 1440p resolution and thin bezels alongside a functional high refresh rate. Would definitely recommend this monitor to anybody with a fairly beefy rig. 9/10!",

I must admit that if all these people hadn't mention about it I wouldn't recognize. Also, I read some forums and most people say if its not too annoying this must be normal for an IPS screen.",
