It held up well until it recently malfunctioned running out of control at full temperature after being set to 350. We bought a newer one at Costco and returned it because it did not accommodate our 12\" square baking pan (depth is 11\" vs 12\"). The Cuisinart models with larger interiors are too wide for our countertop space, So we are ordering this one again! Hoping it will last another 7-8 years of daily use.",

I shopped around to see if there was something else that might be better, but the bottom line is, don't fix what's not broken! I purchased the exact same model and couldn't be happier with it!!",

This has been a great appliance and saved us tons of money because we don't have to heat up our electric stove for pizza, cookies or a plate of food that won't reheat well in micro (bread, crispy stuff etc.) The convection makes cooking time less than big oven as well. I have even made successful popovers in this oven. Down side: The convection fan became very noisy in about 2 years time. I tried to take it apart to clean and lube, but you would have to destroy the plastic housing to get to the fan. I'm going to try a Breville next; Cooks illustrated ranked them #1.",

Only complaint is that the bottom of the toast does not cook as fast as the top due to the grill the toast sits on . . . it leave lines on the toast and seems to shield the heat.

      "text": "My old toaster oven suddenly died, which I loved. I searched online and read all the reviews of toaster ovens. I found a site that had listed the top ones even including the best for the top dollar [...]. I was stuck between this one and the most expensive. Everything I own is Cuisinart. I couldn't be more happy. Though I haven't been able to use it to it's full capacity. I am happy with what I've experienced so far and not to mention it looks fabulous in the kitchen",

      "text": "This is seriously the only toaster oven I think I'll ever, ever want to own. It's wonderful!!! It has options for convection, regular oven, and toast. I use it not only for toast (actually, rarely for toast!), but use it as a mini-oven. It's much more energy efficient than turning on a whole oven for small-er items. It holds/fits quite a large-sized dish/pan comfortably. (Easily an 8x8 pyrex or other pan and holds standard loaf pans for bread baking). Fantastic! The best!!",

Yes, it gets hot so be careful opening it and teach your older children who may be using it to be careful. Yes, it's a little noisy while it's cooking, but this doesn't bother us at all. We rented a beach house that had this nifty oven in it and loved it....that is why we chose to purchase one for ourselves and haven't been disappointed at all.",

      "text": "You will pay a little extra for this product but it is worth it. Most toaster ovens are so cheaply made that they are simply not usable for both performance reasons and safety reasons. We use the Cuisinart mostly to cook frozen pizza in the summer when the AC is on and we don't want to heat up the house with the conventional oven. It cooks the pizza evenly and I would go so far as to say it even tastes better. The toaster oven also toasts french bread evenly,quickly, and effeciently without worring if it will burn as with your cheaper toaster ovens.",

If saving time and versatility are part of your equation for purchase, this is The One you want! The interior space is large and the stainless exterior is stylish and decor compatible.
