Pro tip, the guy lines are there for a reason. Use them. Make sure it's all taut. This photo was taken after two days of rain. Does an Ozark do that? Nope. Plus, the tech support has been incredibly satisfying.",

Can be done by one person, but two people is ideal. Update: Used in Illinois the following September into October. Very little rain, but some strong winds. Held up great.",
