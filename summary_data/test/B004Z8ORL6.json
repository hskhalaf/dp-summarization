It is a smaller set, but my hiusband who is 5'11\" can sit down and play it. It is definitly not a professional set, but will help your kid practice or decide that they really don't want to play the drums, and you didn't waste a fortune.",

It looks really nice and has held up while over the past year even though my four-year-old beats on it constantly. It is a little bit on the small side and I probably wouldn't recommend it for anyone older than seven or eight but for anyone younger than that age I would highly recommend it. Seems to sound pretty good and I've had no issues. Overall I'm happy with this product.",

This is a great set for the beginner. Assembly is a bit tricky as the instructions are not that great but we managed to fumble our way through it. It produces a nice, albeit loud sound and he's happy so it's well worth the noise. This set pairs nicely with earplugs and Excedrine.",

It included absolutely everything that you need to get started. I would recommend for a child beginner.",

The only other problem I had is that the screw to hold the drum didn't screw in properly, so we'll have to get the right ones from a hardware store.",

I have never personally owned a drum set but I have played enough to say this set is a very good entry level junior set.",

If I had to buy another drum set for Christmas, I'd buy something simpler until you know the child is going to actually take lessons.
