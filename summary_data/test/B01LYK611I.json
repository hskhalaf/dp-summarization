It should truly be required reading for any homeschooling mom. I read it every August, but I find myself revisiting the book throughout the school year for reassurance. The idea of teaching from a restful state changes how I homeschool and even how I parent. I wish there were a Parenting from Rest version of this book because the principle can benefit anyone who has children, not just homeschooling moms. Love it!",

Ch 1 esp speaks to this issue, while 2 and 3 are more specific for those who are homeschooling. Sarah helped me think through the basic reasons I'm wanting to homeschool and how I want (and don't want) to go about it. Thank you, Sarah!",
