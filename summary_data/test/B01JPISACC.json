My instructions were to keep my head elevated for 3 weeks at minimum following the surgery, and I was very worried, as I have never been a back sleeper. This pillow was a tremendous help to me. Everything about it made for a very comfortable sleeping experience during my recovery. The width and height were perfect. I kept a traditional pillow on either side for arm support, and to prevent rolling, and I slept well. I would very much recommend this pillow to anyone in the same situation, or someone looking to train themselves to sleep on their back for whatever reason.",

      "text": "I have GERD and hiatel hernia. My Gastroenterologist recommended this to me. Before, I had just raised my bed with blocks. This has helped me about the same. It does take a long time to get use to. I often find myself in the morning slid all the way down. I use my regular pillow to sleep at the top of it. It isn't slippery, so I must just move around alot at night. I haven't washed it yet so I can't review that. No harsh chemical smells. Overall, I am pleased with it.",
