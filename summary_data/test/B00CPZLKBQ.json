I refused, contacted Amazon they sent UPS to pick up defected computer and sent a new one in less than a week. The new one has been great works amazingly fast and has all the features we need in a home computer. Purchased wireless mouse and keyboard the picture is misleading they aren't wireless with the unit",

When you stay at 8 you lose some apps that work better on 8.1. Acer who has been one my favorites has been a pain in the rear with this trying to get them to not only answer questions, but to accept the questions. Their new web site stinks.",

However my first experience is NOT good. Took it out the box, my husband set it up and the screen got stuck after set up and then we did an emergency shut off after several minutes of the screen being stuck and the screen never booted up again. He unplugged and tried to restart -- nothing. So we sent it back the next day. We hope the replacement isn't a dud too.",
