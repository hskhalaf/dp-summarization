The motor is so weak that it stalls out when it hits a hair more than 1/16th long. The battery dies before you can get even one half of an ankle shaved. Pure and total junk. I returned the first one thinking I just got a dud, but the replacement was even more anemic. I would feel comfortable letting a 3 year old play with it as I know they couldn't hurt themself nor cut any hair.",
