However, 30 minutes of Brother tech support has proven this feature claim to be a lie. This device DOES NOT SCAN TO CLOUD SERVICES WIRELESSLY!! You can, however, scan to their installed software on your computer - then, you can transfer your scanned items to various cloud services. This is completely useless as it requires a computer. Why even offer the functionality if I need my computer to which I could have done it in the first place? ** Returning the scanner today **",

This nifty little scanner is compact and easy to use. Had no issues connecting to WiFi and was able to scan directly from the phone app. The phone app is OK but you cannot name or rename file scans which means extra work of finding the file and renaming it. I was happy with the scanning speed. It scans double sided with one pass through, which I love. Only complaint so far is the pages struggle to stay straight, which is a big minus.",
