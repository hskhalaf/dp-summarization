Once installed, you need to use the unlocking knob which is fitted with a magnet to unlock your cabinet doors. The magnetic \"unlocking\" knob can be conveniently kept at eye level for easy access. Another cool feature is that each lock also comes with an \"on/off\" switch for when you need to get in and out of the cabinets and don't want to have to keep using unlocking knob.",

May need to leave more of a lip on the adhesive sticker to be able to pull it off easier. This was my only reason for 4 starts instead of 5. Otherwise love this product.",

I think the only room for improvement at this point would be stronger magnets. On extra thick cabinets I've had to use 3rd party magnets as keys to get them to work.",

The first set was used to keep my autistic child out of my bookshelf--an IKEA Billy with thick glass and wood doors-- and they are still going strong. The second set is being used to keep him out of a pair of IKEA Ivar cabinets with solid pine doors. My child is an extremely strong 6 year old, and the locks have worked really well to keep my things safe thus far. I don't think they will be strong enough to stop him in a year or two, but they would definitely be more than sufficient to keep out a determined toddler.",

These can be tricky to install with some cabinets, and they didn't work on our bedroom suite because the drawer fronts were too thick for the magnet to work.",
