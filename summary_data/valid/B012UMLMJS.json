Soaked it in water overnight per the instructions hopeing this would be a simple remedy, however it seemed to be even more sensitive to the angle of insertion the next morning. I would have killed my plant if I relied soley on this meter. Just missed my return window so in the trash it went, along with the name Risantec. Those of you that are using this as your only means of measurment, I would suggest checking it against the drops or another proven meter.",

It turned on for a little bit gave out a 7.3 for hard tap water and then shut off.

      "text": "So far so good. I have used this periodically for a month to check the pH of my spa. As I'd hoped, it is a whole lot easier than using indicators and appears to be more accurate. Obviously I cannot comment on its longevity. My one complaint is in regards to the sparse instruction set for the initial calibration. IMHO they could have used another paragraph or two to clearly show the methodology, maybe even some diagrams - particularly for the higher pH calibration. Once that is accomplished (even with confusing instructions it only took 30 minutes), using the meter is a snap. If the device lasts, and I've no reason to expect otherwise, I'd probably rate at 5 stars.",
