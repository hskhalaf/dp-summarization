Put in pocket and head for the course. I use this every time I play a round. Stuff the dirty golf ball in, work it around a few seconds and remove a now clean golf ball.

Having this in the pocket, I can clean golf ball whenever and wherever I can. Compared to the other ball cleaning accessory I used to have, this is much more durable. After I pour a couple teaspoon of water, it is moist for a round of 18 hole. The trick for long lasting is to pull it inside out for drying after completing the round. Stuff it back in and pour some water, you are ready for another day of golf.",
