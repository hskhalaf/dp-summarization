However, after using it for a bit (who wouldn't want to use such a cool/fun purchase for putting at home) I realized the return on this putting machine was faulty about 20% of the time. It would not return balls rolled directly to the return slot, often leaving balls for me to go grab (which is against the purpose of the item itself). For this, I give it 2 stars, and would recommend looking elsewhere!",
