The sound quality on these doesn't come close to a pair of hi-fi headphones in the same price range (see: Audio Technica or similar), but when you're 36,000 feet in the air, that doesn't matter too much as audiophiles aren't the intended market for this product. As far as battery life goes, I think the estimated 20 hours is bang on. At the refurb price, worth every penny.",

The headphone comes with a audio cable which can connect it to my computer without using Bluetooth. For a mobile device, bluetooth is a better option. Once fully charged with 4 hours, the headset can last ~10 house using NC mode. Importantly, the microphone works better at ambient sound mode, compare to NC mode.",

      "text": "I can't believe ANYONE leaving a review on these would say something negative! These things are THE best of ALL the BT models and I've tried them all -- Bose, Sennheiser, etc. If you are complaining about anything on these then you are just simply one of those who thrives on complaining. Way better than the Bose. Had them; over-rated. Sound wasn't as good. If you are on the fence, just order. I'm certain you won't regret",

However, I did go for the refurbished option and the initial product I received was damaged so had to be returned. The return process was smooth so not a big issue. I then reordered (again refurbished) from a different seller this time (secondipity) and I received the product as expected. It appeared to be unused when I got it so I'm happy.",
