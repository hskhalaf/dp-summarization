Davis has a crap website that you can publish data to, but it only updates every 15 minutes unless you pay a monthly fee. Total nonsense! Come on Davis, get it together or you will find yourself out of business. Ambient Weather WS-2902 is the way to go IMHO.",

Davis makes a fancier model (Vantage Pro) that is supposed to add some other features, but I like how this is all integrated into one unit for easy mounting. The software that comes with it is obviously very dated and of limited usefulness. But I got a free account with Wunderground and upload my data to the web through that.

      "text": "I have had this unit since 2012 without any failures and have replaced the battery 4 times with the shortest interval being 3 months because of a poor battery. A lithium cell lasts about 1 year and there is at least 2 weeks warning the battery is failing. I live in central Texas so not much snow, but it tolerated 2 inch snowfall without difficulty, as well as a couple of 4+ inches of rain storms and up to 60 mph winds. The only downside I can think of is getting up the 12 foot pole to reach the battery.",

This allows me to easily take down the entire setup in minutes. Hurricane/tropical storm Maria is headed my way so the weather station should get a good workout.",

This station works very well and gives me more information than I need, however that is way better than none. It has a range of 1,000 feet which seems rather long, however, every time a signal goes through a wall, the range drops in half. Consequently, stations with a range of only 300 feet (very common) often have problems -- this one did not. Setup is not hard, but diffidently requires reading Davis' instructions closely.",

So far the only draw back is you need to purchase an additional piece of hardware to pull the data off if you so wish.",

Davis can be tough to get a hold of, but when you do get in touch with them (either over the phone or via email), you will get an answer one way or another.",

View up to 50 graphs including temperature, rain, rain rate, wind and barometric pressure--all on the console. \n * \"This Time Yesterday\" Feature: Data point on the graph indicates the weather during the same time yesterday to help compare and analyze day-to-day weather trends. \n * Alarms: Set 22 simultaneous, different alarms to warn of dangers such as high winds, freezing temperatures, rain rate, flood warning, and more. \n * Time and Date: View the current time and date or the time of sunrise/sunset. \n * Moon Phase: See the eight phases of the moon from new to full. \n * Barometer: Five-position trend arrow shows whether barometric pressure is rising, falling, or stable. \n * Temperature and Humidity: Console updates outside temperature every 10 seconds and inside temperature every minute. In addition, outside humidity updates every 50 seconds and inside humidity every minute. \n * Rain: Console updates rain totals and rain rate every 20 seconds for the last 25 hours, days, months. \n * Wind Speed: See wind speed updates every 2.5 seconds, in miles per hour, meters per second, kilometers per hour, and knots. Provides the average and high wind speed for two-minute and ten-minute intervals. \n * Units of Measure: Data is reported in US standard units. \n\n Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) Features:\n\n * Wireless: Frequency-hopping spread spectrum radio frequency from 902 to 928 MHz ensures consistent transmission up to 1,000 feet from integrated sensor suite to console. Survived cyclic corrosion tests simulating wear in extreme weather environments \n * Solar-powered with stored energy backup: Solar Panel energizes the station during the day. On-board super capacitor provides power at night. Lithium battery provides backup when needed. \n * Rain Collector: Self-emptying tipping spoon measures rain with 0.01-inch resolution. \n * Anemometer: Records wind speeds from two to 150 miles per hour. \n * Wind Direction: Measures wind direction in compass points or degrees. \n * Temperature/Relative Humidity: Outside temperature readings from -40 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 to 65 degrees Celsius). Measures relative humidity from 0 to 100 percent. \n * Weather Proof Cover: is corrosion-resistant and extremely durable. Electronics are potted or over-molded for added moisture shielding. \n * Radiation Shield: protects from solar radiation and other sources of radiated and reflected heat. \n * Easy Installation with included mounting hardware kit. \n * Bubble Level: Allows for more accurate installation and better data collection. \n\n What's in the Box?\nIntegrated Sensor Suite (ISS), LCD console, mounting hardware",
