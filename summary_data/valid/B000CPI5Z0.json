I can vouch for this Cleaner as the engine light went out and my vehicle passed the emissions inspection that is required in our county. I used it as directed and after approximately 50 miles the engine light went out. Took it in for vehicle inspection the next day and passed. Saved me major dollars to replace catalytic converter out of warranty. Would use this again without hesitation.",

I changed spark plugs and O2 sensors (which needed to be done anyway), but would the code would still come and go with every tank of gas. Also tried some of the cheaper fuel additives with no results. I read where that code could also be caused by dirty fuel injectors. After adding the Red Line SI-1, I have gone 3 months now with no problems AND getting better gas mileage. Highly recommend giving this a try!",
