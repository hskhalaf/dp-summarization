Great quality materials, with snap buttons that confidently lock the swimsuit into place. We can't go swimming anymore because of the lockdowns, but if you're lucky enough to have a private pool, then order up.

      "text": "This diaper works well for pool use. The snaps make this reusable diaper all that much easier to remove when water logged. My granddaughter is 22 months and I bought a 24 month diaper. It is a bit snug around the thighs, but a good fit overall. As others have said, this diaper isn't absorbent enough outside the pool. I think it is best for a toddler close to being potty trained. This washes up well and is very soft.",
