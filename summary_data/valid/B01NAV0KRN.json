The curls come out wonderful. I like to curl mine and run my fingers through; see pic. The barrel is super long which I love, I have longer hair. The coating is slick and your curls come out and move effortlessly from the iron. The tip gets pretty warm, but its never burned me, or been a problem, I don't need to be near it to do my hair. Its the best I have ever had in my life. Will not disappoint.",
