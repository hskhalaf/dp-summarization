So I bought this Lasko Portable Electric 42\" Oscillating Tower Fan. Now I feel great air movement.",

My wife went to Costco and bought a another fan and i was going to argue since I feel Costco sell cheap fans. we always throw them away but the fans she bought throws out more cooler air than Lasko. Side by side the Sierra fan wins. I have it next to me while im typing this review. I use it at night to sleep. I don\u2019t recommend this fan.",

Looks like other reviewers have experienced this as well so I did not bother trying another. Had to truck this thing to a Kohl's since that was the only local place I could return it without a fee. Also of note, I bought the PollenTec filter accessory for this model and it was equally awful.",

The first one I received had a noticeable 'tick' sound every time it hit one of the stops. Lasko was kind enough to replace it, but a year later the replacement is starting to make a buzzing sound while oscillating. Not sure if it's this specific model or if the manufacturing quality have decreased, but I can't recommend this model.",

      "text": "It definitely works for cooling you down if it\u2019s blowing right on you. It reaches decently far for a fan. I would have given it 4 stars but it doesn\u2019t oscillate like it should. I assembled and disassembled and reassembled and googled it and tried to fix it but it has never worked. You can tell that it\u2019s supposed to because you can feel the motor that is supposed to make it oscillate when you twist it. I\u2019d recommend the fan for sure to anyone if I knew that you would get one that actually worked. My roommate threw the box out before we realized it didn\u2019t work properly so I was not able to return it.",

The sturdy plastic base assembles easily with a phillips-head screwdriver, and occupies a 13\u201d x 13\u201d footprint on your floor. This sleek, vertical space saving design allows you to put the stand up fan in small places, where pedestal & box fans won\u2019t fit, without sacrificing air circulation, comfort or style. \n\n\n\n Powered by 3 quiet speeds, this fan helps you beat the heat. If you live in the heat with no central air, or your window units do a poor job of moving air around your home or apartment, this fan creates excellent air flow and will help make you feel cooler. This standing fan delivers excellent air flow but is still quiet enough to hear the TV \u2013 even on HIGH. It creates just the right amount of white noise making it ideal for sleeping at night when it\u2019s warm and stuffy. Perfectly sized to aim over a high bed and powerful enough to reach across the room.\n\n\n\n This electric plug-in fan is portable and easy to operate and comes with remote control, optional oscillation, programmable timer and a Nighttime Setting that automatically dims the control display and puts the fan on High for an hour, then Medium for an hour, and then stays on Low until you interact with the fan again. The remote is great for when you don\u2019t feel like getting up to change the settings.\n\n\n\n Lasko has been making quality household products for over 100 years. Lasko tower fans are ETL Listed and come with our patented Blue Plug safety fuse technology making them a safe choice for a cooling breeze when it\u2019s hot and humid outdoors.",
