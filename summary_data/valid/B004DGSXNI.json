The printer also sucks up expensive ink like a dry sponge. The only good things are the low cost and that it prints pretty fast. If you like frustration and dealing with things that don't work they way they're supposed to, this is a good way to go.",

The customer service folks know this, as on occasion they send me free color toner. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Where is the class action lawsuit re: false advertising. And if you don't print a lot, the toner will go dry, and ... you guessed it ... you have to buy more toner. A SCAM - SEND BACK TO CHINA!",
