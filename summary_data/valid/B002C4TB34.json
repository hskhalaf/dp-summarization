He wanted to improve his cymbal sound, and I learned that you can't really do anything to fix existing cymbals. I had learned about Zildjain from a drummer I knew in my younger days, so I bought these. I also bought an extra stand, since it looked like there was an extra cymbal than what his kit came with.",

These might be okay for a youngster just starting out, but I wouldn't recommend them for seasoned musicians or professionals. I'm not a full time musician, I play in a garage band, but we play gigs now and then. I went looking for better cymbals almost immediately. Mr. Keane is correct. If you have some idea what you want for cymbals, you can get really good deals on used ones that sound much better than these. I'll probably be posting this set on ebay sometime in the not too distant future.",

But they do the job allowing me to practice but I would honestly be embarrassed to play them in public and I am not afraid to let my children go crazy on them as I would be with other expensive cymbals. I am giving them three stars only because they are better than nothing. But, I would never purchase these again though, maybe I would use pie plates instead...sorry Zildjian.",
