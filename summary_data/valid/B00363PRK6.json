It was roomy so I got to sleep comfortably even though I am the kind of sleeper who tosses about half the night. I liked that the inside fabric was different than the outside fabric. It's nice when the inside is soft and fuzzy instead of slippery. Makes the coldest part of the desert night snuggly and yet when it warmed up outside in the morning I didn't get too hot.",
