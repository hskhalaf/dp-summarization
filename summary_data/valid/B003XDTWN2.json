They call this a personal heater for a reason - it only heats up the immediate surroundings. My office usually runs about 68 degrees. I took temperature measurements as close as 6\" away from the heater and as far as 3 feet away. You can barely feel the heat any further than 2 ft from the unit. I gave it 5 stars because it lives up to its name and gets the job done. But if you want to warm up an entire office cubicle you're better off getting something a bit bigger.",

It will not heat up your whole cube or office, so you won't hear complaints from those weirdos who are hot all the time. And so what? Who wants to share their precious heat with those jerks anyway? Since it's low wattage, there's less of a chance of blowing out a block of breakers in your crappily wired office building. Stay toasty, my friends!",

      "text": "I work in a very cold single office, and my regular heater kept blowing the fuse. Fortunately this cute little Lasko hasn\u2019t done that once, and it\u2019s perfect to keep right next to my feet so I stay toasty. In an enclosed space, the heat builds to a point where I need to shut it off occasionally. Overall super pleased with its simplicity, size, and efficiency! I\u2019ve used it for a few months now, no issues even though I keep rolling my chair over the cord and accidentally kicking it over.",

My only real complaint is this - I wanted to use near my bed when I sleep to keep my head warm, but the button lights up so bright, I had to place electrical tape over it to block out all the light. I don't like having to do that, though, because I'm afraid I'll forget to turn it off in the morning. I just wish the light wasn't so bright. Other than that, it's a good little heater.",

I put it under my desk to warm my legs and that works better than having it at chest-level. If you're looking for a heater to warm a larger area, this isn't it. It's just a spot heater.",

There's only one heat setting, but it's great for warming up my hands and bringing my desk space up a few degrees temperature-wise without being too hot.
