I spent over $50 on this little one and I can make it work, but the bigger system is easier to use, so I'm going to end up paying for 2 systems. Spend more and get the K4 - save yourself money in the long run.",

It is adjustable to various wood depths and also comes with a guide so that you do not drill the pilot hole too deep. It comes with about 12 pocket screws of each various length and also includes a guide that helps you pick the type for your project. If you need more than 12, you will have to purchase some.",
