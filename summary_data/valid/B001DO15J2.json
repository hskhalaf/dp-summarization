The responses aren't as fast, the viewing system is inferior and the control layout is less efficient.

      "text": "I bought the Nikon Coolpix P6000 as a companion for the Nikon D300 I already own. I needed a small, light point-and-shoot camera that I could throw in my bag or purse or pocket for those times when the D300 would be too heavy or obtrusive. I have only had the camera few weeks so far, but so far I am pleased with its performance, its functionality, and its portability. It is easy to use right out of the box and delivers a nice photo. One drawback (in my opinion) is the 13 MP resolution. That's just overkill. But that's OK. Overall, a very nice camera with a nice feel, and I would recommend it.",

I searched for a replacement, and I found this , for $95.00. The battery that came with it did not hold the charge well. So I had to buy another set of batteries. Then, I found out that the camera was made in Vietnam, and not Japan, which I thought it was made in Japan. Now I am not too sure about it.",

I lost it to a fire and I've purchased other point and shoot (fuji fine pix f550exr, and nikon s6000) in an attempt to replace this one because the prioe now it just out of my range, but none can compare to the features of the p6000.

As far as point and shoot cameras go, the P6000 is \"OK.\" The pictures turn out well as long as you don't exceed ISO 400. This was a con for me as I bought the camera to use in lower light conditions. Any thing shot at 6400 was unusable. The GPS feature sounded good, but in practice, it takes too long to acquire a fix which meant most of the pictures I took didn't have the GPS data attached.",

Love the rotary program button, just like in the old days when one could quickly and easily switch from mode to mode without having to go through endless menus.

Good dynamic range tho' closeups not really macro. Like the GPS feature a lot. Not happy with the battery - - runs out of juice quickly if do any reviewing or deleting. Works seamlessly with a Mac and Photoshop - - both important to me & my profession. I'd recommend to anyone who wants a serious digital camera and like the idea of geo-tagging pics.",

This is sitting on a bench, on the boardwalk at the Jersey shore. You don't get a clearer shot of the GPS satellites then that. After gaining sync the GPS would often lose sync while outdoors. Some of the pictures were off location by 1/4 mile. Nikon tech support's only help was that it states in the manual it can take a while to sync. My HTC cell phone can locate me on Google maps within 25 feet inside a building and do it under a minute. Don't buy this camera for the GPS.",
