For the price and even for more than the price, I am very happy with these monitors. I have had for about 6 months now without any issues. The power supply could be a little longer, but overall they are one of the best deals I've seen for a monitor.",

As a result I have to switch input about every time I come into my home office. Should be a way to turn off auto-detect. I did like the array of input ports on the device, however. Two HDMI and a full size DisplayPort as well as VGA make for a very versatile monitor. Removing the stand to mount on a swing arm was simple.",

There is about a 10 millimeter frame that is behind the film, giving the appearance of \"frameless\"....if you don't try to expand the viewing widow to the true edge of the monitor. A small nit, and no worse than other monitors. I have fairly new ViewSonic which has frame that is 20mm, and it cost 25 per-cent more.",

The speakers are subpar but if you're looking for any kind of entertainment you should have external speakers anyway. I only have one concern and I'm trying to work through it. Because of the very wide width of this monitor, many of the webpages and forms I filled out during the course of my job or a little blurry. Trying to figure out the resolution. Other than that it is a great monitor",

Now i need to find something to \"carry it\" in when i travel. :D",

So many people like the sound coming from those small speakers that I decided to purchase them and hear for myself. At any rate I still think this monitor is a great purchase for the money.

I much more prefer the glass monitor I have at work from AOC. But again I went with this monitor to avoid sun glare which it does meet my needs. If I could I would give it a 4.5 rating.",

The monitor includes the iMenu option, which allows you to change settings using only the keyboard and mouse, better than having to adjust the monitor by pushing buttons on the monitor. The speaker sound is subpar, so I use my desk top speakers. All and all great product for the price!",

There are rubber mats so that it can be removed from its stand and leaned against a vertical surface, but I have not tried that. As mentioned in other reviews, the speakers are atrocious and should never be used. The image looks great though the options are quite limited relative to higher end monitors.
