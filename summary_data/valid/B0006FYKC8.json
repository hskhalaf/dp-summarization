This bag is perfect size to hold: * Boots * Helmet * Gloves, (2 pair) * Hat * Extra shirt * Her ski coat Bonus: * Pouch area for money * Spot for bottled water/snack The bag worked great this season! She is not easy on her gear and this bag looks great now that the season is ending. For the record: boots are shoe size 9, clothing is adult small and her jacket was a North face parka. We will clean it, spray with waterproofing and use it again next year. Well worth it! Great price for the quality",

I ended up with one that barely fits my helmet in the middle and boots on the outside. It is the right size for me, but any smaller would not have worked.",
