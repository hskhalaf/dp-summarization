This year he's asking for an expansion pack, and still putting projects together. His younger brother wants his own set, too. It's a hit. From the adult perspective, this is some very, very basic stuff. I found myself wishing for a little more theory in the instruction book, but I remind myself that this is the very basic entry level kit intended for young kids. Even so, he's starting to figure out the very general ideas about how some of this stuff works.",

My 4 1/2 year old can assemble it without help. She was able to recreate one of the simple circuits (the soaring fan one) after seeing it only one time. Great toy that encourages learning as well.

Other than that, the circuit designs are a bit repetitive, so he's only done a few of the designs, i.e. the ones that get sounds, lights, or motors working with the least effort. It seems there could be some more documentation/explanation to assist the young mind with the how and why this stuff works.

Interestingly, he started building his own circuits without snapping the pieces to the grid baseplate, and did it more \"lego\" style.

The pieces, which include snap wires, slide switches, an alarm circuit, a music integrated circuit, and a speaker, snap together easily on the included plastic grid--no soldering required. Each piece is numbered and color-coded to make identifying them easy. These components combine to create working circuit boards just like the ones found inside televisions, radios, and other electronic devices. With its easy-to-follow instructions, Snap Circuits gives your child a hands-on education in how electrical circuits work to run the everyday devices that they're familiar with. They'll also gain valuable lessons in building and in following instructions. The project manual includes large color illustrations and simple directions for each project. The projects include a sound-activated switch, a musical doorbell, a voice-controlled lamp, a flying saucer, and a light police siren. With these projects, children will experiment with things like electric switches, integrated circuits, digital circuits, fuses, and the transformation of circuit sounds into other sounds. Includes: Plastic snap-grid, 32 electrical components, and 1 project manual.Recommended for children 8 years and older.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nGive your child an exciting, hands-on introduction to electronics with Elenco Electronics Snap Circuits Jr. SC-100.
