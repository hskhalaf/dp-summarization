I cannot say enough about how professional and service-oriented the seller is, too. I had originally ordered a Small, which was too tight, and I contacted the seller about getting a size Medium. The seller response time was immediate, and in no time, I had gone through the return process, and another pair showed up. Actually, I would HIGHLY recommend any product from this seller, just because of the quality service I received in dealing with this glove purchase. You will love having these gloves!",

The fingertips are cut with a more work glove pattern than I am used to in a driving glove.

The stitching is very nice as well. With proper care, which includes not leaving them in direct sun light as this will dry them out and will lead to cracking and peeling, you should have these for a long while. As I have done in the past with similar gloves I condition ONLY the top part of the gloves with a leather conditioner as doing it on the palm side would reduce the grip of the leather and would have a hard time gripping things.",

I needed new gloves. The leather quality of these Riparo gloves is very good and the stitch work is excellent. The large, ordered based on the Amazon sizing chart, fit quite tightly, but the finger length is much better than my last pair. After having had this type of glove previously and considering the thickness of the leather, I am comfortable these will stretch to fit my hands perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.",
