      "text": "Got this for home workouts and wanted something with a rubber coating on the base of the kettlebell to protect it from getting banged up outside and also to avoid damage to things inside when I put it down or store it. Price is reasonable. My only complaint is the grip. I sweat easily and the horns on this are painted, so it does get slippery as I work out. There is a little bit of texture, but not much. It's better than a brand my gym has with polished chrome handles, but not as good as powder coated kettlebells for grip. I will probably ad tape to improve the grip. Overall a pretty decent option.",

Maybe that's part of the compensation issue I mentioned above but I will soon be upgrading to the 10 lb.",
