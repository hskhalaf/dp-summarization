I tried the 1500v3, really liked them but felt they were too narrow and the phantom fit curled up proving to be a distraction while running. Enter the 1500v4 and they made them slightly wider and it made a huge difference. I hate running, but with these shoes I actually enjoy my daily runs.",

As an aside, before this shoe, I suffered from a burning sensation in my left forefoot. I decided that it was from all the cushioning and deeper drops in today\u2019s running shoes. I decided to take a chance and switched to this minimalist shoe. It resolved my foot discomfort and I\u2019ve never run better.",

I use to think I was a minimalist runner, always looking for shoes with the least amount of heel to toe drop. So when I got these I thought I would hate them. Far from the truth, I love them! Just the right amount of cushion and support but doesn't feel bulky like some Asics I have. The grip on the sole is great for outdoor running but it feels funny if using on the treadmill.",
