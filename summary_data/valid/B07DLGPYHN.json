This protein supplement has 25 grams of protein per serving of pure whey protein isolate, the highest quality and most expensive whey protein there is. Did I also mention the chocolate flavor is absolutely amazing!!! The flavoring is all natural, contains no artificial flavors, and is free of artificial sweeteners! This product also contains ProHydroLase, an innovative patented digestive enzyme blend clinically shown to be more effective for maximizing protein digestion than whey protein on its own! Just shows this company is using an innovative ingredient to make its protein powder above the rest! Give it a try!",

I've only tried the chocolate flavor, but it's literally the best tasting chocolate protein I've ever had. Great consistency, 25g protein, BCAAs and EAAs, and ProHydrolase enzyme to speed up digestion. Very high-quality product with the same full label disclosure and Micropure 3rd-party testing that Kaged Muscle is known for. I refuse to buy supplements until someone can do it as well as Kris and his team do.",

      "text": "Let me start off by saying I have been using Pre-Kaged since 2015 and have been a fan of all Kaged Muscle supplements ever since. I am a Mens Physique competitor and for my prep I need an ISOLATE protein. For my first show this past March, I used ISO 100 by Dymatize. Ever since KM came out with their own Isolate I will never look back. Easy on the stomach, mixes easy and the taste is AMAZING. I purchased both Vanilla and Chocolate, both phenomenal. I have been using this protein to prep for my national show later this month. Hands down the best quality, great amount of EAAs and the best bang for the buck. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

My wife noticed the same thing. It has a noticeable chemical taste to it now. I checked the ingredients and sure enough it had changed. I love Kaged Muscle products but for me the flavor is not good any more.",
