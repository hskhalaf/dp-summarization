I would say it is more an adult size. My son is very tall for a 10 year old (closer to a 13 year old and in adult clothing/shoes) and this watch is still a very good fit and gives him room to grow in the strap. If you are looking for a little boys watch this is NOT for you, but for an older boy or teen or even a man it is great.",

I was a bit concerned at first as it seemed a bit big for him but he absolutely loves it and never takes it off! He wears it with his camo outfits, wears it to school, sports, he swims and even showers with it on! Not sure how long it will last with all this use, but it was an absolute winner and worth every penny!!",
