I use it for sun/shade because I take my dogs with me everywhere and covering the windshield from the exterior is the best cooling for them. I added a couple of magnets on the top (not necessary, but hold it snug in a breeze) and some elastic on the sides so i can fasten it inside (anti-theft - also not needed for function at the doors pin it in place). I'm so impressed with how this works I made one for the back window. I live in a very hot and dry area so can recommend for sun (don't know about snow).",
