Initially, I received 1 defective lock in my 2-pack, but I reached out to Puroma, and they offered a refund or replacement. Since I do need the locks, I chose a replacement and they promptly sent it to me, no hassles. Awesome and friendly customer service. I'd buy from them again just because of that.

As previously stated this is a great item (while it works). Easy to set up and even easier to use. The customer service is great as well. I am glad I gave this seller and item a second chance.",
