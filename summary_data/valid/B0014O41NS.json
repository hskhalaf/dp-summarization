Without the Zookeeper, I would have been much more nervous during our adventure. It only took me about 10 minutes from opening the package to completing installation in my car. I did add a couple of extra bungees to further secure the bottom to the car. My tethered, secured dogs could see me, which made them feel better, and they couldn't distract me, which made me feel better! I even found a way to attach a water dish so they could drink between stops. Highly recommend!",

Make sure it will fit your vehicle properly (the fault not of the barrier, but vehicle design in my case).",

My dog can escape from just about anything and it did not take him too long to figure this out. I followed the instructions from other reviewers and bungied these at the bottom to keep it in place. It is easy to put together. You know your own dog and if they normally get out and escape things expect the same result with this.",
