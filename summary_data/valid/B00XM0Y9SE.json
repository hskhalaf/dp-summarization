It's definitely the lauric acid, which means this product is on the cheaper spectrum of MCTs",

Easily pours from the container and I have never received a damaged container or a surprise in the shipping container, so the shipping process works as well as the product. MCT Oil mixes well with a good morning tea or good night tea including smoothies. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to gain an extra edge in their supplement routine.",

Fats with ten links [C10] or less use this trap-door entrance to slide into our bloodstream and rapidly convert to ketones.2 links long [C12] \u2013 too big to slide through the trap-door entrance. This manufacturer does not have any info about how many chains their MCT is. They do not answer their phone and they have not responded to my email. BUYER BEWARE",

Many people have reviewed that it causes them to have bowel changes, but personally I haven't experienced any of that maybe because I consume this in small doses at a time.",
