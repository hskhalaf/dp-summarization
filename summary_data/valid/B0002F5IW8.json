She previously had been using an Etude flute, which is a great beginner flute, however, was having some issues holding certain notes due to wear and tear. Bottom line, my child needed something a step up, and this flute was not only affordable, but was absolutely perfect, right out of the box. Very professionally made, actual cork, and beautiful sounding notes. My child's music teacher at school is very happy with the selection and so far so good, a month into use. The flute comes with a very nice carrying case and registrations paperwork and a fair warranty. Cleaning kit sold separately.",

Owning made more sense to us than the rent to own deal through Marshalls as it will save about 60% of the rent to own price. It is brand new with warranty.",

But normally, a student flute of these two brand costs $500-600 after discount. I was excited when I found this one with such low price (of course, it may not be the same model they showed me in the store.) It is so beautiful,and comes with a three year warranty. I asked my friend who had been playing flute for many many years to try it for me. She said this flute was excellent. I strongly recommended this one!",
