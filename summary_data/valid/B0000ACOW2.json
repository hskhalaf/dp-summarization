      "text": "This WAS a good printer when it was introduced in 2004. However, HP has discontinued the production AND the support/drivers for this unit. Their last driver was written for Windows XP. There were some workarounds using the PhotoSmart 330 drivers that would work with Windows 7. Windows 10 is a complete bust with the 245. The printer will work fine without a computer just by printing images off an SD memory card (NO USB ports on the printer however).",

I photograph small items in macro conditions that are used for insurance appraisals and this printer fits the bill. Set-up is fast and easy and printing time (in color - hi-res) is plenty fast for my tastes. The included software for the PC allows you to print out anything from wallet to 4x6\" prints with just the click of a button. If you don't want to use a PC, loading pictures directly from you media card or from the camera directly is a breeze. Excellent printer for someone on the go!!",

      "text": "I have had this for about a year - great looking results, especially if corrected and printed from a good software package. The stickiness problem seems insurmountable. I have tried several different papers and drying times up to 3 weeks, but they will always stick to photo album transparent material (have tried several brands). I wish HP would sought this problem out - also occurs with prints from other HP printer models. Finally bought a Cannon Selphy dye-sub printer which does not have this problem.",

At first I thought it was because I either framed them or put them in an album before they had a chance to dry. I then printed some and let them sit out to dry for weeks and the photos never dried. Any photos that I have framed eventually stick to the glass, particularily the darker spots of the photo. I even got a new printer from HP and still encountered the same problem...has anyone else had this problem? (Yes I am using the correct HP paper and ink)",

Then it started giving an erroneous 'print jam' error when in fact there was nothing causing the jam. HP said to return to store for new or refund. I keep wondering when HP is going to fix this problem?",
