I have been working and pumping since he was 2 months old. I discovered that this manual pump produced the most milk in the least amount of time when combined with compressions. I will add that I have rather large breasts and nipples and other pumps were just not a good fit, but this one was perfect for me!",

I've tried everything to get it to work but it barely feels like a tickle when i try to use it. It's disappointing to know that a product with so much initial promise has failed miserably, especially when needed most. I've resorted to finally splurging and investing in an electric pump. It's true when they say \"buy cheap; buy twice\". I no longer recommend this pump.",

Hard to explain but you can\u2019t really control the speed of this pump. Better off hand expressing. I threw away the pump part and kept the bottle.",

I don't worry about any parts staying wet as they all come apart and are open and I can leave it out drying until I need it next. Suction is great and my daughter loves Nuk nipples so this was a great purchase for us. Bottle is cute as well. I personally don't like the silicone guard and just use it without.",

I don't pump for work so I only used this for when I was engorged or my son didn't fully empty at a feeding. 6 months later it served its purpose. After using this, I would never buy a pump without a silicone cover that suctions against you so you don't have to press so hard against your breast to create closure.",

It comes with a silicone insert, but it doesn't work if you use it, because air goes in between the insert and the flange. It is also loud, so if you are trying to be discreet, I would recommend a different one. It's also not very comfortable to use, and unlike others, you cannot completely take it apart, so Im not confident it's clean.",

    "description": "NUK EXPRESSIVE MANUAL BREAST PUMP\nBreastfeeding is the most natural choice for feeding your baby, but it is not always convenient or possible. The NUK Expressive Manual Breast Pump is designed for occasional use when traveling away from home or as a back-up to your electric breast pump. It lets you control both suction and speed in order to customize your own level of personal comfort for efficient milk flow. The pump handle is ergonomically designed to minimize hand fatigue while pumping. The pump is also small, portable, and discreet for use anywhere at any time.\n\nview larger view larger CUSTOMIZE YOUR SUCTION AND SPEED\nControl the suction and speed that you need with easy, one-handed pumping. Press down faster on the handle to help promote let-down when you first start pumping, then change to slower presses on the handle after let-down to better mimic baby\u2019s deep suckling once your breast milk is flowing.\n\nMASSAGING BREAST CUSHION FOR LET-DOWN\nThe pump features a soft breast cushion with massaging rings for comfort. The shape of the cushion molds perfectly to the shape of your breast to help stimulate let-down and efficient flow of milk while pumping.\n\nERGONOMIC HANDLE FOR COMFORT\nThe ergonomic handle is designed to align closer to the milk collection bottle while pumping. This helps to minimize your hand fatigue and create a more comfortable experience while pumping with one hand.\n\nMADE WITH FEW PARTS\nThe pump is easy to clean (hand wash or dishwasher) and assemble because it has few parts. To start pumping, just ensure the breast pump shield with valve is properly connected to the milk collection container.\n\nWHAT\u2019S IN THE BOX\n * One NUK Expressive Manual Breast Pump\n * 5oz Breast Milk Container with Silicone Nipple Size 1 (slow flow)\n * Collar, Cap, and Seal Disk for Storage\n * Container Stand, and Extra Silicone Valve\n\nview larger AT A GLANCE\n * Customize the suction and speed\n * Soft, massaging breast cushion helps stimulate let-down\n * Ergonomic handle minimizes hand fatigue\n * Easy to clean (handwash or dishwash)\n * Only a few parts to assemble\n * Convenient, compact handheld design\n * BPA free\n * Assembled in USA",
