These features lend to a great wind breaker. The vest is cut nicely so it gives it a fem look. I am 5''2' and an average size 10-12 and the medium gives room for a sweater underneath. Comes with a packable bag. Less one star for the gold finish. I did order it because I wanted a versatile vests with gold tone zippers. Yet the gold finish too bright rather than a more subtle brass tone.",

It's very comfortable and lightweight, which I love. The zipper is total crap. It's a plastic zipper that is painted on the front to look like metal, which really makes it difficult to zip at times because it gets caught on itself. Super dumb, cheap zipper makes an otherwise pretty lovely vest one that I rarely reach for. The only reason I didn't return it is because I'm lazy.",

Cons: don't especially like the bright gold zippers and front zipper sticks a little. But like the pros enough that I bought 2 - black and blue. I wish a gray one with silver zippers were available.",

I've worn it with jeans and with leggings when I go work out or do hikes. It's a little pricey, but worth it! I totally recommend.",
