The other product that is extremely similar to this is Burnout, but this is basically the same thing and it's cheaper if you get this 6 oz bottle. For my face, water activities or not, I use Badger or Raw Elements. For non-water activities, I use Beauty By Earth. It's not waterproof at all, but it's nice and simple. Don't buy any titanium dioxide stuff. It's not as good as just pure zinc.",

I prefer ThinkBaby, as it smells nicer and is more easily absorbed into the skin.\"",

The smell is amazing too - this is my new favorite and we've tried a LOT!",

Kids barely got any tan while we were there on vacation for a week. I was so very relieved. I'll definitely be buying this again and again.",

This sunscreen though is definitely one I would at least try if your child has eczema.",

As a company, Thinkbaby targets products containing questionable ingredients and develops safer alternatives. We led the movement from BPA, with the 1st BPA-free baby bottle (2006) to the 1st insulated BPA-free sports bottle (2006). We brought the same focus to developing body care and sun care products. None of our products have ever contained avobenzone, oxybenzone, parabens, phthalates, PABA, or 1,4 dioxane, to name a few of the chemicals of concern.\n\nAt SPF 50+ with broad-spectrum protection for UVA and UVB, and the highest water resistance allowed by the FDA, you can expect a highly effective solution for your littles and whole family. We are strictly against the use of aerosols due to inhalation concerns to the effectiveness and safety for users and the environment. Our mineral based (zinc oxide) formulations go on smooth and absorb easily without leaving you feeling sticky or goopy.\n\nThinkbaby Safe Sunscreen has received a large amount of awards and has been featured in a tremendous number of publications including: Allure, Martha Stewart, New York Times, POPSUGAR, Travel & Leisure, The Bump, FoodBabe, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Natural Child, Whole Living, FitPregnancy, Baby List, Pregnancy & Newborn, and Parents to name a few.\n\nMember of: Sun Safety Coalition, Safe Sun Council, Safe Cosmetics Campaign.",
