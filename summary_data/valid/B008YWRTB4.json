The secret is in the rice, make sure to follow the directions on the box and spread it thin if you're using a lot of filling. I found their rice recipe was a bit too sweet so I cut the sugar level to 1/8th cup and it was still plenty sticky. I've also started adding about 1 tsp better than bullion to the after rice cook mix, it gives the rice a nice hint of meat without the meat.",

I also added black sesame seeds to the outside of one and a very inexpensive black caviar to another. My guests and husband were all amazed!",

The directions were clear, it was easy to use, and we had a blast making sushi at home. We picked up all of our fish at the local Whole Foods and it worked out great.",

Also the tool which allows you to cut the sushi roll into circles doesn't let you let go of the roll very easily. Sometimes the roll will tear or come apart because you are trying to open the bottom part wide enough for the sushi roll to come out.",

    "description": "We designed our kit so everyone can make a sushi roll the very first time. We took all the guess work out of it. The hardest thing to do as a beginner is to spread the right amount of rice. That's why we designed our training frame which measures exactly the amount of rice you need to make a perfect role. We also designed our non-stick rice paddle to help you spread the rice along the training frame. The last thing you need as a beginner is dealing with sticky rice all over your fingers as your trying to spread the rice. Then once the roll is made, cutting the roll evenly can be challenging for beginners. So we created the SushiQuik Roll Cutter which let's you evenly cut your rolls while saving your fingers. To enjoy your rolls, we turned the end caps into soy sauce holders! And then once your done having your sushi party, we designed the rolling mat to snap apart so that you can easily place it in the dishwasher along with your silverware. Our whole kit is dishwasher safe, so no worries! We know you will love this kit. The whole family will have fun making sushi!",
