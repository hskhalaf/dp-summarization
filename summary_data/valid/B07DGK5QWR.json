The small is fantastic for getting your speed built up once familiar with your striking. The medium bag provides a considerable amount more resistance building more strength in your punches. I highly recommend both sizes. Some people have expressed concern over the latex bladder leaking down more frequently than the traditional rubber. I have not found this to be an issue at all.",
