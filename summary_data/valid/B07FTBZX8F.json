I tested in on our sink right away. Knocked some of the nasty mold right out. My wife used it to clean the entire bathroom and she said it worked very well. I have no problems at all with it. It does what it says it does and it is very affordable. I recommend.",

Inside . 3rd to get a good steam pressure I would have to wait for a minute to get another burst of pressure. So overall for the price I bought is good n handy for small spot cleaning or in kitchen or bathroom",

It is light weight, but you may need an extension cord. The cord is long enough to do most rooms, but for larger rooms you will have to move it to different outlets or use and extension cord.",
