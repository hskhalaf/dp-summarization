      "text": "Guitar sounds nice and keeps tune well. Perfect for a beginner. The mahogany dampens some of the high frequency vibes that the spruce topped version has, so I think the overall sound is a little richer. The kit is nice, since it comes with a set of crappy strings on the guitar and a set of decent strings to re-string with after some learning has occurred. I wish it came with a hard case or a stand as the soft gig bag is not ideal for storage when not in use, but you can't have it all. And at this price point, it's easy enough to add a $20 stand or $50 case to the Amazon shopping cart.",

I am hopeful I can come back and re-star it. The buy experience was great/ A follow-up on customer satisfaction was sent which says to me they are customer oriented which means a great deal to me.
