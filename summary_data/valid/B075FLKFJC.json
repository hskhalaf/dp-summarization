The quality is fantastic and the black leather with red stitching would\u2019ve gone great with my red leather with black stitching. Would\u2019ve fit my Turvis and my Yeti with only a slight wobble, but appeared that it would\u2019ve been sturdy enough to maintain through turns and hard brakes. Too big to put on drivers side with my bucket seats in a 2006 GTO, but probably workable in a larger sedan, SUV, or van.",

The color and red deviated stitching on the insert matches beautifully with the Porsche interior. Quality construction! Any non-Porsche person looking inside the car would never know this was an aftermarket item. My passengers say there is no restriction on their seating area, but when I sit in the passenger seat, the side of the insert is pressing up against my left leg, but no problem, because I'm the driver! There is plenty of space to allow seat belt access. I am well pleased!",

The insert is also slanted in such a way that I may not be able to put carry out cups in there, for fear of spilling. However, this maybe fixed by adjusting the passenger seat height. I will have to play around with that. Overall, very happy.",
