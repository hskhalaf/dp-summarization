On tour buses there is never any place to put stuff like drink, snack, books, maps, iPad,phone etc. This worked great. Loved it. It is not long, so doesn't get in the way of the knees in the tight spaces. Pockets open wide and held two of the big insulated stainless steel drinking glasses. No more turned over drinks! I am going on a longer trip next year and am ordering more for Christmas gifts for my travel buddies!",

We have five kids so I purchased some of these for the kids while on road trips since they always tend to lose something, whether it be a hand game game cartridge, cell phone, book, etc. This is great to help them keep and organize their stuff in a central location. It does not interfere with the head space of the person sitting in the seat in front. It's easily to assemble and take down. I'm guessing you could wash with warm soap and water and air dry as well.",
