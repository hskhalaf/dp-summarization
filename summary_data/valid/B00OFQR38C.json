Following other reviewers advice I did not upgrade to Windows 10 and to working fine. ***Make sure that you download the nvidia drivers manually as your graphics card won't be recognized otherwise and update the Asus bios. After that Restart, so that the drivers will work. After that should be good to go and happy gaming.",

I installed some required updates and the update stopped my display through the hdmi. This problem was easily fixed but buying a DVI to HDMI adapter and has run perfectly ever since. This pc runs everything great, Photoshop, illustrator, ark, CS , skyforge, you should have no problems with demanding graphics. All in all I give a 4 star because of the trouble I had at the beginning but the pros definitely out weigh the cons.",

Called nvidia, spoke with tech rep, seems they have had issues with this gpu for a while now since late 2013. Their tech rep said its either a hit or miss with this gpu sadly mine is a miss. I will be returning this since opening the shell can void warranties. Wish I could replace but Amazon only will refund. I will try again with this little bundle. Works great and very powerful!
