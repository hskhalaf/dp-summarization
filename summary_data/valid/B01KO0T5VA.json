Cartridges don't last as long as advertised. NFC doesn't work (or mine was faulty) The app has no troubleshooting features. The app has no way of seeing dates of photos, if that's important to you as it is to me. Item returned due to being faulty and not working as advertise.",

I also think the time it takes (which really, isn't very long at all) is worth it because the clarity and coloration of the photos are beautiful. That'll definitely depend on the quality of the photo when it was taken, but so far they have loved this printer.",
