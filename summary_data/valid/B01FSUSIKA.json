Having read the reviews, I felt This was the test for me. Am I glad I did! This test confirmed what I have thought all along - I am not the father, with the chance being 0.00% and performed the test twice for accuracy. They sent me an email confirming that they received the kit and then another email with the results only a few days later, even though it fell through the Thanksgiving holiday period! Their customer service was excellent. Megan was very courteous and friendly. Highly recommended!",

The extra cost was worth it. We mailed off our test the Friday before a long, holiday weekend and got the result the following Friday. This means the lab had to have turned around the results within 1-3 days. Be sure to tape the DNA sample envelope instead of licking. If you forget this and lick it to seal it, there's an extra envelope and swab so you can redo it. Highly recommend this product.",
