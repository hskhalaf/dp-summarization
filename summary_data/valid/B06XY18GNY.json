In terms of comfort I think I will try to find some insoles that work with these since the current insole is pretty flat, comparable to converse. Visually they were perfect and unworn right out of the box, thankfully. Size down half a size and you will be happy, and as other people said these shoes are better for normal/wide feet.",

I sized up from my usual 37 (6.5 US) this time-I typically buy the women\u2019s 2750-and have significantly more room in the width but the length difference is negligible. My feet measure a 6.5E in standard US (5.5Y, 4.5UK) and I usually buy a 7B and modify.

I would buy them in multiple colors if they offered a true wide width sizing option.",
