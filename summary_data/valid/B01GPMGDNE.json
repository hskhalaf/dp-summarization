I had foot surgery several years ago, so I have to be careful to buy shoes with good arch support. These are comfortable and they look good. My only complaint would be the color. The pair I bought a couple years ago were more of a light teal color. The current color is closer to neon green, which I don't like as much. But these are great shoes and even with my foot problems I can wear them comfortably for hours.",

I do have a wider foot so instead of going with the 10.5, I went with the 11 and it fits beautifully. Literally perfect. The shoe itself looks just like it does in the picture, no color distortiins or anything. I have big feet and like that the shoe doesn't make your foot look huge. They feel extremely comfortable, have good shock resistance (such a fan of the micro G for this). I haven't tried a full run on the streets yet but running on the treadmill and workouts in the gym are awesome.",
