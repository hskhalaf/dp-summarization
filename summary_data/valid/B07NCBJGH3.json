I hope they are aware that some of their boxes may have maggots in them, and also that means wherever they are packing them, there are maggots. Very disgusting experience. I got some good pulls though from the pack, minus the maggot pull.",

It's high-quality, well-designed, and the accessories are a nice bonus: pin, pad of paper, and sticker sheet, all of a Detective Pikachu theme. The Detective Pikachu themed booster packs are 4 cards each, the rest are standard 10-card booster packs. This makes an excellent option for carrying your favorite decks, and is also big enough to carry a lunch or something similar.",

This also came with a Pikachu themed notepad and stickers, which she loved. High value for someone who benefits from the added content. Not cost effective for someone trying to get the best bang for their buck on boosters, though.",
