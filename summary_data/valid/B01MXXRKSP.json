Big stuff comes off, but the chicken/meat residue on the inner blades does not come off BECAUSE you cannot reach the inner blades... No release to allow bottom plate to come-off, so you have to snake cleaning cloth between blades. THIS is almost impossible to do without a manic personality, maybe not even then! Didn't use till this weekend and past my return date otherwise I would return. Too bad because it tenderizes very well.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been using this tenderizer for almost 5 months now. It initially worked great. As time went on, the tenderizer would get stuck in the down position, especially on thick cuts of meat. I was forced to constantly hold a butter knife in the other hand to force in between the blades and plastic platform, just to get the device to release the meat. This made the process difficult and time consuming. I finally gave up and bought another type.",

The device is easy to use (but very dangerous so please use caution), and comes with a handy plastic cover for the bottom end. I do recommend looking up videos on how to properly use it first though.",

By using the tenderizer after you season your steak of favorite meat, it helps push the seasoning inside and make the meat more flavorful. This type of tenderizer is so much easier to use than the hammer type, it more evenly flattens and aerates.This product does have 48 very sharp blades and you should be careful with them! I am very happy that this is Dishwasher safe, cleaning is easy and storage after is as well. This tenderizer does come with a cover to protect the blades when not in use. This is a well made item and should last many years around my kitchen",
