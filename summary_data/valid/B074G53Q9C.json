You can\u2019t just turn it inside out because the seams from around the pillow case would show. Because I know how to sew, I just took it apart & fixed it myself. With that being said for me personally I still thought $70 for an entire Cal King set is a great deal. It also fits nicely.",

Keep that in mind. My former bedding outfit looked identical but was much heavier than this one, so it was an adjustment. Also, the sheets have pockets. We don\u2019t use them because we charge our phones at night and don\u2019t feel comfortable putting them in cloth sheets in case of overheating. Overall, gorgeous bedding though!",

I'd definitely want it in more colors Update: The last 2 pics are what I found after sleeping on the sheets one night. Balls of lint everywhere!

      "title": "thin \"whispy\" material",
      "text": "The material is so thin it's actually difficult to put the pillow case on a pillow! And it's so shear any color on the pillowcase (like blue lines or gold/yellow cord) shows through. I've had to buy a whole set of white pillow cases to put underneath them to be able to use them. And it turns out the pinched/crunched design just makes the bed look messy even when it's made, because the material is so whispy it wrinkles! I'm rating this 3 stars though because the price is really low and I like the dust ruffle. Will spend the money and buy something more robust next time.",
