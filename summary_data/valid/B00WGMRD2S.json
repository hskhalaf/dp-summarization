If you enjoy the feel and sound of the bass in your music, these headphones are excellent.

      "text": "These started out okay for the first couple of times, but have got progressively worse. After wearing them twice they moulded to the shape of my head, I am not sure if they are meant to do this but now I feel like they could snap at any point, and makes it so uncomfortable for anyone else to wear. Not that anyone can even use them now as they wont even connect to my phone which is extremely frustrating when at the gym, and even when they did work they cut out all the time. I wouldn't mind so much if this was after a year or so but I have only worn them a few times.",

Both earpieces are also cracking badly as soon as you turn them on and sound, when you does play for the brief period is distorted. Should be under 12 months warranty but don't know how to return them through Amazon Prime?",
