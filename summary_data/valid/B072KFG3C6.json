The available width options and the lightweight and breathable characteristics of the footwear were also received well. However, there were a few shoppers who thought that the wide version was still too narrow and that the foam insert was subpar. But in the end, it came highly recommended by those who are always on their feet because of the comfort it provided.",

I can order Rykas and know that they will be comfortable and fit. I no longer haven\u2019t to try on dozens of shoes at multiple stores to find shoes that actually fit and at a reasonable price. Just a bit disappointed that the memory foam foot liner is thinner and inferior to the ones in my Ryka \u201cHailey\u201d training shoe that I purchased in December of 2016. I will definitely purchase Rykas again, although I\u2019ll have buy a replacement foot liner for this pair and the next if they don\u2019t improve the quality.",
