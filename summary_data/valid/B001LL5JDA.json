Great material and it's nice that they send a HDMI cable with it, never hurts to have an extra one of those. Downside is that one of the mount bolts was bent and I was not about to put it in the wall through the mount. Fortunately the 2 other bolts were strong enough to hold up my tv. Would have been nice to have the 3rd bolt for extra stability but I feel like the 2 will suffice. Recommend for sure but kind of a bummer about the bolt",

The bottom hole of the mount is slotted, which allows for vertical adjustment. There's no other adjustment necessary. The rest of the assembly is obvious.

      "text": "Overall, I was fairly pleased with this mount once it was installed. The arm extends easily and is helpful when wiring components. Installation was less pleasing though, as the hardware that comes with the mount is of extremely low quality. The bolts holding the mount to the wall begin to round almost immediately and ended in a few bloodied knuckles. Additonally, the pieces holding the angle adjustment can come loose if you aren't careful and are very difficult to retighten fully. Despite the frustrating installation, the mount seems very secure now holding a 32\" TV. The product included a ton of hardware for mounting different sized TVs or monitors and was very well packaged with clear instructions.",

I'm incredibly impressed and will likely buy another for the next new tv. Little bit of work to Install and now cant remember how to get the old tv down. But I give this high recommendation.",

      "text": "Worked perfectly with my new Sony XBR55X850D (55\") TV. Easy to install, fits pretty tight to the wall, allows the TV to be tilted, or remain parallel to the wall. I don't use the articulating arm feature often, but it sure is great when I need to access the connections on the back of the TV. I recently installed a 2nd XBR55 in my guest room with a fixed Cheetah mount and am regretting it. Not horrible, but assembly and mounting was harder and a non-articulating mount makes access to the back a real hassle. I will go with the VideoSecu for any future flat panel mountings.",

This mount has a nice low profile, so your TV isn't sticking off of the wall like a sore thumb. I will definitely buy again when we redo our living room!

This defeats the purpose. I cannot return it because I got rig of all the packaging. Ugh. A waste of $58.",

      "text": "That\u2019s right - that tiny level I don\u2019t have is included. Solid and well made. Includes pads in case the screws are too long. Many screws for different TVs which is a bonus. Thank haven\u2019t gotten it up yet - my son has my good drill. That brat! I\u2019m going to hang a little 32\u201d tv on it in my room and it swivels well. It\u2019s a bit stiff, probably because it\u2019s new......if it\u2019s still stiff to turn after a while - there\u2019s always WD-40 right? The directions are great and simple - and the font is big enough I didn\u2019t even have to hunt down a pair of glasses (which were on my head anyway).",
