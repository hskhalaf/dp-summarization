There are two (belt driven) speeds: 1500 and 3000 SFPM. This basically limits the bandsaw to cutting wood and some plastics. The speeds are simply too fast for cutting metal. That said - I have cut Aluminum using the machine, but the blade essentially gets dull fast. All in all though, I\u2019m satisfied with the machine and it\u2019s build quality.",

Making the guide adjustments is a little awkward on the guides located on the under-side of the table, but otherwise most adjustments are relatively easy to make. Blades changes are quick and tension and tracking adjustments are simple. Overall this is an excellent saw.",

I hope the seller will get back to me and help me fix this problem, until then back into the box it goes.",

The only draw back is part of the product description i.e. 'Blade Size L x W x Thickness in. 93-105 x 1/8-3/4, ' based on this I ordered three blades in length of 97 3/4\" which falls within the 93-105 length as stated, however, it is not long enough. For those who are looking at purchasing this saw, I highly recommend it but I suggest you wait until you have the saw and measure the factory installed blade length before purchasing any blades.",

Although longer than 'normal' blades are required, I prefer the saw being designed for that much capacity over adding a riser block. I think the fewer connection points there are, the less that any flexing can occur. The capacity, combined with the larger motor than 'usual' for a fourteen inch saw will allow me to resaw larger width pieces easier than a 'lesser' saw.",

What I'm trying to say is this thing will last you forever because of the weight of the frame. If space is issue, get the rolling frame, works great.

Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nJWBS-14DXPRO 14-Inch Deluxe Pro Band Saw, base, trunnion, table, and instructions\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe all-new JWBS-14D by PRO 14-Inch Deluxe Bandsaw from JET has been fully redesigned to meet the needs of today's most demanding woodworkers.
