There is one design flaw that sort of changes my plans for its use. The hinges are in the way if one wants to haul plastic storage boxes or larger boxes. Round things fit well, and smaller or things put in the bag would work. I wanted to use it like a dolly, it is limited. The platform and space between the hinges is only 16 1/2 inches. I wanted it to move my big heavy sewing machine that is over 20 inches wide.",

It was already a problem because it would fold up while it was being used, for no reason. Worked well when it was working except for the folding up.

I suspect that I will have to replace the wheels one of these days, but it works so well for stairs and moving things inside, that I am not really complaining. Just know that if you have a gravel driveway or paths, it will be harder to pull and will probably stress the wheels into a somewhat early failure. That is NOT a deal breaker for me. :)",
