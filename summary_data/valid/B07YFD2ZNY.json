Assembly was pretty difficult husband and I had a hard time as it seemed like some of the parts didn't fit well and we almost couldn't break it down after that. It came packed in the travel bag with what felt like a million zip ties to keep it compact, and because of this, when we tried to pack it back into the track bag, we couldn't compact it enough to get it zipped all the way. Other than the assembly I'm happy with the purchase and can't wait to use it for baby girl.",

There was still a 10-in gap between my mattress and the baby's mattress when on the tallest setting! Also worth noting that there are only wheels on two, so those do absolutely nothing.",

We have our bed and box spring on the floor so we needed a bassinet that had legs that did not need to go under the bed, could change the level to match our beds heighth, and had a side that went down for easy access/ simulated co-sleeping. Only complaint is that the front legs that fold in to get closer to the bed seem to be spring loaded. So you cant lock them back. Its not super bad, just somewhat annoying.
