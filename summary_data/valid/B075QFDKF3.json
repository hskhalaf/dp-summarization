That is definitely not an issue with these paints. While I am only an amateur artist at best, I know these paints are high quality. The colors definitely mix well together to create the exact shade you want. After purchasing this set, I am definitely interested in purchasing the other two palettes by ZenART. It's clear the creators put a lot of thought and work into creating these palette sets to create paints that will work for all types of artists and paintings.",

This set is definitely for old master painting with good earth colors. But the paint itself is creamy and nice. Just remove that little plastic devil!!!!! LOL",

      "text": "My teens have been honing their art skills in various media and wanted to try oil painting. This beautiful palette is a lovely way for them to dabble without breaking the bank. On first impression, the tubes are surprisingly large - so often sets like this LOOK like a great deal but are practically sample size on the inside. Not so - these are full size tubes of paint. When we opened it up, the paints are very smooth and spread quite evenly. I will admit to being a complete novice when it comes to oil paints, so this set has been a lovely introduction.",

      "text": "Beautiful, rich colors and a smooth, creamy texture make these oil paints a delight to work with. These are a fantastic buy as the tubes are the perfect size for my travel easel. The paints that came with the easel were in tiny tubes and were improperly sealed. That meant that by the time I got to them, they were dry. ZenART knows what they are doing and each color is properly plugged to ensure they arrive ready to use with no wasteful drying. I also like the company's philosophy and how they tie infinity \u221e into their concept.",

I\u2019m giving it 5 stars because I like the product and I only find it difficult to dig up where in their site they offer the mixing advice when using the portrait set. Also, their customer support is exceptional, they reached out to me and asked me how I was doing with my set and finally mailing a free sketchbook as a bonus. Lovely oil paints!",

The handout also has the colors names as well as the opacity pigment code and Light fastness. This set would be good for if you're wanting to paint any Landscapes or nature type pictures. This would be a good set for anyone weather just starting or adding to your collection. Once our piece is done we are working on we will update with another photo to show off the beautiful colors of the collection.",
