      "text": "This is a truly terrible camera and I would not suggest it for anyone, even someone with a very low budget. I have had so many cameras that are SO MUCH BETTER in terms of quality. The Kodak Easyshare puts this to shame, as did a little $70 Olympus point and click I once had. The look of it implies it will provide a more professional image, but that's just smoke and mirrors marketing. This camera SUCKS. I should have known to not buy a camera from GE! These days, I actually prefer to use my cell over this, which says a lot about what a piece of junk it is.",

      "text": "Really amazing camera, has a ton of features and the optical lens is unreal, you can get some really nice close ups and still be standing far away. Need to get a memory card for real picture taking as the internal memory is only 32mbs. Nowhere in the manual did it mention what the internal memory, once I hooked it up to the computer is how I found out. If you accidentally leave the lens cap on the camera tells you to remove it so you don't have pictures of it. All around great camera for the money, comparable cameras with this optical lens are upwards of $200, so the price on this camera is excellent.",

      "text": "I enjoyed this camera - while it lasted. Bought it just before taking back to back cruises. It took great pictures, and the zoom was a huge step up from anything I'd used before. Unfortunately, after a just 7 days and about 3200 pictures, the camera started giving an error message about the lens being stuck, and turning itself off. Various solutions found online were unable to remedy the problem. I feel like I got my moneys worth as far as it goes, but it was very disappointing that it didn't last longer.",
