They are really nice as nurse's shoes. I have worn my first pair 5 days a week for over a year and they're still in excellent condition. I just wanted a new color and was happy to see them on Amazon.",

The memory foam padding makes the shoe seem smaller at first probably, especially around the heel area. Be sure to fit your heel in proper place, lace, then stand to see where your big toe is. If the big toe it sits less than a thumbnail close to the end of the shoe, then the shoe is probably too small. Love the color, comfort, value, and plan on buying another pair in a different color. Great item! Bought them for my everyday walking around/errand shoes.",

Smaller in the toes than I would\u2019ve liked, so if I reorder down the road I will see if they have a wider width. I always use an insole as I have high arches, so I cant say how the memory foam portion works, but the shoe has worked out well for the week now I\u2019ve been using them. Even better, there\u2019s no squeak when I walk through the rain and into work. My old tenors used to squeak badly on the tile floors, so that\u2019s a plus!",

      "text": "The brand Fila tends to be more affordable and fits my awkwardly sized feet better then any shoes out there. They also with stand the test of time and don't ware out very easily, unlike my Sketchers that get holes in them within 6 months. I love the colors options that are available and I was so excited to learn that they make slip-resistant shoes for work that aren't black.",

    "description": "Fila training shoes are versatile for athletic use in and out of the gym. Their lateral support, stability and cushion are perfect for light running, weight machines and fitness classes.\n\nFila began in 1911, in the small alpine town of Biella, Italy, a place renowned for manufacturing the world's finest textiles, and weaving fabrics with impeccable quality, true innovation and extraordinary beauty. Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inexorably derived from Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury and elegance. This is our birthright, it's in our soul, and it defines our future. We continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for our existence. We create what is desired, not what is necessary. Not just enough, but more than you need. This is Fila.",
