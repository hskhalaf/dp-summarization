The box also includes suggested workouts which I really enjoy. I would happily suggest this to my friends!",

My only recommendation for improvement would be a more comfortable, ergonomic waist belt. But I definitely still recommend as is.",

It did come with LoopBand\u2019s in three different resistance levels which is great. I\u2019d just like the clip on bands as well. The bands are covered, which is much appreciated so I don\u2019t get \u201cband burns.\u201d This totally makes for a great booty and leg workout. Highly recommended!",

I\u2019d found some exercises online and am pleased with everting about them. Sturdy and well made. Anyway, they saw my message and sent me a whole new boxed set with all the pieces included. The illustrated exercise guide gives me way more to work with ina. Comprehensive space. A true value and good company. Thank you!",

I was worried it would be flimsy or that I\u2019d have fear of it breaking when I stretched it out, but this thing is solidly made.

That and it hurts my knee, catching when the band does not stretch that final fraction. Is there a solution, as I believe it should work.",
