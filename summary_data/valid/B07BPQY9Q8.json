      "text": "I bought this computer barely a month ago, and have already suffered a hardware malfunction that has fried the motherboard. Upon contacting Dell, the only option made available was to wait for a box to be sent to me, to send the computer back to them, to be repaired. For a $1,500 computer, I expect much better from them. This is putting me out of work, which in essence doubled the cost of this computer, assuming I get it back in the estimated week they offered. Frankly, I find it incredible they can\u2019t offer anything more customer-friendly for a computer that is 5 weeks old, and cost this much.",

There are some things that concerns me a bit, it gets too warm while running it, sometimes it makes a beep sound and freezes out of nowhere. The last thing was solved by contacting dell and changing the configuration. If you are looking for a laptop to carry around with you, this is not it! Its pretty heavy.",
