Original review; It's expensive. It didn't keep my cats from fighting. I combined it with the smelly cat-hormone collar. No success. Currently taming feral kittens and set this up in their room after they'd been in captivity for about a week. No difference in their behavior. The area is well under the square footage limit. The final word is: Meh.",

I surely wished this product did work...we do use catnip, which helps. The one good thing, this product is more affordable through Amazon Prime, than at Petco/Petsmart or Walmart...Thank you Amazon Prime for keeping prices real (affordable).",

No way these things last 30 days. Not sure if they are working yet which is why I'm giving it 3 star instead of 2. But this would get very expensive having to change out twice a month. I guess on the refill I'll have to take a sharpie and mark it to see how long it lasts per week. But I have less than 1/4 left after 2 weeks. I tried these a few years ago. I think this is why I stopped.",

The Feliway refills that go with the room diffuser and the spray on the towels and even on our hands has been a bit hit with the cats and with their owners.",

By the second day, both cats were lounging close to the plug in, content and quiet. They now regularly lounge in the room and have not peed or marked. The bad news is they have chosen a new spot to mark so I will be getting more for other areas.",
