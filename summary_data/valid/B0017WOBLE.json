I also use their quick change extentions (sweet). These work better for fine work where you need a cleaner hole. like drilling through cabinets and such.. less catastrophic blowout. I use them with my old D handle right angle drill from 20 years ago.. Maybe ill buy one of the new SuperHawgs when they have a promotion at my local Plumbing supply house.",

    "description": "The product is easy to use\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nMilwaukee Electric Tool Corporation introduces Ice Hardened hole saws, a new generation of hole saws that offer up to 50% longer life than the competition and are ideal for metal and wood cutting in a wide variety of HVAC, electrical, plumbing and maintenance/repair applications. Milwaukee Ice Hardened products utilize a proprietary cryogenic hardening process that improves upon traditional heat treat processes. Unlike surface coatings that wear away, cryogenics harden to the core by minimizing soft metal (austenite) and creating more hard metal (martensite). The result is a product that is more consistently hard throughout, resulting in life up to 50% longer than the competition. Milwaukee Ice Hardened hole saws also feature Matrix II bi-metal construction for greater durability and a unique precision-ground tooth geometry for faster cutting. A positive rake angle cuts more aggressively while deeper gullets quickly remove chips. A radiused back face reduces stress on the teeth, ensuring that the blade delivers optimum life and speed. Functional slot geometry allows for a standard slotted screwdriver to fit completely underneath the plug for easier plug removal. Kit Includes: Twenty-two (22) hole saws: 3/4\", 7/8\", 1\", 1-1/8\", 1-1/4\", 1-3/8\", 1-1/2\", 1-3/4\", 2\", 2-1/8\", 2-1/4\", 2-1/2\", 2-5/8\", 3\", 3-1/4\", 3-3/8\", 3-5/8\", 3-3/4\", 4-1/8\", 4-1/4\", 4-1/2\", 4-3/4\"; Three (3) arbors: 49-56-7000, 49-56-7010, 49-56-9100; Three (3) drill bits: 49-56-8010; Space for additional hole saws",
