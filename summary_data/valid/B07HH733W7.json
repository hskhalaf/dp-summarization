Yesterday the watch started malfunctioning and freezing and had to be reset multiple times. Even after resetting the watch it still was acting glitchy but functional. This morning it started going haywire again and I noticed it hadn't charged overnight even though it had been on the charger. After a complete factory reset the watch wont even set up with Wear OS and now the battery is completely drained and can't do anything at all. Im incredibly disappointed since I was very much enjoying the watch.",

What I don't care for, but not deal breakers-the band is a little shorter than I like. I have a wider wrist, from breaking it, and would have like just an inch more. Also, the battery does go fast if you leave the flower screen on. But if you put battery saver mode on, battery lasts quite some time. Otherwise, just charge everyday. Love my new watch!!",

This watch filled all the checkmarks and am got it set up easily. I'm able to check my emails, messages and all other notifications easily. Not heavy and feels light when I have it on. I like the fact that I can change the interface or the look of the watch easily and add more if needed. Oh yeah, its great when I use the GPS on the phone as well. This will be a good start to keep track of my workouts and hopefully keep my new years resolution! :)",

It came out of the box just as pictured. Beautiful, sleek, and elegant. All the functionality is there and easy to use. Now I am deprecating my MiBand and giving my Apple Watch to another family member. To my surprise the box already came with a charger so I am putting the extra free charger in my office.",
