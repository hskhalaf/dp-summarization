This made me doubt authenticity. THREE of the pans did NOT sit flat on my glass top stove straight out of the packaging. Light weight, for sure. Egg pan not in the set. T-Fal -fal quality has gone down the drain. I've already initiated the return. Went out this weekend and bought another set that is better quality and sits FLAT on my stovetop straight from the box. I should have listened to the one-star reviews from the get-go.",

If you do not care about using your pots and pans in the oven, this is the best non stick cookware you are going to find under the $700 price point and maybe even at all. This is NOT normal T-Fal cookware, the coating is COMPLETELY different and much more hard. I have owned a few T-Fal Ultimate products for over 7 years and have used metal on them many times, they still look and act brand new. If you are looking for a premiere set of cookware that isn't for oven cooking, look no further.",

It's also dangerous. In all my years of cooking, I've never had pans with handles and covers that get this hot. Impossible to touch without potholders....at any burner temperature. That said, the condo has a gas range; unclear if the problem would be so dramatic with electric or induction. Perhaps many of the positive comments are from reviewers with same. I'd like to donate these but hesitate to pass on a potential accident. A really bad decision to purchase.",

They heat nicely using just med/low heat and cook fairly even. A large issue for us is, they're already discolored on the bottom. They're turning white where they sit on the gas burner.

I am probably going to throw these away as donating them would only cause the same problem for some other sucker.",

I honestly didn't realize how much of a difference a pan could make... with my old pans I would turn the stove to level 4, but now I use level 2. I'm cleaning them with a soft sponge, making a point to rinse off any gristle before rubbing them. And I'm definitely seasoning after 10 uses, too, because I want these to last for a LONG time :-)",

      "text": "VERY nice set! Came in a generic Amazon box, but everything was stacked to fit perfectly, wrapped and layered individually to not scratch while shipping. Not going to lie, I bought the set to give the appearance that I\u2019m a good cook that spends ample time in the kitchen but I\u2019m just the opposite. This set does just that! Super high quality material, heavyweight, and non stick as described. I bought a stainless steel set before this one but returned it immediately because after reading more about stainless cookware. I didn\u2019t want the headache... Would absolutely buy again and recommend this 14 piece set to anyone looking to appear to be a good cook!",

The burnt stuff LITERALLY scrapes right off with no effort (It's kind of cool to watch actually :P) I wash them by hand to protect them, but they are dishwasher safe. I would highly recommend this. The price is great and the quality is excellent. Well worth the money!",
