I installed the 18.06.0-rc1 pre-release, it works great.",

I've had no reason to reboot it except for configuration changes and firmware update - Does not run hot - Looks cool and comes packaged in the nicest box I've ever seen a computer product come in Neutral: - 5 ghz signal is solid but only average strength Cons: - None so far I would recommend this product.",

I am going to try and contact the manufacturer to see if they will help me.",

The interface is accessible enough for anyone to setup in a few seconds, and the expert mode provides all the tools a power user could possibly want. Signal range and strength are excellent. What has really sold Zyxel as a brand to me, and why I really recommend them to others, is that their routers actually do real QoS right out of the box. No need to go under the hood either, the factory settings are already perfect.",
