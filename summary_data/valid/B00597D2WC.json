By far one of my favorite watches I own.",

Great looking watch, functioning timing components, and nice packaging. Of course links had to be removed to fit her wrist, but that is an easy job to perform with the right tools. For the price, it was a heck of a deal. I would definitely recommend this watch for those guys out there that want/need a gift to woo their significant other.",
