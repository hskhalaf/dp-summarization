They told me as much and then HUNG UP THE PHONE!",

      "text": "I just purchased the DPP-EX5 printer and I'm very pleased with the quality of pictures it prints. It's size it's quite portable and is very user friendly, just wasted one sheet while hooking it up on a PC. Like other opinions, I think the quality of the picture taken will determine how good the print will be. I suggest for all those interested, get a good digital camera, perhaps a Sony and then just do your shots and print them, you will be more than satisfied with this printer.",

It has so many features. You can edit your pics right on your television then print. It has many editing features as well! My only concern is that it does't come with a USB cable, but that can always be purchased at a later time. Overall, this is an excellent photo printer.",

My only wish is that Sony would make a version that can print up to 5x7, that would be so great. Even if you dont have a computer, with this you can hook it right up to your tv and use the effects and print. It can print 3x5, 4x6, and little mini stickers which are cool. The stickers are just like the ones you can make out those little booths that charge like 4 dollars. You can make your own much cheaper with this, its awsome!",

      "text": "If you have a digital camara, like photography and want really nice prints, this little marvel will do wonders for you! The advantage over traditional colour printers is the Dye-sublimation process: this means it burns your pictures into the paper instead of printing them on top of it. Result: your pictures won't fade away after 6 months! I hooked up mine to the computer so I can make slight changes in the pictures, no professional foto print store will do that for you. It's a great great printer at a very nice price.",
