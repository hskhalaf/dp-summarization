Hope they hold up and given where they are going to be located I\u2019d say they\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend for daily use of storing toys or something with wild children but as an organization piece they\u2019re great.",

Overall after two months of use, the organizer had to be thrown away because it was not durable enough to hold anything.",
