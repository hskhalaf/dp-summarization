The display is adequate to show turn-by-turn directions, and speed, distance and other Bluetooth sensor information using the CycleBike Smart app. The keyboard is very small, but the app doesn't need much user input. Using this phone for general purpose web browsing, texting or email would be tedious.",

My only complaint is battery life. Might make 2 hours from full charge at dimmest screen setting using G4 and GPS for delivering. I use a backup battery attached at all times. Phone may last about 8 hours with NO use when left on. Handsfree software malfunctions a little but I havent had any smartphone work especially well handsfree. Great phone for short term use - don't count on it for a day long hike if you aren't going to keep it off until needed.",

BUT... after a few days' honeymoon period when everything was fine, the battery sort of \"gave up\" and would go from 100% to 0% in 2-3 hours -- without me using the phone AT ALL, for ANYTHING, and with the GPS off, the \"battery saving\" on, and all other settings set to optimize battery life. That won't work under any circumstances. So, I had to return it. I was really sad. If and they improve the battery life, I will buy another one because it is truly adorable and fully functional.",

Once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier to remove. My unit included a guitar pick shaped tool to help you remove the battery cover. I think it's a newer addition as many youtube review videos make no mention of it or show it in un-boxings. Still a neat little phone.",

However I ended up returning it for a few reasons: - Battery life was terrible, even after doing everything possible to minimize battery drain. - Phone service was poor. A different phone using the same sim card got much better service. In some cases the Jelly phone got no service at all when the other phone works just fine. - The touch screen was spotty. The touch sensitivity at the bottom of the screen was poor. I regularly had to tap several times to get it to register. This happened in several different apps.",

Even without that, the fact that the company even keeps selling this model as a functional phone (which, as sold, it is not) rather than pulling them or selling with an improved battery from the get-go, makes me leery of buying from them again.",

If you use it at all, the battery drops ridiculously fast, requiring it to be charged most of a day in order to be used for 40 minutes.

Now I have the best of both worlds, no social media of any kind, but have access to a smartphone with all of its bells and whistles. I can talk, text and use the apps just like a full-size phone. But I do not feel the need to look at it every five seconds. Genius product ever!",

      "text": "I'm a big fan of this phone. It does what it's supposed to do, which is make/receive calls, pair with my Bluetooth headphones, and sync my contacts with the Android os. I don't care about games, texting, email, or anything else. It's super small and light. However, as others have stated, the battery is a trash. It's almost a joke how bad it is. If you do NOTHING, maybe you'll get 4hrs. If you make a few calls, maybe 3? If you do anything else? 2 hours. Not an exaggeration. The battery is awful. But if you can deal with that (it's fine for the way I use it), add a star.",

It worked great with any app I downloaded. Truly a mini SMARTPHONE. The one and only fault is the deception on the battery life. The batteries didn't even last half of the school day. Now I'm stuck with the 2 most expensive paperweights.",

Smart phones are making us stupid, and this is a good little tool because you can still communicate with all the annoying people you talk to everyday on snapchat and instagram, but small enough to make typing unnecessary words a hassle which makes you spend less time elaborating and more time talking to people in real life. I like it because im tryna not use my cell phone all the time and this phone is perfect for that.",

This is in ideal conditions where no apps are in uses, no inbound or outbound calls, and wifi access is constant (no wifi searching by the phone). I wouldn't want to be out and about using this phone without quick access to a power source.",

Only problem with mine is that when I put the brightness in the lowest setting the brightness doesn\u2019t stay where it is and it goes up and down. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the problem with it. The phone would be perfect for me if it had a decent battery life. I am trying to make it last a whole day if I can\u2019t I\u2019ll go back to my IPhone SE",

The online manufacturer's chat told me \"we fixed that problem\" and asked me to check the phone's build. I had what they had supposedly fixed. Both speaker and microphone are full of static; they were bad but usable on the first day, but some 12 days later are completely unusable. Conversations are impossible to hear. Expensive junk.",
