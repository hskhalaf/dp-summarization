We ended up going to the hardware store and buying connections in the plumbing section and making the same thing, but better, for about $5. We got a connection to screw into the inlet, then used an elbow joint to turn it, then adapted it down to the house connector size and connected the black tubing. Very easy, much cheaper, and it doesn't pop off or come apart.",

It's not a miracle worker, but it does help. Plus, I don't have a black hose yet, I have a green cloth hose that expands. So a black hose would probably really heat it up. Also, you have to have it wide open, then turn the pump on, then start closing it until you get a stream of water through the hose.",

However, on the very down side: the adapter often blows off with water pressure when you turn the pool on; and, any hose is very difficult to attach because no matter how I screwed it on, the attachment site always pointed UP, and the hose is difficult to connect without getting hung up on the edge of the pool.",

Simple to install and take off even with a 1000 gph pool pump going. I am using it with about 50 feet of hose currently with their Intex adapter (which fits nicely).

    "title": "Beluga Pool Solutions 1652 Solar Heating Device for Swimming Pool",
    "description": "The beluga solar pool heating device is a revolutionary way to heat your swimming pool using a garden hose. The beluga device attaches to a standard 1 1/2\" return fitting on above ground or in ground swimming pools and allows you to divert a small stream of water into a garden hose. If you have ever picked up a garden hose that has been lying in the sun you know how hot the water can get. The beluga allows you to slow the water down going through the hose capturing all of the heat that the garden hose can produce. The beluga solar heating device is the least expensive heating option on the market today. Now you can get your pool up to temperature sooner, extend your pool season, recover from a cold rain or a cool evening without any additional costs; no expensive heater unit, no service bills, and no expensive energy bills.",
