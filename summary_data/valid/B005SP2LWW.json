This wrap is a bit warm and will sometimes cause my baby to sweat but right now it is still cool where I live. Once it warms up I will probably have to get a thinner wrap. I've also noticed when I where it for an extended period of time my back starts to hurt, but that is to be expected if you are carrying a whole extra person around for hours with just the support of fabric.

I've fluxed approximately 60lbs and can still wear this sling snug and tight throughout my body's changes. Also, the product itself is very well made - the fabric is high quality and there's plenty of it to securely swaddle both you and your child, together. I will most definitely be purchasing a second one in the near future! Bonus: so many great color options!",

Plus, we look stylish wearing this wrap, it\u2019s long enough to even wear it as a shirt so to be skin to skin all day. We can easily breastfeed and still be covered effortlessly !! GREAT BUY !!",
