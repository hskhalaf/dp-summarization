Rather than send it back I opted to fix it myself by putting bolts and nuts in place of the glue and screws that pulled loose on three of the four sides. I'm hoping the problem is fixed and doesn't happen to the other one.",

A power drill also made it very quick work :) One seat came with a tiny gash in the seat in the back in an unnoticeable spot, so Amazon issued me a small refund to keep it and I was able to glue it.

I did notice a couple of scuff marks on the seatbacks, nothing terrible though. I taped the Allen wrench to the bottom of each stool so that I don't lose them and if needed in the future to tighten the screws as needed. The 360 swivel is of course pretty neat. Thanks.",

Also, a bit of advice when putting them together...don't tighten the seat screws until you get that ring somewhat secured and then tighten all of them. Learned that the hard way.",

I will say that my husband had a little hard time with screwing in the back rest because it goes in sideways, but just be patient and it will be fine! The price was unmatched compared to other similar stools. some other reviews said that the stools are uneven but I found that if the stool is turned evenly with the leg in the front it does not wobble at all. Perfect foot rest as well",

It arrived in 2 days, and was extremely EASY to put together. Took me less than 10 minutes. And this is a sturdy barstool. Looks and feels great. My girlfriend and I liked it so much we are ordering 3 more. Absolutely worth the money!",

The picture should only show one chair if that is all it includes. I now have to order another chair to complete the set and I am not happy about having to spend more money than I thought originally cost!!!! I will not order from this company again.",

This is especially important with the circular foot rest. You will not be able to put this over the legs if the base screws on the legs are remotely tightened. First chair took 10 minutes to assemble, the rest took maybe 5 minutes each, and that was with my little guy \"helping\".",
