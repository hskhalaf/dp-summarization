I mainly got it, because it was tiny & sorta cool :) That being said I have used it a few times since purchase and it is indeed functional. Some of the 19 tools are ridiculous to try to use with my larger hands but the main ones (pliers, screwdrivers, wire stripper) work just fine! And for what I paid for it, I feel like I got my moneys worth. Plus it sits on my keys perfectly and doesn't get int he way. I consider this a good buy!",

The tool seems kind of small to be effective, he said he really liked it and he carries it with him. I have never seen him use it, so it might be to not hurt my feelings. The concept seems really great though so I hope he's getting a lot of impromptu use out of it.",

Sadly the 1/4\" next wench makes the 7/16\" essentially unusable and it's the whole reason I bought it for. Would love a version that eliminates 1/4\" and the crimper I never use in place for a better 7/16",

However, the selection of precision Phillips and flathead screwdrivers is remarkable. Screwdriver selection alone is worth twice the price.",

Also loose are the rivets that secure the arms of the tool. I still keep the tool around but it is now secured with a rubberband.",

Aside from that it does do well when needed. It is lightweight and and really small.",
