Keep in mind, however, that this item has been discontinued for quite some time and there's is no Microsoft support if you need assistance with it. Loading the device as well as making changes to your content is needlessly complicated, but gets easier with practice and determination on the user's part. The sound quality is solely dependent on the quality of earbuds you use. There are no external speakers - just a jack for earphones.",

I choose this over the Nano & am glad I did. Pros: Has a FM Tuner!! (That I did not have to pay extra for) Ease of navigation. Easy to read the bigger letters at a glance. Zune marketplace seems to have songs that Itunes does not. The software works flawlessly with Vista Ultimate. Cons: The headphone jack is on the bottom. Lack of accessories. In summary, this Zune surpasses the Ipod Nano. I cannot wait to order my 80gb Zune!!",

Movies and Music Videos are watchable with this and all in all I think this rocks over an I-Pod, give it a try.",

I really like the simple Zune Software for ripping and transferring mp3 songs. It is so fast and easy compared to itunes. So, if you are looking for a great mp3 player with a nice FM radio in a nice sleek package, I recommend the Zune. My ipods are collecting dust now.",

Putting a whole album on the Zune 8 GB is not the best choice as it will fill up very quickly doing it this way. Has a slide pad for easy navigation which upgrades the first gen model that i have currently. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the compact size.",

I also bought the A/V pack/dock to connect to my existing stereo; it also recharges the Zune while it plays; and the remote does well from a good distance. Ease of use and great sound with the standard earphones have been a big plus. I've had no problems to date (knock on wood) in downloading or playing my music as some buyers had reported. Since it's my first MP3 player, a 1,000-song capacity seems more than adequate. The inclusion of a radio which other brands do not have, is another plus. Highly recommended!",

In comparison to an iPod click-wheel, the zunepad is actually very usable and just as good, if not better. In fact, I'd argue that the interface and ease-of-use beats an ipod anyday. The software, however, is rather slow. It's very usable and easy, but it is not a very good media player. I really only use it to download music, update my player, etc. To actually play movies I'd probably use a diff media player, though for music it works well enough.",

Now you can create a playlist, move that playlist to your Zune and play all or part of it. Other devices force your music into different catagories, like Genre, Artist etc. Seems to have good battery life. The touchpad is a little sensitive to use.

She uses it at least every other day to run with. Positives: -great battery life -easy, intuitive functionality of the menus -the included head phones are actually pretty decent Negatives: -even after several updates, the Zune software leaves something to be desired. Still cannot drag files from folders into the program (despite both being microsoft products) -no equalizer. This was almost a deal breaker buying it. Fairly satisfied with automatic settings",

It's easy to find the song your looking for with just a few presses of the D-Pad. And the radio signal strength is amazing. Although it has been discontinued from the Microsoft line-up, it is still, by far, a high quality product. One of the only things I had wished that they would make for the Microsoft Zune is a better case. It may be made of metal, but I'd like to have some protection on it. Other than that, a great product.",

    "description": "Capacity:4 GB| Color:Pink| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingAMAZON.COM\n Music and entertainment, your way. That's what the Zune 4 GB Digital Media Player is designed to deliver. The Zune easily connects you with your music, videos, and pictures wherever and whenever you want, and unlike the iPod, it even has a built-in FM tuner so you can keep up with local news and sports. Your Zune gives you the power to wirelessly share full-length tracks, playlists, pictures and podcasts with your other Zune-wielding friends, and it is available in four bold colors. And when you receive songs that you just can't get out of your head, you can easily tag the songs and buy them the next time you sync up. Whether you're listening to music, radio, or rocking out to the latest music videos on the bright, roomy screen, the Zune allows you to tailor your entertainment, right in the palm of your hand. Watch a demo on Zune.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Zune easily connects you with your music, videos, and pictures wherever and whenever you want, and it is available in four bold colors. \n\nShare full-length tracks of your favorite songs, albums, playlists, pictures, and even audio podcasts with other Zune users. (Red Zune shown here with Dock Pack v2 with remote, sold separately.)\n\n\n\nStore up to 1,000 songs, 25,000 pictures, or 12 hours of video. \n\nGet all your favorite music at the Zune Marketplace. Simple, Innovative Controls\nThe Zune is a breeze to use with new, intuitive touch controls. Don't subject yourself to cumbersome, slow scrolling. The innovative new Zune pad makes browsing your music, video and picture collections fun and effortless. You'll fly through your favorites and get to just what you're looking for in no time flat. This powerhouse device stores up to 1,000 songs, 25,000 pictures, or 12 hours of video. (Please note that music estimates are based on 128 kbps WMA files, with length of 4 minutes each; pictures transferred to Zune will be optimized for Zune screen size; and video estimates are based on 500 kbps WMV files with 128 kbps WMA audio tracks.) That's a lot of entertainment, and you'll appreciate it even more with the Zune's awesome screen. The super-slim, ultra-portable Zune sports a durable, 1.8-inch color screen that provides uncompromising portable video viewing. This Zune also comes equipped with headphones and three pairs of foam headphones covers. Your favorite music, videos, and pictures have never looked and sounded better.\n\n FM Radio\nThe Zune also features a built-in FM radio tuner so that you can listen to local FM stations or tune-in programming while you're at the gym. Advanced tuning capabilities allow you to see the name of the song that's currently playing on select frequencies.\n\n Wireless Sync\nWe're all exhausted by the cables and wires that tangle up our lives. Luckily, the Zune is one device that doesn't require another cord. You can easily connect to your home wireless network and sync your Zune with your PC collection of digital goodies. You can also sync using the dock, AC adapter, or speaker dock accessory (not included).\n\n The Zune Community and Marketplace\nZune is all about sharing and community. At the Zune Online Community, you'll discover, share, and leave your musical mark. Create a Zune card and Zune profile page to reflect your musical identity. From the Zune Online Community, you can invite friends, share song recommendations, post comments, and browse member pages to unearth new tunes and connect to others who share your musical tastes.\n\n When you're ready to purchase music and load your device with new tunes, turn to Zune Marketplace. With more than 3 million songs, DRM-free MP3s, music videos, audio/video podcasts, and more content added every day, you'll certainly get your fill. The store is always open and just a mouse click away. You can also choose between the download or subscription packages--buy individual songs and albums, or snag a Zune Pass subscription with all you can eat access to discover and explore the nooks and crannies of artists and genres.\n\n Zune-to-Zune Sharing\nOnce your Zune is loaded with good stuff, you'll be ready to embrace wireless Zune-to-Zune sharing. Share full-length tracks of your favorite songs, albums, playlists, pictures, and even audio podcasts. You can listen to the full track of any song you receive up to three times, and you can even pass along songs that are shared with you to other friends. If you find a song you really love, you can easily add it to your wishlist and buy it later when you sync to your PC. When it comes to syncing and importing your music, the Zune makes it easy. Zune software can automatically import your existing music, pictures, and videos from iTunes and Windows Media Player in a variety of formats, including your existing playlists and song ratings.\n\n Recorded TV or Movies to Go\nThe Zune will also automatically import TV shows or movies recorded using a PC running Windows Media Center in Windows Vista. Record all your favorites, sync to your Zune, and hit the road with your favorite TV shows right in your pocket.\n\n Your Games. Your Music. Your Way.\nAnother awesome feature is the Zune's compatibility with the Xbox 360. Plug your Zune into your Xbox 360 to customize the soundtrack in supported games. You also can stream music, pictures, and videos from the Zune software on your PC to your Xbox 360 console using a wireless connection. Whether you're staying in or going out, travelling or working, the Zune can be right there with you, providing loads of entertainment direct from your pocket.\n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nZune 4 GB Digital Media Player, headphones, sync cable, and three pairs of foam headphone covers.",
