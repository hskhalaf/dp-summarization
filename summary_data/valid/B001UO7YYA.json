It does not bother me that the attachment devices are plastic, they have been sturdy enough to withstand a direct hit from Andrew. Wrapping is a problem, when I figure a solution to this I will let you know. I think maybe just lengthening the metal grommet attachments might do the trick, i will think on this. This is a solid company. I will write a follow up in three months.",

I was desperately trying to find one for a new flag I had ordered, which has a narrower channel (barely 1\") than most, to thread over the pole. I'm very happy with it. The product is definitely as described. Thank you!",
