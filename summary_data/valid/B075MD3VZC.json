Flash colors, also adjustable brightness too. I really couldn't find anything wrong.",

The supplied length of cable is just right if you plan to run through the driver side into the passenger side under console, and hide cables appropriately. The adhesion is rock solid with the double sided tape and included wipe for extra adhesion. The app has synched for me just fine, and the lights are bright and adjust to about any color imaginable. The ONLY downside is the music only synchs with downloaded or purchased Apple Music. The ability to synch to a music streaming service would be a massive upgrade.",

But it works, orange and yellow is alittle dim in color depth. But Its not to bad. I like these leds. And would buy them again.",

I will say that if this issue gets fixed it appears to be a great value and I would recommend to everyone.",
