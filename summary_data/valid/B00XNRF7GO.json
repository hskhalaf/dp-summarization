The belt holds a full size 1911 holster in both iwb and owb styles with spare mag pouches with no problem. There is zero sagging. The apppearance of the belt is also very good. It is darkly dyed black- and is very uniform in appearance. This belt new is almost good enough to be used as a dress belt. So this thing has a 100 year warranty? Challenge accepted!",

Then you have the warranty just another + in this belts colomn. Lastly you have the customer service. Its top notch truly exceptional. I cant say enough good things. My belt was a little small for my IWB holster and they sent me a new one with a envelope to send back the first one free of charge. Seriously if your looking for a gun belt thats not nylon and not ridiculously priced look no further!! Im not affiliated with Hanks in anyway i just really like this product",

I plan on buying a brown one next month just need to find brown clips for my IWB holster so the black ones don't stand out with a tucked in shirt. Great job Hanks!!!",

For the price of two or three low grade belts that will wear out in a year you can have this and be done.",
