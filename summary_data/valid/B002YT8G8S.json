      "text": "I purchased these to replace what should have been identical Riedel glasses that we broke. However these glasses are very inferior quality to the ones they're replacing. The crystal of the bowls is very wavy when you rotate the glasses (compared to the original glasses). One of the glasses has a very noticeable flaw in the rim, and the other glass has a flaw or a chip in the base, which is sharp enough to have drawn blood! Finally the Riedel logo on the bases of the glasses is actually wearing off (it should be permanently etched into the glass)! Overall these glasses look like cheap Chinese fakes, despite the Riedel box they came in appearing legitimate. Very disappointed.",

They are actually amazing wine glasses, and this value-priced set of their glasses strikes the perfect balance of high quality and reasonable prices. Because of course, I am going to break these, either during hand-washing them, or you know, the million ways we break wine glasses. I have to admit, wine tastes better in Riedel.",

Hard to see on the pictures but there are triple glass circles in both places and the stem itself has a distinctively elegant detail. It is not a smooth stem but rather has raised impressions. It's elegant. Now I want some.",
