I needed a pair of trail runners on short notice and didn't have time to go shopping so I just ordered these. I love the New Balance brand so I clicked order and crossed my fingers. I received them and was super surprised at how well they fit and how comfortable they are. Plenty of cushioning and the soles are perfect for hiking. I went on a hike the day after I received these, hopping across streams, walking across rocks and walking uphill in mud and the grip was awesome. Great shoe and I would definitely order them again.",

      "text": "I needed some shoes for hiking this summer on our vacation and after lots of research, I decided on these. I didn't want traditional hiking shoes but I needed something that could handle rocky, uneven terrain. I run about 2-6 miles most days on a gravel trail and these shoes have been amazing! I can tell a huge difference in the traction between these and normal running shoes. I've already worn them on some local hiking trails, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they hold up on some of the more challenging trails this summer. Either way, I'm already impressed and plan to stick with a New Balance trail running style shoe from now on for my daily running.",

Also, the \"toe protect\" is a layer of soft, thin rubber (spray on?) that provides no protection from anything you're going to brush up against on a trail.

Good traction all around even on the worst climbs and nasty downs. I was concerned because the price was exceptionally low for trail shoes but I'm very impressed.
