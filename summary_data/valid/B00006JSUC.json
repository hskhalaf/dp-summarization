However four months after purchase as I was heating up olive oil on medium High temp , while I was in the kitchen dicing gArlic for it , I heard what sounded like a gunshot and found that the pan split in two. Photo attached. Unfortunately it's past the return date. I'm disappointed because I had good experience with this product before and no explanation as to how a few minutes of heat could cause fracture. Had to toss the pan.",

Once seasoned you must watch how you wash them, (no dish washer, no soap, only hot water and a nylon scrubber works best for me) and re-season them after washing. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. Cooking with cast iron will also add dietary iron to your meals. I am low in iron but cannot take iron supplements as they upset my stomach. But cooking in cast iron helps keep my iron levels up.",

    "description": "Size:13.25\"The Lodge Cast Iron 13.25-inch Skillet is a multi-functional cookware that works wonders with slow-cooking recipes and all your favorite foods. Fry up a chicken, saute vegetables or bake an apple crisp in this generous 13.25-inch pan that features two handles for heavy lifting and two subtle side lips for pouring. Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching. It retains heat well so you can sear meat at higher temperatures and will keep your delicious meals warm for a long time. Whether used in a kitchen or camp, theses virtually indestructible cookware should last for generations. Made of cast iron, this Skillet evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls. Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron Skillet looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron. Cast Iron, like your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made. It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware. The American-based company, Lodge, has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century.",
