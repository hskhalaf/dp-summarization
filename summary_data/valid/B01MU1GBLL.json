I did some research and found that many other people have been having the exact same issue. I never leave negative reviews but this is egregious. Fix your system with an update that addresses this problem and I will update my rating accordingly.",

Before the purchase I read where a few people had problems but so far (it's been about a month), all is great.",

It really is a wonderful TV. This being a budget TV, the trade-offs include a lower 720p resolution and the contrast of the picture drops sharply at harsh viewing angles. These drawbacks are totally acceptable at this price range.",
