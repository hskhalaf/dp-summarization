I'd say my skin is \"sensitive\" (aka: crappy) but this product did not cause any breakouts/rash/inflammation (though it's a little itchy when you first apply it) 3.) As for effectiveness, the key is to follow the instructions exactly and be sure to let your skin dry, but it's awesome. 4.) It's great for heat or anxiety-induced sweat (the latter being my primary usage)",

      "text": "This product is magic. I sometimes experience nervous sweating at work mainly with specific fabrics like satin top. I didn believe that this would honestly stop me from sweating but somehow I don\u2019t even realize but at the end of the day there is no wetness under my arms and admits fabric is dry. And it this is my very first time trying and literally lasted the whole week. I will be testing it further hoping for the midsummer time when it s blistering hot. I work in office and sometimes it s kind of chilly yet my underarms are wet so hoping this will tackle that problem as well as hot summer days and cute outfits",

For my skin, a bit sensitive, it caused burning and itching such that I tried it a few times and just didn't want to put it on my face anymore. I then thought to put it on my feet, didn't think it did a thing. So, I'd say if you have sweating issues, and you can swing the price, it's likely worth giving it a go. It seemed to really work for many people.",

Don\u2019t use it after shaving or it burns and itches pretty bad. My skin is sensitive and has mostly held up well with these. I have had some burning and itching but nothing unbearable.

I usually wait 10-30 mins to apply lotion afterwards - however long I can stand the tingling. It really does last close to a week and for the duration (after the initial application), the tingling is rare; usually when your pores would've produced sweat, but aren't.",
