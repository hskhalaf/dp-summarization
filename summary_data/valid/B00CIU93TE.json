I cringe looking at the small drizzle of juice that each fruit/veggie produces. Waste of money on both ends (buying this machine and losing out on your produce) If I could return this I would in a heartbeat. I'm super disappointed. Also while juicing the mastication piece wobbles so much as if it's going to fall off. Cheap plastics, not well put together. They are only able to sell this machine because of the Omega name.

      "text": "I loved this juicer the first few uses for celery, unfortunately the plastic juice receptacle cracked right down the center after hand washing on the second use. The instructions say everything is dishwasher safe, however I hand washed all parts to be safe. I made the mistake of juicing turmeric which this machine should be able to handle, it juiced well but left the macerating arm very sticky and after cleaning never worked correctly again. Now I can't even juice a few stalks of celery without the pulp getting caught on the macerator. I just passed the 30 day return window, I am hoping the company is reputable enough to honor a return. Disappointed.",

There was a crack in one of the containers that were included upon arrival. It didn't go all the way through, and it was usable...but figured I should call the company, just in case it was damaged further with use. They were very pleasant to deal with, and immediately rush ordered me another container. So impressed with this product and the way they stand behind their products. Highly recommended!!!",

A lot of research has gone into finding a cold-press juicer that doesn't burn the nutrients through heat generated by other types of juicing machines. I agree with the reviewers who say that this juicer extracts juice really well. The pulp is bone dry for vegetables. For fruits that are meatier (e.g., pineapple, lemon), it is wetter, but still manages to extract a crazy amount of juice. Let's see how long this machine lasts.",

      "text": "I bought this juicer back in 2015 and decided to spend a little more due to the reviews and that it is supposed to be top of the market. My husband uses this daily and we needed a high quality machine. However, the cone piece has cracked down the middle and is not longer usable. I wouldn't expect any of the parts to break when we paid as much as we did for this machine. It would have gotten 5 stars, but I am disappointed for what we paid we are already having issues with the parts.",
