However I still use it almost every day. I just keep it plugged in all the time. Its been abused on construction sites most of the time. Ive dropped it a couple times. It been in very dusty conditions most of the time as well. Still sounds as good as it always has surprisingly. Its certainly not as loud as most of the other \"Jobsite\" radios out there, but it works for me. Im going to continue to use it until it finally blows I guess haha.",

(Despite the title of the product and packaging, the speaker works perfectly with non-Apple devices as long as they support Bluetooth, like Android smartphones and tablets. I have no idea why Logitech does this as it can cause confusion.) I'm somewhat jealous as I have Logitech's wireless USB speaker Z515 myself and although its sound is great, it can't hold itself against this. Just phenomenal sound. If you must absolutely have the best mobile sound for your smartphone or tablet, this is one of the contenders for its price point. You will not be disappointed.",

I contacted logitech support and they indicated I should perform a \"Factory reset\", which also didn't work. It wouldn't reset using their instructions. I hope I just received a defective item.

B) switching from one bluetooth device to another only seems to work if the controlling device cancels the connection before another device tries to pick it up. if you don't cancel the first connection it won't be seen by other devices. i have held buttons ins, turned them on and off an doesn't recognize. this gets annoying when someone who may be using a phone leaves and others try to connect to the speakers.",

And there was a noticeable difference in sound quality when it was plugged in vs just running on battery. Bass was overall decent. Battery life was pretty good. I ended up shelling out the money for a Bose Soundlink (the original one), which I have been very happy with for a larger speaker. I also recently purchased a Cyren Photive and Roverbeats T3 for the office, which are amazing values for a smaller speaker.",

If you are looking for great audio, keep looking. Now, on the portability side this unit shines. Its great for the beach or anywhere alike. It does has an audio input to use with not BT enabled devices. That way it does sounds better not not great.",

It automatically turns down the bass output a little if you are running off the internal battery and not plugged into a 110v outlet. Ive never checked how long it will run on a full charge but I've played outside at a picnic with it for hours and my phone battery died before the battery in the speaker died. Great little unit",

Well, the \"update\" to this is the $100 more expensive UE Boombox, which doesn't hold a candle to this in terms of sound quality. Get one of these if you can find one at a decent price.

I read somewhere that the two bigger woofers turn off all together, but without being too scientific, it seems like you can achieve the same sound by turning the volume back up once you unplug it. Inexpensive compared to other options although I have not compared them... I love this thing!!",

Setup involves no more than taking it out of the box and plugging it in (battery means that you don't need to leave it plugged in, however). Cons: No remote! Blue light flashes when no bluetooth device is attached. Overall: Great deal! It could definitely use a remote since I feel the need to turn it off when I go to sleep due to the lights on the front of the unit.",

However, for use in a smaller room or outside when you want something portable, it's great. Even though the volume and bass diminish a bit when running on battery, it still sounds very good. When plugged in, it sounds great. Surprising for a boombox this size. I also listened to the Bose Soundlink and I like the sound of the Logitech better and it's $180 cheaper. I highly recommend it.",

At about 60% volume I'll get almost 4 hours. Would buy it again for sure. Only downfall is when multiple devices try to connect to it it bugs out sometimes and ends up locking out both devices until you reset it. If more than one person will be using the Bluetooth audio functionality make sure to disable bluetooth on your device after you are done using it so the next person can connect without a problem.",

I even use it as a distractor for the noisy neighbors and their basketball court right next to my house LOL. I simply place the box in the window sill in their direction and let it blast. It has good directional sound, so I can drown them out without distrubing the interior sounds of my own home. How's that for a product plug.",

      "text": "Since we own several different brands of cell phones and an iPod, we thought the BlueTooth option would work best. Instead of the iPod dock with remote, you can use your device as the remote, which is much easier. The sound is very good - not as much high end as I expected but nice full mid-low end sound. This is a perfect addition to the kitchen for my wife to listen while she cooks.",

      "text": "I have owned many Logitech products and I have become accustomed to their price and quality, this one does't disappoint. I am no audiophile, so the volume and quality is more than enough for the normal person. The sound quality does indeed diminish when running on battery power but is AWESOME when plugged in. I had planned to just use this at home but I have found it coming to the beach or camping every time I go. I would highly recommend this unit if you are looking for a nice Bluetooth set of speakers.",

If you max it out the speakers will distort but it's more than loud enough before then. I am most likely going to pick up another, I also love that you can unplug this baby and it works for up to 6hrs without any fuss or having to pick up batteries.",

It has just enough bass,imo, to give it a full and rich sound. The only problem i've had is the windows machine will lose connection even though it says it's connected. My apple ipad and iphone don't have that problem so it's probably stupid windows not handling the driver correctly. Highly recommend this!!",
