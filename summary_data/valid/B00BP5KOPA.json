I suppose I should have known that a wireless keyboard and mouse combo that costs like fourteen cents wouldn't be found in Trump Tower. But I don't need anything gold plated or huge. It just needs to work for more than four months. I shouldn't have higher monthly computer accessory costs than my Hulu subscription. Won't buy again.",

The mouse worked fine but the keyboard would not respond at times. He could turn the keyboard on and off and then it would work, but only for a while. We tried changing batteries ... no luck. We tried using different USB ports .. no luck. It would always work for a while ... and then quit. We don't think it's the computer because we ended up borrowing another Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combo from a neighbor and it works flawlessly. Unfortunately we played around with it way too long to send it back. Won't be buying this product again.",

Unfortunately, when you purchase this combo set, neither device is \"Unifying\". Both devices have to be used with the USB stub that comes with them, so you cannot \"mix and match\" these with other keyboards or mice.",

The wireless aspect makes it nice to avoid the tangle of cords. And I can use the keyboard from across the room, say when my laptop is connected to my TV. I like that the receiver is tiny and sturdy, unlike another Logitech model's long USB stick receiver that would get bent.",

Conversely, I use the \"touch-typing\" method where I always keep my fingertips lightly in contact with the keyboard. With previous keyboards, this was never a problem, but with this keyboard I constantly get unwanted letters, especially k and g.

This set has nice rubber feet on the keyboard that keep it flat without sliding around, keys have good feedback, and action, mouse feels slightly inexpensive, but looks and operates perfectly. Single dongle operates both the keyboard and mouse, connecting automatically to two different Windows 7 PC's immediately on start up. Nice set, even at the $21+ price point.",

I thought it was the batteries in the KB since the mouse is still working, So I changed the battery thinking the battery it came with, since sometimes they are 'trial' batteries.

I replace the batteries every 1-2 months on the keyboard, but only every 6 months with the mouse. Overall I would recommend this item as a good basic set up.

From Trouble shooting against several PCs/OSs showed the same behavior so the problem is inside the keyboard, Took apart the keyboard, and by manually connecting some of the lines internally it could type the keys etc, Just not when it was all put back together, So not a software glitch but a hardware problem. Conclusion: The internal engineering design should be made more robust. The mouse is smallish, but has good resistance in the scroller wheel. The usb connector is nice and small, standard logitech. You can get associated software from logitech, but it all feels outdated.",

This is not a mechanical problem, as the only way to restore functionality is to turn the keyboard on/off. Although only ~$20, expect longer than 1 year lifespan.
