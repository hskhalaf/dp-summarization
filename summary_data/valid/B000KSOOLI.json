I was going to rate them 4 stars, because they aren't anywhere near as good as my Freud bits that I have, but I am a beginner woodworker and these are a great starter set of bits to get me used to using my router and give me versatility while being affordable. I have been using this set for about 2 months now and all the bits I've used so far have worked great. I bought the set so I could see which bits I would use most often and replace them one by one with better bits individually.",

After the first 23 inches on the router, I noticed just about in the middle of the second edge the bit was not cutting the wood cleanly. A mental note was made that I would have to come back over the edge with the sander to clean it up. Both short ends of the boards (5.5 inch) were burnt and also did not have clean cuts. The first bit used in this set was now worthless. My set of bits were collected and tossed in the trash. Don't waste your money....You truly get what you pay for. 15 bits for $20...........what was I thinking?",

I think this is due to the type of paint that is on these bits as this doesn't happen with a more expensive bit I bought. keep a can of spray lubricant nearby for the bearings.",
