It was able to recharge my group 24 deep cycle marine battery (65 Ah) from nearly completely dead, however it did take 52 hours of continuous charging to do so. Now that'd I'm back up to full charge, I'll be doing more frequent charging after every use to maintain the charge and avoid another 52 hour marathon. If you're looking to completely recharge a large deep-cycle battery regularly, I'd look into chargers that pump more than 2 amps. However, this lil guy will still get the job done",

Talking to the manufacturer requires extreme patience, to be nice, they have short hours and one attendant so you will be on hold for up to an hour. When I finally got the complete unit in working order two months has passed since my purchase and paid for shipping twice. I'm still not sure if the unit works. I will never buy anything else from Black & Decker again!",
