After about 32 days and used less than 10 times, the motor stopped spinning but the lights and sounds still worked. The cover this time was hot. Don't trust this fan and choose another brand. I bought the Westpointe pedestal fan and exhibited little heat on the cover even after 10 hours of constant on but it only has 3 speed settings, no timer and no remote.",

At this price point I wasn't expecting a Forever Fan, but I had a reasonable expectation that it would outlast and outperform the $25 cheapie I picked up 5 years ago in a discount 'bargain store' and use in the laundry room. This thing was a poor buy and IS a piece of junk.",

Loved the remote, settings, oscillation but who cares - it didn't last two summer seasons. Run away!!! Only doing this review to buy replacement pedestal fan and never again Honeywell.. It does operate quietly, but also isn't as strong as fans I had in past. I believe those who say it is super quiet, like me, have a dead machine that doesn't operate.",

Easy to assemble and disassemble without instructions or tools. Never had to replace the remote batteries in the 2.5 years it functioned. Did not like: The piercing blue light others have mentioned. Lack of oscillation controls on the remote (have to use the tab on the fan itself).",

The outer components surrounding the fan blades are metal and you have attach the front face via metal clamps. No matter what we do, it rattles due to the motion and an insecure fit.",

      "text": "This is a very good fan. It is stable, reasonably quiet, and the remote control feature is surprisingly useful. As others have noted, it has a small light which can be annoying if you use this while sleeping, but you can put a piece of tape over that. Also, it beeps when turning it off or on, which can be a bit of an issue if using it around people who are trying to sleep. But otherwise, I really like it, and will probably buy another one for use in the garage.",

This can be fixed by placing tape or something over it that can be easily removed. Other than that, no complaints.",

At first I thought thought there was something wrong causing it to turn on and off randomly. Then I realized it was the TV remote. Moving the fan a bit further 5th o the side has lessened the problem, though it still happens now and then.",

It's as if the front was smaller around than the back grill. Of course this was the final step in assembly so a big waste of time. Then we had to try and repackage all the parts and get it back into box. Not a happy experience.",
