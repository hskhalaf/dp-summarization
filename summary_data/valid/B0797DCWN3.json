The flakes were about 1/4\" x 1/4\", far too large for Parmesan to be sprinkled on Italian pasta. The description does not specifically state that it is for grating cheese, but one would think the overall design lends itself for that purpose. Almost all the other similarly designed products offer 2 different flake drums; one for large and one for small flakes, whereas this one only has one for large. Shame on me for making assumptions.",

Our model OXO is no longer made and the replacement gets bad reviews so we tried this because of the good reviews.

My favorite is the smaller grater options, because I usually just use this for cheese. You can, however, use it for veggies like carrots and cucumbers. It also suggests that you can use this for chocolate. Its a big grater, and the rubber grip handle makes it really easy to hold onto. So far, this is the best grater I have ever had!",

Probably better suited for hard chocolate. It prominently features \"stainless steel\" on the description but that's only the drum--- most of the unit is plastic. Would have been five stars if they would have included several drums to give more flexibility in its use.",

The bidirectional feature eliminates the need to reposition whatever you're grating so you can grate on both up and down strokes. Unfortunately, t's uncomfortable to hold and it feels like you're going to catch a finger or knuckle on the blades. I also don't like the curve in the blade section because it ends up carving out a section if you're grating a big chunk of cheese and makes it hard to grate smaller items that have a natural curvature (lemons, limes, etc).",
