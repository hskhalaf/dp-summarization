And, that is standing less than 2 feet from the mic straight on. It would be easier to just talk louder and use the built in microphone on my Canon Rebel T6i. WHY??? Because the mic is a COUNTERFEIT! When I went to register the mic at rode.com, it showed that my serial number was already registered to another owner. I will be contacting Rode! The seller was Beschen and fulfilled by Amazon.

There is no metal of any kind to block interferences with this microphone. For example wifi signals, phone signals, bluetooth signals. You will hear constant clicking noises. There is no permanent fix to this. Tech support has no actual solutions to this. So do not buy this mic.",

I also tested on a boom stand above 1.5 ft away at 45 degrees from the subjects mouth and only then did the quality increase by a small amount. You need to be close to it in order to hear a difference. If you want high quality you'll need to invest more money!",

      "text": "after two weeks it has started recording with a ticking noise and I'm super bummed because it ruined a couple of my vlogs and it's like so annoying and stuff. I tried messing with the cable. The picture shows it not tucked into the slot they have -- it's like a place for the cable to go in the back of the red thing of the mic. (The problem started when I started using that.) Reversing the direction of the cable helped for a bit but now it doesn't help.",
