Having said that I find the nude ones more comfortable than the black ones. Even though they are same style and same size the black ones feel tighter. I usually wear size 6 however I have wide feet so I order 6.5 and they fit great. I have worn these shoes to work all day as well as to go out and they haven't hurt a bit and I usually have problems with shoes.",

Unfortunately the quality was very cheap and the shoes were so uncomfortable to wear I could only wear them for a few minutes. The heel is way too high and the toes too narrow and short, so the height of the heel pushes your foot forward into the short narrow toe and pinches your toes. I'm returning them.",
