      "text": "Bought this axe for a family car camping trip to Rocky Mountain National Park. First, the axe is light and compact enough for my medium framed 12 y/o son to split logs endlessly (and enthusiastically). The axe really does seem to chop three times faster. It did finally get somewhat dull after a few days of abuse, but it never lost its splitting power. Overall a great buy and a good seller to deal with.",

The first opportunity I had to use it was to chop wood for firewood at the campsite. On day two, The handle broke free from the Axe head. I might add that this was not a handle strike that caused this. The result was actually a quite dangerous situation and fortunately nobody in the surrounding area was hurt.",

There is plenty of handle to swing it over your head and follow through a whole piece of wood. The blade is sharp and durable as well. You probably won\u2019t chop walnut with it. But it will go through most woods you would take camping. Only thing I don\u2019t like is the open bottom of the handle. Not sure why it\u2019s there, looks like it was made to store something, or that mine was missing a piece.",
