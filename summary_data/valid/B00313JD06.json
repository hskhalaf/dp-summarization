I have only had it for a few days, but if it holds up to everyday use, then it will rank right up there with my iPad as one of my favorite things.",

All worked great. However, when I tried to play music from my MacBook Pro using iTunes (via Bluetooth) the sound quality was unacceptable.

Volume is more that adequate for hotel room listening, and the small weight/size makes it easy to keep in the smallest of travel bags. Bluetooth works fine, but can be 'buzzy', a direct cord yields best results. Cell phone function isn't so hot though, and the call audio level and quality pales to the music function, hence 4 not 5 stars. Still, if portablility and audio quality are your criteria, you will not regret this purchase. Sam Missimer",

The SFQ-04 is about 3-4 times as big, about $100 bucks here (MORE than twice as less as the soundmatters). Anything with even a little bass sounds absolutely horrid.

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingSoundmatters introduces foxLv2 and foxLv2 Bluetooth, worthy successors to the first and still only portable pocket-sized stereo speaker system good enough for an audio purist. The foxLv2 Bluetooth version adds significantly improved Bluetooth music streaming (great for use with iPhone 3G/3GS/touch and other music phones) and surprisingly competent built-in dual-microphone system for \u201centerprise-quality\u201d hands-free/conferencing.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nSoundmatters introduces foxLv2 and foxLv2 Bluetooth, worthy successors to the first and still only portable pocket-sized stereo speaker system good enough for an audio purist. The foxLv2 Bluetooth version adds significantly improved Bluetooth music streaming (great for use with iPhone 3G/3GS/touch and other music phones) and surprisingly competent built-in dual-microphone system for \"enterprise-quality\" hands-free/conferencing.\n\n\n\nTurns the palm of your hand into a personal amphitheater\n\nLINEAR MAGNETIC DRIVE TWOOFER\nUnlike other portable speaker systems, foxLv2 is engineered around a pair of proprietary, highly sophisticated acoustic drivers, unique in their ability to reproduce both extreme high (tweeter) and low (woofer) frequencies from a single very small diameter (25mm) dome speaker, dubbed the \"Twoofer\".\n\nCovered by a portfolio of patents, the Twoofer incorporates Soundmatter's Linear Magnetic Drive topology featuring field-focused, back-to-back, dual Extreme-Energy neodymium magnets and a 1-inch, dual voice coil.\n\nENHANCED BLUETOOTH HANDS-FREE AND MUSIC STREAMING\nSoundmatters engineers worked closely with their factory partner, one of the largest manufacturers of Bluetooth devices, to ensure that foxLv2's implementation of Bluetooth's v.2.0 A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) technology was optimized for both wide audio bandwidth and low distortion. This extra effort ensures surprisingly high quality stereo music streaming.\n\n\n\nBring and share the joy of high-fidelity music anywhere\n\nfoxLv2's built-in noise and echo-canceling microphone circuitry, coupled with the Twoofer's remarkable voice clarity, make it a superb choice for hands-free and conference call applications. When a call comes in while listening to music streamed via a Bluetooth-enabled music phone, foxLv2 automatically switches so you'll hear and be able to speak to the caller, and when the call is finished music returns. With a quick press of foxLv2's front Bluetooth button, you can even remotely reject, answer, or terminate a call.\n\n\"SKINTIGHT\" DOMEFORWARD ENCLOSURE\nfoxLv2 incorporates high-tech glass-filled composite walls to form a \"skintight\" ultra-rigid totally sealed acoustic enclosure...often confused with metal, but much lighter, for portability.\n\nUnlike others that mount their acoustic drivers in manner that actually obstructs their sound, especially if the listener is off-axis from the front of the speakers' direct \"line of sight,\" foxLv2\u2019s Twoofer speakers, are mounted \"dome forward\" from the enclosure, protected by a grille designed to maximize acoustic transparency. Another reason why unlike typical small speakers, foxLv2 sounds open and airy, almost regardless of its location.\n\nBASSBATTERY/FLATMAGIC\nfoxLv2's dual digitally powered Twoofers are assisted in their task of reproducing low frequencies by a miniaturized version of the high mass \"moving-wall\" passive bass radiators found in Soundmatters' award-winning SUBstage home subwoofers.\n\nTo add the additional bass driver, without compromising stringent weight and space restrictions, Soundmatters engineers developed an innovative solution: the BassBattery. This patent-pending design was created by rubber-encasing foxLv2's built-in high capacity, lithium-ion battery, enabling it to provide the mass for, and doing double duty as an acoustic suspension bass driver.",
