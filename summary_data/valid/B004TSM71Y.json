I\u2019ve worn it every day for almost 5 months and so far I haven\u2019t had any quality issues with it. I\u2019ll admit, I waited to write my review because I was expecting it to fall apart after a month with it being so affordable, but I\u2019m definitely impressed and will be purchasing different styles.",

This purse was a suitable replacement for my actual purse bc it's stylish looking with the chrome squares and the extra flap on the side at least feels like you aren't totally open to the world (as if you would ever want the world to see the inside of your purse.) The plastic is thick and feels like it will hold up. The fact it has nice handles also makes it a winner. I would recommend this purse for any woman who is stylish but attends large sporting events with high security.",

It looks better than some bags I've seen on Amazon which just looks cheap. She no longer uses it since she doesn't work retail but for those 4 months of daily usage it held up well. Material seems to be thick heavy duty plastic so it looks pretty durable. Stitching seems very durable as well.",

It needs more additional pockets like a regular briefcase for files, pens, etc. The other problem is the flimsiness of the plastic; this bag has no structural support like a regular briefcase and collapses on itself due to lack of sturdiness. If you think this is a regular briefcase, just see-through, think again...will not re-purchase a replacement if this gets damaged.",

      "text": "I am a casino associate and need a clear bag for work. I never have any luck finding a clear handbag at an actual store, they are either too big, too small, or just poor quality. I was so excited to find this one! It arrived on time and was exactly as described online. I get compliments everyday on my new bag. My only issue so far, the little metal trim pieces at the top are falling off already. It not a huge deal, I just hope its not an indication of the bag's overall quality.",
