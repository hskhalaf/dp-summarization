If this collar does ever wear out I'll get her another one forsure! I can not recommend it enough. It's durable and padded so it's comfortable for my sweet pitty.",

I'm writing this review two months after my dog wearing because I realized that because of this collar, my dog now has a huge rash on her neck from the buckle. We looked at the collar and we think this is because the collar is double sewed on back for the buckle to be looped on. My dog is a short hair dachshund they're known for sensitive skin. So this dog collar would probably be fine for dogs with normal skin types, but be wary with sensitive skinned.",

I got the extra small size for my other cat, and it fits him perfectly! So for regular to small-sized cats, I recommend getting the smallest size. Unless your cat happens to be very big around the neck, the extra small size will do. I would recommend the extra small size for dogs like chihuahuas as well.",

No complaints with the product at all, and I would recommend it.",
