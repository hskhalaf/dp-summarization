I also use the 'programable' feature to program certain songs on specific CDs (i.e create a playlist of any of the songs on the CDs you put in) - it's always worked for me. I have a Yamaha receiver. I shopped around quite bit before purchasing this. I feel good about my purchase.",

You will be pleased if you have a lot of CDs that are older. I have mine attached to the surround speaker system for home theater.

On the plus side, the price is very reasonable and plays CDs with no extra noise. Just insert your CDs very carefully.",

      "text": "The CD player is excellent. The sound is great and it\u2019s very easy to change discs, even if one is playing. It was sold as new, but when I went to register it, I was informed it was registered to someone else. I also found out that there is nothing I can do if anything goes wrong except pay for it because the warranty is not in my name. So I knocked off two stars and probably should have done more. If I have trouble with the machine, then there will be a one star review.",

Repairs are under warranty but I have to contact repair shop to have them done.Long story short-- The CD player is a piece of junk and the customer service sucks.

It has a great sound and it works flawlessly moving back and forth on a track as I replay a phrase as to learn the song properly. I play in a rock cover band and I load this baby up and pick my disc and track just play, play, play. I've had it for a few months now and I think it works great.",

The mechanics seem ok, but even though it will transport discs and select them, it doesn't seem to want to spin them. Again, when on the workbench, the spindle clearly worked. Time to try the Integra six-cd changer.",
