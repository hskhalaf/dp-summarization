If you have a weak grip or small hands it may be more difficult to use due to how wide the handle is and where they keep the trigger. But I have OCD and it really helps with cleaning! You get what you pay for!",

      "text": "This product seems to work just fine, floor cleaned well. I love the swivel ability. However, it's top heavy and you have to pull the trigger to get steam so you get some muscle fatigue from continually having to pull the trigger. It reminded me of snowmobiling where your thumb gets tired. Due to it's multi functional ability, the water source is on top and it's just too top heavy. I'm sure I'll like this a lot more once I start using some of the other attachments for bathroom, etc.",
