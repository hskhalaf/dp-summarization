The color is very beautiful and the fact that it resists water makes it great. Also with this speaker you can charge your cell phone, believe me it can save you in an emergency. I have used it with different cell phones and even now I have it connected to my computer. It is an excellent speaker and I definitely recommend it to everyone and that, personally, I would buy it again. Note: The charger cable is very weak so I recommend to buy another one.",

So I went to an electronics store where the clerk tried several cords, and none of them worked. He said that he's seen a few other JBL speakers like this that had the same problem, and he thought the mini-usb port was defective. This was a lot of money wasted for only getting to use the speaker through one full battery life. I suggest you can find a more reliable speaker with just as good a sound (the sound WAS good) at a better price point and reliable charging system. I'd stay away from this speaker.",

I also listen almost exclusively to electronic bass music so I am in no way testing the speaker diversly but in this area I absolutely love it. It remains sharp and full at high volume ranges and just has a giant presence in the sound quality. I also appreciate that it's a battery bank as I usually have it when I travel which means I can also easily recharge my devices. The only reason I gave it the four stars is that it's amazing but likely only to an unbalanced audience.",

Now looking for a replacement but it won't be a JBL. Very disappointing as I enjoyed the sound so much That I was considering purchasing their larger $500 speaker.",
