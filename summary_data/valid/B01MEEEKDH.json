I highly recommend anyone looking for great cross ties that your horses can't break. They poles will break before these do. I can say enough about how much these have been a huge benefit for vetting and farrier work. I know that they are meant to be used for a boat.But sometimes you just got to take a blind leap of faith and I am excited that I did rescue horses can be very difficult and dangerous at first but with these it took a lot of the danger away when getting their health up to where it should be.",
