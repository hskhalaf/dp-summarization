Its bulky to carry loaded with the seat and the booster, but wasn't super uncomfortable. Our trip wasn't direct flight so I was handled often by the airports, and survived with some minor scuffs. I was impressed with how well it held up. Would by again.",

Shoulder straps are comfortable to wear; other straps make it easy to grab the bag just about anywhere (e.g., for easy bag-claim retrieval). Withstood typical TSA handling well. Like the velcro flap at the top; you can tuck the long drawstrings into the bag & the flap will help keep them in, so they don't catch on anything else. Tons of room in the bag; can't imagine there's a seat out there that wouldn't fit. We were also able to easily slip a couple of additional items in the bag that we couldn't fit or had forgotten to put in our other checked bags.",

Although I love the reversible pouch it comes with, I wish it was a little easier to fold and fit back into the pouch. A very minor inconvenience, otherwise it's a great travel bag.",

Most others I looked at basically were a one use thing because they don't hold up. This is well worth the little bit added cost and was still on the cheaper end of others I looked at.",

      "text": "So far we have made three trips with this bag. It is way too big for our infant car seat, but surprisingly that didn\u2019t affect its use as a backpack: it actually carries really well, and I can easily drag two additional suitcases behind me while this thing is on my back. An advantage of the large size is that it will carry larger car seats (or even multiple car seats) in the future. Also, right now I can totally sneak an extra bag in there without the airline noticing \ud83d\ude0a",

We had no problems packing up the carseat and the after one round trip through the airport the bag still looks brand new. I love the durable straps for carrying it as a backpack and the bright green colored straps make it very easy to find at baggage claim. Although it doesn't have any added padding to protect the carseat, it has plenty of space to add some diapers for insulation.",

It almost could be smaller to stay closer onto my back when walking with it (but you get used to it). Definitely recommend if you want to travel with a car seat through an airport, or really if you're transporting it anywhere you'd need to carry it for a while.",

Pro tip- if you will not be traveling with another adult and have a carseat and a 2yo, consider paying extra to rent carseat with rental car and put 2 yo in harness (leash). Yep, leash.. go ahead and fight me. I dont give a crap.",
