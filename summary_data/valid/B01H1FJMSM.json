Whether you're a casual sunset hiker, playing cornhole at a barbeque, or base jumping in a speedo this will keep your ice cold brewski on deck. This neck coozie is a necessity in every beer drinkers arsenal; rumor has it, it can also be used for beverages other than beer, but I've never actually tested this theory myself. If you're on the fence of whether to order this or not, free up your hands and get over the fence.",

I used one while fly fishing on the lower Sac a couple weeks ago and it was perfect. It is comfortable to wear too... No seams or scratchiness. I have actually started wearing this around the house while taking care of the kids too. I was always losing my drink and the kids were always knocking it over, so this solves both issues!",
