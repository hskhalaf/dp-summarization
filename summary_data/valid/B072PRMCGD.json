      "text": "I purchased two of these-one for my daughter\u2019s new Toyota Corolla SE (blue trim) and one for my 2016 Volvo XC90 Inscription (black trim). My steering wheel is 14.25 inches in diameter and my daughter\u2019s is 14.5 inches in diameter. These covers have dressed up the steering wheels and given them a nice chunkier feel. My steering wheel is heated (which I only use late December through early March), so I don\u2019t know how much heat I will feel during those months. I\u2019m very pleased and installation only took a few minutes but I did leave them in the cars overnight in our Houston heat and they were pliable enough to put on with a very nice snug fit.",

There are threads that come off immediately- which was weird considering I hadn't used it yet. This product doesn't come with a tag, brand name, or instructions.

So we left it on the car seat for an hour or so. This VW wheel is already substantial in size, but even with the cover it\u2019s still quite comfortable for my not so large female hands. Very nice quality leather and worth the very attractive price. Highly recommend.",

Understand that this is not a sewn-on cover to replace your factory steering wheel finish. The seams are visible and you might see and/or feel them. Simply line up your center point, I recommend starting at the top and working down, start rotating the cover with your hands firmly gripped on the cover. At the bottom you will have to pull the rear seam over the wheel and it will take a little strength. Then rotate your grip front to back to adjust. Take your time and it should fit very well.",
