      "text": "We desperately needed to find something to help our foster dog with his separation anxiety. He absolutely hates when we leave and barks and barks in his crate. I decided to order a pack of these collars to try. They seem to make him feel a little more calm and they smell great! I was really impressed that they seemed to make a difference. They are the perfect size for the dog, a 70lb. Labrador, and I didn't need to cut it down at all, as to leave it loose for easier removal. Would definitely recommend these to anyone with a nervous/anxious dog as something to try.",

We recently bought a new car and the dog whines constantly because she has to ride on the backseat by herself. We put a collar on her and she just curled up in her bed and went to sleep. DAP may not be effective for all dogs, but it works well for ours. The price here cannot be beat.",

They use these when walking, and training, to get them socialized while being a little more calm during the process. This isn't a quick fix and won't fix behavior issues on it's own... but it is a great tool to put your dog at ease while moving forward with training. I wouldn't expect a hyper active dog, that doesn't get walked often, to just calm down and all of the sudden start to behave! Great product, when used correctly, or a quick fix to introduce your pup to a new situation with less stress.",

This is a well made collar, that you can size. She didn't completely change, but I do feel this has helped her relax a little. And that is worth it. The smell also will last the full 30 days.

      "text": "It works, but there's quite a strong smell (almost floral). It bothers me and, I assume, bothers our dog. Wish they could do away with the scent. Other pheromone collars don't have it, so I assume it's added to cover up the pheromone scent for us humans. I'd prefer an unscented version. Felt bad forcing our dog to have this inches from his nose 24/7. It's too bad, because otherwise the product works and calms our senior dog. Three stars only for the smell.",

The stalking became murderous, the peeing became solid, under foot became bite your foot off, etc. So, even if you don't see immediate or strong results, it's still doing something.
