      "text": "It was a good guitar while it lasted. It wasn't excellent or great, but good for it's value. I rarely play it since I went back to school, if anything, about 3 hours per week. In less than a month, the E string snapped. I stopped playing until I could get it repaired. Then suddenly the screw that was holding down the top portion of the guitar fell out. I have no idea what happened and am pretty irate at the fact that I dropped around $100 and this guitar snaps so easily. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This product is dysfunctional.",

She is completely happy! It comes with a mini amp. If you are an advanced or professional guitar player then this would not be the guitar for you. But for beginner it is wonderful. It is a great price and allows them to learn and see if they even want to continue with the instrument, which half of the time kids and teens quit after a couple years, so why make a huge investment?",

A cheap little clip-on tuner was also a very worthwhile purchase. I first tried tuning the guitar with the original strings and it couldn't hold a note for crap. The Ernies were fantastic, though. I am an absolute beginner and bought this guitar to use with Rocksmith for learning. Very happy so far!",

I was surprised at the quality for this price. If you're starting out or need a 2nd guitar to practice on I would recommend this one .",

      "text": "I was worried at first when I made this purchase after reading some reviews, but I really love my guitar!! It came in quick and without any scratches or breaks in the packaging. The little amp it comes with is very nice! It produces such a big sound for a little amp and comes with overdrive built in. I like how the guitar looks black at certain angles and blue at others. You almost think its black, but when you get closer you see its beautiful blue. The only thing is that I wish it came with instructions or a picture explaining what the dials and knobs mean.",

The little amp has a very clean and clear sound, which is fine, but I hooked it up, instead, to my somewhat bigger amp with a \"gain\" knob to achieve distortion and, therefore, to get that classic louder, fuzzy, rock and roll guitar sound. The amp is great for beginners, this is really no complaint, but just keep in mind you'll probably want to get a bigger amp before long if you are a rock music fan.",

The guitar goes out of tune easily and also the frets are not installed on the right place causing the note to be different which is not recognized by Rocksmith. Another thing is the action on the guitar string is rather low, which makes the buzzing sound during regular play. This fact makes it very frustrating for guitar beginners. Other than guitar, I do love the accessories that came with it.",

If you are looking for a slightly nicer beginner Stratocaster style guitar I would recommend a squire, but if you\u2019re just looking to see if electric guitar is for you than this guitar will do perfectly.",

I learned a few cool chords, and the practice amp wasn't terrible, but after a few days of trying to practice with it, the subpar quality really started to show. The Low E is virtually impossible to keep in tune or strum hard enough without it flying all over the place. All the strings lose tune after a few days, and the overall quality of the neck is pretty low. I didn't realise just how bad it was until I picked up a real guitar. It'll get you interested in learning, but you're better off just saving an extra hundred bucks and buying a real guitar.",

But if you replace the amp it\u2019s a good starter for rock and metal. Not great if you want an acoustic style sound though. My advice, but this and learn.

His parents, nor we grandparents, couldn't believe the quality, sound, etc of this electric guitar. It is a great buy for anyone starting out",

The guitar is good, pretty hard to tune as it doesn't really stay tuned for long before going back out of tune. Also parts of the wood were kind of rough and I felt as though I may get a splinter, it just needed a bit more sanding down. Other than that its a good beginner pack.",

It seems small but it's rather difficult to get out and if left alone vibrates annoyingly. Other than that amp is nice and smooth with comfortable stamps.",
