      "text": "I had originally received this phone for free when originally joining Sprint with a two year contract. It is a simple phone that fails often. I take good care of my electronics. I never dropped this phone or did anything else to it that would result in damage. It froze often, would overheat, and would randomly shut off. After only a year of owning it (I only used it for phone calls and texting), the screen became permanently white. Nothing would fix it and Sprint would not replace it. I purchased a refurbished one so that I could finish out my contract. It is a poor phone and I can only say that it was a disappointment... even for free.",

Although the phone was fully charge when it was shipped, I plug it to the charger, and nothing happen. I waited for hours... Nothing.... Do not buy. Note: my phone did have a clear esn. But still, what's an active phone when it can't be charged and used? Waste of time and money.",
