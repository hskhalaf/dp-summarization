A little smaller than Oakley holbrook's. very lightweight very comfortable well made I'd buy them again. I'm thinking about putting some gray gradient lenses in them and making them some super bangers. By the way the gray lenses are actually green and this has happened to me before with electric sunglasses they say gray and they're actually green not bad though I like them anyways.",

Because the frames looked exactly as pictured i don't think they mistakenly sent me the wrong glasses, i think they just don't have what is pictured, which sucks. My glasses also came slightly messed up. The right side didn't fully open or close because they had a slight bend in them. I've never had any issues with these glasses before, this is my third pair and only because i lost the first 2 over the years, so i think it was just a fluke, but either way it wasn't great.",

Although not polarized, they are super clear and take the glare off of things really well and are a lot darker than they look. Definitely a pair of glasses that are plenty worth their price",

      "text": "Look exactly as pictured and the lens quality was good but they fell apart quickly. The arms always moved a little too easily and then one of the arms fell off less than four months after purchase. I'm not exactly wearing these whilst participating in Ironman competitions so them falling apart after standard use is disheartening. I was able to get the arm fixed and now they're fine but these are a little pricey to fall apart that quickly. Great glasses though, love the look and overall quality, it's just the hinges that are cheap.",
