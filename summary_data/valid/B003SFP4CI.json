The description clearly says it has one, says that you must charge the battery pack for 24 hours prior to use, but when I opened it up I saw that there was no charger or battery pack included. In fact, there no place to even connect one. Just be aware of this before you buy if it's something you need. We needed it but now have to run a 100' extension cord for this.",
