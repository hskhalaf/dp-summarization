We renovated a house that had been sitting empty for several years but never took the time to replace the glass shower doors. We tried CLR, scrub brush drill attachment, baking soda, bleach, etc and nothing remotely worked. After reading other reviews, we gave this a try and it worked perfectly. Shower glass is completely transparent. Even worked on the faucets and old hard water clay stains in the bottoms of the shower floors and bathtubs. Just ordered our 2nd bottle.

I tried all of the brands at grocery store and the hardware store and they were mediocre at best. I can only find this on Amazon and when I ran out it, I went back to the grocery store brands temporarily. Yuk. I can tell a difference so now I am going to stock up because I like a clean, shiny stovetop.",
