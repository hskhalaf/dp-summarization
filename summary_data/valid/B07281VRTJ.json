We switch boards sometimes and I get great rides on the Grom and I'm not a small guy (weigh about 240 lbs). I grew up body surfing in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and currently live in VA Beach. I'm about to buy another one as a birthday present for a close family friend. You won't regret this purchase - it helps make great beach memories.",

If you know how to body surf or boogie board, you will get this. What makes it fun is you can ride all the waves. Even the small waves, I was going all the way to chest in sand at the shore. Cool thing, I will always have this at the beach.",

And it was pretty solid with the waves on the smaller side it was ok on the bigger ones but had a rough landing. I would pick this over a boogie board 9 times out of 10 just because of the lightweight and compact design, it was so easy to catch a wave and then dive right back in to the next one. This board is flawless the design is sleek and the feel of the board is great. I recommend this board to beginners all the way up to the pros. 10/10",

If there is enough surf, the grom is easy to catch waves with, but for waves that flatten out and turn into slop, you need a little more to keep you going. I am a strong swimmer, but sometimes the waves lose power around here and you need a bit more for a longer ride. When the surf is really pulling, you can't go wrong with these guys!",
