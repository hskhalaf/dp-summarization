I switch hands holding the Kindle when I read and I thought it would be nice to be able to turn the page when I hold it with my left (I know, first world problem). However, I was sorely disappointed. Sometimes the response lagged greatly, other times it would jump two pages with one press. I ended up just using touchscreen to save myself the trouble of relocating. Personally I also feel the loading is not as fast and smooth as the Paperwhite. Maybe I just got a lemon.",

It's fast, the page turn bezel is wonderful, and the image so sharp. I love that it's thinner and lighter and much more comfortable to hold, especially for long hours.

Well, the buttons on this one don't work quite as nicely as I'd hoped they would, but boy, the resolution on this baby is great! Well worth the upgrade just for that. I just realized that supposedly the Voyage has the same resolution as the Paperwhite, but still, it looks so much better than that; maybe it's the number of LEDs and the adaptive brightness, I don't know, all I know that I enjoy reading a lot more since I've got the Voyage.",

      "text": "I've had the Voyage for 4 years and simply love it. It's easy to hold, and the page press functionality is great on either hand. It has very nice features such as the adaptive lighting, many different fonts, and of course the ppi300 is super sharp for reading. There are many different cases for it and over the years I've collected a few. The battering charge is great. For an avid reader, the initial charge is about 2-3 weeks (if you read more than 30 minutes a day). Although it is a bit pricey, I don't see how anyone can go wrong since it'll last for years because of its' great quality. The Voyage truly enhances the reading experience.",

In fact, the only thing that makes me a little crazy is the on/off button on the back. Why? Why not just put it on the top/bottom like my other Kindles? That said, five stars means five stars.",

My biggest pet peeve about the Paperwhite was the location of the power button. (Now if I had my dream ebook, it would be the Voyage, in color, with audible capabilities.)

I can't imagine not having the sensor buttons while shopping and arranging. The contrast is great. If you're on the line with this and paperwhite, I recommend this for sure. Paying a bit more for something you'll use for years is an excellent investment. The youtube vids I watched before buying don't give it justice. There's so much more to this Kindle.",

Most other devices will automatically update out of the box or at least allow you to connect to update.

After using it only for a couple of time, it's obvious the Voyage is a better Kindle than the Oasis. If you're a first timer and got more cash to buy for a Kindle, then my advice is buy the Voyage. The form factor of the Voyage: thin, light, and not square, makes it better than Paperwhite and Oasis altogether.",

The combination of all these make the Voyage convenient for one-handed operation for protracted periods. Tip: to bypass the ad displayed every time you turn it on (unless you pay the premium to eliminate ads entirely), press one of the pressure points for page advance instead of swiping the screen.",

This forces me to hold the power button until it restarts. A second outcome of the freeze is that Whispersync doesn't remember where the book you were.
