The only thing I would caution is to make sure you hang this on a door that closes the same direction of your pulling. Meaning if you're pulling the TRX toward you with a workout, that door should be a door that also pulls closed. It works okay on doors that open toward you, but I have better piece of mind that I'm not just relying on a thin lock bar",
