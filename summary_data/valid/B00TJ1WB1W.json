So now I have 2 choices. 1 keep it and pay to unlock it or return for refund. This is now the 4th time I bought an unlocked phone and had this happen. Will repost if any information comes to light about this problem.",

The battery is bad you charge it full and when you don't even use it and if little it goes way down I constantly have to charge the phone. I like Samsung products but this phone by far the worse for me just use it for basic texts and emails. Looking to buy another one hopefully I have better luck!!",

      "text": "I've had this phone for about a little over a year. My main complaint is that it is a lot slower than other comparable models. Frequently it freezes up for 10-20 seconds, then starts responding again. It does however have a great display like most Samsung devices do and the camera is decent. The phone came with a 1 year warranty. With light use, the phone finally failed completely after 1 year and 2 months of light use. Just 2 months past the warranty. I am not sure if these lower end Samsung devices are worth it. I may look for another brand next time.",
