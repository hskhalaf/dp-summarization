We got him this for Christmas, and it was the only gift he cared about. He wouldn't open any other gifts after getting to it. His sister had to do the rest of them. He has been \"vacuuming\" for 4 days straight. When I vacuum, he follows along side me with it. It is a lot quieter than I expected. The sound doesn't get annoying. I love it! If it ever breaks, I'll buy him another.",

I was expecting more based on the headline and the reviews I had read. It barely picks up anything. A couple pieces of dog hair at best. But it looks nice and is a fun teaching toy for the LO's. I like this kid vacuum better than other kid toy vacuums because it looks realistic. I am only disappointed in it not being true to the advertisement and description.",
