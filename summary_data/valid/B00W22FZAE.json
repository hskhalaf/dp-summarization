Cedar is better than hay as it dry quicker, deters mold and pests. The material doesn't mat our dog's hair, huge star for that. Best part is I dump out the chips, wash it in a bucket with Dawn, and fold it up for the next year. This is the 3rd year and it's held up great.",

We live in Florida and it\u2019s summertime which means we are ALWAYS in the water. I LOVE that these towels dry super fast and are really pretty vibrant colors (I have gotten so many compliments and everyone wants to know where I got them). Yes, they are thin (which is the point) but that doesn\u2019t diminish their usefulness. They are super light weight and have seriously cut down on the bulkiness of my pool/beach bag. I plan to buy one of every color! Worth the price, you won\u2019t regret it.",

The beaches we went to were the pebble kind, so I can't tell you how they do with sand. But they dried quickly and were nice and big. My only negative is that when I washed them for the first time, I threw them in the wash with my new white microfibre pillowcases. I followed all washing instructions, but the dark colors on the stripes of the towels still bled onto my pillowcases and the white stripes of the towels. Other than that, these are great beach towels.",

I ALMOST didn\u2019t pack these at the end because space in our bags was so small. But I\u2019m so glad we did! They were probably our most used items in the trip. They were used at pools and beaches, as picnic blankets, and even once I put on my train seat because the AC was broken on the train and we were so sweaty. The pouch it came in was perfect to shove our keys, money, jewelry while we were swimming. So many people asked me where I got them.",

I'm fairly tall, which is why I opted for the larger size, smaller sizes are available at less cost, but I thought the price was great, less than you'd pay for a quality towel at some department stores.",

They dry quickly so my kids can use the same towel for the whole swim meet. They have held up very well- my kids have used them a lot and they are not showing any signs of wear. I am looking forward to trying them out at the beach this summer. No need for a giant beach bag because these towels are nice and compact.",

Great for boating - we aren\u2019t hauling big bulky beach towels back and forth.",
