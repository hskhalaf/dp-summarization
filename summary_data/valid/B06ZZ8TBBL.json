The curtains looked really nice and the quality of the material felt thick and heavy. We paired it with our movie projection screen and it all looked very good together. During our shadow skit we saw no light coming through the curtains and we can't wait to use it with our black light setup too. Overall it came quickly, the fabric was perfect and we didn't even have to steam or iron the material at all. We are actually looking at purchasing more!! Super pleased!",
