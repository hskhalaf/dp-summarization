      "text": "My son and I used these on a recent camping trip as liners in our sleeping bags. We were tenting in temps approximately upper 40s. These bags gave us both some welcome extra warmth. I don't think you'd want this alone at 50 deg but maybe around 70 deg it would be ok by itself. They pack down reasonably small, and while they aren't especially lightweight for backpacking, they fit our needs just fine for Cub Scout camp. The fabric is soft and warm just like your favorite throw blanket at home.",

I wound up with the green one, and color is unimportant to me but wish they had shown all colors available on the listing. It makes a decent light weight blanket when completely unzipped, or for a throw on the couch to snuggle under.",

I unrolled one and they\u2019re very thin, but soft. I like that they\u2019re easy to repack by folding in thirds. The elastic band to hold it together is a smart touch when shimmying it back into the storage bag. The zippers seem really heavy duty. Too bad the first impression was off!",

If you want a Liner without a zipper they make that too as well an they pack up smaller. This however is not overly heavy at all. light duty but warm might add 10-15 degrees warmth in your bag who knows will update when Camp tested, only used it at home so far. Included Drawstring stuff sack with breathable mesh perforation Strip. Buyer beware color is random from here but i knew this an ended up with grey ;-].",

He slept comfortably at the Jamboree and we took it on a camping trip after he returned home. After four machine washings, it still looks and works great. He will take this with him and use as a liner in his mummy bag for winter camping in January. Would love to get a couple more of these when the budget allows. (we got the rust color)",
