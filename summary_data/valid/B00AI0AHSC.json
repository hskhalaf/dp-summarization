However, just like some other reviewers mentioned, the magnito feature does not light the burner after the first use. I've been using a manual lighter which is not a big deal, but it is sold with a magnito feature that does not work. Since I saw other reviewers' post complaining about this problem before I purchased, I anticipated it wouldn't work. Just know this before you order in case this is important to you.",
