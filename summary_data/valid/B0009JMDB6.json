Long story short, I was so happy with the first one that I bought a second (to fully accommodate a 1/2 cord of wood). It is fairly easy to put together (took me ~ 30 minutes each, but for anyone reasonably competent it'd take maybe 10-15 minutes). Super sturdy, the cover is great, they look good, and get the job done. Seems like a product that will last forever based on the quality, which is hard to find. Ended up spending $300+ for two of these but am happy I didn't go for a cheap option.",

Oh, and make very sure it's EXACTLY where you want it, before you load it up. I need to move one end about two inches, but it won't budge until I unload that wood.",
