Great value - material is quality and style is flattering.Worked well for semi active beach/hiking activities, kept everything in place.

I'm 5'10\" and 150-155lbs, 34C, size8/10. I ordered a medium; bottoms and top fit perfect, no weird muffin top or unflattering tight bottom issues (which usually I end up ordering large bottoms medium/sm top when I buy suits).",

We ordered this swimsuit in black, size XS. It fits her perfectly. I like that the top has padding (removable) to cover and support, but not so much that it looks like she has implants. The bottoms are a little skimpy for a mother's taste, but they cover her assets and have a cute strappy design along the sides. The suit has held up in a highly chlorinated pool and two washings on regular cycle. No shrinkage or fading so far. Great suit for a great price.",

I am a small bit worried that the straps are a wee bit skinny and will some day pop off and expose my breasts to the beachgoers, but they seem well-stitched to the cups, so I'm going to put it out of my mind.

      "text": "So disappointing! The material is beautiful, but I don\u2019t know who would have the body shape of this suit. I got an extra-large because according to the size chart and clothes that I buy, I am a 16-18 in swimsuits. The bottom wasn\u2019t bad, and I would have liked to have kept it. The top, however . . . oh, dear. Very skimpy, uncomfortable, and probably more like a size small. I couldn\u2019t even get into it. Don\u2019t bother unless you have a strangely shaped body.",

I thought for sure I was sending it back but instead I pulled up the picture of it and figured out how to wrap it. It looks fantastic and fits perfectly. Surprisingly it also stays in place while swimming too! Great purchase.",
