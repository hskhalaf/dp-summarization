The boys gave it a thorough workout for about an hour and it is still in great shape for my girls team. Only time will tell how it wears but so far so good. It is NOT a regular soccer ball. It is rubber and has batteries, thus a little heavier. It is pretty close though and the guys were able to launch it pretty good.",
