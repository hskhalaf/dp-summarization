The arch almost hits where it should, but is just a wee bit too short when standing. I have thick ankles, but these fit perfectly and feel very comfortable at the top of the shaft and are smooth inside where the elastic is. They are easy to get on and off and the color is so pretty. The only thing I don't like is that they clomp on hard floors.",

I've had water and dust splashed on them, but the leather actually takes a fair amount of abuse pretty well, so no need to be precious with them. They're easy to break in and very walkable. The only reason for the four-star rating is that the elastic gore has a plastic seam on the top that does get a little itchy after wearing the shoes for a bit, and will leave a red rub mark on my ankle.",
