I had bought a KastKing Royale Legend Baitcasting reel before this one and it was just a backlash magnet. I thought it was just because I was inexperienced, but nope was not the case. The Torrent performed beautifully on my first outing with it. Only had one or two back lashes, in about a hundred casts. This reel is amazing. Hope it holds up over time, and I expect it will.",

This is an awesome reel and I gotta say I would definitely recommend this to people just starting out or on a budget. I mounted it on an ugly stik gx2 medium heavy fast action rod and it is an awesome combination. Attached is a photo of a 4.5 to 5 pound bass I caught on my fourth cast with this reel. Will definitely be buying more Piscifun products.",

It felt nice right out of the package, but when I took it fishing, it felt stiff. it would either cast far but get backlashed and make a rattling noise, or it would only cast about 10 feet and be really stiff. The kastking Royale legend is MUCH better. just go with that one.",

The reel has performed well with heavy lures and #3-5 spinners using 12# pound mono and up to 30# Berkley fireline. Make sure you oil it before you use it, once you tune the reel to your bait/lure and adjust the brake to your experience then it performs very well. When I have the extra cash I will try out one of the 4000-5000 series spinning reels with heavy drag for fall add winter steelhead.",

      "text": "You could lay on a table 4 different baitcasters, all costing well over $200 except for the Torrent by Piscifun, use all four of them blindfolded, and you would never know a $40 reel was in the lineup. You may even guess the $40 to be the highest quality one of all. Will absolutely be purchasing more, the reviews don't lie. And aren't exaggerated. I've used baitcasters since I was 11, and the value for the money with the Torrent is unmatched.",

So if you already know how to and want to get a bait caster get the Phantom hands down. If you are trying to learn the Torrent is great. I will be keeping this in the car pm all the road trips",
