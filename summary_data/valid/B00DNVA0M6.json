The different modes are brilliant for when you can't be bothered to think about what you're doing but it's also nice to be able to control the shutter speed and aperture for when you want to get creative. It's a really small size so great for hoidays. Most importantly, the picture quality is excellent. It does take a bit of getting used to - the shutter feels like it's in the wrong place and the pop up flash is a bit awkward, but after a few days it's fine.",
