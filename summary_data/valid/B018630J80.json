      "text": "I've tried all the recommended, super chemically, products for cat urine in carpet. Nothing worked! It just masked the smell with an even worse chemically smell. UNTIL THIS! This was recommended on Instagram and i'm so glad i tried it! It's been the only thing to not only get rid of the smell, but actually remove pet stains. I also love that it's natural and better for you and your home! Because of it's super strong concentration, this bottle is going to last me forever!",

I did 2 capfuls for a 100oz tank and even then I still had a bit of a gummy feel after rinsing the carpet, which was no big deal. Pulled a lot of nasties out of the carpets and effectively vanquished the dog puke on my sofa. Thanks puracy!",
