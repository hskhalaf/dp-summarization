While super easy to set up, it did not perform as well as current Sagemcom Fast 5260, so this will be going back. Maybe my Spectrum router is better than I thought as I just assumed anything would be better than what cable companies issue.",

    "description": "Motorola's MR1700 AC1700 WiFi Gigabit Router is able to transmit high-speed WiFi data over a wide area, even to distant rooms in large homes. One reason is 4 antennas for the 2.4 GHz frequency band, the best band for sending WiFi to distant locations. The MR1700 also performs very well in apartments and condominiums that are bombarded by wireless noise from neighbors. Model MR1700\u2019s wireless performance is outstanding when used with smartphones, HDTVs, computers, game stations, and other wireless devices. This WiFi router has better range than much more expensive routers, which typically have only 3 antennas for the important 2.4 GHz frequency band. MR1700 setup is fast and easy, with phone, email, and Web support from the USA. 2 year warranty from Motorola.",
