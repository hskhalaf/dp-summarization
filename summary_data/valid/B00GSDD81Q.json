We've had some cold days recently, and I've been able to walk around outside for extended periods while remaining warm and cozy. I saw on some of the reviews that some people had issues with the feathers coming out, but I've been wearing this coat almost every single day since I received it and haven't encountered that problem! If you live somewhere like I do where the temperatures can drop into the single digits, this is definitely the coat to buy! 10/10!",

I read it in other reviews and took the chance anyway. So far, only the outside sheds. The silver insulating lining isn't shedding yet. Also, it offers little to no protection from the wind. Nice idea, by the way, the silver lining (see what I did there?) Not sure if it will work like a heat blanket but I like the thought. I will keep this jacket because it fits well and is cute. The shedding isn't so bad as to make me return it - yet.",

Also, there are small feathers coming out everywhere. This is my first Columbia coat and I had very high expectations.

The coat packs very nicely too and doesn't take much room at all in a suitcase. Would definitely purchase again.",

Today I wore it in 14 degree weather felt like 2 with a 11mph wind and I was perfectly warm almost hot. Inside my house I was sweating. Can't wait to test it when we have -13 wind chill because I'm certain I will be cozy in my coat. I bought a L and the sizing was spot on too.",
