Only one little problem. IT NO LONGER WORKS. Sony discontinued the internet service for this device in February of 2016. I will be asking for a refund. By the way, the only reason I found out about the service stoppage? I checked with the Sony website when it was at the 45min mark just looking for updates.

    "title": "Sony DMXNV1 Bravia Internet Video Link",
    "description": "The BRAVIA Internet Video Link is an optional module that connects to DMeX\u2013ready BRAVIA televisions. It allows access to streaming Internet video entertainment from popular sites with which Sony has partnered with. Navigation is fun and easy. The Xross Media Bar\u2122 on-screen interface gives you access to a rich amount of content at no additional charge with your existing broadband connection. With the push of a button, a customized page based on your zip code automatically delivers the latest news, weather, and traffic straight to your BRAVIA TV.Would you rather huddle around a PC display to watch streaming online videos and content from popular Internet video sites or view it on your large screen BRAVIA HDTV while sitting comfortably in the family room? The choice is now easy thanks to the BRAVIA Internet Video Link module.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe BRAVIA Internet Video Link (BIVL) is a small module that attaches discreetly to the back of a selection of select Sony BRAVIA LCD flat-panel television models, and seamlessly streams on-demand entertainment via an existing Ethernet connection including movies, TV programs, your favorite YouTube videos and a variety of other free content as well as news, weather and traffic information without the use of a personal computer. A broadband connection of at least 2.5 Mbps is recommended. Content is easily navigated with Sony\u2019s Technical Emmy award-winning Xross Media Bar user interface.\n\n\n\n\nWe should say something about what the BIVL is not. The BIVL does not give you access to the full internet on your television, but it does give you access to a large number of rich media channels, including some video-on-demand, some of which are exclusive to BIVL. Access to all of the channels is free, although there may be a charge for some of the content available through video-on-demand channels (e.g. movies). At the time of this writing, the content available via the BIVL includes:\n * Amazon Instant Video -- Watch more than 50,000 movies and TV shows for as little as $0.99 each (Learn more about AVOD on BIVL)\n   \n * YouTube -- millions of user-created videos\n   \n * full episodes of CBS television programs\n * CBS College Sports broadcasts\n * Wired.com -- exclusive original reporting (some serious, some funny) on technology and video gaming\n   \n * C-Spot -- original character and story-driven episodic series\n * Yahoo!\n * AOL\n * Sports Illustrated\n * blip.tv\n * Cond\u00e9Net\u2019s Style.com and Men.Style.com\n * Epicurious and Concierge.com channels\n * Sony Pictures\u2019 Crackle\n * The Minisode Network (condensed versions of television programs)\n * Inside Sony Pictures channel\n * FEARnet\n * Ford Models\n * SingingFool\n   \n * VideoDetective.\n\n\n\nThe Bravia Internet Video Link is a small, sleek module that attached unobtrusively to the back of your compatible Bravia HDTV \n\n\n\n\n\nXROSS MEDIA BAR\nXross (pronounced Cross) is Sony's Technical-Emmy award-winning graphic user interface for Sony WEGA and BRAVIA televisions and PS3 and PSX game systems. The interface features category icons spread horizontally across the screen that organize the viewing options (TV, Music, Internet, Tools, etc...). When a category icon is selected on the horizontal bar, a vertical bar appears showing the viewing options within that category. Using the directional pad on your remote, you can easily maneuver horizontally from category to category, then scroll vertically through individual viewing options to easily navigate through the wide range of programming available on today's televisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Q&A on the Bravia Internet Video Link\n 1. What does the Bravia Internet Video Link do?\n    It delivers streaming video and entertainment content to the TV, creating a TV viewing experience using content from the Internet.\n    \n    \n 2.

What kind of content can I expect with this product?\n    You will see video content that includes user generated content, movies, music videos, movie trailers, RSS video, and other TV like content, including Amazon Instant Video.\n    \n    \n 4.
