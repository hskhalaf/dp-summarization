      "text": "My son considers this the best outdoor party prop. In fact, when he set it up in the front yard, with a safety/training line above it, he got all the neighborhood kids and teens stopping by. It does take two trees, one at each end, that are \"at least 12\" diameter.) To be sure, a hardwood could be thinner. I like the attention to detail, like a wrap around the tree that avoids injuring the tree, and a ratcheting tensioner that allows you to get the tension you need in the \"slack\" line. My biggest complaint is that I can't stay on the line anywhere near as well as my kids, but then they are in their 30s now.",

I used to use 1in tubular nylon webbing and a bunch of carabineers to do a primative setup, but this required a group of people to pull hard to get the line tight enough. Nowadays, it is difficult to find a group of people, as we are still older. I bought this kit so that I could easily set up by myself. It works extremely well, and only takes a few minutes, and a few clicks of the ratchet. It comes with a nice compact carrying bag, as well as tree protectors. I would highly recommend this for experienced slackliners as well as beginners.",

I appreciated that a bag was included as now I have a place to store it and its easy to transport. The bag was even big enough for me to throw in some granola bars for the park. I love too that this company donates 10% of their profits to charity. I would highly recommend the zero gravity slackline!",

The quality of the line and tension mechanism is great. I hear the larger lines are easier to walk on which also helped me decide on this on.
