I bought them after seeing the codechaos won mygolfspys most wanted spikeless shoe testing and wanting something with better traction than my old puma spikeless shoes. So far they\u2019ve worked and felt great. Hopefully they last a long time.",

Which was unexpected because They are not known for having very cushioned shoes. I like the nontraditonal look of them. I have high hopes for the Boa System. Wearing around the house I like how snug the shoe feels with the Boa System. will update if there anything new to report when I play in them.",

Mine came in a repackaged box and was clearly worn to the point they didn't bother to clean out the mud in the spikes. The forefoot seems thin on support, I just feel the ball of my foot is right next to the ground with hardly any cushion in between. Love Adidas bounce shoes (5) but this one needs more engineering.",

I have a pair of NB shoes for walking with the similar sock fit and wished they had a shoe like that for golf.. this is it.. if I wasn't convinced my first round with them, I was when we had cart path round only during a brutal hot day in central florida... These things honestly didn't even feel like I walked at all. Great shoes!",

Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t take these on the course to try them out, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt the soles would keep you grounded well. Sizing wise; every adidas shoe I own, I have to go down a half size for a good fit.",
