In it I'm processing pineapple and orange juice. It bothers me that the pulp still has so much juice left in it that I'm unable to get out. But I wanted something cheap and I guess you can't have it all.",

Unfortunately, I was't able to use this juicer until after my 30 return window expired thinking it would be fine - but it wasn't I'm giving it away. The really unfortunate part is that I've recommended this juicer to two people and hopefully they can return it. I bought another brand with 1100w motor. Hoping this is the difference.",

If you want to be really cheap just use an Oster blender and a cheese cloth bag. No one needs a $100 plus blender -they are just lifestyle cherries for the foolish and stupid. Most people get sick of juicing after a single spurt so get this one, save your money and splurge the savings on quality veggies.",

I\u2019ll be honest, I hadn\u2019t done much research on juicers nor did I read the the instructions but this was so easy to use and results were great! I\u2019ve used it every day since I received it and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Can\u2019t wait to experiment with more recipes. Oh, and very easy to clean, the brush is 100% awesome for the blade and everything is dishwasher safe-can\u2019t beat that! I need to make sure to have something easy to clean for busy days and just any day! Lol",

Is one. I juice everyday and it works so fine for me. Main thing for me is cleaning! It\u2019s so easy literally can take the parts off, wash and put back on. I just hate the brush they have with it to clean the metal grinder part. The bristles get stuck in it all the time and rip off buttttt still amazing",

The pulp rarely even makes it to the pulp container. It all gets clogged either in the metal part itself or in the plastic above. Pulp receptacle\u2019s bottom was broken and a very sharp broken off piece almost cut my hand. A pain to wash. I have nothing good to say about this juicer. It\u2019s an all-around terrible product. Save yourself a $100 and get something else. Update: Broke on third use. Plastic inside basically burned. See photo",

I bought the expensive Breville juicer and that one didn't last much longer than a year; and it did not extract the juice as well as this one.",

Ease of use is similar with other juicers: easy.",

The design of the pulp bin does make it a little harder to clean, since you have to use a sink sprayer or a different brush than the one that came with the juicer to get the tiny little shreds of pulp out of all the molded nooks and crannies where it tends to collect and adhere. A completely rounded, smoother design for the pulp bin would probably help a lot with that. But as for its performance, the juicer definitely delivers.",
