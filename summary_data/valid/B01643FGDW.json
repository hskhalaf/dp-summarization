HOWEVER, the amount of product you get for the price is simply ridiculous. After carefully testing the ability to retract the pencil, I was shocked to see that you only get less than one inch of the super-thin (1/16\") pencil. I thought another brand was bad for offering about two inches of the actual product, but this is even far worse with less than half the diameter and length. Uploading a photo to warn unsuspecting customers. Needless to say, I won't be repurchasing.",

My brows are dark brown/black and the dark brunette color is a perfect match. NOT REDDISH /WARM- yay!!!!! The \"lead\" part of the pencil is loose and will just fall out so you have to open it carefully and tilted upwards. I guess the \"lead\" is adjustable but mine just flops around haha. So it's nothing fancy. The spoolie works great. I would repurchase, mostly due to the color and the thin line.",

I stock up on them in case they become hard to find. I have found a light hand application controls the depth of the color also. It is close to the universal taupe advertised by some other manufacturers but is more precise. I wish the pencil would last longer but none of this type do and i really appreciate the lighter color. Since my eyebrows are an important part of my minimal makeup use I will spend the $8 every 4 to 6 weeks. To me, it's worth it.",
