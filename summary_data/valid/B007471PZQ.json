I need it for school and don\u2019t have the time to exchange so I guess I will just deal with it. For me it\u2019s a minor inconvenience. Like I said, everything else is working great!",

When it's finally on, It then displays the this message \"Your computer restarted because of a problem\" It is difficult for me to finish any project due to the above problem. Does anyone know how to fix this?",

The only problem I've had is learning to speak Apple rather than PC. I think once the transition is made it will be terrific. One thing for sure is that I'm never going back.

One issue I'm beginning to notice, though, is that the trackpad may be needing a replacement soon. The problem seems to be pretty apparent amongst the community. So, you might want to keep that in mind when deciding to purchase this version. All the positives I have for this MBPr seem to have been addressed already in other reviews, so I won't be reiterating the same thing. Other than the trackpad issue (which is covered by Apple's warranty), enjoy your MBPr once you decide to switch to Apple from PC... Haha!",

I did find the Battery not reflecting correct hours even after full charge. The MAX it would show is 2.30 hours. It should be close to 6 hours based on normal usage.

Another impressive thing is the size compared to the standard MCP 15\". This laptop is thin, lite and easy to travel with. All that being said I think this is more of a specialized laptop.

This morning, mail failed to start and then could not even do a normal or hard shut down from the display. Had to shut down with the power button, not good with the backup hard drive in use. Update as of 1/29 - instability with external trackpad has been reduced to just random occurrence. Have not had any hard crashes since initial report. Overall very satisfied. There have been 2 updates which may have addressed the hard crashes.",
