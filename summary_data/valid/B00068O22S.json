To instal you have to remove the knob on the stove which took me a little bit to figure out because the are stuck on fairly tight and i didn't want to break my stove. I ended up you tubeing it. But it worked in the end. I included a picture to help others see how they are instaled",

Maybe the knobs on our GE stove are smaller than standard, or maybe where they attach to the stove is thinner than standard, but these covers sort of hang on the knobs loosely and have nothing to grip on to at the back. So when you pull at the covers, both the cover and the knob come off. I wonder if I should try some double sided tape to attach the cover to the area behind the knob, but the instructions don't mention having to use anything like that.",

Very easy to install just take off the knob but the case first and the knob on top .",
