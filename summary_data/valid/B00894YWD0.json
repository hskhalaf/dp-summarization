SO glad I got the T4i instead of the T3i, The touch screen is something that initially I thought wouldn't matter but after using a friend's T3i, I realized how much I love my touch screen. More menu features as well compared to the T3i and although both are great, I am very happy with the T4i. I have since added several lenses to my kit and although I have joined an accessories addiction group, I am very happy with this purchase - and have convinced others to purchase the camera and they tell me they are very satisfied when I see them at group.",

      "text": "This replaced my beloved EOS Rebel XSi which snapped 50,000 pictures in the years I owned it. So the T4i had a lot to live up to and it does it without any trouble at all. It's faster, clearer, easier to use, has more features and shoots incredible video. Once you have a video camera with replaceable lenses you'll never go back. My only gripe is the autofocus motor noise when recording video. The mic sits right on top of the camera and if you don't have a STM lens you'll hear the autofocus motor. I just ordered an external mic so that should solve the problem. Other than that Canon hit a home run with this one.",

If you're looking to use the video feature, the swivel screen is so handy. If you're super serious the stereo mic isn't too important, but it's easily one of the best mics on a DSLR. I've found that I don't use the touch screen that much, but it really does help when you need to switch some settings quickly. I've always told people if you're just getting into photography, don't look to invest in the body too much, invest in lenses. Save some money, get this body, and look up to pick up another lens.",

This is great for me as I intend to use the camera for both photos and video. This is an improvement over the previous generation and they have new lenses which take advantage of the auto focus for shooting video. Those supposedly have a quiet USM type motor which is silent.",

One of the advantages of this camera over cheap[er] point and shoots is the speed. Maybe more expensive cameras are faster, but I can shoot as soon as I can turn it on and get it to my eye. (I don't use the Live view setting much at all, except to take video.) The video capability is very nice. Again, my first Full HD device, so I REALLY like it, and it works for me very well. Very likely other cameras/camcorders do better, but I'm happy with it.",

They have the same functions and do the same things, but the ease of use with the touch screen on the T4i makes it a much more painless experience. Other then that, the camera itself is great.

Other disadvantage it has is the autofocus function in live view mode. It is not as good as adverticed. Other than that, the camera is perfect. Built quality is ok, feels sturdy and if you add a battery grip to it it feels definitively professional.",

Another fact is that with cheap adapter I can use old M42 lenses with it (pentacon 50mm f1.8 for example, or Yashinon 135 f2.8). I tried camera with stock lense, and quality of photos is amazing. Battery life is good. It is easy to use, both in automatic and full manual mode. I am happy with it.",

I am still learning how to use it, but immediately, out of the box it takes much better pictures than any point and shoot I have had. I love taking pictures of my kids and their activities, but I thought since this one isa good bit bigger that I would just use it around the house and locally. I have completely changed my mind, it will be worth carrying around a little extra weight on vacataions, etc. because of the quality difference. I am really pleased with my purchase!",

Add compatibility with Canon\u2019s proven EF and EF-S lenses and a slew of EOS accessories, the Rebel T4i is an incredibly versatile tool for creating the images and videos you envision.\n\nAMAZING CAPTURE AND PROCESSING POWER\n18.0 MEGAPIXEL CMOS (APS-C) SENSOR\nThe EOS Rebel T4i features Canon\u2019s amazing 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor. Perfect for enlargements or for cropping detailed portions of the composition, the EOS Rebel T4i\u2019s sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel\u2019s light-gathering efficiency and has center pixels that aid in the EOS Rebel T4i\u2019s accurate AF performance. This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).\n\n14-BIT A/D CONVERSION\nWith 14-bit analog-to-digital conversion, the EOS Rebel T4i captures and records images with remarkable gradations and detail in subtle tones and colors, resulting in more realistic and detailed images. By recording up to 16,384 colors per channel the EOS Rebel T4i ensures that the fine detail found in subjects like foliage, sky and water are preserved and recorded with a tremendous level of accuracy, ensuring gorgeous results.\n\nISO 100\u201312800 AND EXPANDABLE TO 25600 IN H MODE\nThanks to its new DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel T4i features an expanded ISO range of ISO 100\u201312800 (expandable to 25600 in H mode) that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. The Rebel T4i, with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor\u2019s remarkable noise-reduction technology sets a new standard for Rebel cameras and low-light photography. Along with one of Canon\u2019s EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer, the EOS Rebel T4i can record beautiful images even when light sources are scarce.\n\nDIGIC 5 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe Rebel T4i is the first Rebel to feature Canon\u2019s DIGIC 5 Image Processor. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera\u2019s CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor the Rebel T4i can achieve higher ISO sensitivity, can shoot up to 5.0 fps continuously and can even perform advanced functions like HDR Backlight Control, art filters, lens correction and much more. The brilliant \u201cbrain\u201d of the camera, this imaging engine supercharges every facet of still and moving image capture.\n\nTHE FASTEST REBEL YET!\nHIGH-SPEED CONTINUOUS SHOOTING\nA Rebel first, the EOS Rebel T4i can shoot up to 5.0 frames per second, continuously. Thanks to improvements in the shutter mechanism, the mirror drive and the camera\u2019s sensor, the EOS Rebel T4i is ready for action; whether capturing that perfect expression, the game\u2019s winning goal, or the bride walking down the aisle, the EOS Rebel T4i delivers the speed and performance to guarantee results.\n\nENHANCED AF SYSTEMS TAILORED FOR PERFECT STILLS AND VIDEO\nIMPROVED AUTOFOCUS PERFORMANCE AND NEW HYBRID CMOS AF\nThe EOS Rebel T4i is equipped with AF features that ensure speedy, accurate and continuous AF every time. When shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel T4i has improved autofocus with a new 9-point, all cross-type AF system (including high-precision dual-cross f/2.8 center point) for accurate focus whether the camera is oriented in portrait or landscape position. A new AI Servo AF system achieves and maintains consistent focus with an exceptional degree of reliability.\n\nThe EOS Rebel T4i features Canon\u2019s amazing new Hybrid CMOS AF System, perfect for shooting photos and video in Live View. This new system combines two distinct AF technologies, phase and contrast detection AF, for speedier and more accurate focus. These complementary focusing systems are aided by pixels on the camera\u2019s CMOS sensor that assist in predicting subject location; therefore making continuous focus tracking quick and accurate in video recording while enhancing focusing speed.\n\nTRUE HD PERFORMANCE, REBEL SIMPLICITY\nENHANCED EOS FULL HD MOVIE MODE WITH MOVIE SERVO AF\nThe EOS Rebel T4i offers easy to use, professional video capture without compromise. Capable of shooting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates the Rebel T4i sets a whole new standard for performance, quality and simplicity. The Rebel T4i enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! New Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. When shooting video with one of Canon\u2019s new STM lenses, Movie Servo AF takes advantage of the lens\u2019 stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF. With an STM lens attached, the EOS Rebel T4i sets a new standard for SLR moviemaking performance!\n\nResolution & Recording Sizes Frame Rates Full HD\n1920 x 1080\n16:9 format 30 fps (29.97) 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard 24 fps (23.976) HD\n1280 x 720\n16:9 format 60 fps (59.94) 50 fps \u2013 PAL standard Standard Definition (SD)\n640 x 480 30 fps (29.97) 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard \nBUILT-IN STEREO MICROPHONE, MANUAL AUDIO LEVEL ADJUSTMENT\nThe EOS Rebel T4i has an internal stereo microphone for improved audio capture and a wind filter feature to reduce wind noise when shooting outdoors. Sound recording levels can be manually (up to 64 different levels) or automatically controlled. A built-in attenuator is also provided to reduce audio clipping. For more advanced audio recording, the Rebel T4i is compatible with many third-party electret condenser microphones with a 3.5mm diameter plug.\n\nVIDEO SNAPSHOT\nWith the Video Snapshot feature, the EOS Rebel T4i DSLR can capture short video clips (of 2, 4 or 8 seconds) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights \u00e2\u20ac\u0153album.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d With no editing needed after shooting, the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera\u2019s HDMI port. Additionally, stills can be recorded during video shooting simply by pressing the camera\u2019s shutter button. During playback, video clips in an album can now be reordered or deleted.\n\nSHARP AND CLEAR, WITH TACTILE CONTROLS\nNEW VARI-ANGLE TOUCH SCREEN 3.0-INCH CLEAR VIEW LCD MONITOR II WITH MULTI-TOUCH OPERATION AND TOUCH AF\nThe EOS Rebel T4i comes with a newly engineered, Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II. Using the same capacitive technology as today\u2019s popular mobile devices, this new screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two finger touch gestures (multi-touch) can be used for zooming or changing images, menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a new, solid construction between the monitor\u2019s resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD\u2019s surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display.\n\nCOMPLEX FUNCTIONS MADE SIMPLE\nSCENE INTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nThe EOS Rebel T4i features an enhanced Scene Intelligent Auto mode that incorporates a number of Canon technologies to deliver the best possible exposure. Joining Picture Style Auto, Automatic Lighting Optimizer, Automatic White Balance, Autofocus, and Automatic Exposure, Scene Intelligent Auto mode analyzes the image, accounting for faces, colors, brightness, moving objects, contrast, even whether the camera is handheld or on a tripod, and then chooses the exposure and enhancements that bring out the best in any scene or situation.\n\nNEW EFFECTS FOR DRAMATIC AND GORGEOUS RESULTS\nHANDHELD NIGHT SCENE MODE\nAccessible right on the EOS Rebel T4i\u2019s Mode Dial, Handheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas, delivering results previously impossible without the use of a tripod. By shooting and combining four consecutive shots at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, the EOS Rebel T4i\u2019s Handheld Night Scene mode makes dramatic nighttime photography simple.\n\nHDR BACKLIGHT CONTROL MODE\nThe EOS Rebel T4i\u2019s HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too dark. By shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.\n\nSEVEN CREATIVE FILTERS, PLUS NEW ART BOLD EFFECT AND WATER PAINTING EFFECT\nTo add to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS Rebel T4i, seven different creative filters that can dramatically alter the mood and visual effect of any particular scene. Creative Filters include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fish-eye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect and new filters, Art Bold Effect (makes the photos look like an oil painting, with subjects appearing three-dimensional), and Water Painting Effect (photos are altered to look like a water-colored painting). Since the filters can be applied to the image after shooting, it\u2019s easy to try several effects on the same shot.\n\nCLEANER IMAGES, EVEN AT HIGH ISO\nMULTI SHOT NOISE REDUCTION\nTo enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS Rebel T4i features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera\u2019s sensor and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor alone. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the Rebel\u2019s traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever new feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better. \n\nFLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE RECORDING\nCOMPATIBILITY WITH SD/SDHC/SDXC MEMORY CARDS, INCLUDING NEW ULTRA HIGH SPEED CARDS\nThe EOS Rebel T4i uses popular SD, SDHC, SDXC and is even compatible with the newest Ultra High Speed (UHS-I) memory cards. Compact and available in large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel T4i\u2019s compact design.\n\nAdditionally, the EOS Rebel T4i is compatible with Eye-Fi\u2217 SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi\u00ae transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and an internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T4i can display the Eye-Fi\u2019s connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.\n\n\u2217Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada; please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.\n\nA COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF OPTICS PERFECT FOR VIDEO AND STILLS\nCOMPATIBLE WITH EF AND EF-S LENSES\nThe EOS Rebel T4i is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, including compact and lightweight EF-S lenses, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses and including the new STM series optimized for video shooting. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver outstanding performance and deliver beautiful results. Special technologies like Canon\u2019s Image Stabilizer technology help to minimize the effect of camera shake, effectively adding up to four stops of light; STM lenses even feature a stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous autofocus while capturing video.
