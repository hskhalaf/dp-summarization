I've been wearing them everyday hoping that they will stretch a bit wider, but no luck. My toes feel packed so order wide and possibly go a half to full size larger. Overall they are a good looking boot, but as I stated in the headline: Try before you buy. Safety toed work boots are very much different than hiking boots.",

      "text": "This boot is very well suited for cold weather hiking.... insulated to keep your feet warm down to -20 degrees! I really like that Keen made this boot slightly wider than my other cold weather boots like the Vasque Snowblime. The little extra width adds all day comfort and, if needed, room for heavier socks to endure colder weather. Another feature I like is the two different compounds in the rubber soles. It gives the boot a flexible feel on different terrain and cushions your step. It also displaces mud and dirt easier because of this.... what another writer calls \"squishy\", I call an advantage! I find myself wearing this boot all the time regardless of outdoor temperature.",
