Pretty much all the stars and angel tree toppers you find are incredibly gaudy, gold and glittery and over the top obnoxious. If you want something simple yet elegant that looks natural on top of the tree, I highly recommend this star. I'm so glad I found it! It has also lasted for several years now.",

The electrical cord is so long which is nice if you don\u2019t have an available outline on the tree. My tree is 7ft and it reached the floor.",

The cord is hassle free since it\u2019s long enough for our tree. It\u2019s very well made and a real keeper. It\u2019s perfect for farmhouse and rustic decorations.

This made the plastic cone that came with the star fit much more securely and then I inserted the star into the cone and it is very straight.

We do natural trees so this changes every year. This is light enough and easy to tie to that top branch whatever it may pose for shape and size each year. The lights are traditional mini-lights and so give a warm yellow hue versus some of the blue white of many new LED light strings. We liked the difference. Although I may wire in a few of the matching LED lights next time to best integrate to the rest of the tree. Absolutely worth the price.",
