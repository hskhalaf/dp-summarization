I am actually pretty disappointed that the conical burr grinder on this unit moves laterally very easily, so much so that it contacts the stationary burr, while leaving a huge gap on the other side. Without getting something to stabilize the movable conical burr, you will not make a consistent coarse grind with this unit, and you will probably wear down the burrs faster than you were hoping. Yes, this unit is larger than the Mini Mill, but it is not as well-made.",

Cons - slow grind process by hand, hard to fully clean the burr grinding part and notably more costly than cheap mark-offs.",

If you don't mind hand grinding, prefer hand grinding, or want to take it on the road in a trailer or something, it's a great grinder for that. If space was an issue (like backpacking) I'd say the Javapress might be preferable just bc it's very slim and compact.",

      "text": "The two things my husband and I dislike most about this grinder are 1) It takes so long to grind your coffee! It takes me at least 5 minutes to grind only enough coffee for two servings. We grind our coffee fresh every morning, so this is not a fun task to wake up to. 2) It\u2019s so complicated to change the grind setting to make the grounds coarser or finer. There are too many little parts to remove and put back together. We finally bit the bullet and paid $70 for the Handground Manual Grinder. 10 times easier and worth every penny.",

I don't drink coffee that often, and I preferred manual operation to avoid the hassle/noise of another corded appliance. I read some online reviews that gave this top marks, and I completely agree. It's easy to adjust for a coarse, French press grind. The consistency is also much more even than with blade style grinders. This grinder is perfect for people who like to enjoy the ritual of a well-prepared cup of coffee. Looking forward to many years with this product.",

However, the hand-grinding is just too much to do without coffee so I modified it. Found a Black and Decker cordless screwdriver also available on Amazonand replaced the nut and handle with two washers and an 11/16 nut. Then used the screwdriver, and adapter and an 11/16 socket to grind the coffee. So much faster! Be sure to clean the ceramic parts from time to time. Take it apart and brush gently to remove any particles from the grooves. If the grooves are clogged they aren't going to grind the coffee correctly.",

For $40, it does get the job done (mostly), but for fine grinds, this grinder falls flat. I currently use tape to expand the shaft diameter as close as I can to 5/16\", but the tape wears out and it's a pain to have to replace it all the time.

      "text": "My boyfriend noticed that the coffee tasted especially good when I started using the Hario (he did not know I'd gotten it). I have heard that's the effect of burr grinders but didn't realize it would be so dramatic. I always use a french press so I'm doing a coarse grind, and while it does come out a bit uneven, I don't think that it adversely affects flavor. If it bothers you just run the beans through twice to catch the large bits that slipped through the first time. The only annoying thing about it is that the top nut tends to loosen while grinding.",

No, it's not instant like an electric grinder (duh) but it does a much better job of preserving the integrity of the beans. My espresso comes out with beautiful crema. Very happy I purchased this!",

After a couple of month's use, there's been no change in the grind quality, so no wear evident yet. The nut tends to loosen with use, which some reviewers have reported could damage the interface between the shaft and handle, so I added a drop of Loctite Blue to keep it from backing off, but still removable by hand.",

Buy any old beans -- you don't need anything fancy. Keep them in the freezer and grind them per-use. The only thing I don't like about it is that, while it's adjustable (you can grind coffee, spices, salt, etc.), there are no markings or other ways to remember what setting like liked for a specific grind. You can just get used to a certain number of turns when tightening it, and that's fine, but I like precision. However, I can't really complain for the price compared to other burr grinders.",

There are no indicators to guide you as to what is fine, medium and coarse. Because of that, you can do outrageous things like grind a bean into four or five pieces. I really like that the grounds container is made of glass. Gives it a bit more of a hefty feel, and grounds won't stick to it like in other grinders.
