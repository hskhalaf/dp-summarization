Only complaint is WHY didn't Fiskars put a belt loop on the sheath?!? I got the idea to make belt loops out of paracord off youtube and it's a GREAT added feature! At 2 1/2 lbs, keep your belt tight though! OR use the paracord loops to attach it to the outside of your pack (Reflective paracord makes the sheath MUCH easier to find in the dark too) Love this thing!",

I use one of the older splitting hatchets without the added wedge, but it doesn't seem to be any better. I hopr that Fiskars takes this criticism as constructive and keeps working on the design.",

The weight feels just right for car camping, and yet the handle is longer than your typical camp axe. It's not going to work well for chopping down trees, for that you need a different blade. But this one is GREAT for splitting logs that are already cut, but not the right size or shape for your fire.

    "title": "Fiskars X11 Splitting Axe, 17-Inch",
    "description": "Perfect as a secondary axe for quick jobs, the X11 is designed for easy one-handed use when splitting small logs. Like every X-Series Hatchet or Axe, the X11 combines perfected weight distribution, advanced blade geometry, an ultra-sharp edge and virtually unbreakable design to maximize your performance. This combination of features allows the blade to disperse wood more effectively, offering more one-strike splits with each swing. Since you can split wood more easily with the X11, each job requires less time, less effort and less hand strain.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nMAKE EVERY SWING YOUR BEST WITH AN AXE DESIGNED FOR EXTREME PERFORMANCE.\nUnlike traditional axes that can be heavy, quick to dull and easy to break, X-Series axes combine perfected weight distribution, advanced blade geometry, an ultra-sharp edge and virtually unbreakable design to maximize your performance.\n\nView larger. \n\nNote: Image shown is of the Fiskars X25 Splitting Axe. Proudly made in Finland, the axes are designed to be simple, functional and effective, helping you get more work done in less time. This design earned the X-Series axes the international red dot \"best of the best\" product design award for the garden category in 2010, recognizing outstanding design quality and trendsetters. A wide range of sizes and styles makes it easy to find the X-Series axe perfect for you, whether you're chopping kindling, chopping logs, splitting logs or felling trees.\n\nTHE X-SERIES ADVANTAGE\nView larger. X-Series axes combine innovative features for chopping axes that chop 3X deeper and splitting axes that offer more one-strike splits.\n\nView larger. MORE POWER AT IMPACT\nAll X-Series axes feature a smart design that distributes the majority of the weight to the axe head while keeping the stronger-than-steel FiberComp handle lightweight. This perfected weight distribution provides an optimal power-to-weight ratio that increases swing speed to multiply power, much like an aluminum baseball bat. X-Series axes give you more power at impact to help you get more done with every swing.\n\nView larger. SUPERIOR BLADE DESIGN\nThe blades of X-Series axes are crafted with a proprietary grinding technique that provides a sharper edge for better contact and cleaner cuts. The hardened, forged steel blades also stay sharp longer than traditional axes, and a low-friction blade coating helps power through the tough logs and prevents the axe head from getting stuck. X-Series Splitting Axes also include advanced bevel convex blade geometry that adds even more power and disperses wood from the blade for cleaner, one-strike splits.\n\nVIRTUALLY UNBREAKABLE\nX-Series axes don't just outlast other axes--they're virtually impossible to break. A shock-absorbing FiberComp handle is lightweight yet stronger than steel, so it can't be broken through overstrike. The hardened, forged steel blade won't chip or crack, and the innovative PermaHead design is over-molded so the blade can't be separated from the handle.\n\n Note: Images shown are of the Fiskars X25 or X27 Splitting Axe.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThis superbly designed, compact axe defies the concept of \u00bfsize matters\u00bf. Fact is, a smaller axe has its place in the world. Canoe trips into the Northwest Territories when space is tight. Trail clearing when you want to travel fast and light. And in the hands of smaller-framed people tired of being bossed around by an overgrown axe. If any of the situations above describe you, this is your axe. Plus, it\u00bfs crafted with all the fine details of its bigger counterparts, including a unique wedge-shaped blade that takes fewer swings to bust through the toughest timber. The FiberComp fiberglass composite handle is many times stronger than traditional wood handles, yet it\u00bfs also light in weight and impervious to weather. Fiskars\u00bf insert molded design prevents the head from ever loosening or separating from the handle. And a lifetime guarantee means you can trust to really hack it.\n\nSee more",
