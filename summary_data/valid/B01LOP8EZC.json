Most importantly, however, the PS4 has some excellent exclusives that you can't get anywhere else. My first game was Persona 5, and it's definitely one of my new favorite video games of all time. I'm pretty much on this console at least a few hours a day, it's that fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to get into console gaming",

For games that support PS4 Pro enhancements, it really looks beautiful, even without a 4K tv. For example, The Last of Us Remastered looks much better. One thing that always bugged me on a regular PS4 was that the shadows in the game always had a jagged, pixelated look and didn\u2019t have much depth. With the performance enhancement option turned on, the shadows finally are smoothed out and crisp and the color and shadows both have much more depth. The frame rate is better too. Definitely go for this over the original PS4.",

As a casual user, the console is a waste of $$$ as we usually quit for one of many reasons.",

Most importantly, however, the PS4 has some excellent exclusives that you can't get anywhere else. My first game was Persona 5, and it's definitely one of my new favorite video games of all time. I'm pretty much on this console at least a few hours a day, it's that fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to get into console gaming",
