I attempted to shave & trim other more sensitive areas as he would allow & tolerate & as close as possible as his skin is irritated by the fleas. I applied directly to skin all along my dogs back, starting between the shoulder blades all the way to his tail. By Wednesday, 10/18, he still has a lot of fleas (see attached pic of his belly). Extremely dissatisfied with the failure and total lack of effectiveness. Horrible product & will be looking into how I can get my money back!!!",

EPA stamps present, no change in effectiveness. The 2nd issue seems be the product's current effectiveness, seen by some as a potential change in the Frontline formula. My understanding is that the active ingredients in this product are the same as always. What has changed are the fleas. In some areas, fleas are becoming resistant to these ingredients, and in that case you should switch to a newer, different product. So for me, same great product, lower price than my local Walmart. 5 stars.",

The treatment usually lasts for about 4 weeks. I notice when I've missed the 30 day mark to re-treat them, because they begin itching from mites, etc. before they show signs of fleas. The generic brands don't seem to take care of the problem, whereas Frontline does! I would definitely recommend this product!",
