There is ample cord to mount as high up as you need. I would recommend users to read best mounting practices for this type of monitoring device.

      "text": "Lots of brands and models on the market to choose from. But this is the first one I found that was very practical and clever! The power transformer/plug unit snaps into the back of it. Allowing you to turn it 90 degrees if your wall receptacle needs it. It also can stay out and there's a couple feet of wire to mount it away from the receptacle. The digital display is large enough to see partway across the room. I have a ventless fireplace, so am interested to know about ANY levels of Carbon Monoxide - preferably BEFORE it reaches a predefined alarm level.",

To Amazon's defense, I'm guessing they can't know how old the product is unless they cut it open and look. Manufacturer should write the date on the outside, but I guess they would sell less product that way.",

So if it's unplugged, the battery will quickly drain and then the unit will be off without any audible warning. The older models had a sensor that would immediately and repeatedly tell you if it was unplugged with a loud warning. Sometimes people unplug them not knowing what it is, or because they need the outlet (or the dog knock it out) and the homeowner may not be aware that it isn't plugged in.",

Be careful though the battery portion of the Roost is $10 + shipping to replace, so if the power goes out you may run down the battery very fast. CONS - Nothing so far.",

    "description": "The Kidde KN-COEG-3 AC powered, plug-in CO and explosive gas alarm protects you and your family from two deadly threats. The KN-COEG-3 includes 9V battery backup that provides protection during a power outage, when AC-only units cannot provide protection. By pressing the Peak Level Button you can see the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous digital display shows you the level of carbon monoxide (if any) the unit is sensing as well as if gas is present. The gas sensor is a metal oxide sensor designed to detect natural gas (methane) or propane. Temperature range- 40 degree Fahrenheit to 100 degree Fahrenheit.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nProtect your family from the dangers of carbon monoxide (CO), methane, and propane exposure with the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk Plug-In Carbon Monoxide and Explosive Gas Alarm. The Nighthawk is an easy-to-install unit that provides reliable protection against the dangers of CO and explosive gas. The digital display shows if gas is present indicates CO levels in parts per million, allowing you to see if, how, and when levels change.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Technology in an Easy-to-Install, Plug-In Design\nDesigned for home use, the Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is a UL-listed, A/C-powered, plug-in alarm that utilizes sophisticated electronic components and sensor technology to protect you and your family from the dangers of CO, methane, and propane exposure. It plugs directly into a standard A/C outlet and includes a 9-volt battery backup that provides continuous monitoring--even during power outages.The Dangers of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Propane Exposure\nThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, carbon monoxide (CO) is often referred to as the silent killer because it's odorless, tasteless, and invisible. Carbon monoxide poisoning can come about via a number of sources, including everyday items and appliances in your home or office. And because symptoms of CO poisoning mimic the flu or other common illnesses it can often go undiagnosed.\n\nLikewise, methane and propane gases are commonly used in homes for cooking, heating, and water heating. Although it happens rarely, gas leaks can sometimes occur inside the home, increasing the risk of fire or explosion.\n\nAudible Alarm Pattern Alerts you to Elevated CO and Gas Levels\nWhen placed on every level of your home, alarms like the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk can help protect everyone in the house by giving you an unmistakable signal when gas levels have reached an unhealthy point. If unhealthy levels of CO are detected, the alarm will emit four quick audible beeps every five seconds until either levels decrease or the reset button is pressed. If methane gas or propane gas is detected, the alarm will emit beeps every other second with \"GAS\" shown in the display.\n\nEasy-to-Read Digital Display Shows CO Levels\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk is preferred among traditional CO and explosive gas alarms because of its digital display. This display clearly shows levels of CO that the unit has detected and stored-- from 30 to 999 ppm--and it updates every 15 seconds to indicate any abrupt changes or alarming trends. The display also shows the peak CO level recorded by the alarm since it was last reset or unplugged. The continuous display also shows if gas is present.\n\nLED Shows Sensor Status\nWith the KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk, you never have to wonder if the sensor is functioning properly. A blinking dot in the lower right-hand corner of the display denotes normal operation, so you can trust that it's working. In addition, you can test alarm function by pressing the test/reset button at any time to verify that the horn and electric circuitry are operating properly.\n\nConvenient Mounting Options\nThe KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a low-profile design that makes it suitable for any room in your home. The detector can be plugged into any standard A/C outlet; it's plug can be snapped into the back of the unit and can be rotated so the alarm remains vertical, independent of whether the electrical socket is mounted vertically or horizontally. In addition, the alarm comes with a 6-foot extension cord, so the unit can be plugged into the wall outlet and then placed on a table or shelf. For the most thorough protection, place an alarm on every level of your home.\n\nThe UL-listed Kidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk has a seven-year life and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.\n\nAbout Kidde: A UTC Fire and Security Brand\nRenowned for global leadership in fire detection and suppression, Kidde provides solutions ranging from portable fire extinguishers to advanced industrial controls such as flame detection and explosion suppression systems. Kidde is a UTC Fire and Security brand, with a history that's rich with innovations, from the patent of the Chubb Detector Lock in 1818 to the development of the world's first wireless networked smoke detectors in 2004.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nKidde KN-COEG-3 Nighthawk Carbon Monoxide and Explosive Gas Alarm, 9-volt battery, mounting hardware, and installation guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in North America, Carbon Monoxide is odorless, tasteless and invisible.
