The screw holes for the legs were a little too small. So we needed a power screwdriver to drive the screws in. Otherwise, the steps are pretty straight forward (requires time but none too complex). All pieces fit perfectly without any wobble. The table is at a perfect height for entryways. If you are in doubt, please go ahead and by it, you'll thank yourself later :)",
