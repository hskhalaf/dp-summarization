Sony is pricing this a lot lower than what it is worth.",

Also, note that old Minolta autofocus lenses can fit this body too. I think it applies to all of them but the only one I know for sure works is the Minolta Maxxum AF Zoom 80-200mm lens.",

This however is a good starter camera and will suffice well for your \"average\" hobbyist/photographer. I was able to capture very clear images of the milky way and infinite numbers of stars with just the stock lens, which I was NOT expecting to be able to do at all. After 8 years you'd think the batteries would be trash. Specifically because we didn't use it much but battery life still seems sufficient after all of this time.",

I am used to shooting a 35mm SLR, so it doesn't bother me that the LCD screen doesn't display what you're shooting. The only con for me is that you usually need still subjects, pictures will come out blurry when your subject is moving too fast, unless they are well lit. However, it helps that you can adjust the shutter and aperture manually.",
