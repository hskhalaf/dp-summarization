I\u2019ve seen a few reviews saying that this calculator is awful for math or chemistry and that it doesn\u2019t solve things properly, but that is NOT TRUE AT ALL. I\u2019ve used this from middle school math all the way to calculus and now college chemistry, and it works great! You just have to be aware of how you put things into the calculator, meaning parentheses are your friends!!! And you get a lot of awareness from that, this calculator is great for students!",

      "text": "Easy to use calculator. There are so many on the market that all look about the same it is very hard to decide. I picked this for my son in Advanced 6th grade math. Turns out this is the calculator his math teacher uses in the classroom. so I guessed correctly. So many features but he seems to be getting the hang of it so far. It does fractions and I think this will last for his math journey for a few years.",

It has instructions on the back of the lid which my GED testing place took away as it was a \"cheat sheet\" So, learn how to use it by the lid! It will be a lifesaver! This helped me with fractions and square root. If you struggle with even those this will save you.",

Combination of solar and battery-powered is incredibly useful--I don't have to worry about the battery dying and/or not having a good light source when I have both. The biggest convenience about this calculator is the ability to see fractions, exponents, roots, etc as you would actually write them on paper. Helps prevent a lot of confusion when working with complicated problems! This is the way to go if your classes don't allow the use of graphing calculators.

      "text": "I bought this by mistake (daughter needed a different one for school) and Amazon will not let me return it. That's disappointing!! I'm sure the calculator works fine, but do not purchase unless you know you won't need to return it. I can't even find in the description where it says you can't return this item. Not happy!! Edit: I contacted Amazon about this concern - they refunded me for the item and said to keep the item. They suggested donation since I can't use it. I will be donating to the school for a child to use who can't afford. Thanks Amazon!",

I promise, it isn\u2019t just about the money for me. I never liked using the graphing calculators I was sometimes loaned in school. Too complicated. This one got me through high school, the SATs, and currently through college (where most math classes don't allow you calculators anyway). Unless you have a very urgent need for graphing utilities, this calculator is the way to go.",
