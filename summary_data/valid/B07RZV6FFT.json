      "verdict": "The trail performance of this Columbia hiking boot captures the attention of outdoorsy individuals, thanks to a combination of comfort and lightness. It is also able to provide satisfaction through its grippy outsole and ample cushioning.However, it may not be for everyone because of its inadequate arch support. All in all, the Columbia Redmond V2 Mid Waterproof may fit the bill to those who require a comfy and protective pair, granted its insole is replaced with a supportive variant.",
