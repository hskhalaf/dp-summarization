I drilled several holes in metal conduit for a swing and a single battery provided power to dill all the holes I needed. I also use the batteries to power several Arduino projects. The voltage is just right for projects needing up to 12 Volts and they last for long time-lapse shoots. I printed a base for the battery to make easy attachment to my projects.",
