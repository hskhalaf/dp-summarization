I first noticed the issue when every time I logged back in, a messages popped up to say the computer had to restart due to an error. This happened about 3x. Then I noticed that the user icon at the login page had shifted to the bottom left and had some fuzzy colours at the top. Then I noticed that the magic keyboard was no longer illuminated but still worked when I touched it and then that too began having these fuzzy lines as if the ink had ran out or something. What a shame for Apple. I\u2019m returning for a refund",

      "text": "The minimalist approach of Apple is a risk. USB C is not Thunderbolt 3. Thunderbotl 3 docks cost a fortune and many SSDs like Samsung T5 only operate if directly plugged into the machine. And you cannot daisy chain like USB 1 and 2. That is a major step back if you have current kit. For sound buy an external sound unit like M Audio Air Hub to avoid constantly plugging and unplugging headphone jacks. The onboard SSD is too small. One cannot fit other SSDs into the computer and so external SSDs are a must for Logic Pro.",
