The blades on these knives are 10 1/4\" (to the handle where they sit on the block). It's fine for me, due to the way I have my block placed, but could be a problem for others, maybe?

Compared to my old KitchenAid knife block (see pic). this is much larger mainly bc it holds more but added height makes it looks more attractive too. Have had it for a few months now and no issues with peeling, cracking or fading. If you have the DalStrong steak knives, they will not fit in the lower steak knife slots. It was my fault for not checking first but there\u2019s enough slots to place them elsewhere. One issue for me is that the scissors do not sit well but slanted and cramped between the other knives. Not a deal breaker; just an aesthetic issue. Overall, happy with my upgraded knife block!",

It is a bit deeper than you might expect, so if you don't have deep counters, I'd go for a smaller block.

Cons: the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th slots on the right and the 4th slot on the left don't seem to be tailored toward any particular knife design. They're a bit big for a vegetable, bread, or paring knife, but too small for a 4\" santoku or 6\" chef knife.",

Even though there are twice the holes of the previous knife block we had, it is not that much bigger on the counter.",
