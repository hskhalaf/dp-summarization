We were extremely cautious and gentle with it, as we read countless reviews/ watched videos on these trains before purchasing. However, with in hours of having it, the tender broke. The connector simply snapped off, and the design was ridiculous to begin with. We also had to realign and get the wheels back on track every few minutes. My son has spent more time crying than playing with this. Heartbreaking.",

I would guess that the people who have this issue did not read the directions to ensure that the track bed and actual track form a smooth connection. Then the idea that the locomotive will not connect to other cars and can only push them... This is a COAL fired engine... The ONLY car that would be behind the engine is the coal handler... Follow the instructions and connect it... Everything else just falls right into place. My only issue is, I wish all cars had metal wheels.",

If your child loves trains and you want to jump into electric sets, I would definitely recommend this one! Beware -- electric trains are addictive for both kids and adults. :)",
