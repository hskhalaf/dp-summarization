It his heavy, yes, but it feels extremely solid on the road and I am currently looking for accessories. It is awesome on the flat bike trails of Hilton Head, and sturdy enough to have my 6 year old just sit on the back and us ride together. Great value!!! And VERY pretty colors, very pleasing to the eye, comfortable seat and feels great and solid on a road with cars going by. Definitely recommend it!",

As a result, we used the bike and rolled for 3 to 4 rides until the chain went out of the gears resulting in complete loss of the shifts/gear system. Now the repairs account for $120 which is near the price a paid for this bike. With this personal experience, it is impossible to recommend this brand or shipping method. Always consider bringing shipped bikes to a professional before use (and include the cost of this service before making a purchase decision).",
