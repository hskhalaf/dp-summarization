Looked Flawless no signs of wear and I got it at an awesome price. These still sell in stores for over $450. Great phone and great price!! Highly recommend",

I also bought the circle case which made it a bit nicer to handle. Now the bad.. The batter drains real fast, it takes a long time to charge, the battery gets hot fast, the camera sucks, (the camera on my LG stylo 2 plus is much better) and it's slow when playing games. Plus I heard about the bootloop problems, so be careful. It's not a bad budget if you just need a phone.",

When I asked to return the phone thru Amazon, they wouldn't even go thru the courtesy of contacting me. I paid $270 for a brick. IB SUSPICIOUS about IB Wireless....",

      "text": "Bought this phone as a refurb from Zeetron third party seller. The screen began to fail about 3 months in and is slowly dying. Doesn't register taps, and is showing ghosting of text. Further research show this phone has a lot of screen issues. Third party seller refuses to help and of course LG doesn't support refurb phones. I did take a risk by buying a second hand phone, but I'm not happy that I basically paid $165 to rent the phone for 3 months. I do not recommend buying this phone second hand.",

Before that 1/2 hr the battery simply states I need to plug the phone into a charger. Any time I get a message a notification at the bottom of the screen comes up telling me that the \"mobile data is on\" for roughly 5 minutes. That's very annoying. LG did a fantastic job losing a customer. What an awful phone from what was a good line.",

It should have been covered by warranty but the company pretty much does not recognize their responsibility and will not flash the operating system.... but will include it in repairs for $72, or a complete refurbish for $172. If you do that ... their warranty is 90 days.... I now have three of these sucker.... \"Bricks\".",

    "description": "Everything about the LG G4 makes it a pleasure to see and hold. We crafted it from timeless materials and included an intuitive rear key. The gently contoured, ergonomic design not only looks good, it feels good too. With the LG G4 camera, we\u2019ve enhanced speed and versatility in several significant ways. The f/1.8 low-light lens, Manual Mode, Optical Image Stabilization, Laser Autofocus, and high-res image sensors deliver improved resolution and sharpness to every image you\u2019ll capture and share. The 5.5\u201d IPS Quantum Display on the LG G4 produces accurate color in Quad HD, with impressive contrast ratios for the next level of detail. Everything you view springs to life with vivid, brilliant color reproduction, drawing you in like never before. It\u2019s time smartphones were designed to keep up with their users, not the other way around. The new LG G4 has an available microSD slot\u00b9 plus a removable 3,000 mAh battery and Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor with X10 LTE. That means you can choose how much storage you need and get endurance and lightning-quick processing to spare.",
