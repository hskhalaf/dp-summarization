It is a little on the heavy side so its kinda hard to move around but its still doable. You can adjust how tilted you want it, and it can be anchored to the wall if you're nervous it might fall over. I don't anchor mine because I often move it around and it has never fallen over. With the wood boarder: about 72\" tall and 28\" wide. Without boarder: about 64\" tall and 20\" wide. It arrived in perfect condition and does not disappoint. I highly recommend this mirror. ***If helpful, please click 'Helpful'*** :)",

I went to return it but then amazon said I had to take it back to a post office- well its huge and heavy and I don't have a vehicle that can hold it. SO my dad came over and nailed the backing back on all the way around the mirror.....this worked but the frame is loose also so Im wondering how long it's going to last. Poorly made and wont recommend this mirror to anyone.",

I did a LOT of research and found out that if you buy a mirror and it's not sold and shipped by Amazon that you may be liable for the cost of return shipping and a restocking fee, even if it arrives broken! That fact alone narrowed my choices greatly. I definitely am glad that I went with this one. It was packed very sufficiently and I didn't have the styrofoam breaking into a million pieces and going everywhere as one reviewer mentioned. Worked out great - I'd highly recommend this mirror!",

They just sent a new one out - I believe for safety reasons they don't have you mail back the broken one. Second one came in one piece. I've since had this in three different homes, its pretty easy to move. Just be careful when setting up as there are little straps that hold the back leaning piece in place - they're adjustable so you can change how much the mirror leans, but if not secured the straps come off the hooks easily. I love how tall this mirror is - especially since I am 5'11\".",

The mirror is completely detached from the frame because the manufacturer didn't ensure the staples were fully installed; the staples are just halfway inserted (see pictures). Every single staple is halfway in, so of course the mirror will detach in transit. That's not a shipping issue, that's a manufacturing issue. Luckily, I can fix this issue myself by properly mounting the mirror to the frame, but I shouldn't have to do that, now should I? Beware.",
