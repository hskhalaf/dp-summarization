Zero mildew. Super pretty and would buy it again but looking for a much overdo change. Def. recommend this!",

      "text": "Purchased during a lightning sale so this was quite a deal! It's a fabric shower curtain and the design is beautiful. It definitely looks like I spent more on it than I did and the bathroom really brightened from the pop of color against the gray background. Happy with my purchase as I usually spend more for a shower curtain and never really cared for the designs. This I love!",

If that fits with your de\u0301cor than it is a very nice curtain for the price. It look pretty harsh in my bathroom but my husband had hung it up before I saw it and I didn't have the heart to take it down yet.",

The colors work really well together except that it is very hard to find matching patters to decorate or piece the rest of the bathroom together with this curtain. I wish there was a bathroom rug set to go along with this curtain to make it a little easier to out fit the room. Does the job and helps keep water in the tub/shower where it belongs.",
