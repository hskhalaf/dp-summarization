I had my boyfriend stand behind it in the picture at night and you couldn't even see a shadow or outline. It's nuts! I got this because I'm not supposed to have cats at my apartment, so i blocked out the window they sit in so light still comes through but they cant be seen from outside! Haha!",

You just need a spray bottle, a drop or two of liquid dish soap, and a credit card or other straight edge that has curves at the edges (square edges will rip a hole in the plastic). This design is really pretty. It doesn't block out all the light by any means, but it blurs the view from outside. Of course at night, when the room lights are on and it's dark outside, you can still see inside, but only shadows - no detail.",

Installed it according to the instructions (most of it anyway) and voila, you're done. It looks great. I installed it the morning. Towards the afternoon, some bubbles started to appear. Just squeegee them out. And it does offer a lot of privacy while still letting a lot of light in. Well worth the purchase.",

I had sheets of opaque plastic on the windows for years but they began to get brittle and break, so the privacy film was the answer. A bit tedious to pull up a corner to get backing off, but once the film is placed on the window, it is very secure and does not slide back and forth as you are trying to cut it and fit the sides. Bubbles left between window and film easily wipe away with minimal pressure and again, the film stays securely in place. Highly recommend!",

It looks great on there, does a great job with privacy you cannot see in or out, however it let's a lot of light in which is good. I would buy another roll, if I needed more. It's been on the windows about a year I believe and we have had no issues with it peeling up, or off the windows, so I'd say it's a good product.",

It takes awhile to cut the pieces if you're covering a ton of area, but beyond that the application process is fairly easy, and we've never had an issue with them to date. Do take note that if you are buying this to block light, a different pattern would probably work better. This one is more for privacy than cutting down on the light, so for about an hour and a half every day it can cast a pretty nasty glare on the TV.",
