I only have two small complaints: it has no buckles for easy on/off (so you have to tighten and loosen it each time) and that it barely tightens up on me. I am a very small person at 5'4\" and 127 lbs. It takes all of the adjustment to get it tight, but it does the job. Overall, I'm really happy with it for the price and would recommend it for other Paramotor pilots on a budget.",
