      "title": "The REAL Dimensions",
      "text": "Seller's listing was quite confusing, listing three different dimensions for the pillow. Actual measurements are 25\" long, 6\" high, and 11.5\" wide at the base. Pillow works well for my use, underneath my knees to reduce stress on my lower back when lying in bed. Unlike another product I used, this pillow is quite firm and hasn't permanently deformed from being slept on all night. At 25\" wide, pillow is wide enough to allow me to sprawl a bit without my legs falling off of it. Width is great enough that pillow requires a king-sized pillowcase to protect it and cover the somewhat tacky overprinting on its cover.",

My gripe is that when using this under my knees while sleeping on my back (to protect my back) my knees sink almost all the way down into the memory foam. As a result it really isn't elevating my knees very much. Wish the exact same shape was available in a much firmer cushion. This might work better for a much lighter person, although my 120 lb wife experienced the same issue.",

It's OK for that purpose but it's really hard to get it to stay in place without laying partially on top of it (vs leaning weight against it). I am trying to think of something I can attach/sew to it to keep it from sliding away when I lean my back against it. With that said, it's very nice for under the knees when on my back, or under my head pillow when I want to be a bit more upright for reading. It's also nice to snuggle and use between my knees when on my side. It's a semi-soft foam.",

This bolster pillow is awesome, only once since i've gotten it did I find it at the bottom of the med (in 4 weeks). It's so comfortable it doesn't keep me awake and i forget its there. It's even very easy to move it from your knees, to behind your knees. I love this pillow and if something happens to it, i'll buy another! I highly recommend this one!",

The reason that I am not giving it 5 stars is that it is too big to be comfortable. I am a 5\u20199\u201d woman with long legs and it is too large for me. I have to pull my knees way up to get my feet flat on the bed. I can\u2019t imagine how it would work for anyone shorter than me.",
