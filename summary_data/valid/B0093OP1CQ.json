The ride lasted about 10 minutes. The seat wasn't able to remain in a stationary position, so I cranked down on the nut to tighten it. That didn't help. Every time I say on the seat, it tilted all the way back, not a fun experience as a grown man, in fact it made me upset. So I took another 15 minutes and put it back in the box and UPS came to take it back the next day.",

One peddle broke within like two and a half weeks of light use in less than 15 miles. I never got off the seat to get more power when riding either. Finally the front wheel had a SEVERE wobble when it arrived. I did what i could to make it at least rideable. Disappointed with the quality of everything but the handle bar and frame",

    "description": "Color:Matte Black w/ Black Seat/Grip| Style:7-speed\n\nOffering both killer looks and true comfort, the In The Barrel 26-inch beach cruiser bike for guys features a durable 18-inch extended frame in 1-, 3-, or 7-speed gear options. Ideal for taller guys, the In The Barrel's forward pedaling combined with an ideal crankset configuration give you the smoothest and easiest ride you could ask for. It features a cushy saddle and grips, plus a thicker top tube that combines both a mellow and rugged look.\n\nBreeze through the city, by the beach, through your town, or up and down hills with three gear options to help you along the way. The 1-speed version is ideal for casual, recreational riding on flatter terrain. The 3-speed version features a Shimano Internal hub with Nexus shifter, giving you more gears for climbing hills and longer rides. The 7-speed version provides maximum versatility with its top-of-the-line seven-speed Shimano gear-shifting system, enabling you to go farther distances and enjoy more high intensity riding.\n\nWhile designed for riders measuring 5-foot, 4-inches to 6-foot, 4-inches, the bike also works just as well for those of us who are a little more vertically challenged, with just a couple minor adjustments to the seat post and handlebars required to customize the fit.\n\nNo matter your height, the In The Barrel a nice, comfortable ride in a relaxed and open seating position. The thicker top tube and the all blacked-out parts and components on the matte black frame really make sure to give this bike the coveted mellow and rugged look.\n\nRide along with sixthreezero in the creation of a community of life enthusiasts who are passionate about living everyday to its fullest and enjoy the benefits of one of man's simplest and greatest mobility inventions, the bicycle.
