      "text": "My daughter loves this! She has swam in it twice and seems to be holding up nicely. Do not expect the child to be able to walk once the tail is on. The mono fin makes the outfit. We would be disappointed if we hadn't purchased it with the mono fin. We bought a size up for my daughter and it seems to fit great. I would've given it a full 5 stars except there is a little threading coming loose on the material. I'm not too concerned about it but I was surprised to see it happening so soon.",

With the mermaid tail being fitted, we could take up the slack, fold it over at the waist and it works beautifully! I am sure it will fit her for the next few years :) She is a strong swimmer so she had no problem adjusting to the tail. According to her this is the best present EVER!",
