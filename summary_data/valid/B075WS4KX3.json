This rack was fairly easy to install, and feels extremely secure with the seatpost mount and chainstay braces. I added about 15lbs in the panniers snapped onto this rack, and it feels 100% solid. No problems at all during my ride.",

      "text": "Initially I thought this would be more stable than other racks for mountain bikes but it really isn't. Even with every bolt and nut tightened and the rubber parts to add pressure it still jiggles around. I'd trust it with a small 3-5 pound bag but anything heavier and it'll bend the rack out of the shape on a sharp turn or hard bump. The other major downside is the short 'bars' on the sides, as it won't allow most pannier bags to sit correctly without sliding around or hitting the wheels. So if you normally use the ROS bag set, it won't be secure. Bit of a shame as I liked the design, but I don't entirely trust it.",

Second the reflector mount on the end is super cheap looking and riveted on. I wanted to mount a bike lights where the mount was but ended up needed a dremel and some creative work.

Instead of waiting for them to seize up, I ended up returning the rack instead. Maybe this is different in dry climates, I can't say.

The product is pretty much completely metal but has a very interesting way of tightening the bolts that took a while to figure out. Not sure how it will hold up after a while but it seems to hold a lot of weight and fit's pretty much any bike.",

Original review: We bought this earlier this year and mounted it in August for our son to put his wheeled backpack on the bike for his daily 6th grade commute. Initially it\u2019s great and he loved it. His backpack is heavy, maybe 20 lb or so, and the 15-minute route is a little bumpy. But we never expect it fails just after 3 weeks into the semester!!! Apparently the connection between support bar and platform has serious quality problem. At least the one we bought has. You can see the pictures of the failed rack components. Disappointment.",
