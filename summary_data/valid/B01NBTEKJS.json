It works just as I had anticipated and the hotdogs are delicious. As long as it continues to work the way it does right now, will be very pleased. The hotdogs get golden brown. The temperature seems to regulate very well. Cleanup as as expected on these units, but with a good soft scouring pad And a little mild detergent, and cleans up just fine.",

Love this item- the only things I will say, is that if you are using true \"Bun Size\" hot dogs, you will not fit the maximum amount product is stated to hold. Regular size franks are no issue. Either way cooks the perfect hot dog and keeps them without burning as long as you regulate the temp correctly. Very pleased!",
