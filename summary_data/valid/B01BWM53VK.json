The only real draw back is the extreme cost of this. Ends up being $50 for same amount as their Protein with stevia, in large size.. at $34. So weight the difference in cost verses taste. Why this stevia thing has taken the market must be same as why palm oil has crawled right back into every snack and food product in the world. It is CHEAP to use. Saves the companies Moooooooneeeeeeey! ( as Kevin 'the cold hearted capitalist' O'Leary would say).",

If you look at ingredients listed there is vanilla listed (in small print) but they don't tell you that up front. I do not care for vanilla and no matter what I try to mix this with it tastes awful and the vanilla is overpowering. I wanted an \"original\" plant based green protein without vanilla flavor. I will go back to just wheat grass. Disappointed.",
