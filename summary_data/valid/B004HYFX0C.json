      "text": "I usually use my Pentax DSLR - great photos but it is too big and heavy to carry around all the time. I returned a Canon Elph because the auto shutter was too slow, and there were no override controls. This Cyber-shot has nearly as many control options as my DSLR, at a fraction of the size and weight, and the default auto controls are usually all I need. The sample snapshot was on auto in the early evening. I like natural light and often want snapshots in the house at night, in low light conditions. This Sony does an excellent job at that, even when I'm too lazy to change the shutter speed. Highly recommended!",

Second (and infinitely more important) it takes dynamite pics. I transferred images onto my computer and expanded the images and was amazed: no snow and at extreme magnification stayed crisp way into expansion. Good buy. Usual Sony quality.",

I'm really happy I went with the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V, since the pictures and videos it takes are incredible! The nice quality combined with 16x optical zoom makes this a great camera for travelling with. If you're not sure if you'll use the optical zoom, let me assure you that you will. Zoom is essential for framing many shots properly, especially while travelling. Another nice thing about this zoom is that it can be used while taking video. The zoom feature alone should be enough to pick this camera over any camera with 5x or less optical zoom.",

I finally caved and bought one before leaving for 6 months in Australia as things like the Great Barrier Reef and the Opera house deserve something better than an iPhone I didn't realize how much better real cameras were till I got this one. Comparing pictures with this to my 8mp iPhone is ridiculous. There is not any competition what so ever. You can even tell by the thumbnails which camera took which there is such a difference. It looks like digital cameras still deserve a place in the world. Highly Recommend.",

Pictures are not sharp but are good. I think you'll need an SLR to get truly sharp photos. Color is good so most pictures do not require tweaking on the computer. The battery life is poor but I am attributing that to how much this camera does compared to my old one that pretty much just took snapshots. I think all the processing eats up the battery life. The zoom is great, especially for a P&S. I am happy with the purchase. I can't expect more from a P&S camera.",

I was inspired to buy it after checking Sony DSC-W530 I got for my wife last Christmas. I bought Canon P&S a year ago (15x zoom) and returned it due to speed and poor low light performance.

Occasionally the pictures can look a little over-processed (noticeable more if you zoom in while photo editing than if you just print them). Biggest complaint is that flash is so powerful, it can wash everything out within 10 feet in the wrong light settings. This camera does very well in low light for a non-slr camera, so most of the time I can still get a very good shot. For the size and price, a great camera.",

I like it a lot for the kind of work I do. The only drawback is the length of time (about a second or two) it takes for the video camera to begin shooting, the awkward positioning of the video trigger, and the fact you have to rotate the dial in order to take stills. On the other hand, because it shoots full HD you can use the video to make stills.",

I also recommend purchasing a hard case since soft cases tend to let the camera turn on by itself (sensitive button), and while in the case the lens tries to exit, risking damage.",

Auto mode works well in sunlight, but you'll want to use manual mode for accurate colors in medium to low light. Manual mode is a bit difficult, because when you set parameters like ISO and f-stop you have to be quick not to loose the short window for setting them. This sometimes means you have to repeatedly go back to adjusting them before a shot. But once set, shots are superb! So 2 stars for design quality, but 5 for everything else.",

      "title": "Distorted Photos / Inconvenient Flash",
      "text": "We purchased this camera to replace vs. repair our beloved +/- 3 year-old Panasonic Lumix. Ultimately, we returned this Sony because of poor picture quality; specifically, the photos were distorted (think 'house of mirrors' at the carnival). Also, the flash 'pops' up just about where our right index finger tends to hold the camera to get a steady shot, which is frustrating when trying to catch those candid shots. The pros of the camera are: The panoramic function is pretty amazing; ability to take rapid pictures was also better than most. In the end, we opted to repair our Pansonic Lumix (well, actually, we received a refurbished model) for $180, and are very pleased with our decision.",

The only problem I had was one of the circle setting buttons is really hard to switch and it gives a little hard time to change shoot mode but I believe it is gonna soften a little with daily use. no complaints. Thanks to the seller and thanks to amazon.",

By design, the flash pops-up from inside the camera, but it is placed in an akward location (right where you normally place your left index finger). It seems that the mechanism is broken or somehow locked. Talking with a friend of mine, he told me that his parents bought the same camera and got same problem. For the rest, the zoom is great, the panoramic photos are awsome, etc, etc But please, be aware, before you get one of these....",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 16x Optical Zoom G Lens, 3D Sweep Panorama and Full HD 1080/60p Video",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n Sony DSC-H70 \n\n\n\nWith 16x optical zoom, incredible low light performance, full 1080x60p HD movie capabilities, and innovative features like, high speed linear auto focus, 3D image capabilities, and backlight correction to catch even the smallest details in high contrast shots, the Sony DSC-HX9V will renew your passion for photography.\nSony DSC-HX9V Feature Highlights \n16.1 Megapixel Back-illuminated \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS Image Sensor\nThe DSC-HX9V features a 16.2 megapixel \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera\u2019s Sony G lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast up to 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080p movie modes.4\n\n3.0-inch XtraFine LCD display \n3.0-inch XtraFine LCD display with TruBlack technology (921K dots) gives you deeper blacks and more color in your display, all while being thinner than most LCDs.\nCompact camera with 16x optical zoom \nThe Sony 16x optical zoom G lens brings distant subjects super close for great outdoors, sports, and travel photos. The compact size makes it easy to take along in a pocket, purse, or backpack.\n\nFull HD 1080/60p \nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p in 1080 Full HD. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your Blu-ray Disc players, Sony PlayStation 3 systems and compatible PCs and HDTVs.\nBacklight Correction HDR \nDon\u2019t miss a single detail in high contrast shots. The built in backlight correction analyzes the image and automatically adjusts accordingly to give you a perfectly lit shot. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of each into a single image for more natural looking shots.\n3D still image and 3D panorama \nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities.4 Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\nHigh resolution iSweep Panorama mode \nWith high resolution iSweep Panorama mode just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a high resolution panoramic image providing the ability to zoom in on small details. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.\nHi-speed Linear Focus \nLife moves fast, your camera\u2019s focus needs to move just as fast. The Hi-speed linear focus achieves dramatically clearer images with an auto focus that moves just as fast as your life.\nBackground Defocus \nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\n\nSuperior Auto Mode \nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and 44 scenes for movies, making it easy to get the best shot. \nDigital Zoom \nCapturing the right shot at the right moment has never been so easy. Digital zoom brings the action up close to get that perfect shot, every time.\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\nSoft Skin Mode \nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\nNatural Flash \nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\nHDMI output \nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable (sold separately) to any compatible HDMI device to easily enjoy and upload content.6\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\nFace Detection technology\nSony\u2019s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\nAnti-blink Function\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \nCompatible with PC and Mac Systems \nThe Full HD video captured with the DSC-HX9V can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.1\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.5\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony\u2019s Personal Space site). \nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software \nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable the DSC-HX9V makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites without the need for any additional software to install.2 \n 1. PMB requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7 environments not supported. Not supported by Mac OS.\n 2. Uploading directly to the web requires PMB Portable software and USB cable (included), and PC with internet connectivity. Windows XP SP3 64-bit and Starter Edition and Windows Vista Starter Edition environments not supported. \n 3.
