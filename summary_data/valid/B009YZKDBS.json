Seems that lately I am having to return a number of flimsy products that Amazon is sponsoring, what's going on? Have had great products up until recently, all through the quarantining.",

All the soil falls in between the slats into the black bag below. It's weather proof but I would still consider covering it to protect it from general wear and to preserve the longevity of the bench. It definitely adds a decorative look to any patio.",
