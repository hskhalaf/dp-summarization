I'm not leaving it up during the winter because it probably won't hold up to feet of snow. Good cheap fix probably won't last a few seasons but it's cheap enough to replace. I think I spent around 15 bucks for it.",

I'm a professional photographer and spend a lot of time out in the scrub and marsh in Florida and this netting allows me to set up a quick, lightweight blind super fast. It's also perfect to drape over my Jeep Wrangler whenever I need it to blend in better to my location. It does have some \"noise\" when the wind blows, but it sounds just like the rustling of leaves and palm fronds so it actually helps me blend in even more. I most definitely recommend this product for hunting, camping, photography and anything else outdoors.",

It seems that the \"new\" material would hold up longer and better under field conditions. We didn't use it in the field. It was used as part of a set for a military-themed play. It looked excellent under theatrical lighting, held up well, and covered the area needed easily. It was also not impossible to fold up when it was done. The photo doesn't do it justice... very pleased with it overall.",
