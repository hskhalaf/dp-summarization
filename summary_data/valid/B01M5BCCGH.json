I plugged the machine in, added the wax and it began to melt. When I checked it later the light was out so I opened it and found the wax just as solid as it came. The unit never cycled back on. I am disappointed, but I'm sending it back with the wax still in it and buying another one. If the next one fails I will be looking at another brand. From the reviews it appears that there are some bad units out there.",

It is hard to grip the 'handle' aka the slight raised center channel of plastic. The lid itself rests on the shallowest of lips inside the basin. What this means is at least every other time you will not seat it properly and it will dunk in the wax itself. My lid was very moisturized. I wish I could return this.",

We keep our unit plugged in and the wax stays at a constant temperature while the outside of the unit remains cool to the touch.
