I never needed for running or working out, but I used it at class, where we were in and out of saltwater in BDU\u2019s for a week. It really helped with wet uniforms rubbing or salt crusty ones rubbing. You may need to reapply if your doing heavy activity, but in general it withstands a lot of abrasion , before it rubs off. Its small enough that you can carry it with you, if you think you need to reapply. Not greasy, doesn\u2019t stain and no smell. Good stuff.",
