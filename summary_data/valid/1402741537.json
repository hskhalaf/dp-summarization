      "text": "Beautiful colored pictures to stimulate a person's interest in collecting insects. There are two ways of collecting insects: One is to \"capture\" them with your camera and store them in your photo album. The other way is to kill them and put them physically into a real three-dimensional collection. You can even combine these methods as follows: Look at the description next to the photo in the book to see what the insect eats and what it does. You can then infer whether an insect is beneficial or not. If it's beneficial, capture it with your camera. Otherwise kill it and put it into your three-dimensional collection.",
