Aluminum frame -- not heavy at all. Almost as good as my Diamondback Insight bike, but at 1/3 of the price. Great price that I purchased two for my boys. The only small downside is that one of the bikes needed wheel balancing or truing. Other than that, it's a great bike and I can recommend to anyone.",

It feels very solid but not heavy at all. I am 5'2'' so I was a little afraid it would be too tall but with the seat on the lowest setting its just right. This bike was also fairly easy to put together. My husband and I pieced it together in less than 30 minutes with very little cursing ;) Make sure you have all your tools at hand first! I am very happy with this purchase!",

Only drawback is the seat, it's pretty uncomfortable. I ordered her the Sunlite Cloud-9 cruiser gel seat  Much better than the original seat.

Well actually, I had to replace the stem due to a bolt consistently coming loose. This may not occur for every bike, but I was able to fix this issue by taking off the stem (bar that connects the handlebars to the front fork tube) and replacing it with one I had lying around. Other than that, everything on the bike is holding up well for the beating I put it through. Make sure you correctly assemble and tune the brakes & gearshifts correctly, and this bike will work for you.",

I need to tune it a little, as the third set of gears don't always kick in as assembled out of the box, but that's strictly an adjustment problem. Everything else was great, and I've had a lot of fun re-learning to ride a bike after about 45 years!",
