Easy to put together even for a 65-year-old lady. Amazing desk chair. My only complaint is that there are only a few color choices. I went with the black fabric, but it attracts every single hair that my two cats shed throughout the day. It would\u2019ve been nice to have a few more choices of different woods and fabrics to choose from. In the end, I would buy it again.",

It's super comfortable and it's easy to mash out the desk work sitting in the Balans. I like the constant motion of the chair. It's nice to be able to move around in different positions. This chair really seems to help me stay focused better too. The Balans provides spinal support and good balance for long sitting sessions. I'm very pleased with BOTH of my Balans chairs.",
