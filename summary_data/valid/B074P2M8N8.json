I found could angle the massager almost vertically to massage my calves in our comfortable recliner (not reclined, of course). This multi-use massager is great for my tired, tight feet and calves. Its adjustable settings make it a delight to use. I highly recommend this shiatsu foot massager. I think you will love it as much as I do!",

The unit is solidly built (made in China), applies great pressure and the rollers provide a great massage simulation. The adjustable stand is also great for getting the unit in the right position to be effective. Works great for feet, lower calf and upper calf. This has definitely helped my issues and it just plain feels great on the feet and legs. If I had one complaint it would be that the unit is not particularly effective on the IT band area on the upper side of my calf but otherwise great!",

Second, it will massage a few seconds...then stop a few seconds...then start again...then stop...then start again, etc. This is also annoying as it seems to always stop when it's massaging exactly where i have pain.",

With the different positions, it is great for feet, ankles and shins. If I lie flat on my stomach, I can even use it on my thighs. A remote would have been a nice added feature, but to be honest, I like the Shiatsu massage, heat, air compression pressure and vibration - so I only ever select the one button that gives me all of these options. My family uses it in the evening while watching television. I would highly recommend the Cloud Massage sold by Happy-Homes. And with the 100% no hassle warranty, you have nothing to lose.",

The company should proofread their manual though - HEEL not HEAL in at least one spot and other areas just stop mid-sentence. The machine was relatively quiet considering all it is doing. We bought on an open box deal and it came brand new with little outer box damage. We would not pay full price for this, but we'll worth what we did pay.",

      "text": "I wanted a foot massager that was better than those $20 gifts you give to someone for Xmas. I deal with plantar fasciitis and try to do 15000 steps a day. This machine helps alleviate my strained fascia and deal with pain management. I was a little skeptic at first because I never heard of the brand, but so far its been great. I wish there was a better way to control the machine from my finger tips, I normally have to press the right buttons with my toes. I dont like bending over, too lazy haha. I wish the 15 minute window was longer as well. This is a decent size machine, be aware of that.",
