This one, luckily, had zero dead pixels, the brightness and image quality are 'good enough' for what I needed; and for less than $100, I feel I did okay.",

It took all of five minutes to set up the monitor, snapping the stand together, hooking up the power cord, audio cord and the VGA cable. Both Windows 10 and my graphics card recognized the monitor immediately, I downloaded the latest drivers and registered the product on the ViewSonic website. The built-in speakers can be adjusted from the built-in menu, but they are not much to write home about - not very loud and rather tinny sounding, even with adjustments on my audio manager software. The video is beautiful. This 1920x1080 monitor is well worth the money.",
