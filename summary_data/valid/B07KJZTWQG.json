The outdoor community also appreciates this footgear\u2019s lightness and water protection.On the other hand, this hiker garners criticism because of how its sole separates from the upper after minimal usage. Nevertheless, the Sorel Madson Hiker\u2019s urban and trail-centric attributes may help adventurers come out on top, as long as they overlook its faults.",

Its really hard to find boots you can just live in despite the sheer volume of choice available...and I must already own about 20 pairs. My wife also bought a pair of Sorels this week and she loves hers too.",

They look good on as well it will better when they have been worn a bit so they looked lived in. Highly recommended.",
