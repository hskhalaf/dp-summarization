I purchased these because I don't understand why you'd buy the small version, which soaks full of water in two seconds while you are washing your car (because its just so small). WARNING: Any microfiber towel attracts dirt like no other. If you drop it onto the ground, you have to painfully pick out each bit of debris that it collected, because washing them won't get the debris out. So I keep my microfiber towels in a sealed box or bag while i'm not using them, and I am careful to never drop them on the ground.",

They do absorb quite a bit of water, but pale in comparison to old microfiber cloths I bought 10 years ago. I like the larger size (they are longer than others) and will use them, but I'm horribly disappointed that they are not thick as my old ones. Does anyone make real thick cloths any more? UPDATE: My review is getting hidden by the \"sensitivity filter\"? What about this review is \"sensitive\"? Editing - trying to find out what is \"sensitive\".",

      "text": "Bought these for polishing guitars because they're advertised as lint-free, but I was disappointed to find that they leave tiny fibers everywhere--especially on the strings when wiped after playing. They're also just a little too large for my intended purpose, but they're soft and thick and appear to be well made. I'll repurpose them for general house cleaning duty where more frequent wash cycles might eventually clear up the issue with excess loose fibers.",
