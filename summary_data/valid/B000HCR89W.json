This cover stayed out on our walk out patio over the entire winter. It has held up very nicely and has not faded as much as I would have thought. It's very difficult to find a good grill cover that won't crack, fade, rip, or tear in the elements. The material is awesome. I just ordered another one today for my $300 Smoker because I was so happy with the first cover from Classic Accessories. The one I bought today was on sale on Amazon Prime!

However, it appears to only last for 2-3 years. Then it tears fairly easy, and doesn't protect anymore. It seems that all covers only last 2-3 years. But this one is half the cost of the Weber Grill Cover (which I have owned and cracks after 2 years). Like I said it's ok, but don't expect it to last to long. Update. 4/23/17. I have this cover for less than a Year and already has 2 tears in it. I don't recommend this product. Look elsewhere",

The stitching on the product appears to be top-notch, the sewn-in handles very convenient in removing the cover from the grill and covering the grill.

I am careful not to let snow build up on it, so the tearing is caused by the weight of the cover pulling down on the corners.

Has 4 clips on thick straps on the bottom to hold it down in a storm. I am impressed with this manufacturer. I\u2019ve bought other items for my porch furniture. They\u2019re all well made.

It's cracking and torn and we honestly don't even use our grill that much so it's not from taking it on and off all of the time. Waste of money.",

I did not want a long cover. SO... I bought this grill cover in the medium-small, it was the correct dimensions except it was too long (too much height). I cut the middle section out of the cover about 22 inches and then sewed the bottom section (dark part) back to the tapered top part that covered the grill/table. A couple of hours work but the result was a perfect short grill cover. This cover is made from very nice material and is very attractive.",
