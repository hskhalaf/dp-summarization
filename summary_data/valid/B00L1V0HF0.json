The tripod feels really good and added my canon sl2 to it and it does the job. I\u2019m impressed and I will definitely recommend this tripod to my fellow photographers and family.",

We needed something that was travel friendly and this fit into out travelpro 21\" carry-on bags on the plane and into a larger backpack while on the streets of Paris. An inch or two shorter when collapsed would make packing it a bit easier but even as it stands, it did not cause us any issues. Highly recommend for the quality, function, and price.",

Lots of adjustments, holds pretty stabile considering its light weight, and collapses down to a small enough size that it will fit inside a backpack.

I like being able to control the pivot and pan. 55\" height might be an issue for some, but the swivel screen on my Nikon covers that.

A normal camera should not be a problem. All other aspects work great, including panning which has been a complaint with other tripods. The locks to prevent movement work very well in all places and it fits well into the case.",
