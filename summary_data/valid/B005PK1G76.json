It's lasted 2 years and still going :) So when we had another baby and got a double stroller, I started looking at new organizers and then realized this one fits PERFECTLY on half the Mountain Buggy Duet! Bought a second Diono organizer and now we're in business :) And I love having it on the stroller frame vs. handlebar - looks cleaner and we have more room for pushing the stroller.",

This organizer straps on perfectly to my handlebars and flexes to fit a large variety of tumblers, cups and water bottles. It has a zipper that I use for my keys and is deep enough to hold my phone, wallet and other crap without falling out. I regularly fold up my stroller in and out of the trunk and this bends and folds just fine. I never have to take it off. It's seriously the best. This $5 item has made me love my stroller again!",

It's better than my $20 one. The only downside is the top seam seems to have a metal bar going around which is good because keeps the product intact and from getting collapsed but its also its downside when you close an umbrella stroller. you need to un-velcro one side so that you can close the stroller without damaging the product. I still recommend this!",

The other thing I don\u2019t like is that it slides around on the handle. The Velcro doesn\u2019t hold it in place very well. I have to reposition it constantly. It might just be my stroller handle.

The only things I ever put in it were my phone and keys and sometimes a burp cloth or pacifier. Wish it had held up for a lot longer.",

I actually have another one that was $35, and I feel like this fits my City Select stroller better (works on my City Mini, too). Great cup holders (fits my Yeti), and I like the big open pocket in the middle for snacks, my phone/headphones and keys. The zipper pocket is great for smaller items like hand sanitizer. Loving it so far! The only reason I gave four stars for durability, is that I have only had it for a week thus far. I will update it as time goes on!",

      "text": "We've been using this heavily for almost 2 years now with our Chicco Liteway stroller and it looks the same as the day I bought it. It has never fallen off, it takes a ton of abuse from holding phones, multiple drinks, rocks and sticks my son picks up on our walks, etc. It's a fantastic value and I highly recommend it for anyone that wants a simple contraption to hold some basics that won't be too heavy for a lightweight stroller. I also have never had to take it off to fold our stroller so that is a major plus!",

Although I read other customer reviews saying that you cannot fold strollers while this stroller organizer is still attached, I can fold it attached to the Nano without any issue (I empty the organizer first, of course) and the Nano still fits in the bag it came with while folded with the organizer. We basically use the organizer to store a water bottle or drink for us, the baby's bottle and our phones. It is a great addition to our Mountain Buggy Nano so we may end up buying another one for our Bugaboo.",
