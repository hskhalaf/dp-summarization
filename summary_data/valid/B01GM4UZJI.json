The proofing baskets have both worked well for me. Construction is good with few, if any, splinters (nothing affecting food).I had an issue with sticking once or twice., and was able to address it by using a brush to remove caked flour, then using ample flour on the next 2 - 3 times I baked. The support has been great. While I have not yet tried the recipe provided, I found the video and instructions to be valuable as I become more familiar with sourdough and higher-hydration baking.",

I was worried there would be some chemical smell emanating from the rattan that would impart unnatural flavors to the bread, however this was not an issue at all. The only thing I don't like is that there was some fine splintering in the rattan, however, I was able to get rid of it by gently rubbing the basket with my fingers.",

Second, it gives you an attractive pattern for rustic style bread. Third, the linen liner gives you a smooth texture to french style boule (ball) bread. So, you have a lot of flexibility. As the linen liner is removable, it's snap to decide the style of bread you're making. When you use this, ensure you dust enough flour inside so the dough doesn't stick.",
