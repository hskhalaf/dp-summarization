I found that the phone is not warm if I leave it on the charger overnight. I assume that after the battery reaches 100%, the charger is no no longer active. This charger is small and takes up little room. It does have rubberized feet which keep it from getting tipped. Highly recommend.,",

Only complaint is it is a little light-weight, which we all know makes things feel 'cheap', but this is not a real complaint because I like this product more for being so cheap/affordable. The usb cable it comes with is a bit shorter than I would like, and because of the scant instructions I'm not sure if it will work if I replace it. This hasn't been a issue because I am adaptable.",

Phone does not get hot and anyway I put it, it starts charging. And the price you can\u2019t beat!!! Recommend!!!",
