      "text": "I bought this for the shorter and lighter size and am very pleased. I already had a Manfrotto 679 monopod that is very good but it is a minimum of 24 inches long where the Sirui is 15 inches long and, of course, lighter in weight. I use both with a Manfrotto 3229 tilting head which I understand has been replaced by a newer model. The Manfrotto pod is quicker with only three sections and it is very sturdy for support in stream crossings or such but the Sirui is also very smooth to use and easier to carry and it goes in my backpack. Both are great choices but different.",

It is exactly what we were looking for although be advised that it is not as small as some other models available and I would recommend getting the manfrotto 234RC attachment for quick release of the camera. Also the manfrotto 234 tilt head will allow you to make quick adjustments if you are doing sports photograph. The attached picture shows the size of it completely compressed with the manfrotto tilt head attached and the camera next to it for reference is a Nikon D500 with 70-200 lens. Hope this helps you.",

It's small enough to fit in a carry on case in an airplane, lightweight, simple to use along with being practical for those who like to not carry bulky tripods. I like that I can use it at its shortest length creating a small handle that keeps my hand steady as I take photographs. Extended it is solid on the ground easily moved to any angle you may want. I have stopped taking handheld photographs because this little monopod helps me take sharper and focused photo's better than without it. Love this monopod!",

It can double as a hiking/walking stick, and even has an attached compass. I lost mine and have ordered a replacement, as I'm going through withdrawal. Highly recommended!",
