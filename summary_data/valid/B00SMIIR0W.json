Works extremely well if you have sensitive or rougher skin, gentle and removes all hair no problem! I was even able to shave recently shaven areas, which usually leaves my skin irritated and slightly burned, but no issues like that with this razor. I highly recommend.",

The trimmer misses a lot of hair and doesn't trim as close enough to the skin even when I use the lowest setting. If you're looking for a quick trim and not clean cut for your private area, this would be an ideal choice for you, plus $13 for a razor-trimmer combo is a good deal compared to some of the more expensive brands.",
