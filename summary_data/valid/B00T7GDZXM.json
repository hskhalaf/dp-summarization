Which I guess if you're just using it for facebook or other nonsense it's fine, but definitely not good for working. The keys also have a habit of being unresponsive, especially if you type fast. And one of them has already gotten stuck repeating itself. I blame this on a lag issue, the keyboard takes a second to register the keys. Also it frequently loses connection for no reason. Seems to keep a good charge though. So if you want something just to mess around with, it's good enough for that. If you actually need a keyboard for typing though, this is pretty useless.",

I've had no issues with any of the keys in all the time I've had it unlike other portable keyboards, so this gets a 5/5 rating just from that. It's very easy to use, has a great magnetic cover and the stand works great for school either on a desk, or in my lap.

A small, simple thing to rectify, but the lack of the delete key slows down my work. Will probably buy a different keyboard...after checking the keys carefully.",

The cover flips around and can hold up the tablet if needed, or can flip underneath and provide a small area for wrists to sit on while typing. It's very cool for the price. Recharges and stays charged a long time. Thin and light if you need to throw it in a bag for travel.",
