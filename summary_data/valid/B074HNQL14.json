Quick and easy to break in yet has excellent padding in the palm and fingers. I'll be purchasing another for my son when he has outgrown his current youth glove.",

This glove will last many seasons. I promise. Rawlings is hard to beat. And I\u2019m not sure why some people don\u2019t think this glove is not pre broken in.

Update: just finished up a season of Spring and Fall little league with the kid and the glove is breaking in nicely. I have been using saddle soap to keep it clean and soften the leather.
