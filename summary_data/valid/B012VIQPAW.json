These lights hold up very well in this climate. When I get up at 6 a.m., I look out my kitchen window and my dragonfly lights are STILL ON. That's 8 hours or more!!! I have purchased them as gifts for relatives, in other parts of the country and got such rave reviews, I had to buy a set for myself. Wonderful product that I can be used all year around.",

I'm not certain how long they stay powered up; because I have never stayed up long enough to find out. I'm so glad I found these.
