Unfortunately, within 6 months of ordinary use they stopped working--if the chord shifted at all, the sound would cut out. So I returned them under warranty and B&W sent me a new pair. Within 6 months of very limited use and even more careful care, they once again stopped working--the sound would cut out in the right speaker after 15 minutes use. B&W refuses to give refunds, so I am stuck in an endless cycle of using and returning these now...a huge hassle. Too bad.",

The sound is simply stellar: clear, balanced, open, and with great bass when the buds are correctly positioned. The in-ear loops are a little odd, but surprisingly effective. They stick out more than some other styles. But if you have ever heard sound reproduced by other B&W speakers you will recognize these in-ear headphones as having that \"cut above\" character to them as well. Recommended.",

Fit is snug and secure with variety of ear tips to get the best fit. Sound is good, not sure if its any better than the Shure's or not, didn't A/B compare and must go from memory. Wasn't struck by a great difference. I usually wear them only on long flights so comfort and unique approach do well.",

The C5s sound as good as my $8,000 speakers. Classical music--both orchestral and piano--are well-presented. Rock music sounds fine also. I doubt anyone would fault the C5, especially at their price.",

The fatal flaw is the durability in that after a few months (3-4), the audio starts to drop or crackle with movement of the cord. The short term pleasure is replaced by the long term pain.

I am not abusing the headphones in any way so it is ridiculous for it to be so fragile given the relatively higher price.",

I found out through trail and error and to go to the next song you have to hit the middle area twice very quickly.If you are too slow it will pause the music as if you only hit it once.

    "description": "Color:Black| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging\n\n\nThe Bowers & Wilkins C5 earphones deliver pristine, natural sound quality together with a secure, comfortable fit.\nview larger The C5 earphones are designed to work perfectly with iPhone or iPod touch, and feature a purpose-built microphone/control cable. \nview larger C5 HEADPHONES\nC5 noise-isolating in-ear headphones bring you amazingly natural acoustics and fit so comfortably and securely you'll hardly be aware you're wearing them. Bowers & Wilkins unique Micro Porous Filter system makes sure that sound is open, spacious and full of rich, lifelike detail. So you can truly lose yourself in unadulterated sound, even when you're on the move.\n\nSECURE LOOP DESIGN\nThey feature Bowers & Wilkins innovative Secure Loop design - loops of plastic-coated wire that curl around the inner rim of your ears and hold the in-ear headphones firmly in place. The C5s are also Tungsten Balanced, meaning that the headphones are weighted towards your ears, rather than away from them, for optimized noise isolation.\n\nMADE FOR IPHONE\nC5's MFI remote and microphone make the headphones the perfect match for your iPod or iPhone. They also come with a quilted carrying pouch.\n\n\nC5's unique Micro Porous Filter acts as a sonic diffuser, allowing the headphones to sound open, even while they isolate external noise. \nview larger C5's snug fit allows them to isolate external noise, while also keeping your music quiet to people sitting next to you \u2013 perfect for the commute into work.\nview larger ADVANCED ACOUSTICS\nWhatever Bowers & Wilkins make, the goal is the same: the most natural, realistic sound possible. With C5, you can take true sound with you wherever you go. C5 is a mixture of long-held acoustic principles and technological advances, key among which is the Micro Porous Filter. Together with C5's noise-isolating design, this allows users to lose themselves in flawless audio.\n\nMICRO POROUS FILTER\nIf you want a spacious sound, you need room to breathe. Not a problem for a large speaker, but quite a challenge for a set of headphones small enough to fit in your ears. With C5 in-ear headphones, Bowers & Wilkins engineers got around the problem with the Micro Porous Filter. Hundreds of microscopic steel balls act as a sonic diffuser, opening up the sound and making music feel remarkably rich and expansive.\n\nNOISE ISOLATION\nC5's snug fit and stunningly realistic sound means you can forget the rest of the world and lose yourself in music. At the same time, these in-ear headphones let in just enough ambient noise to allow you to retain your sense of place. Perfect for listening to music when you're out and about.\n\n\nWHICH HEADPHONE IS RIGHT FOR YOU?\n\nBowers & Wilkins P7 Headphones Bowers & Wilkins P5 Headphones Bowers & Wilkins P3 Headphones Bowers & Wilkins C5 Headphones Design Over-Ear On-Ear On-Ear In-Ear Changeable Ear Cushions Yes Yes Yes Yes Foldable Yes Folds flat Yes Carry Case/Pouch Yes Yes Yes Yes iPhone Compatible Yes Yes Yes Yes Weight 290g 195g 130g 20g \n\n\nThe control room of Studio 1 at London's Abbey Road Studios, which uses Bowers & Wilkins 800 Series loudspeakers.\nview larger Nautilus isthe result of a five-year research program to create the perfect loudspeaker. Many technologies developed in this project are now found in all Bowers & Wilkins products. \nview larger BOWERS & WILKINS HISTORY\nIn leading recording studios around the world, music that will soon be heard everywhere is first heard through Bowers & Wilkins loudspeakers. In London's world-famous Abbey Road Studios, all three main studios use Bowers & Wilkins 800 Series speakers to capture the output of the world's biggest-selling artists.\n\nENGINEERING INNOVATION\nEvery discovery Bowers & Wilkins' scientists make in their dedicated Research and Development facility influences how speakers all over the world are designed and built. Technologies such as Nautilus Tapering Tubes and Flowport start life in their high-end loudspeakers, but are also important factors in the likes of Zeppelin Air and their headphone range.\n\nDOING IT FROM DAY ONE\nWhen John Bowers set up Bowers & Wilkins in 1966, experimentation in sound and recording was escalating rapidly. It was the time of Sergeant Pepper and Pet Sounds, and Bowers had a pioneering spirit to match. His ambition was revolutionary for the day, and remains so: to create a loudspeaker that neither adds nor takes away from the music. Bowers & Wilkins has been exploring the world of sound ever since. And they'll never settle for less than perfection.\n\nRELATED PRODUCTS FROM BOWERS & WILKINS\n\nBowers & Wilkins Headphones Bowers & Wilkins Wireless Music Systems Bowers & Wilkins Computer Speakers",
