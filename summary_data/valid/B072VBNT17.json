Meaning it\u2019s not very strong. Very flexible. The back of the bucket doesn\u2019t have the strength that it should like a Rubbermaid. For someone to squeeze most of the water out of the mop could result in injury if not paying attention to the back of the bucket folding in. The only decent quality is the wheels but I have a feeling they will end up not lasting to long. cheap version. So if you\u2019re a contractor, just get the real thing.",
