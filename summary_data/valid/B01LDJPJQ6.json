So I take a chance and order this because I can get it quick, it is real silk (so no static), has the cold pac (to keep in the fridge), and the flax for gentle pressure. I was pleasantly surprised, shocked really that it came with two extra pouches of lavender and flax to adjust smell and weight. And the flax isn't just loose in the bag but has it's own pouch. Either the designer has migraines or they listened very closely to clients because they got it right this time. This is going on the gift list for my friends.",

I put the cold mask inside of the satin mask and OMG so relaxing and the weight is perfect to keep that eyelid shut while I sleep but isn't doing damage to my skin like the tape & patches are!",

I didn't use the gel mask, but I have used those before. I didn't heat up in the microwave because I returned the item and didn't want to damage any of the materials.

They also included a package of flax seeds for filler and/or weight. The mask is slightly larger than average ones and gives much better light blocking.

I personally want a very strong sense of lavender, however If your just looking for a hint then it will be perfect for you. Overall great product!",
