When he was ready to try solids, we started with this at around 6 months - first with breast milk, and now that he's over 1, with regular milk. Never had any issues with expiration or quality. We went through the 6 pack in about 1-1.5 months initially. Now that he is eating more solids, we don't go through it as quick but it is definitely one of our pantry staples.",

I have a pretty tolerant sense of taste, but I gagged on this stuff... Anyway, it is certainly convenient in how easily it stores and mixes... But that doesn't mean much if your kids hate it.",
