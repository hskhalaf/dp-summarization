It raises the seat approximately 4 inches, which makes it easier to sit and stand, and the arm rest helps you achieve an up-right position. With the swelling that comes along with the surgery, a man needs an elliptical shape in order to be able to \"tuck\" in order to sit. I liked this so much that I purchased two more and donated them to an organization that supplies hospital equipment for free for those in need. Yes, I highly recommend this model of seat.",

      "text": "I had high hopes with all the good reviews but disappointed when I opened the box. One big problem with this seat is the very thick screws that comes with it. It did not work with our toilet and when I tried to return it, at the very last step it says this product is not returnable ! We had to make it work with duct tape for a short time until the new raised seat arrives! I do not recommend this product if this is for after surgery purposes.",
