When I received it and picked up the box, I knew I wouldn't be pleased. This blanket shouldn't even be called a duvet - it is two extremely thin pieces of fabric sewn together over cheap polyester filling. There is no heft or loft to it, and absolutely no weight. I am still just blown away by how terrible this product is, especially considering the number of positive reviews.",

Since I sweat and I'm not trash, I wash this bad not often and it's held the heck up. On top of my sweaty charm, I have three dogs and a cat who like to Netflix and actually chill with me on the bed and between the biscuits made and puppy power this thing has still held up.

We slept with just the comforter and a sheet all winter and did not need more cover. It washed well. The duvet straps kept it in place in the duvet. i have an older double mattress that is less deep so the small size was a plus for me. The comforter was large enough that the springs did not show and a ruffle was not required. That was important to me because we are getting too old to take the mattress off the bed and wash a ruffle.",

When our daughter came to visit with her family, she loved it so much that we gave them one for their bed and for the kid's beds, too.. They wash beautifully, dry very quickly and are fluffy. We call it our \"heater\" in the winter because we stay toasty warm under it and can turn the heat down at night. (Sometimes I have to stick my foot out just to cool it off!!!) We are in North Florida where it can get pretty cold in the winter. Highly recommend this comforter.",

Works great! Super happy with it!",

I have owned one that you wouldn't have know it wasn't real down in the past, but it was ridiculously expensive. This blanket is a great value and comfy!",
