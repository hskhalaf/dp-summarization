I think that every fan of the show would love this set which makes it a MUST HAVE! It's to die for and just so perfect! I'm so glad that Lego makes such fun sets like this one. :)",

Other than those two things, I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into the props in the background. It sits perfectly on my bookshelf and I hope they make more of the Big Bang Theory sets (Sheldon's room, Howards lab, or Penny's apartment, maybe).",

The only thing that bugs me is that the black chair is a little awkward, since you can't snap the figs into it, they slid out if you pick the model up.",

With 7 minifigures, the price is okay. I would prefer to see more room made so all seven minifigures could be fit in more comfortably. Unfortunately none of the girls can sit fully on the chair or couch due to the hair. Makes a great display! I certainly do enjoy adding my TBBT characters to the Jurassic World sets I have. Now that's a unique way to play with LEGOs!",
