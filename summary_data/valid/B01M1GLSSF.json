      "text": "I use this when making had cider. Much easier than than using a hydrometer and far less wasteful of your cider since it only needs 2-3 drops. The instructions were ok but it took a while to feel comfortable when calibrating it. Same when reading the specific gravity/brix scale although using a brighter light source helps. Come with a nice case. Refractometer is very solid/sturdy but you need to handle with care since it is an optical device. I wish I had bought one a long time ago.",

I was able to quickly and accurately assess the gravity of my wort at every step of the way, including monitoring the sparged wort every 5 minutes. Only a couple drops of wort are required for a clear result. The only thing I don't like is how easy the eyepiece turns, which can slightly throw off the focus over time. I highly recommend this product, especially at the price found on Amazon. Buy it already!",

It's also very easy to calibrate, the directions are clear and easy to follow, and it comes in a decent case.",
