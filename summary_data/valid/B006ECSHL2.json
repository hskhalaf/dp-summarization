I'm a big girl and the chairs hold my weight... they feel very sturdy and I don't feel like I'm going to break it. Could probably hold up to a 300lb person no problem. Shipping was pretty slow but I knew it would be when I bought it so thats not a problem. Took me about 3 hours to put it together on my own. Solid wood, sturdy, great buy!! Thanks!",

This was not a problem for us, as it will be mainly for my moms use and she is not super tall, however, you may want to consider the chair height when making your decision to purchase if it is for a taller person.

It would have been much easier if I had another person to help me with the chairs because it can be kind of tricky trying to balance the two sides of the chair to put them together. To be completely honest I think I put the chairs together wrong (the back slats are turned the wrong way... oops) but it's still functional and I'm too lazy to change it so it's still great!",

It seems like such a huge pain to return a large heavy item like this, I don't even know what to do.",

Because it is a natural wood finish, it MUST be protected from water and heat, but hot pads or trivets take care of that. A plastic-covered cloth keeps water off of it when I'm putting plants on it. It is a perfect size, too, and the chairs fit under the table, so they don't take up precious floor space.",
