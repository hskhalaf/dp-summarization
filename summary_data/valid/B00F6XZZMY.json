Ive used obagi C for over 5 years (mostly from different dermatologist offices) and it always stings/tingles just a little bit, makes face a little flush and makes skin feel silky. this does none of that. Its not even the same color. I highly doubt there is any vitamin c in it. Maybe I will do a litmus test,id bet this stuff is very nuetral. I will see if serum discolors over time too. if you let real obagi sit too long, it does turn dark. Save your money. Im a real person, with real experience and this is just oil. I'm pretty pissed, want my money back.",

Vitamin C serums are a great additions to any face treatment. I have used this directly on my skin and had no side effect. I would not, however, try that in the day time. One thing to remember is that vitamin c will brighten the skin, so if you are already pretty fair, you might want to blend it with another product. I am not trying to get lighter, but I really like the glow it gives me. And, the looks I get from people are not to bad either :-).",
