If the past is any indication of what will happen with this LEGO set prior to retirement (when the set is no longer sold), you'll have the opportunity to pick this set up at 30-40% off. Be patient... add this LEGO set to your Amazon list... be ready to pounce when the set goes on sale. Happy bricking!",
