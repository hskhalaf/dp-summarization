But, when she saw this one, she thought it looked great and really liked all the detail and accessories (though it is too bad it doesn't come with the shield and the sword). She said (coyly) that it would make a great stocking stuffer. So, I grabbed one for her before they ran out. Only problem is that it's big, so I guess I'm going to have to buy her a bigger stocking. Hmmmm...maybe that was part of her plan?!?",
