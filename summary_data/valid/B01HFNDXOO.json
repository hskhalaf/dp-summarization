It does not compromise the support it rendered to consumers despite being lightweight. The widest point of the forefoot area served as a stable base, allowing wearers to perform powerful push-offs.However, the shoe\u2019s extended break-in period, poor waterproofing, and insufficient ventilation let consumers down. Overall, the reasonably priced pair of hikers from Merrell may deliver adequate performance on demanding trails, as long as wearers break it in first.",

You'll feel confident wearing these on any hiking trail, even those that have sharp slopes. The shoe is comfy overall.

I will edit as time passes to update on durability. Later edit: A difficult rock climb up Blue Mountain, and these shoes passed with flying colors. Still waterproof, very steady on uneven surfaces, rocks, roots and extreme ascent and descent. No hotspots, no blisters, very comfortable. I'm liking them a lot.",

Being that I\u2019m a woman and having to wear a men\u2019s size because this company doesn\u2019t carry them large enough for me, they fit surprisingly well. I think I would prefer it to have a little better arch support but other than that they worked exactly as described. I sprayed with extra waterproofing after reading other reviews. This resulted in excellent waterproofing - through puddles of water and mud. Great traction on Giants Causeway (saw others slipping while I hopped around the stones without any misstep) and in slippery castle ruins and on cobble stones. Perfect footwear",

I wouldn't run in them. Hiking only. Felt weirdly wide (9.5 normal) on cement, but felt good on the trail itself. I\u2019ll keep em. I could use a way to keep the laces tied better.",

This shoe fits slightly smaller, so I had to go up one-half size. It's a bit stiffer than my first pair, but has good arch support and excellent tread grip, even in wet conditions. My only challenge is with the breathability of the shoe. The waterproof feature clearly reduces the airflow, resulting in sweaty feet even in 60 degree weather, so I suspect hot days this summer will lead to some damp socks from the inside out.
