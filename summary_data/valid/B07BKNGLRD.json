The cage feature pops out the back Cons: 1. Tracks don't rotate very well. 2. Large number of pieces; complex to put together. 3. Pieces along the sides tend to fall off with crashes (although that is to be expected!)",

Had I had to pay full price for this, I probably would have used the $100 to be more practical and spread out the wealth a little bit. That being said, my son loved it and the fact that so many of the characters were included.",

There are a number of fun little details that make this a more intricate set than it looks like (the retractable anchor on the side, for example), and the minifigs that come with it are great. All in all, we had a fun time building it, and the finished product looks very cool in a steampunk kind of way.",

This set is very hard to put together. We are talking hours if the kid(s) do it on their own, which they should. I think any mature kid over 7 (but closer to 8) could handle this. The big winner is Ninjago is fun and the creative play is there for kids to play for hours. Having a lot of characters helps too. Even my oldest (16) who watched the original tv series was into it.
