      "text": "Bought this last year for my trip to the UK and Europe since it can work on both systems and it was great! I actually still use it in the states to charge my iPad since it sends a stronger electrical current then some of the other chargers I have. Only negative thing I would have to say is that sometimes its hard to place it into some sockets since the prongs tend to retract when there is too much force and the button on top doesn't always lock in place, but once you get it in and don't pull on it, you should be fine.",

The side USB charged much more slowly, so just keep that in mind if charging more than one thing at a time. The rounded part fit perfectly in the recessed outlet in the hotel and stayed secure. I also love the little case. Nice touch for packing. I bought another adapter but never used it - I stuck with this one the entire 2 weeks.",

I'm not sure how to explain how this thing is better than the others, but it just is.",

Not only does the product work as advertised but it also is the last travel adapter I\u2019ll ever need since it supports all plug types. Additionally, the two USB charging ports came in handy when the need to charge both my laptop and cell phone arrised. The case that the adapter comes with is also an added bonus. I would recommend this travel adapter to anyone who has the need for one.",
