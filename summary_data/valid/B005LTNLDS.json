Unfortunately, the way they package the product makes it impossible for you to see how it functions till you break the package open since it is pre-sealed around the edge.

Great quality and very user friendly There is a switch to screw or unscrew on top and u can lock it to use it manually for delicate jobs. Don't expect to drill walls with this one. Black and decker offer another model that can do that",
