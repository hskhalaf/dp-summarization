      "text": "I love these headphones. Love them. There's no doubt these headphones SOUND better than any Beats or Bose headphone I've ever used. However, I am not so sure they are BUILT better than Beats or Bose. As much as I love these headphones, I don't use them very often. So imagine my surprise after 5 months of very infrequent use, one of the headphones fell off the headband right at the hinge. PSB requires that you go through the vendor for any returns, so I called Audio Advisor and requested an RMA. They were quick to answer and quick to respond. Hopefully the headphones that I get back will last longer than 5 months.",

I have a half dozen jacks laying around unsued, so that did not really bother me. However, about a year after purchase the right speaker began shorting with increasing frequency, and eventually no longer worked. The sound on these things was great for the price until it turned to early retirement.",

The bad is that for someone with a fairly large head like myself they are a bit tight and uncomfortable. I think the tight seal it makes around the ear combined with the tight fit makes a fair amount of air pressure on the ear canal. They also look a bit awkward when I wear them (for me at least). The folding hinge makes me nervous about its durability, but I havnt had any problems yet.",
