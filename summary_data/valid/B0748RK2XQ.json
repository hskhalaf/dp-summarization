The only negative, and the one that drops this from a five star to a four star rating, was that the battery in each needed to be replaced within a couple of weeks. These are specialized batteries and not inexpensive.",

    "title": "Zircon Leak Alert WiFi - Smart Electronic Water Detector Alarm with Email, Audio and Visual Alerts - Battery Included",
    "description": "Size:1 Pack| Style:WiFi Email AlertThe Zircon Leak Alert WiFi smart water detector is a wifi water sensor and alarm that protects your property. This compact wifi leak detector allows for easy placement anywhere in any place that has potential for flooding or leaks such as near water heaters, sinks, dishwashers, sump pumps, and more. The Leak Alert WiFi is battery operated, wireless and fully automatic so no wiring or hub is required and all the limitations of hub-based wired products on the market are avoided. When moisture is detected, the wifi water detector will sound an 105 dB alarm, emit a visual warning by flashing a SOS, and will send an email alert via your Wi-Fi connection to up to five email addresses to warn you of the water leak. This could potentially save thousands of dollars in water damages. The Zircon Leak Alert WiFi eliminates the need for all the expensive accessory equipment by operating independently on a hub-less platform. Each unit operates independently of each other and can be individually named, allowing for an infinite number of units to be on guard protecting your space from water damage. Name each wifi water alarm during the set-up process (it is best to name each unit uniquely based on the location the device is utilized) and the emergency email will alert you of the exact location of the problem allowing for even faster intervention. Should a flood occur, the Leak Alert WiFi unit will float and continue to send out visual flashing alerts, an auditory alarm, and email notifications so it can be both seen and heard from a distance. Zircon designed this wifi water leak detector to chirp and send email notifications when the battery is running low and needs to be replaced. Each Leak Alert WiFi unit includes an easily installed standard 3V Lithium battery to keep your smart water leak sensor running at optimal performance. Just like your smoke detector, remember to check and replace your Leak Alert WiFi batteries every year. The Leak Alert WiFi is the perfect water detector for HOA, multi-unit, and multi-story property managements. It is also a great smarthome device to meet the needs of your property and protect your apartment, home or office. The Zircon Leak Alert WiFi allows you to save money and protect your entire property with one purchase.",
