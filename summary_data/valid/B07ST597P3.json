The good point is that Back wheel is with rubber so in general it is not going back without hard push and It go ahead smoothly. Overall the Wlaker is light and simple. My baby liked it. I recommend it who looking for a convenient walker for his baby within a reasonable price.",

      "text": "We bought this oh so darling little #SAFETYFIRST, #ReadySetWalk walker in the #DiamondBlush fabric pattern for my great niece for Christmas 2019 and she LOVES IT. So easy to assemble and I love the little detachable activity center with specialty toys, included, PLUS the handy little, convenient tray designed into the walker so that she can occupy herself AND nibble away on her treats while mom is doing quick little tasks around the house. Love the \"stow-away\" feature which is such a bonus. And Safety First baby products is a long-time, trusted brand name that has spoken for itself for years. Very satisfied buyer in this household! ~XOX",

It was easy to set up, everything clicks and snaps together. The toys and seat are a great quality, the lowest setting works great for her to reach the floor, she can\u2019t walk just yet but it\u2019ll be great when she can. I does not work well on carpet but it\u2019s great on our hardwood floors.",

It was money well spent and it is very sturdy!",
