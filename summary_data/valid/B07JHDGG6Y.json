Although the software installed on the devices themselves is proving more informative, as the Bitbox doesn't have much to say. Port forwarding was not easy to find and the online user guide was not helpful. Good device management and device information. My BT Home Hub 5 didn't like it, until after two reboots and now it's running perfectly.",

I recommend Bitdefender Box 2, 1,000,000,000,000% !!! Probably the best investments in your online security and safety that you'll ever make!",

Buying this product does theoretically give bitdefender access to your network traffic as it needs this to function properly. Its also worth mentioning this product isnt designed to work as a standalone router, although built in wifi is available if required. Overall it does what it says on the tin, however dont expect it to be 'hack proof' rather a good means of defending the average home from well known attacks. There is also an \u00a379 annual fee after your first year of use. I presume this is in-line with other AV products of this nature, however its worth considering this before purchasing.",
