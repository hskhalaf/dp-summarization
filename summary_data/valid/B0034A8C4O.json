This makes fitting both cord and accessories in the storage container almost impossible. The electrical cord in all of the photos from the marketing department at Cuisinart has magically disappeared. Had I been shown the truth, as shown in my photo, I would not have wasted my money for an expensive plastic container that now sits apart from the mixer. The Mixer works fine.",

It also has a greater variety of speeds which lessens the splatter from liquids and flour. Also comes with dough hooks and a whisk. Works great . . . very pleased with the item.",

It takes several tries every time. There\u2019s a slot at the end of the mixer where it\u2019s supposed to go, but getting the rest of it to stay put so you can carry it around by its handle is a crap shoot. Very annoying.",

The beaters look light weight, and I was worried that they wouldn't stand up to heavier chores, but there's been no problem. Though it isn't as quiet as a stand mixer, the Cuisinart is much quieter than the Proctor Silex mixer it's replacing. There's a good range of speeds, and when you need to add ingredients, the mixer has a squared end rest. I love that the beaters are stored neatly under the mixer. I would definitely recommend this mixer.",
