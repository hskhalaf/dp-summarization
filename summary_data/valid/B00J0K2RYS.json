On December 27, 2019, the oven portion of the unit decided that it didn't want to work anymore (heating element doesn't appear to be working). At this point, an Easy Bake Oven would be more effective. It's a shame, because it's an attractive oven, and it HAD been working beautifully. Unfortunately, my window to return the product closed on December 4th, so I'm stuck with a fairly pricey microwave. I regret ignoring other people's reviews that had mentioned the heating element going out -- could have saved me some disappointment.",

Two days ago, the oven started to trip the breaker. Now only the microwave option is useable without tripping the power. We had the outlets checked and they are fine. Suddenly the dial button has become creaky. Instead of being a smooth dial, it feels like it's grinding. This happened all of a sudden. I am very disappointed and I don't know, if I can receive a replacement or my money back. I wouldn't by from this company again.",

The microwave works well but isn't powerful since it's small so takes extra time. After using for awhile... we noticed it gets quite wet inside after using it, more than other micros. We leave the door open to dry out. And we have to add to cooking time due to low power.",
