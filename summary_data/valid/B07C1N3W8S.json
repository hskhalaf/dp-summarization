Open multiple windows and didn't see any slow down . Love the idea of hiding the unit behind the TV and going to add extra storage to accommodate all my wife's pictures and the installation is so simple .Unit is really cute to behold and for the price think its great value . There is enough usb ports to had extra stuff if required - ie external dvd unit . I've only had the unit for a short while but i'm in love with it - one of my best buys this year",

I have attached peripherals easily. I kept the original windows on the small drive. So I can always boot from it in an emergency. My only complaint is the lack of documentation. So I had to search the web to find out how to enter the boot configuration as an example.",
