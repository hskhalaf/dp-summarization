The stand I had was not meant for fish tank so it did collapse with the entire 20 gallon water in the tank and several fish! Surprisingly this Tetra 20 gallon fish tank did not break! The fish tank even landed on the stones as everything in the tank fell on the floor and flooded my space but no damage to the glass tank! Not even a scratch! I later bought a good stand that was able to hold the 20 gallon tank. I will recommend this product to all!",

The filter is as quiet as advertised, but not the most powerful (Tip: Use bio sponge filter media pad for mechanical and biological filtration instead of disposable filter cartridges). The heater keeps the tank water at a constant 78 degrees F. The LED lights under the hood are bright and well displaced. The frame hinges that come with the hood are an excellent feature (most aquarium kits lack hinges for the hood); they make opening and closing the hood very convenient. The glass on the tank is very strong, solid and easy to clean. This is a great tank for fresh or salt water aquariums.",
