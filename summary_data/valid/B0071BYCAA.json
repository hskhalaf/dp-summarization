The first time took about 20 minutes to figure out all the combinations, but now he is able to combine all 11 zords, plus add in the SharkZord and LightZord, in about 3-5 minutes.

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The Bandai Power Rangers Bull Megazord warrior toy faithfully captures the awesome power of the giant transforming samurai robot featured in Power Rangers. This colorful and impressively statured figure offers two transformation modes, allowing kids to play with the toy as a samurai robot or rampaging bull. Or, they can combine it with other Zord vehicles and figures to create the Ultrazord (each sold separately). With its extending legs, rotating shoulder blasters, oversize Gatling cannon, and six wheels, the Bull Megazord offers mighty morphin' fun for ages four and up.\n\nMegazord stands over 1 foot tall in samurai mode. View larger.CHANGES FROM SAMURAI ROBOT TO BULL MEGAZORD\n The Bull Megazord comes as a sleek samurai robot warrior, but can quickly be transformed into the impressive Bull Megazord. In its robot form, the figure stands over 1 foot tall and is enhanced by moveable arms, rotating shoulder-mounted blasters, and an attachable Gatling cannon accessory that can be held in either hand or stored on its waist.\n\n When it's time for the samurai robot to charge into battle, the figure transforms into the ferocious Bull Megazord complete with golden bull horns. In just a few easy steps, kids can rotate the arms, extend the legs and head, and flip the figure over to allow it to roll on its six wheels for a piercing attack.\n\nCOMBINE WITH OTHER FIGURES TO CREATE ULTRAZORD\n For enhanced fun, the Bull Megazord can be combined with select Power Rangers Zord vehicles and figures to create the ultimate weapon--the Ultrazord (each sold separately). Choose from a variety of items in the ZordBuilder Collection and snap them to the Bull Megazord's body to create your own unique hero. For guidance, a step-by-step instruction sheet is included demonstrating a variety of figure combinations.\n\n This figure is not as sophisticated as some other transforming robots on the market, and its articulation is limited--only its arms rotate. However, the transformation process is easy to accomplish as kids need only rotate the arms into position, pull the legs out, and extend the figure's head forward to change the basic configuration. Because of its ease of use and imaginative design, the Bull Megazord makes for a versatile toy to play with and relive your favorite Power Rangers moments.\n\nABOUT POWER RANGERS\n Appealing to a global audience since 1993, Power Rangers has become an international phenomenon. Airing in more than 40 markets worldwide and offering more than 700 episodes to date, the show emphasizes the importance of teamwork, personal responsibility, physical fitness, and helping those in need. Power Rangers chronicles the exciting adventures of ordinary young people who morph into extraordinary superheroes to work together in solving challenges.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n Power Rangers Megazord Bull Megazord, Gatling cannon, and instructions.\n\nAT A GLANCE:\n * Bull Megazord offers two play modes\n * Morphs from samurai warrior to Bull Megazord\n * Can be combined with additional figures in ZordBuilder Collection (sold separately)\n * Includes rotating shoulder blasters and Gatling cannon \n * Stands over 1 foot tall in samurai mode\n\nAGE/WEIGHT REQUIREMENTS:\n * Four years and up\n\nASSEMBLY REQUIREMENTS:\n * No assembly required\n\nBull Megazord morphs from samurai warrior to Bull Megazord.
