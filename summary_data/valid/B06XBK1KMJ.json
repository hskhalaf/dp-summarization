All over the walls... then tracked it throughout the house as he ran around in a frenzy!

The reason for only three stars is the product could be greatly improved if shaped so the cones stick out further, and if some additional velcro areas were added to create a better fit. I used these on two toy poodles, and both puppies have small necks (if that is helpful to know).",
