Since it is a laser, you would think they would make the keyboard full size or give the option to switch between the two. I really don't use it because I am frustrated. I am giving it a 4 for the cool factor. Also, some of the keys are moved to an additional row above the function keys so you need to learn a \"new\" keyboard to use it.",

I like it and will probably buy more to give away as gifts.",

I kept sending it into cursor mode because the change over button (from cursor to keyboard mode) is right next to the space bar on the right and my right hand must lean that way when I am typing. Therefore, the \"hunt and peck\" method is actually better with your elbows slightly akimbo so you can type what you want and not get gobbly-guk. Overall, I really like it. It is an excellent alternative to the more pricey ones.",
