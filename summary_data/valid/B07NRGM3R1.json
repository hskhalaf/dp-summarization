I can barely smell the scent unless I hold it close to my nose. It's probably just me in my opinion, but I like a candle that you can small even for a small bathroom. Plus the excitement of expecting it as aromatic is down the drain. I can barely smell it. I have bought cabdleo this small of a size but smells great when lit up. I see it more for just display. I'm a bit disappointed.",

It's just a mild flower smelling which makes her really happy. I will say it's really high quality and the price is also affordable.",
