      "text": "I put these on my road bike at the recommendation of a friend of mine who also has some. My original tires were very fast (low rolling resistance) but, a consistent thickness throughout their width, were prone to retain road debris, risking punctures. These tires are more thick on center, which makes them better at resisting punctures as well as providing a little softer ride, which is appreciated. I will say that the softness of the rubber does seem to increase rolling resistance a little, but not significantly. I will gladly trade a little rolling resistance for the extra security of resisting punctures. I'm a casual rider, not a racer, so these were a great replacement.",

They are not as big or thick as mountain bike tires, so they are fine for street use, and perhaps an occasional well beaten path. We bought the Gatorskins to replace a set of racing tires which kept getting punctures on our paved streets. So far the Gatorskins seem tougher and have not suffered any punctures.",

After I installed these new tires yesterday I could not wait to take them for a ride. After a 3 hour ride, I am happy about how quiet and smooth they are. And it seems they are also more comfortable to ride than my last set. I highly recommend them.",

In the hundred-odd miles I put on them over really garbage roads, I had 2 deep gouges from construction debris. Probably nails. No flats! The rubber was gouged away down to what I think is a kevlar strip. The kevlar stopped the penetration, so I rode on without realizing I had taken a hit. All in all, that's insurance you can't buy.",
