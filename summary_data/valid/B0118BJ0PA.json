The razors are thin and sharp as hell which makes a great clean/smooth shave. Make sure to change your razor blade every 3 or 4 shaving sessions if you want to always get a smooth one-stroke shave.",

Slow and steady is the path to achieve that barbershop quality. Well worth the investment, I do not need to purchase a strop for the edge, five to six shaves per blade. Brings me to a time when Men were Men.",

It was my first shave with a straight edge razor and it went without a hitch. No nicks no cuts. At the end of my shave I recreated the scene from Gangs of New York and slashed my cheek. \"The blood stays on the blade. One day you'll understand.\" One thing that people might like to know is that my razor came with some scratches. I don't mind but I want to let people know that there were visible scratches all over the thing. It still performed well. I look forward to using this more often.",
