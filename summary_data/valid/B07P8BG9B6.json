They thought of everything in their designs and audio quality is superb for music and the less demanding lower fidelity movie audio. You can\u2019t go wrong with this. That being said, I really dont think you can go wrong with any brand these days. Just make sure you get the power and number of channels you want.",

Sort of like switching from a flip phone to a smart phone. Now that I've used it for a few weeks I love. I like when I turn on my TiVo that the receiver starts also because of some two way communication magic through the HDMI cable.",

Just know that, if you turn zone B on, none of the listening modes will be available. Took me a bit of time to figure out this was the cause. Was never mentioned in the operating manual and could not find anywhere else where this was discussed.",

When running a switch thru the pass thru it would cut out for a few second every so often which would ruin the game you were playing. Other than that it works great, ARC works well, pairs well with Klipsch surround system from costco.",
