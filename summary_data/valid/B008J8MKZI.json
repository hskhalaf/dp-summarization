I like the toasters features and the way it toasts but they need to change the handle lever back to metal and it would be a great toaster.

The bagel ends up crushed against the retaining grid, and after toasting, adheres to the grid. I the have to pry the bagel free. Also, the spring to pop up the toast is VERY weak, I have to manually lift anything but thinly sliced bread. Temperature control is difficult to read.
