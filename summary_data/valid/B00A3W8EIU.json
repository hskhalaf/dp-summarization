Rode with it maybe 6 times before the cheap straps gave way. The straps wouldn't stay tight and the movement caused the primary support strap to wear quickly. The post strap is fixed on to the bag and doesn't wrap well enough around the seat post to be completely secure. My last seat pack was way better quality and lasted 15 years, but just a bit too tight on space. See pics.",

It still held stuff though, and when I got home, I redid the connection with a giant Zip tie. I have it working now..but if you like your things nice and new...do something about the top connection BEFORE your first ride.",

Probably a great pack for true bikers, who wear phone on their back in their shirt pocket, but not for casual neighborhood and trail riding where you're gone for just a few hours.",

The straps with a buckle attached also seem to have been strangely attached. But for the price, it works fine and, despite the minor quirks it's a safe buy.",

The expandable section would be fine for carrying extra stuff in emergencies, but I personally would not want to use it every day.",

I recommend to pass a little wire or something between the main zippers to avoid them of opening in the middle of the road, I used one \"plastic covered wire\" that comes in the bread bags of the supermarket and never have any more problems.",

If I\u2019m going more adventurous, there\u2019s still enough room for a patch kit, co2 inflator/cartridge, and maybe another extraneous small thing or two. If I really Tetris it, I can get my iPhone X in there with all the standard stuff, but that usually goes on a stem mount.",
