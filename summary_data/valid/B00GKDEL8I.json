A pet-peeve of mine is when you can see the pole through the branches and this tree was full enough that it wasn't an issue.

The tree is the perfect height and is FULL instead of narrow like most artificial trees these days. This is the traditional shape that everyone thinks of when picturing the classic 'Christmas Tree'. It comes shipped in three peices which are easy to assemble and the branches are hinged so they easily drop down into the correct configuration. Seriously, this is the perfect Artificial Tree and blows away those overly expensive crappy ones found at brick and mortar stores. A tree this quality should easily cost $300+ at hardware/department stores.",

Great way to handle the issue and we could start decorating the tree immediately.",
