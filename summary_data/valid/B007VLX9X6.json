Unfortunately it has a raised-line going through the entire length of the table top. Luckily I can cover it with some magazines. I would not recommend if you are using it for yourself or giving as a gift.",

The first package must have been a returned unit because the package was damaged and only came with 3 of the 4 legs.

I love the design and think the quality is decent, but they were packaged poorly and not handled carefully during shipping.",
