      "text": "This was fantastic for a while. But after five months, it developed a stress fracture on the top knuckle making it so that one of the legs pops off and is extremely loose. Annoying sure, but it's well within one year warranty so I'm thinking, \"No big, right?\" Nope... wrong. After some weeks of contacting the email listed for warranty claims on JOBY's website I get crickets. Because Amazon is awesome (and prolly because I'm an irresponsible impulse buyer) they're accepting a courtesy return so I'll be alright, but be warned. Your tripod may only last a few months and don't count on JOBY to replace it if it does.",

I'm using it with a canon 70D & Sony RX 100 M3. Although it is a bit of over kill for the Sony, it works great for the Canon. With that said, I am only using a 10-18mm lens and not a telephoto. I also don't have a mic or extra attachments on the 70D. So I didn't see the need for the larger version. Great quality gorillapod",

I use it with a Canon G7Xii and a Sony a6300 without problem. Only complaint, the screw mechanism that goes into the camera could be a better design (e.g., with a folding clip) so you don't have to have a coin to tighten (or in my case, strain my nails)",

It has been through a great many adventures with me over the years & it has stood up tot he test of time, but at this point the legs are super loose & sometimes pop off.

I still highly recommend if you're looking for something like this.

I bought the one with the level indicator on the ball so much easier to set it up quickly (the ball head has quick-release).
