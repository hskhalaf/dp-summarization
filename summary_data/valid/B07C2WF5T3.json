The water resistant cover on the charging port barely allows enough clearance to plug in and charge the unit. I expect that it will get torn off after only a handful of charges. It doesn't seem to seal the charging port very well either. Battery holds up without issue so far. Very lightweight and compact. 3 stars for ease of use because the accessories don't attach very securely, but that is manageable.",

The included attachments don't fit in standard air mattress intakes. It's also not powerful enough for air mattresses. After a mild inflation it just chokes and won't continue inflating. The Pros, it's small and the power is surprinsingly long lasting given this cheap product. Overall this is too expensive for its cheap quality. DONT BUY! unless you're planning to only inflate balloons.",
