      "verdict": "The Nike Downshifter 7 road running shoe was welcomed by a lot of shoe enthusiasts and novice runners. They were happy with this product\u2019s affordable price and quality construction. The sizing scheme and width options were also given praise as they apparently adhered to people\u2019s expectations. It accommodated the foot adequately and kept it comfortable, based on user feedback. On the other hand, some individuals felt that the in-shoe fit was narrow, that the wet-surface grip was dodgy, and that the overall construction wasn\u2019t intended for hardcore workouts and runs.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of the testers commented on how comfortable the underfoot experience of the Nike Downshifter 7 was during their runs",
        "The lightweight configuration of this running shoe gained fans who felt that it permitted them to effortlessly wear it all day",
        "The trademark Nike swoosh is much appreciated by many consumers because it apparently gave the shoe that classic Nike look",
        "The minimalist design allowed testers to use the shoe for activities other than running, like walking and circuit training",
        "People liked the variety of color schemes that were available for this running shoe, stating that the options were pleasing to the eyes",
        "Several users recognized the value of the shoe considering its build and features",
        "The price of the Nike Downshifter 7 was affordable, and people flocked to this shoe because of it",
        "Almost every consumer stated that the Nike Downshifter 7 had a sizing scheme that followed their preferences",
        "The width profile was welcomed for being snug yet unrestrictive"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A few of those who have tested the Nike Downshifter 7 expressed how narrow the shoe felt despite getting the shoe in their usual width",
        "A good number of reviews noted that this running shoe did not provide decent traction on wet surfaces",
        "Several users stated that the shoes are more for casual wear or light exercise, and not so much for running long distances or extreme training"

      "text": "After reading about how the successful Kenyans run (on their toes, no need for air-filled heels), I tried a pair of these a couple of years ago as a relatively inexpensive, lightweight shoe for long-distance running. My first pair have finally worn down to a point where the soles are too slippery, but they have lasted well - they have taken me 1000 miles this year alone, including two marathons. They have always been comfortable, and are suitable for casual wear as well. So, I am happy to buy another pair to keep me running.",

Material has not faded over time as one might expect with a cheaper pair of trainers. Didn't have an issue with sizing. Only downside is that I don't find them to be supportive for exercising. Wore these when I wanted to go running and ended up with a knee injury for 3+ weeks as they don't seem to have the right sole build to absorb impact due to only being some kind of foam.",

Fits quite snug but having read previous reviews I was expecting that so went up half a size. Very light and well structured around the heel and toe box. I will need an insole to help with arch support but thats not an issue. Sole has a nice spring to it and is quite low profile. Overall the shoe has good breathability and looks really nice. Might even buy a 2nd pair for work as I do a lot of standing.",
