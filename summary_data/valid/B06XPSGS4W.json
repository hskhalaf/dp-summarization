It wasted my 170$. USELESS.",

The tech support system is not very sophisticated, and it is impossible to speak with someone to help you. There are little to no troubleshooting instructions. Would not buy this product if I had it to do over again.",

He goes crazy running around looking for me which is a little heartbreaking to watch.",

Works great as a nanny cam. Only downside is it has 9 treat dispensing slots so it can only dispense 9 treats while you're away. I'm spacing treats out a little bit longer than I would like to and run the risk of that nervous behavior showing up. It's better than nothing, though, and once she's over the crate training phase I'm sure the treat quantity won't matter as much.",
