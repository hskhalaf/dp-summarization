They loved the previous model so I purchased this one for them when they dropped their old one and broke it. The WiFi feature is nice and the camera performs good for the price I paid for it. If you are expecting to get a professional camera for the this price then look elsewhere. It has basic functions for the everyday user or someone young in need of a camera. Quality of pictures is nice and like stated before for the price you cant complain. I would buy again.",

Kids mode works to catch kids attention. Wifi capabilities are cool but I have never been able to use it",

      "text": "Used this camera on a recent 5 week trip abroad. I am happy with the quality and the feature set but one thing that I found really inconvenient wad switching between photo and video, it takes 4 clicks of 3 different buttons to switch. Capturing vacation moments frequently involve both videos and still photos so this camera is a poor choice for that. Furthermore, the switching is further delayed by about 1 second after power on due to its internal initialization so I missed many photo opportunities due to 1 second delay and 4 clicks of 3 different buttons. If you are taking still photos exclusively, this review won't apply to you.",

The front-view LCD screen was one of our favorite features. It allowed us to take self-photos in front of landmarks without always having to ask someone to take the picture for us. Our one complaint was that we had difficulty getting the camera to upload pictures to the internet unless the wifi in the area was incredibly strong. It worked at home in our apartment, but in local places like Starbucks it did not work.",

      "text": "I have had this camera for about 4 months now and I honestly can say the picture quality is not good. Especially considering the 16.1 Mega pixels of this camera. I have taken about 200 photos and had only 15 of them clear. I do not like the picture quality so I am not sure how to rate this camera. Now, this camera does come with many features such as Wifi and built in software it is fun to play around with it. However, bottom line is the picture quality is unsatisfactory for me. So I will give it a 3 star and probably will never buy another Samsung camera.",
