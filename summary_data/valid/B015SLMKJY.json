It will only work with mechanical chimes and it does not do that very reliably. SkyBell is a much better product and all the necessary adapters are available to make it work seamlessly with digital and mechanical chimes. I have a chain of emails between myself and August technical support that document my frustration with the product. Bottom line, save yourself the hassle by just staying clear of All August products.",

I finally contacted support a month later and they remotely installed pre-release firmware on my device. Ever since then, the doorbell has performed flawlessly. It connects fast and reliably, and the video quality is stunning. Now I'm just waiting for the motion detection update and I'll be one very happy customer.",
