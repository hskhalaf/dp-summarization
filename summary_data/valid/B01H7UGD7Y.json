      "text": "This under desk keyboard tray is solid and strong. The metal supports are heavy gauge metal. The keyboard tray itself is adjustable and solid. The big problem is that the slider is not equipped with ball bearing tracks. This makes the tray very difficult to slide. The tray does not slide smoothly under the desk, and requires 2 hands and a strong grip to get it to move. My prior tray could be pushed with one finger. Also the actual keyboard platform seems to be generic for multiple differs sliders, and has screw holes on top that are not used, resulting in an unsightly appearance. However overall the unit is functional.",

I have a big platform at work which I expect that cost quite a bit $, in terms of stability they both are very similar but this one is not super ergonomic. Not very smooth to put the platform out and under the desk, but still possible if pushing it up a little. Comparing the price with other platforms, this one functions very great!",

The only drawback was the sliding mechanism. Definitely not as smooth as others I have seen that use roller bearings.

My main complaint is that there is a really horrible off gassing coming from the wrist rest. Fortunately it can be removed. Hopefully a few days of fresh air with fix this.
