It was a little tricky getting the bottom plate in place (it doesn't come installed) but once that was done it's brain-dead simple to operate. Load your charcoal, throw some paper in the bottom (add oil to the paper if you want, helps it catch) and wait a couple minutes. Your coals will be ROCKET hot. Hold over the grill and pull the release handle and the coals drop in place. VERY easy. Add more coals on top if needed. The super large capacity of this model means you can get rolling faster.",

Well, after maybe a dozen uses, the bottom flap fell out of the thing, and even though I could place it back together, it just kept falling out after every two or three uses. It is very flimsy and borders on 'cheap'. And I hate to say that because I like the Char-Griller company. So...I went to Lowes and picked up a Webber brand chimney. It's designed differently, with a permanent bottom and no flap that could bend and fall out. I used the Webber last night and it worked great. (Yes I grill every chance I get) Anyways...beware of the flap!",

      "text": "I bought this chimney for my Char Griller Akorn grill. It does light the charcoal easily. The problem comes from the release at the bottom. It seems really sticky. Also, the tabs that sit in the holes and hold it in place on the opposite side from the handle don't hold the tabs well - they can slide out, dropping your charcoal prematurely if they aren't sitting just right. I eventually bent the tabs down with a pliers so they would stay in place. A couple of times, the release wouldn't let the flap go, and I ended up having to dump the red-hot charcoal out of the top.",
