I\u2019m using it in conjunction with an Abus 540 U-Lock, to secure the front wheel and in case I need to secure the bike to something larger than the U-Lock will fit. It\u2019s over 7 feet long so it will wrap around both your wheels and the frame and a thick streetlight. This is a thick cable and it will not fit through the seat rails so it can\u2019t secure your seat. It\u2019s flexible enough to wind it into a tight circle and it\u2019s got a thick clear coating on it so it won\u2019t scratch the paint.",

The cable has a velcro attachment to keep it folded. I never use it because I fold it and stick it in my backpack. The cable is very long and therefore it is easy to lock every item of the bicycle. I didn't manage to make it go through the attachment of my saddle as the cable is too thick.",
