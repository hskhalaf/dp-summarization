It's easy to adjust by pulling it forward then moving back. I don't feel like it's gonna snap on me or anything (weight 170). It's easy to slide behind furniture or in the closet when it's not in use. Also there is just enough cushion. I have a sensitive tail bone from an injury and it doesn't irritate it at all.",

My boyfriend and I love them so much for playing board games on our new coffee table or on the floor. It provides extra seating for guests to sit around our coffee table in addition to our couch.

We don't, so we store it (which is easy enough to do as it's slim), but it won't get the use it could if we left it out permanently (we were placing it on the sofa).

The teachers informed me last week that they are no longer using the second chair because if the babies push on the chair, the chair can unfold and fall on the child. I wanted to return and exchange for a sturdier built chair that was better designed for our needs, but apparently we just missed the return window. [I'd direct this feedback directly to the seller, but I can't do so privately without providing a review of some kind.]",

Chair back is slightly shorter than I was hoping for, but it still supports up to my shoulder blades which is good enough. Most of the negative reviews I read were issues with durability.
