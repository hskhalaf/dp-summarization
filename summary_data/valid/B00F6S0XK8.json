The fans also shipped with what I can only assume were the wrong screws. This was my first PC fan replacement so I don't know much about them, but the screws provided were only about 1/4 inch long and too wide to thread through the corner holes. No other mounting screws came. I found my old mounting bolts after an hour of searching and mounted it that way. The fan itself is quiet and seems to move a lot of air, but the overall experience of this purchase is definitely 1-star.",

The 140s ar ethe fans to get if your case supports them over the 120s cause can move the same amount of air of a 120 but at lower speeds thus being quiter. Can't go wrong with Corsair, in my opinion one of the best in PC market.",

I have used other corsair fans in my systems (ML120s & SP120s) and must say I was disapointed to see this fan does not have any rubber vibration dampening going on at the fan mounts, but for the price of the fan I can over look this. So far I'm quite happy with it.",

Since the price was right, I bought a two-pack, and my nieces love their i5 CPU computer. The prices was great too. I would recommend these fans to a friend or family member.",

These things get loud when on max speed and my SP120 performance fans are way quieter than these which should be the opposite. My PC sounds like a jet engine on full load.

      "text": "I bought this product in January 2020, and at time of writing, it's 5/24/2020. I bought these fans as a replacement for a stock NZXT fan in my tower that had gone bad in my PC (bad bearing, causing lots of noise). One now failed today. Immediately ordering another set of fans from a different company. Not about to wait until the other one starts making a hideous sound as well. Never buying corsair fans again, that's for sure.",

One of the fans did not work when I installed them but was able to get another replacement in. I am very pleased with this overall purchase. The fans are pretty quiet in the environment I'm in and can definitely feel a much better airflow through my PC. I would definitely recommend getting these fans to those looking to upgrade or build their PC.",

My computer is much quieter than what it was before by far! I replaced my old Cooler Master fans with these, because these actually pushed more air and stated they were quiet compared to my old ones. The red l.e.d lights on the case fans are bright, but not too bright. They are very true to their color as well. My side panel on my case is smoked plexi-glass, so I can see the light, but it's not blinding. Overall, I highly recommend these fans for if you need to get new ones that are quiet.",

If you are up for the challenge, your motherboard indicates where the fans are to be plugged in. Be aware that plugging into the main control board will pull a little power from your operating speed (just a little), but if you have a fast system you may not notice the change. I gave 4 stars for durability but honestly how can you quantify durability after just two months use? These fans are a sound purchase.",

Also, at 100% speed the fans aren't so quiet. But if you lower it to 60% speed from your BIOS or using a fan controller then it's very quiet. I got the blue LED model and it adds some nice ambient light into the PC case. I would recommend to anyone that wants quieter fans and cooler temperatures.",
