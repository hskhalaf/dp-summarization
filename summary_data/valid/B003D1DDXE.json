They work well for when you need to turn your pump on, but when it came time to vacuum my pool, all the debris just fell straight through and went back into my pool. I have to have my husband vacuum while I hold a nylon/filter saver on my outlet to catch the debris. It does not have the basket inside like the Summer Escapes filters. Overall I am happy. If I could have found the summer escapes filters in this quantity for this price, I would have bought those instead, but these will do until next summer when walmart gets them in again.",
