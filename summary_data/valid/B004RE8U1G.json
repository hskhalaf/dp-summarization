      "text": "As another customer said, there is no cooler under any seat. What appears to be cuphoders are fishing rod holders with holes too small for any cup or can. The transom appears study enough for a small electric trolling motor but there is no provision for tying down a storage battery to power the motor, so what good is the square stern and transom? I recommend the KI industries 156 instead. It does have a cooler under the center seat. It does have cup holders. It is 1.5 feet longer for more stability and it is available from Walmart for about $450.",

I am sure it is a simple mistake but needs to be corrected. The price was an excellent value.",

All screws were half in, rear transport handle, connected at one point, all had to be screwed in. The most important thing is stability and ease to transport, it does the job with flying colors. I can see the screws being loose due to the truck shipment, along with the dent. It's plastic and the dent popped out, but the other advertised features missing thats purely BS, if your not going to put them on the canoe, then don't include them.",

Nice and quite when fishing along the banks with a very shallow draft. Car top launch. 14' does require registration, no biggie though. A drawback on the hard plastic seats that dont fit traditional aftermarket add on canoe (bleacher seat) style seating. I found the GCI sitbacker with extension strap will work.",

Handled smoothly in the water and with me rideing solo it was very stable. The canoe had plenty of extra cargo room and with 6 fishing rod holders haveing multiple fishing rods in the water was simple. The only complaint that I can think of is it was missing a \"rivet\" on one side the gunrail when I brought it home. Overall it seems to be well worth the money. Other online reviews I have read say that \"plastic canoes\" should last 10-15years with proper care-storage. Cant really go wrong with this canoe for under $500.",
