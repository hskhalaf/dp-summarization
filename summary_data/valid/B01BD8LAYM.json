I see these lasting a good number of years. I would buy there again and I highly recommend them.",

I needed bookends that would stay put and not slide around when I removed or put back the large cookbooks stored on the polished wooden shelf of my baker's rack. These two guys work perfectly. Not only do they have some weight to them but they have long bases for increased stability and the bottoms are coated with a non-slip material. Now, when I remove a book and its neighbors tip to fill the void, the bookends stay in place and keep the rest of the stack from collapsing. Fabulous and well worth the money!",

Other than that, they are sturdy and pretty heavy duty. Price wise, I think they could be cheaper.",
