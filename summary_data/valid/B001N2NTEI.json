      "text": "The drill broke after a few years of light use. It stopped spinning as I was driving a screw into some wood despite a fully charged battery. Otherwise, it is an adequate drill although not super powerful. I was very disappointed at its longevity. Theoretically you can take it into an authorized repair center to be repaired under warrantee, but no repair center within 50 miles actually repairs cordless drills. I filed a warrantee claim with Metabo-HPT (which now owns Hitachi) and I will see if they honor the lifetime warrantee.",

It is light and fast and powerful enough to do all of my around the house tasks. I don't know what else to say than it is so much better than any corded or cordless drill that I have ever used in my life. Power, precision, ease of use, feel are all great. It is also one of the least expensive quality drills. I can't tell you if this will work for contractor grade work, but for around the house it is terrific. The light...eh, it's pretty pathetic, but you can just not bother with it.",

I finished up the job with an old Ridgid drill that this one was supposed to replace. I typically have to replace my cordless drills every 2 years or so. I don't know if this was just a bad one or not, but I rely on my tools to much to try again.",

For me; if I need more power with long run times, get out the big heavy duty corded drill. The carry case has lots of room for other stuff, which is nice when compared to previous drills I've had. The flashlight is kinda gimicky in this day of mini LED units, but it still may get some use. Highly recommended.",

This unit is also lightweight and comes with two batteries that charge very fast in no time at all.

    "title": "Hitachi DS18DSAL 18-Volt Lithium Ion Compact Pro Driver Drill with Flashlight",
    "description": "Rated \"Best Buy\" by a leading consumer publication and covered by Hitachi's Lifetime Lithium Ion tool warranty, the DS18DSAL is the first in Hitachi's Compact Professional series featuring an 18V Lithium Ion slide battery. It is impressively lightweight and compact at 7.7\" in length and weighing only 3.3lbs. The DS18DSAL is the ideal driver drill for anyone seeking professional power in the most compact, lightweight and ergonomic tool body on the market.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nPowered by a long-lasting 1.5Ah lithium ion slide battery, the Hitachi DS18DSAL 18-Volt Compact Pro Lithium Ion Drill/Driver packs a powerful punch. Efficient and easy to handle, this variable-speed tool provides professional power in the most compact, lightweight, and ergonomically designed body currently available. For added convenience, it comes with Hitachi's UB18DAL Lithium Ion Flashlight.\n\n\n\nCompact Design Minimizes User Fatigue Without Sacrificing Performance\nThe first in Hitachi's compact Pro Series of cordless tools, the DS18DSALmeasures only 7.7 inches in length and weighs 3.5 pounds, making it easy to hold and use all day without stress or strain. The compact design also provides the power and performance of a pro-grade 18-volt tool, making operation as efficient and dependable as it is comfortable.Variable Speed and 22-Stage Clutch for Versatility\nThis impressive driver drill features a variable speed trigger to set speed from zero to 350 RPM or zero to 1,500 RPM so you always match the right speed to the job. Additionally, the clutch has 22 driving stages and a special mode for drilling, allowing for both high torque applications and precision driving.\n\nFirst-in-its-Class Torque for Heavy-Duty Jobs\nWith unmatched torque in its class, the DS18DSAL powers through even the toughest jobs. 460 in./lbs. of torque gives this easy-to-handle model the necessary boost to take on hardwoods, masonry, and other heavy-duty drilling.\n\nBelt Hook, LED Light, and 1/2-Inch Ratcheting Chuck for User-Friendly Operation\nThe DS18DSAL comes with a convenient metal belt hook and an LED job light to illuminate your work surface. It also features a keyless 1/2-inch ratcheting metal chuck that accepts a wide variety of bits, giving you greater flexibility. Finally, externally accessible carbon brushes allow you to easily and economically replace the brushes when they are worn, thus ensuring longer tool life.\n\nLightweight 1.5 Ah Lithium Ion Slide Battery for Long-Lasting Power\nThis driver drill is powered by a long-lasting 1.5 Ah lithium ion slide battery. Designed without the vertical chamber of a post-style battery, this battery glides easily into place and allows the DS18DSAL to have an ergonomic handle. And because this Lithium Ion battery weighs roughly half as much as a NiCd or NiMH battery, you can work longer, with better accuracy. \n\nSteady Stream of Power for Precision and Consistency\nAs with all of Hitachi's lithium ion batteries, the tool receives a steady stream of power for the duration of every battery charge, from the moment the trigger is pulled until the charge cycle is exhausted. And with up to three times the number of charge cycles of traditional batteries, you won't have to waste money on costly replacements.\n\nIncluded Lithium Ion Flashlight for Added Flexibility\nAs a bonus, the DS18DSAL comes with Hitachi's UB18DAL Lithium Ion Flashlight. Adjustable to five lighting positions, this flashlight stands alone while you work and can be aimed where you need illumination. A shoulder strap makes for easy, comfortable carrying, and a low-battery indicator light helps ensure that you don't run out of power mid-use. And because the UB18DAL runs on the same 18-volt slide batteries as the driver drill, it shares the same lithium ion benefits of long battery life, lasting power per charge, and lightweight convenience.\n\nWarranty Information\nFor even more value and peace of mind, each of these tools is covered by Hitachi's 10-year lithium ion tool warranty and two-year lithium ion battery warranty.\n\nAbout Hitachi: Breathing Life into a New Era\nFounded in 1910 as an electrical repair shop, Hitachi offers a diverse line of professional grade power tools and accessories for woodworking, metalworking, drilling, and fastening, and concrete drilling and cutting, as well as a complete line of pneumatic nailers, staplers, compressors, and collated fasteners.
