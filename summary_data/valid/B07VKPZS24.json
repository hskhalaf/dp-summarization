It evenly and smoothly heats up and very nicely adheres the vinyl to your project then returns safely to the silicone base to cool down. Of course you could use a regular iron, but this small iron gets into little spaces much easier than a traditional, large iron. I like this mini press very much!",

It\u2019s perfect for small objects like cups, hats and or applying a minimal graphic on a side of a t-shirt. It was easy to use and easy to store as it doesn\u2019t take up much space. Definitely recommend this mini heat press to those crafters out there who like working on small objects.",

It doesn't perform as well as an iron, but it does the job for smaller projects. It is very easy to use and takes up very little space on my sewing table. Overall very pleased with this purchase!",

Great for small projects such as hats, scarves, masks etc as well as projects on sleeves and other hard to maneuver areas! Heats up quickly, has three settings and has its own base to place the hot press back in, no tipping up and worrying someone might touch the iron part while still hot.",
