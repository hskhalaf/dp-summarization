When taking video, it doesn't automatically focus or refocus so you have to stop the video, refocus, and restart the video. Unless there is a trick I couldn't figure out. This was especially annoying for me as I was on safari taping the animals, who move, and every time they moved, the video went blurry and I had to stop and restart.",

BONUS: you can use your smartphone to connect to the camera (via blutooth) and use it as a remote to control taking pictures through the camera; took selfies to a whole new level.

The camera worked fine at home in the pool and for the first three days of the vacation. The first time I tried to use it snorkeling, the camera won't even turn on. It's completely dead. I'm sending it in for warranty repair, but failure after 3 months of light use, at the very moment I planned to use it for the only purpose I bought it is just inexcusable.",

    "title": "Olympus TG-3 Waterproof 16 MP Digital Camera (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:BaseHigh Speed Ultra Bright f2.0 lens\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nTOUGH GETS CONNECTED\nHave you ever stopped and wished you had a WiFi-enabled camera that could handle extreme outdoor conditions and deliver spectacular high-resolution photos and smooth HD videos of your epic outdoor adventures, even in low light? If so, meet the Olympus Tough TG-3. It\u2019s incredibly rugged, yet boasts a super-bright f2.0 4x zoom lens, sophisticated features like next-generation GPS, Interval Shooting and time-lapse movie options, four variable macro shooting modes, and system accessories that further expand its capabilities. This is the camera you take to places you never dared take a camera before.\n\nSo Rugged We Call It \u201cLifeproof\u201d\nExtreme pursuits in extreme conditions require an extremely rugged camera. The TG-3 stands up to the four major challenges facing any adrenaline-crazed adventure shooter: wet \u2013 waterproof to 50 feet (15m); cold \u2013 freezeproof to 14\u00b0F (-10\u00b0C); clumsy \u2013 shockproof to 7 feet (2.1m); and forgetful \u2013 crushproof to 220 pounds of pressure (100kgf). So whether you dunk it, leave it outside, drop it or sit on it, the TG-3 will handle the abuse and keep right on capturing your epic adventures.\n\n\n\nHigh-speed, Bright f2.0 Optics for Superb Low-light Shooting\nShooting fast action in less-than-ideal lighting is a recipe for disappointment with most outdoor cameras \u2013 but not the TG-3. Its ultra-bright high-speed f2.0 lens enables the camera to dial up the shutter speed to nail blur-free shots when a school of exotic fish is passing by or your buddy is flashing through the shadows on his bike. You can also reduce the ISO to shoot crisp, detailed images with minimal noise in low light, or use the Aperture priority mode to expand the focus range of the background.\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Connectivity for Your \u201cSmart\u201d Lifestyle\nThe TG-3 is designed to meld seamlessly with your ever-more-interconnected digital world. WiFi is built right in, so you can share files easily with the Olympus Image Share app; even cooler, you can operate the zoom, adjust ISO and white balance, select the shooting and drive modes, activate the self-timer, and even select the autofocus point and trip the shutter, all from your smart device \u2013 great for wildlife photography and including yourself in group shots. The TG-3 also has a built-in electronic compass and next-generation GPS that accurately locates your position in 10 seconds and geotags photos (for mapping out your journeys).\n\n(1) Location/landmarks\n\n(2) Electronic compass\n\n(3) Air pressure/altitude\n\n(1) Location/landmarks\n\n(2) Latitude/longitude\n\n(3) Air pressure/Water pressure\n\n(4) Altitude/water depth\n\n(5) Date and time\n\n(6) Location/landmarks\n\n\n\nGet Creative with Interval Shooting and Time-lapse Movies\nWith the TG-3\u2019s Interval Shooting function, you can set when you want the camera to start shooting (from 1 second to 24 hours), then select intervals from as long as 24 hours to as short as 1 second and snap up to 99 frames. These images can then be compiled automatically into a time-lapse movie lasting up to 10 seconds (720p at 10 fps).\n\nGet Up Close \u2013 Really Close!\nMountain panoramas are great, but sometimes you want to zero in on subtler forms of natural beauty (like snowflakes or dew). The TG-3 offers four different modes for macro shooting, including Microscope, Microscope Control (a maximum magnification of 44.5x is possible from a distance of 1cm), Focus Bracketing and Focus Stacking (in which multiple images, from foreground to background, are taken and the areas in focus are automatically merged into one perfect shot).\n\nExpand Your Rugged System with Useful Accessories\nAnother thing that sets the TG-3 apart from other rugged cameras is its family of accessories (sold separately). The waterproof fisheye converter (FCON-T01) gives you the ability to capture gorgeous wide-angle shots; thanks to the bright f2.0 lens, even dark underwater scenes pop. The waterproof tele converter (TCON-T01) increases the camera\u2019s zoom capability from 4x to nearly 7x, and allows you to highlight the subject by blurring the background. And the new LED ring guide (LG-1) channels the camera\u2019s LED illuminator for enhanced, even lighting during macro photography.\n\nIn-camera Special Effects \u2013 and Now Photo Story\nFor those who like to spice up their photography, the TG-3 includes 11 built-in Art Filters that enable you to apply effects like Pin Hole, Grainy Film and Fisheye right in the camera \u2013 no need to transfer images to a computer for manipulation. The TG-3 is also the first rugged camera that includes Olympus\u2019s much-loved Photo Story feature, which provides templates you can use to combine different perspectives on the same scene into one image.",
