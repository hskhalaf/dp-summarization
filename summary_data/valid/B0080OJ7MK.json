They appeal to a huge age range and the finished builds are really cool, especially once you gain some understanding of how they connect. I would highly recommend this really unique toy.",

Literally hours of fun. I love that the company now does sets based on designs, but this simple box of mixed colors is perfect for the kid who's eager to dive right in. We bought more for this year, for the cousins, too, and even the big size for the toddler in the family. A winner!",

They are really tiny, so be very cautious where you play with them if you have younger kids. The package they come in is not great for permanent storage, we just used a tupperware container. They fit together easier than legos and have a nice range of colors. We played with them for at least an hour, great for adults and kids.
