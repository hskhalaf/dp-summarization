      "text": "My husband bought this as an early Christmas gift for me and I could not be more pleased. It came packaged in two boxes, surrounded by thick styrofoam on all sides. Well protected! I was pleasantly surprised with the actual size. It is quite substantial. The background is gray, which suits me just fine and goes well with my decor. The flowers are detailed and beautiful. The bottom isn't completely level as it wobbles a tiny bit, but nothing worth worrying about. It is totally worth the price, which by the way happens to be at least $20 less than I've seen for this exact same product on other sights. Overall, I highly recommend!",

The two I received are evenly shaped and flat bottomed. But definitely gray.",

      "text": "I was absolutely shocked at the poor quality of this piece. For starters, the color is off (it's almost grey instead of white), however, the blue flowers look fine. The vase is not even a proper cylinder, as if squashed before being fired in the kiln (this is the most serious flaw). There was also a pile of rock hard crud in the bottom that I had to scrape out, perhaps swept up from the factory floor and dumped into the vase. The takeaway from all the above: there is absolutely NO quality control, which would have caught these issues. This is a fairly expensive item, and given what showed up at the house, should be priced about 75% lower.",
