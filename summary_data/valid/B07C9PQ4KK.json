      "verdict": "The Nike Air Max Infuriate 2 Mid is a versatile shoe designed for both light and heavy players. Its Air Max unit has given wearers superb comfort especially upon landing. The textile upper reportedly retains its shape even after so many uses on and off court. Spending $85 is going to be justifiable if you get a sturdy mid-top basketball like the Air Max Infuriate 2 Mid.",

        "A lot of buyers are happy that the Nike Air Max Infuriate 2 Mid is only $85",
        "Several users observe that the colorways of these Nike basketball shoes are simple and attractive",
        "A couple of users mention that the mesh upper does not stretch at all and remains without serious blemish even after months of use",
        "The raised midsole and heel counter prevent the foot from slipping out of the footbed"

      "cons": [
        "A handful of owners complain that the shoelaces are too short",
        "A few wearers claim the Nike Air Max Infuriate 2 Mid runs long and narrow",
