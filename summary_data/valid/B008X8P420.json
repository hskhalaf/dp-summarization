Not a deal breaker, it just would have been a lot more user friendly if it was interchangeable with standard disposable water bottles.

Also multifunctional given it can easily be a water bottle for yourself. In the past for hikes I would carry some type of bowl for my dog, but with the Gulpy that isn't an issue. Only suggestion I have is to make the latch a little softer and possibly wider. Carrying the thing by the latch seems to be hard on certain fingers due to size, and the latch can be wearisome given the hard plastic over time. I just wrapped some soft padding on mines, which eliminated this issue.",

I am obsessive about him drinking from his Gulpy because I have read some horror stories about dogs who have become quite ill from drinking \u201cstale\u201d e.g. water that has sat around in a bowl without being changed like at a dog park. Champ recognizes his water dispenser and when he sees me fill it, his tail begins to wag. I think he is genetically linked to one of Pavlov\u2019s dogs.",

First off, it's hard to stand the bottle upright because the outer dispenser makes it lopsided. Maybe if the bottle part was shaped with an indent that would make the bottom of the bottle flush with the green dispenser part, that might make it work better. Also, if you pour out too much water into the dispenser, there's no way to get it back into the bottle so that's a little bit frustrating. Overall, I really like the bottle though and recommend it to any dog owner.",

      "text": "This was exactly what I needed for my long walks in this summer heat. I have a husky and she always got so thirsty on our walks and it was annoying for me to have to carry a bag with a water bottle AND a bowl for her, This bottle is really convenient since is has its own clip that I can just hook on my belt. My only complaint is that the hing where the \"bowl\" connects to the bottle is a little loose so it flops around. But that's something I can deal with. Over all a good product for the price.",

One draw back is that the clip that holds on to your belt allows the bowl and bottle to disconnect...it has to be hand held or put in your back pack....if the bowl portion could just click to attach to the bottle....it would be then perfect...",

The seal is solid and we have not had any leaking. It is easy to fill at water fountains if needed. For the record, I have a large golden retriever.",
