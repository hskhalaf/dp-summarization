So embarrassing... this literally stopped it in its tracks... once I saw/felt the sore start I used a clean needle to puncture the part with fluid. Immediately applied rubbing alcohol to start the drying ASAP, after that I used this product. Like 10 times a day... it never got worse, swollen, bloody, crusty... it dried out and scabbed over within 2-3 days.. I also took 4,000 mg l-lysine (top quality) each day.. I hope this helps someone else!!",
