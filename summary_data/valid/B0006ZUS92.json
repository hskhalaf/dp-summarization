It's the exact thing they use in sunscreens and warn everyone about because it causes cancer. I'm not sure why they even sell this product with the risks that could be involved.",

There is no reason or evidence that I can find that ingesting this form of vitamin a would pose that risk. However it is fat soluble and you can experience hypervitaminosis. Which would damage your liver. For this reason 10,000iu every other or third day seems like a more reasonable dosing schedule that daily.",

If you are taking a multivitamin make sure you check to see how much vitamin A is in it. 10,000 alone is already more then you should be taking unless your doctor recommends for a specific issue. Vitamin A is fat soluble so you can overdose on it (unlike vitamin C). Do your homework.",
