I was vitamin D deficient through my second pregnancy as well and was determined not to repeat my PPD. I started taking this asap after birth combined with a 5000 I.U. Vitamin D Supplement and at 6 week check-up my levels were back in normal range which is hard to do so quickly. Note you have to take two pills a day. They are medium sized, so if you have trouble with pills keep that in mind.",

You can get similar formulas at equivalent quality for half the price. The pills were easy to swallow and no after taste (a mark of quality!) If money is of no consequence then this is for you! On behalf of the claims to balance mood - tis very true! I recommend this to postpartum mom struggling with depression as step one. Omega 3 has helps me level off emotionally.",

I breastfed my first one for a long time and still breast feeding my second one. I think it's essential to take them on time so my kids get EHA and DHA through my milk (I know breastmilk already has them, but they play such a key role in brain development, I just loving taking extra). They are easy to swallow, has a very light fruity smell. very great product!",
