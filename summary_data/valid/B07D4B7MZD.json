This is the first year I can recall (and I may be wrong) where it doesn't come with a minifig/Friend. Sure she has tons of minifigs that she can use with these things, but opening the minifig on day 1 and then using it with the rest of the set is one of her favorite parts. I suspect she's going to be a little disappointed. I am disappointed with LEGO's decision to not include a figurine in this set.",

It\u2019s my fault for not looking more closely at what was included, but unlike previous years this set does not include any of the friends and you don\u2019t put together things to make a bigger scene. Each one is a Christmas tree decoration. It has nothing at all to do with LEGO Friends, except the picture on the box. I had looked carefully at many sets, but this one went on sale and I thought I had already looked at it. My mistake. But I definitely don\u2019t recommend it, if you are looking for something related to LEGO Friends. Side note, I really wish amazon wouldn\u2019t lump all the reviews together.",

I really like this year's kit because it incorporates more pieces and therefore more builds (500 pieces almost twice the previous years) and allows girls to use their builds as ornaments. Sure getting mini figs and setting a scene is fun but in years past it was not very cost effective for the amount of pieces included. It was cheaper to buy my grand daughter a regular Friends set the last several years. Thank you Lego for trying something different.",
