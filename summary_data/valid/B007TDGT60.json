      "text": "If assembled properly, which isn't really difficult, the product is nice and solid. My family is really enjoying it. I took off 1 star because of the legs. The solid parts of this table are all pressed board. They will not hold a screw for very long. The manufacturer therefore inserted a threaded metal sleeve into the legs. However, if you play the game vigorously - ahem - then the metal sleeve itself will dislodge. I removed all the sleeves - they were basically falling out on their own - and reset them with hot glue. So far - so good... If that fails to solve to the problem I'll probably just replace them with regular pieces of real wood.",

It did require total assembly, but the instructions were easy to follow and all the pieces fit where they were supposed to! After it was set up, all five of my boys immediately wanted to play with it. It's held up extremely well and is often brought downstairs when we have company over. The kids love it. It's not flimsy at all, and it's a great size. I bought an extra set of soccer balls just to have on hand for when one of the two it comes with is lost. Overall, the kids love it and I enjoy playing it with them!",
