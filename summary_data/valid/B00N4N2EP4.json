It's too small to cook for a family of four or dinner party but it is great for the money. Long term use confirms that the heated handle problem is real; I'm a dedicated cooking enthusiast and I've burnt myself on that handle a few times, once badly. Under long term everyday use the center of the pan warped convex, this is just not created for every day use. I will buy this again but I won't make the mistake of using it for anything but Japanese Omelettes.",

But it works really well for what it is made for, and it's beautiful too.

I got the smaller size not the really big one, I think unless your like supper hungry or feeding lots of people then just get the smaller one.

It's been great to experiment with different omelette fillings. I purchased the smaller size and it is perfect for the two of us. Frankly, even if I had kids I would still go with the smaller pan (just make two batches duh..). I've also used it to make sweet omelettes that I use with homemade sushi. It's says dishwasher safe but I would never put any non-stick pan in my dishwasher and only hand wash. Have fun!",

With 3 eggs plus multiple extra ingredients, I have to be a bit more careful. I have only been using this pan for only six weeks so I cannot comment on performance in the long term.",
