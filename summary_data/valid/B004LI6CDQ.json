I have tried numerous expensive natural, pure and hypoallergenic mascaras, only to find that within an hour my eyes are red, burning, itching, actually painful. I've spent hours researching MSDS sheets and eliminating mascaras. I wouldn't care if this mascara clumps, runs or smudges, as long as my eyes don't hurt. Well, this mascara causes no problems for me at all. Bravo!",

Also there is little to no clumping and is for a waterproof mascara fairly easy to remove with make up remover towelettes. It is also gentle on my skin and lashes. I've had problems in the past with mascara irritating the skin around my eyes, causing puffiness. Highly recommend.",
