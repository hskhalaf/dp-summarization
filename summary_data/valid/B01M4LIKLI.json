However, the Caps Lock and Num Lock indicators stop working randomly and intermittently. I looked online and this appears to be a common issue across Corsair's entire keyboard line, which is disappointing. It's annoying to say the least when you're typing a password and you're not sure if caps lock is on or off. Unplugging and plugging it back in will fix it temporarily but it will eventually happen again, which is really just unacceptable for such an expensive keyboard.",

The RGB is very nice, you can setup the lights to scroll, to pulse, you can set how fast they scroll, you can set the colors in 3 different areas individually ( left, middle, and right) you can make it all one color, like all Red or all blue... The keys are not mechanical so don't expect the sharp click of a mechanical keyboard but they don't feel cheap either, I like it better this way because a mechanical keyboard is very noisy and I find that anoying. Great value for your money it also comes with a detachable arm rest.",

My one problem is that when I've had an unexpected shutdown and the computer reboots with that \"start normal or start in safemode\" screen, the keyboard doesn't work. I get to wait the full thirty seconds for it to auto-reboot normally instead of being able to kit the enter key. Annoying, but not a huge problem.",

It's intuitive to use; just hit the \"MR\" button on the upper right, select the G-number you want that key to memorize, then enter your keystroke combo you want assigned to that G-number. Hit the \"MR\" button again, and the macro has it remembered. 2) There's some travel to the keys, so you know if you're clicking. 3) Wristpad is a neat add-on. The only dislike I have is that the RGB lighting isn't too bright. But it's easy to customize the 3 zoned colors. Overall, not a bad keyboard for its price.",

There are 3 different sections of lighting. If you hit and hold the FN key and press F1 key you can cycle through all the color choices for the left 1/3 of the keyboard. FN + F2 dopes the same for middle of keyboard. FN + F3 does the same for numeric keyboard.",

The key backlights will leave something to be desired if you're looking for the light show associated with more spendy Corsairs (or some similarly priced other brands) as these backlights aren't as customizable, but I didn't get it for the basement \"wow\" factor, so for the price, this suits me fine.",

I have not installed the control software or used the macro buttons but I can see where they would be useful, especially if you are into MOBAs or MMOs. I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality keyboard that doesn't want to shell out for a mechanical model.",

While using it, the keys will randomly stop working, freezing me in place during game play. Last night it just stopped working at all, I had to reboot the computer. Don't waste your money or time.",

I've changed USB ports, made sure everything is up-to-date, etc. It will stay connected for a short while, then losses connection and is back to default.",
