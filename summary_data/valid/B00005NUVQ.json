I'm not sure if it's worth the purchase, but I'll give it another try.",

Unexpected downside: the pasta sticks to the drying rods if left for a while. After a couple hours when the pasta if fully dry it comes off the rods readily. However, if you want to use the pasta shortly after you make it, but don't get to it right away then some of it will be sticking resulting in breaking or tearing of the pasta. Don't recall any instructions. If there were any included maybe they said to oil the rods. Will try that next time.",

It holds a lot of pasta. I made a four cup recipe and it held the whole thing. Cleans up with a wipe to each spindle. It's also easy to store. Great product.",

I highly recommend this product it's compact, easy to store and holds alot too. The wand makes it so easy to slid your fresh noodles on the rack.

The tool helps, though. (2) The bottom half of the pegs are really low, so the pasta inevitably drags on the counter. It's well made and does its job, other than those minor annoyances.

I found this one on Amazon for a very reasonable price. The legs fold up for storage and the arms swing out and in for drying and storage. Very easy tool to have to make the pasta making experience fun.",
