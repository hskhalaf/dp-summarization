The the box was very short so the shoe was squeezing my foot up, pressing up to the toe. If you have a normally narrow (or regular) foot, i still would probably go up 1/2 a size. I regularly wear a 10.5 and with an 11, my foot had about a finger-width of space before the tip.",

I was skeptical about buying this online where I wouldn't have an opportunity to try them on first but, after watching as many reviews as I could find on YouTube (and there aren't many) I decided to go with the size 11. Best choice I could've made. Fits exactly as I like my shoes to fit -with a little room to the front so I could wear an extra pair of socks or thicker socks if necessary. Great price. great deal. Love these shoes",
