      "text": "I\u2019m honestly disappointed at the quality of the blocks as well as the reconstruction support. Unlike the traditional jenga blocks base of hard wood that can withstand the abuse of the game, the blocks in this set are very soft wood. Some of them aren\u2019t even well finished (see pic)! Right away, some of the blocks are already warped and don\u2019t sit flat. The cardboard they give you to help rebuild the tower is extremely flimsy - it\u2019s just a single thin layer of card stock. I expected more for a classic game that families should be able enjoy for years, not months (based on how quickly and likely they\u2019re to be warped, dinged and dented out of shape).",

I paid higher price for this item specifically because they are showing the round storage container. I work with kids and I have one of these round Jenga boxes at work. They are great. I've had mine for 5 years and it still looks like new. The blocks that used to come in the round container were also higher quality. However, this one comes in a cheap very thin box and it's not going to work as a storage. I'm really upset that they are misrepresenting what they are selling.",
