While the flavor was the same great taste, Amazon had punctured a small hole in the bag in order to make the bag fit in the box and the chips were stale when they arrived. This has happened twice now, the other time with another brand. I don't advise ordering chips through Amazon. However, these chips are typically very good with that extra crunch that Kettle Cooked chips often provide. I would just stick to purchasing these at your local supermarket.",

Normal flamin hots have almost a sweetness to them, that is completely absent here.

If you love those you might like these as well but they don't taste like normal Lays brand.",
