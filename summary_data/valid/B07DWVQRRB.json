Security was a breeze and although this shoe has little arch support, they were actually comfortable. While at the airport, I did wear little socks with them. Although they looked dorky with socks, I didn't want bare feet at the TSA check point or on the plane. But while in the cities, I wore these with no socks and they were breathable and comfortable. I walked a lot throughout the European cities comfortably. I do wish darker colors were available also.",
