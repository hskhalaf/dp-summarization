The bag has a board at the bottom to keep the bag upright and the leather is a bit stiff but I think helps the bag maintain its shape. The bag that was included is cute with lots of space to hold misc items however, it is very large and may take up too much space in the tote...depending on what else you have in the bag. Others have mention poor craftsmanship but as I said this is my first impression so I can't comment on that. For the price it's decent.",

Has a rustic, sturdy look to it, the insert is great and it is still in the same great shape it was when I got it. Definitely real leather, not sure why other reviewer insists it's fake.
