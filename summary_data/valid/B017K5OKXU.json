      "text": "The Campingaz party grill 600 had some damage when it was delivered so I had some money returned so a very good service, very good quality product the catches that hold the lid on are a bit flimsy but everything else seems solid to be fair, great design and a pleasure to cook with the hot plate is very good quality and easy to clean, I use a 5kg propane tank that works great heats up within a few minutes the temperature gauge works well, hard to fault very happy 9/10",

Most satisfactory buy we made before taking trips to Somerset and Sussex... Used just about every day... hardly used our internal campervan kitchen because it's so easy to set up and use. Very pleased we bought it, and using again with grandkids too very soon :-)",
