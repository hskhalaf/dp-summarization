I don't know how much action it can stand since its only being in use since Christmas, but so far, so good. Has very good ventilation and is really easy to assemble.",

It can be their fort, a secret hideaway, a clubhouse, or even a place to take a quick nap. The tent arrived very quickly after I placed my order. It took less than 10 minutes to assemble and it is very well made and sturdy enough to endure the roughhousing of three young boys. I love the size of it. As you can, my 4-year-old, 6-year-old, and 11-year-old grandsons fit in it comfortably. Money well-spent!",

They have sent me pictures of them reading their books inside the tent, with pillows taking naps inside the tent... It\u2019s their own little space and they love it! It is on the larger side, so you have to have enough space to put it up. Thankfully their bedroom is actually the master, so they had the space for it. And it\u2019s a beautiful tent!
