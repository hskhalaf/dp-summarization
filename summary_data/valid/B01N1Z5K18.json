The quality of the shovel is outstanding, good stainless steel, the depth gauge is etched in to the steel, not stamped. No directions for assembly came with it. Yea, it seems obvious at times, but they don't tell ya some of the accessories need to be removed for all the sections to be assembled. Over all it is good quality, including the accessories and the knurl is good for bare hands.",

      "text": "This is an awesome shovel. It's not that big but it is sturdy. The shovel head attachment is threaded opposite than the other segments so you have to keep that in mind when you're digging but it works great. I wouldn't use the axe head for larger tree limbs or hardwood but it is great for smaller tees and limbs. Probably one of the most cost effective purchases you can make for a survival kit and it all folds up into a ridiculously small package you can wear over the shoulder, attached to your belt or stored in your dashboard. It also came with a para cord bracelet which I wasn't expecting.",

I did some trail work one day but it just isn't big enough for regular trail work. Would love a version of it that was 30% bigger all the way around.",

The handle pieces are aluminum and have a nice grip and weight to them. The shovel is very solid once put together. All the stuff in the handle pieces is pretty decent except the compass, it only kinda works. Totally worth it for a small shovel you can pack anywhere.",
