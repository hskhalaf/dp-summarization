Fast preheat, easy-to-use manual (not digital) controls, decent toast, etc.. At 1800 watts, this is the most powerful one we've owned and the extra 300 watts over our last model is quite noticeable and makes the oven suitable for more baking which requires better heat control. When this one finally weakens (they seem to lose power versus break down) I will probably buy another one. The last one went through 6 very busy years of toasting, baking, broiling and reheating and finally got to the point where it needed replacement.",
