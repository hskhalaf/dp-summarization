Medium/Large size with solid build construction. It's very quiet and has no problem heating food up nice and evenly. I like the blue LED display and the gray interior. It has a nice sturdy door handle as opposed to the push button types. This microwave has a unique sensor heat technology that can detect when your food is steaming. This makes it a snap to reheat food without trying to guess how long you should cook it for.",
