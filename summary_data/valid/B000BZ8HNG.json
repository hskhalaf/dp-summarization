This was the best buy. Happy to get it so quickly. Since the P number is so high, I was delighted to mix my previous purchases of Miracle Gro soluble fertilizers with a lower P value with it to bring up their nourishing value to my plants.

      "text": "I simply toss this material down at the base of a camelia then spray water so it dissolves and sinks in. The sprinklers then over time work it down further. Within days, at most a week, there is fresh growth, fresh light, bright green leaves. It is obviously attributable to the product. One puts it down after the flowering of the winter. We had renovations and the sprinkler system was hit and miss as electricity was cut on and off. The camelias suffered. But this stuff has brought them back. A couple of bushes will need to have branches cut off, but I am happy to see the very old and healthy bushes coming back to life.",

Still, I was pressed when I went to Walmart and discovered that you can get almost three times the amount (certainly a bigger box) AT THE SAME PRICE!!! If you can, just go to Walmart to get the same product, or if you have a gift card and Amazon Prime, get it here, I guess lol.",
