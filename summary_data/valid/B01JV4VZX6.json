      "text": "I researched a ton before buying this. It's by far the cheapest light carbon paddle available. Be aware of which color you choose because they are made of different material combinations and that affects the weight. I was actually disappointed when I received it at home because it didn't feel much lighter than the aluminum paddle that came with my isup. However, I took it to the lake this weekend and it was so light while I was out on the water that it felt like it wanted to get blown away by the wind! So I'm a happy camper (or paddler).",

I got my paddle in about 5 days but I still had 10 days of vacay to go. Not as light as a carbon fiber paddle but less weight than aluminum. Feels sturdy and well built. Perfect for roadtrips.",

Highly recommend. I am a real person. This was a real purchase with no promotion and/or did not receive anything for this review.",
