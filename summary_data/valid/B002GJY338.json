One side of the paddle has more cushion for defense (green) and backspin and the black side is harder which allows me to go on the attack with greater speed. Ill take my paddle over any of the top 10 paddles on the internet. Lastly the white case it comes in is great to protect the paddle, its not bulky but its strong",

My first purchased paddle was the Killerspin Jet 200 and enjoyed it for the past few months. However, just last week, after hitting the paddle on myself after a bad shot, the area where the handle meets the rubbers broke and is now requiring that I reach out to see if this is common or not? I'm hoping that this is a bad batch vs. the quality of the wood on these paddles. Your mileage may vary, but I figure it's worth putting out there to see if this is common?",

It's a good value. The rubber is tacky enough to put pretty good spin on the ball and the power is decent. But if you are a tournament player, obviously you would want something much more advanced.
