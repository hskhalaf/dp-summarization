He used it for \"A\" Days and a different backpack for \"B\" Days so actually he used it every other day. It began to rip at the seams within the first 4-5 months! I didn't want to buy another so far into the year, so I attempted to sew the areas. Those areas held up afterwards, but holes continued to show up every few weeks! We finally gave up and bought another pack about 6-7 months into the school year.",

I don't own a car, so all of my grocery purchases and library trips are done by carrying everything in my backpack and then walking/taking public transportation. After reading some of the other reviews for this particular backpack, I was worried that the straps would quickly snap or that it wouldn't hold up well. I've had it for about six months now, and I needn't have worried about anything. It has held up wonderfully well, despite being shoved full of books almost constantly. It's comfortable to wear, with plenty of pockets of all sizes for organization.",

The only thing I dislike: On the end of the straps that come down from the bottom of the bag, there are these circular plastic bits. Whenever I'm sitting on a bench or a bus seat, they like to get caught between slats or whatever. It's a minor inconvenience, but otherwise this is a great backpack.",

Very well made and durable. This backpack isn't going to fall apart in a couple months. I use it for work, where I have to carry alot of heavy books and supplies around with me, just like a high school or collage student. It holds alot of stuff and is still comfortable to wear on my back.",

If you are thinking of buying this bag for school or around the town usage, DO IT!!! It's affordable and a good value for what you get. If, however, you are buying this product for hiking/survival/bugout, then let me go ahead and insist you look elsewhere. While this bag will get the job done, it just isn't made for that purpose. This bag wasn't meant for the wear and tear of the wilderness and doesn't come with the amenities that other bags more suited for the outdoors have.",

I've taken it as a personal item on several flights and never had any trouble. It has lots of compartments, which can help with organization. However, it is not very waterproof.",
