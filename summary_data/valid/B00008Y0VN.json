Mine has collimation problems (double vision) so now I have to decide whether I go through the hassle of an exchange or if I just keep them and try and fix it myself. It's best to teach the company a lesson and do an exchange instead of potentially breaking them yourself. Update: Just received my 2nd pair. Jupiter is double vision again. Even worse than the first pair. What a surprise.",

They have begun to dissolve to the point where the case and neck-straps have left impressions in the parts. You cannot pick up or use the binocs without your hands getting sticky goo on them. The eye-cusions and end-caps are fine. I'd consider buying another pair if Celestron could assure me the manufacturing defect has been corrected- but how can one know???",

Pros are also they are portable, easy to point and view, simple focusing, great moon viewing and daytime birdwatching farther away, price is good, quality is very good .

When you go to adjust the width of the eye pieces, you're torquing the scopes with your hands to rotate the width adjustment. You may be inadvertantly unscrewing one or both of the scopes from the housing ever-so-slightly in the process. I've had double vision on two separate occasions from this happening. It's a very easy fix - simply screw both scopes back on as tightly as you possibly can, and then the double vision goes away. Enjoy your stellar, crisp, single binocular vision!",

If you're just scanning the horizon looking for, say, a deer to kill, this works OK. If you actually want a nice view of an animal, sailboat, whatever, then this isn't for you. Given the poor construction or quality control, I would look for something that has a longer life span and better optics. You get what you pay for and sometimes you get less than you pay for. The case here.",

I love the other two pairs for higher magnification and more light but these are much, much lighter and are great for just about any type of viewing.",

It is also flimsy and might as well be thrown away.

      "text": "This is an excellent pair of binoculars from which I have found many uses. Not only is it great to look at the stars but also function as well as any other binoculars would. Some reviewer's stated that it was a heavy unit, but I found it to be a very light weight unit. Some reviewer's said it was hard to keep steady but I did not find that to be the case. It does have a smaller field of view than some of the others, but it brings that field of view in close so you can examine it well. Overall, I thought this was a great binoculars at a very reasonable price.",

Now that I have a working pair, they're fine, and I look forward to using them for bird-watching, viewing ships off the coast, and other such activities. However, the bad experiences with the first two pairs have left a nasty taste in my mouth, so to speak.",

    "title": "Celestron - SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars - Top Rated Astronomy Binoculars - Binoculars for Stargazing and Long Distance Viewing - Includes Tripod Adapter and Case",
    "description": "Style:SkyMaster 15x70 Binocular| Configuration:BinocularCelestron\u2019s SkyMaster series of large aperture binoculars are a phenomenal value for high performance binoculars ideal for astronomical viewing or for terrestrial (land) use - especially over long distances. Each SkyMaster model features high quality BaK-4 prisms and multi-coated optics for enhanced contrast. Celestron has designed and engineered the larger SkyMaster models to meet the special demands of extended astronomical or terrestrial viewing sessions.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nBinoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and an even wider range of prices. It's easy to spend less than $100 or more than $500 for what may appear to be, at least outwardly, comparable models. While they may look the same, they are probably quite different on the inside. \n\n Recently, the binocular market has seen a flood of giant binoculars at prices that were unheard of just a few years ago. In general, giant binoculars are defined as those that magnify the view 10 times or more and have 70-mm or larger front (objective) lenses. It used to be that the least expensive giant binoculars cost in excess of $150, even $200. All that changed not long ago, when the bottom fell out of the price cellar. Now, several companies import giant binoculars that sell for half that, or less. \n\n Celestron's 15x70 SkyMaster binoculars are one of the leaders in the low-price giant binocular arena. They certainly sound good on paper. The SkyMasters include multicoated optics and BaK-4 internal prisms, two features that promise brighter, better images, and key points to look for when judging a pair of binoculars. They also come with an adapter for attaching them to a photo tripod, which is a must to use them to their fullest, and a soft carrying case. But just because they are cheap doesn't always mean they are worth the price. Would it be better to save up for a more expensive pair? \n\n To find the answer, I had an opportunity recently to judge the SkyMasters against a pair of Fujinon 16x70 FMT-SX binoculars , one of the finest pairs of giant binoculars sold today. Like the SkyMasters, the Fujinons feature BaK-4 prisms, but also have fully multicoated optics. As a general rule, superior coatings mean superior image sharpness and contrast. But then, that should be expected, given that the Fujinons cost many times more than the Celestrons. \n\n While the Fujinons were clearly the better performer, the Celestron SkyMasters held up admirably. Image brightness, quality, and contrast were all remarkable considering their bargain price. Although images were a little soft across the outer 25% of the Celestron's field, the overall view was impressive nonetheless. \n\n Some inexpensive binoculars have very sloppy focusing, causing the eyepieces to tilt and shift. Not so with the SkyMasters. I found that their center-focusing mechanism worked smoothly, with no apparently backlash or wobble. Eye relief (the distance you hold your eyes away from the eyepieces to see the full field) is stated to be 18 mm, a good distance for higher power binoculars and an important consideration if you must wear glasses when viewing. The SkyMasters are also light enough to support by hand for short periods of time, although buyers would be well advised to mount them on a sturdy photo tripod. \n\n The bottom line is, if you are considering a pair of giant binoculars, whether for bird watching, stargazing, or another recreational use, and have a limited budget, Celestron's giant 15x70 SkyMasters represent an excellent value. --Phil Harrington, author of Star Ware and Star Watch \n\n Pros:\n\n *  Exceptional value for the price \n *  Light enough to support by hand \n *  BaK-4 prisms \n *  Multicoated optics \n\nCons: *  Outer 25% of the field is soft and a little blurry \n *  Requires a tripod to use for extended periods \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n SkyMaster 15x70 Binocular (item #71009) SkyMaster 15x70 - General Features \n\n * 15x magnification porro prism binocular\n * Large 70 mm objective lens offers maximum image brightness in low-light and long-range conditions\n * Ultra sharp focus across the field of view\n * Multi-Coated optics for sharp, clear views\n * Suitable for terrestrial or astronomical viewing\n * Protective rubber covering for ultra-firm grip\n * Large center focus knob for easy focusing\n * Tripod adapter included\n * Long eye relief ideal for eyeglass wearers\n * Carrying case included for travel and safe storage\n * No Fault Warranty provides best protection and product support on the market\n\nDetails\nCelestron's SkyMaster Series of large aperture binoculars are a phenomenal value for high performance binoculars ideal for astronomical viewing or for terrestrial (land) use - especially over long distances.
