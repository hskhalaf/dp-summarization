My son has sensory issues and had extremely tough time with these FAKE boots. PS - These are made in china. emu's - like Uggs - are made in Australia. Very unhappy customer and sending these back.",

The soles never came apart from the actual boot. I would LOVE to buy these again if they ever go on sale. I bought three different styles for $75, back in 2010! I guess never again, huh?",

Otherwise I think that the products is wonderful. Cute and funny. Buy the size as you buy normal winter (larger) shoes and you will be happy.",
