      "text": "I used this 4 times at the end of summer and loved it. Will be retired in 4 months so plan to use it a ton next summer. Pretty easy to set up and take down. The only issue is trying to get it completely dry before storing. I keep trying new things and the next one is I am going to strap it to my roof with hold downs like a hard shell kayak and see if the travel home will get into the crevices and dry it out that way. I can live with it because its way easier than trying to load a hardshell onto a car roof by yourself.",

I found it tracks easier and straighter than I had anticipated, and it is very comfortable as well, enough that I even took a small nap on my 2nd trip out to the bay. I recommend this, especially for smaller bodies of water and rivers. Customer service was very responsive by the way. I had read other reviews, and don't believe those to be true.",

One of the great pleasures of kayaking for me is the sense of being \"in\" or a part of the water, without getting wet. This is closer to a canoe experience.",

I LOVE this one, almost even more so than the regular kayaks because it lets you go faster and is easier to maneuver, yet it doesn't feel like an inflatable kayak at all. Every time I'm on it I would get approached by someone asking if it's inflatable or real because it looks that sturdy. Money well spent!",

Tracks relatively straight. Seems durable. Had it in the pacific northwest, pulled up on rocky beaches, no problem. Very satisfied. I wish it came with safety air valves on the tubes as it does on the floor. That would make it perfect. Works great with one adult and a child as well as two children. If you are calm, you can paddle it and stay dry which is good if you are using it as a dinghy.",

My very 1st day included two C-4's, & I stayed upright! I've only been swimming once, & that was due to poor technique on my part. My wife likes calmer waters, & has taken it out twice on more mellow sections; she gives it 5 stars also. It's only drawback for me is the less-than-ample legroom due to the airbag in front (I'm 6'-2\"). I'll probably buy an AE \"Attack\" soon to solve the legroom, & my wife will use the StraitEdge.",
