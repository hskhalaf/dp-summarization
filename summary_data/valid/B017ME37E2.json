The device for putting socks on is a much better design than others I\u2019ve seen. She was even able to put on a tight compression garment with it. This design of reacher/grabber is easier to use than the kind with converging 'blades' or 'fingers' and is capable of picking up something as small as a dropped pill from the floor. We already had a foot lifting strap, but that is also pretty much essential for therapy, bending the leg in bed, etc. The six-piece version of this kit has one, plus the items here.",

After weeks of using the device, I finally realized that the puller works better when the heel of the sock has been pulled onto the device as well. Best results were achieved by bunching the toe of your sock at the end of the scoop, then pulling. Further, the lengths of the clothing puller and the reacher make them impractical for use outside of the home. Telescoping handles would make each of these items packable for travel. Further, the reacher should be devised for collapsed hands-free carrying, perhaps hanging from a belt loop.",
