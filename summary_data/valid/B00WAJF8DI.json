I love the snug & durable feel, which keeps everything where it belongs in the middle of a bootcamp or obstacle course race. I wore these for a Spartan Race, and they were really fantastic. I even loved the long inseam, which I was afraid would be too long since my legs are pretty short (I'm 5'5\"). They come right to the top of my knees, which is perfect, and they did a great job keeping the mud & grit mostly out during the Spartan Race. These are my new go-to's, and I just ordered another pair.",

BUT, after that, when I went running, they were awesome!! They kept my stuff perfectly in place for my entire 5-mile run. So, yes get them, but beware the peeling ink.",

If they perform like all the other MudGear products I own, then I'm sure I will own these for a long time.

Kind of loose in the waist maybe I should have sizes down. I messaged their I)G account and they responded quickly and offered a discount on another product so service was quick and helpful. They should describe them as compression shorts cause they are not that!",

I plan to wear these running as well and expect them to perform even better than today!.
