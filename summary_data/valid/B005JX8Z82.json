It has a very clean face with numbers at 3, 6, 9 and the Swiss Army shield at 12. The luminescence of the face and hands are easy to read in low light. This is my current favorite watch. I get comments all the time on its clean looks and function. I must admit that for the price it was simply to good to pass up; especially given the quality of the time piece. I am very pleased.",

This seller offers a one year limited warranty but the manufacturer offers a five year warranty if the item is purchased from an authorized retailer. Fourteen months after my purchase, the watch stopped working. Because CoolChrono is not an authorized Victorinox retailer I could not get any warranty repair through Victorinox. CoolChrono refused to provide any warranty because I was (barely) past the one year purchase date. The watch is beautiful but be sure to read your warranty details and purchase the item from an authorized retailer.",

It is more like a dark gray face close-up, but it could pass as black anywhere else. The only issue I have about this is the price of the band. Last time I checked the band was ~$175+ for the stainless steel band. The band also scuffs easily (for me, scuffing occurs on the bottom of my wrist). It isn't noticeable, but when you are staring at this watch every time you wear it, you notice the blemishes that form.",

The only problem I have with mine is the strap clip makes a little sound when I poke the pin thru the hole, no big deal I barely notice it. I have small wrists and the diameter of the watch face is just perfect. It's a beautiful time piece and you can wear it for any occasion. You'll get noting but compliments and it comes in a cool package.",
