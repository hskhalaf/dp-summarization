I have been using this product for a few years, and have a 1TB hard drive attached to it, which stores photos, home videos, etc. The content can then be accessed from my PS3, iPhone, and I-Pad very easily, as long as I have an Internet Connection. I like that these personal items are stored on my own hard drive instead of on a server somewhere in the cloud. I use the products as intended by the company, although i have heard that this can be \"hacked\" and used to do much more. Unfortunately, I do not have the knowledge to do this.",

I'll certainly get myself another Pogoplug if it can maintain a somewhat similar price level and come with more memory and more powerful processor.",

I was concerned about the negitive reviews on this product and went for it anyway, and very happy with it.",

But of my three external USB hard drives, it could see only one of them (the other two were 2.5-inch drives, even though that fact shouldn't matter). And the virtual drive capability that lets you work with the Pogoplug drives via standard drive icons did not work under Snow Leopard when copying folders or multiple files (it was fine under Leopard). The tech support guy at Pogoplug says he can't duplicate the problems, so maybe I had a defective unit (since returned for a refund). So it may work for you; just be sure you can return it if it doesn't.",
