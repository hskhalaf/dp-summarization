SO MUCH better than my old hanging Everlast . . . BUY THIS!! You will NOT be disappointed!!!",

Random note: my cat hasn't been scratching it at all, so I guess that's a minor plus, for people who might be worried about that. :P",

Base is stable the bag moves but does not rock. 4. Has handles to practice clinches and knees. 5. Comes with a base that you dont need to fill. 6. Very easy assembly. 7. Base is small and not bulky. 8. Can be used for low kicks. Cons: 1. Bag is floating on the base instead of directly connected this makes it more stable but the bag is not perfectly upright.",

If you hit it hard at neck/face height, it will fall over, but that's what it's designed to do. We can jab/cross all the way around without knocking it over. If you're kicking waist height or lower, you'll have to kick it extremely hard to knock it over. The base weighs 110 lbs and seems very durable. This isn't a heavy bag. It's more of a striking bag. The foam doesn't weigh much at all. All the weight is in the heavy sand base. If you have the room to drag it around, that's a great workout too.",

Worked like a charm. This particular punching bag is heavy enough to get a hard hit on, but doesn't need to hang, so it can be moved anywhere we need it. It's particularly satisfying when you hit it hard enough to knock it over, then step on the end to get it to come back up and punch it again.",

Attaching the two pieces was very easy. Nice and tall and convenient that you don\u2019t have to adjust the height.
