      "text": "I have used this printer now for over four months. It has traveled to Africa and back and been carried around in various bags and backpacks and given one heck of a workout under adverse conditions. If one needs a printer that will actually work under field conditions, I can strongly recommend this printer. The battery life was a pleasant surprise too. It will allow printing of fairly extensive documents without running out. No, it is not as good a printer per se as the big multi-purpose printers in my office and Lab but it works out in the field when we need it.",

Battery and bluetooth options combine to allow for less plugs and cables to be carried. There's a concern with the construction if the baggage handlers at the airports throw it around - I purchased, and highly recommend, the travel case - it's a great protector for your investment. Speed, quality of print and ease of use are all great.Highly recommended for anyone that needs portability!",

The telling statistic is that if I had it to do over again, I would have done even more research and probably gotten a different printer. jw",
