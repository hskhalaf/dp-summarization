The entire process took less than 30 minutes (the installers gave me a few minutes to vacuum and mop the space before bringing in the new range). Everything necessary for the install was included in the base price. The range is clean, unobtrusive and intuitive (I haven't had to crack the manual open yet). Having the knobs and display panel on the front of the range is new for me and I love it. I keep burning everything because I am so used to having an old ill-performing range. Now, food actually cooks in the time stated in my recipes. Excellent value.",

It seems like the inside of the door isn\u2019t insulated well, which collects tons of heat and then vents near the handle. Terrible design and dangerous!",

Had used an induction stove in Europe and really liked it because 1) it heats the food/water/etc. extremely fast thereby reducing cooking and energy use time 2) saves money 3) the stove doesn't get hot so when something boils over it's easy to clean up 4) because the stove doesn't get as hot as normal stoves you don't have to worry as much about burning yourself on the element. The heat goes from the stove to the bottom of the pan/skillet. So very glad our old stove finally \"bit the dust\" and we could buy this stove. Did I mention it has 5 burners? Another plus.",
