Not kind on the cuticles. So I ordered this wondering if it'd be strong enough to work well. Like with pressure would the motor be strong enough to keep spinning. So far it's gone like a champ. It's so easy to get up right along the cuticle for a nice smooth start to the nail. It comes with a little pack of different drill file bits, including a small pointy one for filing under the nails which I love. Also, a baggie of sandpaper files.",

It won't pull off the table when you move. The file itself is weighted nicely that the low vibration it does put out is balanced nicely in your hand. There is so much less feed back from the file when in contact with the acrylic. The bits actually locked down into the efile creating a lot less danger than other files that you just shove it in there. The foot peddler is perfect and I feel a safety spec. This file is an investment in a higher quality nail game.",

This is very disappointing because this was a great drill before it stopped working on me and I was in the middle of doing my nails on top of that. Glad i didn't have any clients because this woulda been embarrassing. Can't return it and don't know who I can contact to get it replaced so I guess I just lost $60 bucks.",

There aren't any major concerns at this time and I will update if anything changes.

The only downside of this machine is that, while it has a foot pedal, it is poor quality and can only control on and off feature does not titrate speed like other e-files I have used.

Anyway, the sleek design and color caught my attention and with the good reviews I didn\u2019t hesitate to buy it. It had everything I was looking for: small, lightweight, not noisy, foot pedal, small hand tool, rest area for hand tool and bits, and the rpm settings were low/high enough. Someone else stated that it does not stall or stop and I can attest to that! I love it and am so happy I purchased it. You will not be disappointed! It\u2019s cute and it\u2019s gold!",

      "text": "The foot pedal is optional but still really cool! The machine is so quiet it's like filing butter! The only thing I don't like about it is I thought when I ordered it that it came with one of the round drill bits made for cuticles and it wouldn't be a problem to order some I just don't want them to not fit the drill. The file is great and comes with a 12 month warranty!!!!!",
