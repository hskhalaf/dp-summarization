Two rambunctious boys love setting these up as towers, buildings, etc and letting their oversized dragon and ogre toys knock them down.

The best part is they are SOFT, so no injuries to themselves or damage to the walls, furniture, etc. It arrived on time and nicely/appealingly packaged. I would recommend this product.",
