I might try putting extensions on the straps if I get a chance or hope to lose 20 or 30 lbs. From everything I read in the questions section, this should have fit me. If it fit, i would have given it a 5.",

The zipper is not particularly robust, and it is set up on the oposite (female) side. Not a big deal, really. Just don't abuse it. Very comfortable to wear! I work security in South Florida. The mesh construction is helpful in warm/hot weather. I can wear it in my vehicle and for 12 hour shifts no problem. I bought two patches for it on Amazon: The American Flag, and a Christian Bible verse. \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"",

Mine has no detectable odor, as I've seen mentioned in other reviews. Zipper is plastic but appears to be plenty sturdy. Velcro (suitable for flag or other patch) where you see the shotgun-shell holder in picture. This would be a nice gift for any outdoor-type person. I'm 5'11\", 175 lbs, and there's plenty of room for adjustment either way. Holster fits a Crosman P1322 .22-Caliber Air Pistol quite well, should fit anything that's not too bulky. Might not be roomy enough for a revolver. Good purchase!",

      "text": "Wore this for 8 hours straight at a tactical rifle defense course. Has great functionality and fits well. Also has lots of adjustments that can be made for your personal rig preference. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I wish there was more padding on the shooting shoulder. Standing for that long with my rifle harness hooked in to the shoulder clip caused some soreness. Otherwise like it.",

The holster is mean for longer barrel guns and work ok with a longer revolver. Loaded with pouches for ammo or extra clips. 12ga shells fit perfect with a large pouch just behind it. Cell phone and hand held radio located at easily to get to locations on the vest. So far the quality exceeds my expectations. And really moveable and easy to get to everything!",

I do wish the pistol holster was easily rotated at 45 degree... instead of the 90 degree.. it is hook and loop so i can turn it, but it does not securely attach with the top strap. Hope it helps.",
