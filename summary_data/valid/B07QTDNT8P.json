      "text": "Way too heavy. I researched and saw they were 13+ oz but lots of reviews said they were comfortable. Well they weren\u2019t at all. I didn\u2019t run in them. I wore them for a day around the house, they were so tight and heavy. I didn\u2019t feel the normal cloud like cushion on my feet as I walked. I will say I love Mizuno running shoes and have worn them for years. These just were no good, so had to return them. Went out and bought my normal waveriders and they are great. Not against Mizuno at all just these shoes, hence the three stars.",

Mizunos run small for some reason. Especially if your a runner, remember your feet swell from jogging. I also noticed that I cant wear these for to long since they are a sock like fit. My feet start hurting and throbbing in the upper ankle area after wearing a long while.",

Definitely feel more absorption in the heels. Do agree that getting an extra 1/2 upward would helps with comfort. Wish there were more color options.",
