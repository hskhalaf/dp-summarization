I have tried a lot of the expensive shampoos and nothing lasted -- not even the groomer shampoos. But this one does! Instead of having to endure her short-hair stinkiness after 2-3 days, this shampoo lasts two weeks! And it keeps her shedding and itching to an absolute minimum all while keeping her nice and shiny. This shampoo does everything!",

The bottle is much smaller than what it appears to be in the picture, so pay attention to the ounces when ordering.

We have been using this shampoo/ conditioner once a month plus feeding him eggs in the morning to help with his coat/skin and no more itching or flakes.

She is an active dog and likes to swim and play in the mud, resulting in frequent baths. Other shampoos used to leave her coat coarse, dry, dull, visibly flaky/itchy, and she constantly scratched. I tried using the best conditioners after the baths and even my expensive leave-in conditioners for my color-treated hair as well. I now only use this shampoo with a warm water rinse and nothing else. Have even had compliments on her shiny coat from other dog owners. Now I just want to be able to buy a much bigger bottle at a time.",

I was a bit hesitant of the Oxgord with the conflicting labeling/ingredients, but it leaves our dog clean, soft, and smelling good. Plus it's a shampoo and conditioner all in one, only 1 step vs 2. Excellent price as well. We like it and our dog doesn't mind it (no scratching or skin issues). It will be our go to shampoo/conditioner.",
