The sound is rich and even, with a very nice treble, adjustable bass, and good mids. My gripe, however, is the build quality of the cables and connections. The two satellite speakers are connected to the sub woofer by a plug that uses 4 prongs. These prongs are incredibly sensitive and susceptible to bend, which is exactly what happened to me. Since it was just over a year past the date I bought them, I'm pretty much out of luck now. This is a really big oversight and that plug is not very user-friendly.",

Only downfall, the bass volume control knob is on the back of the sub-woofer which is typically placed under ones desk or generally away from you main satellites. This makes adjusting it difficult, but that's kind of ok. You can simply set one level that most audio sources are fine at. I only have mine at about 50% and it's plenty of bass!",

It gives an instant boost to the base with good efficiency, if not a bit too boomy. The down-side is the striking look is now hidden underneath the desk, except for 2 sticks for the high's.",

I can say the sound delivered closely complicates its looks. it is absolutely bliss to listen to. What was unclear to me at first was that the switch on the sub doubled as a volume knob for the sub - took me a few months to figure this out. After learning that and doing some fine adjustments in the control panel optimizing bass output gain, I would highly recommend this set to anyone.",

Be it games, movies or music, everything sounds clear. There is no emphasis of any specific frequency range and there are little to no distortions of the various sounds even at high volumes. Do note though, that you need to set up the speakers properly on your table because the satellites are very directional due to the length of each speaker.",

    "title": "Harman Kardon SoundSticks III 2.1 Speaker System",
    "description": "A 6-inch, 20-watt downward-firing powered subwoofer. Eight 1-inch full-range transducers. Plug-and-play compatibility with virtually any multimedia device. And stunning industrial design that perfectly matches the clarity of the sound. The Harman Kardon SoundSticks III desktop sound system brings a new level of excitement to music, games and movies with a minimum of wiring and looks spectacular doing it.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nLISTEN TO A WORK OF ART.\nPraised for its stunning design, the harman kardon\u00ae SoundSticks II speakers and subwoofer system became a milestone in harman kardon history when it became part of the permanent collection at New York City's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Improving on its famous sibling's pop-culture appeal, the SoundSticks III system is all that and much more. As a three-piece, 2.1-channel multimedia sound system, SoundSticks III brings a new level of excitement to music, games and movies to your home - with its exceptional sound clarity, enhanced color scheme and bare minimum of wiring. Beyond its eye-catching appeal, SoundSticks III continues to be incredibly capable - with 40 watts of dazzling amplification, a down-firing powered subwoofer, eight full-range transducers and compatibility with all sorts of multimedia devices. As the sublime sequel to a prized performer, SoundSticks III is performance art at its finest. \n\n\nStunning Sound. Stunning Looks. THE HARMAN KARDON\u00ae SOUNDSTICKS III - AT A GLANCE.\nFour, 1\" full-range transducers per channel powered by a 10-watt amplifier for room-filling sound One, 6\" low-frequency transducer powered by a 20-watt amplifier for outstanding bass performance Compatible with all devices with a stereo mini-jack output Touch volume and mute controls Subwoofer volume control Angle-adjustable satellites Incredible industrial design \n\nThe full-range transducers fill the room with accurate, detailed sound quality Click here to View Larger HIGHLIGHTS.\nFILL THE ROOM WITH EIGHT FULL-RANGE TRANSDUCERS\nThe harman kardon brand has a rich history of engineering sound with highly regarded results. The SoundSticks III system is no different. Powered by a total of 20-watts, eight full-range transducers (four in each speaker) deftly fill your room with great sound, while increasing power handling and audio output. With less distortion and better sound quality, SoundSticks III speakers ensure that you'll hear music or video exactly the way the composer intended.\n\n\nA powerful 20-watt woofer delivers deep, accurate bass from whatever you happen to be listenting to Click here to View Larger DOWN-FIRING SUBWOOFER WITH VOLUME CONTROL\nFor a true audiophile listening experience, the SoundSticks III system also features a six-inch down-firing subwoofer with volume control that is powered by a 20-watt amplifier. By aiming sound down instead of at surrounding walls, your subwoofer makes your system less susceptible to adverse room variables - giving you a consistent performance. The subwoofer also has a flared port that reduces port noise during high-volume passages. This feature helps you tailor sound levels based on your room's specifications as well as your own listening preferences.\n\nCONNECT TO VIRTUALLY ANY MEDIA DEVICE\nOther than its stunning good looks, the SoundSticks III system offers excellent compatibility with other audio components. Thanks to its 3.5mm stereo audio connection, SoundSticks III speakers can be used with MP3 players, portable CD players, computers and almost anything with stereo line-level outputs. By offering you this user-friendly option, SoundSticks III becomes a nimble addition to your desktop, bookshelf or entertainment center, keeping your life simple with a maximum of connection options - and a bare minimum of wiring.\n\n\nTouch controls offer elegant ease of use TOUCH CONTROLS FOR VOLUME AND MUTE\nThe SoundSticks III system makes it easy for you to interact with your subwoofer and \"sticks,\" offering sensitive touch controls for raising, lowering or muting the system volume. By responding to the gentle touch of your fingertip, this intuitive design feature makes your SoundSticks III system easy to operate, and keeps this work of audio \"art\" in the best possible condition. \n\n\nThe Soundsticks III satellites angle to nearly any direction for the best possible sound CONTROL THE ANGLE OF YOUR SATELLITE SPEAKERS\nElegant and easy to use, SoundSticks III satellite speakers are designed to fit exactly where you want them - and maybe even in a few other places. As a modern design feature that's adaptable to your environment, the SoundSticks III system has two angle-adjustable satellite speakers that bend from low angle to high. Gently push or pull each satellite to the desired position - and you can optimize the angle at which sound enters, and fills, the room around you. \n\nATTRACTIVE, HIGH-QUALITY AUDIO CABLES\nSome manufacturers make audio cables a bare-minimum expense, which can compromise the integrity of an audio product and, potentially, the look of it. The SoundSticks III system does no such thing. SoundSticks III audio cables match the high-quality, transparent modern design of the speakers in terms of quality and visual appeal - and live just underneath the transparent speaker covers as if being showcased. Kept in place by black connection beads, these premium audio cables ensure that audio travels from source to speaker, without any sign of degradation or outside interference. Their flexible design gives you the freedom to use the Soundsticks III with other devices that use an analog output such as games consoles, DVD/Blu-ray Disc players, and TVs. And since they are detachable, they can be easily replaced if they happened to get damaged. \n\nA SOUND PLAN FOR ENERGY-EFFICIENCY\nThe SoundSticks III speaker system is soundly engineered for full compliance with the most demanding energy-efficiency requirements. It achieves this \"green\" standard primarily through incorporating a convenient on/off switch, which is built into the subwoofer volume control. This way, you gain more power over your power usage while keeping your satisfaction levels high and your energy bill low. \n\nINSPIRING INDUSTRIAL DESIGN\nFew multimedia sound systems can boast that their predecessor was part of the permanent collection at New York City's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), but that's exactly the claim the SoundSticks III speaker system can make. Taking its older sibling's celebrated design even further, the SoundSticks III look is cutting-edge with a modern industrial design aesthetic, elegant black accents and a luminescent white LED glow. And though the SoundSticks III system may look like a visitor from the future with its transparent speaker covers, its exceptional performance makes it a more-than-worthy encore to its pop-culture predecessor. \n\n\nFor more than 50 years harman kardon products have delivered great sound and extraordinary design DESIGNED TO ENTERTAIN.\nFor more than 50 years, harman kardon\u00ae audio experts have - through extraordinary industrial design, innovative technologies and meticulous engineering - created products to deliver the ultimate listening experience. From the world's very first high-fidelity receiver in 1954 to high-current, ultrawide-bandwidth amplifier design (still used today) to high-performance multimedia speakers that look as good as they sound, the harman kardon brand has led the way to the finest audio and video quality possible. With a complete package of performance, design, flexibility and ease of use, harman kardon products are perfect for all the sounds and visuals that modern, high-definition digital content has to offer. So treat yourself to the ultimate at-home listening experience - one that only a harman kardon system can provide. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n\n\nOne pair of Soundsticks III satellites One powered subwoofer module One power cord One set of audio cables \n\nSPEC SHEET\nClick here to View Spec Sheet \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHECK OUT THESE OTHER GREAT HARMAN KARDON MULTIMEDIA SPEAKER SYSTEMS \n\nGLA55 \n\nDesign 2.0 System Power 55-watts per channel Frequency Response 35Hz-20kHz Input 1/8\" Stereo mini input",
