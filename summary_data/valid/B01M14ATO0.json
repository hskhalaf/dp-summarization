The 5 white has an internal battery so your video options are limited to a little over an hour of video before having to recharge. Even now with 2 generations of GoPros out since the 5, the 5 still holds up as a great action camera.",

Image stabilization again does not compare to Cannons I owed. Yes, it is small, but what I recorded feels so poor quality. Voice recognition is terribly unreliable.
