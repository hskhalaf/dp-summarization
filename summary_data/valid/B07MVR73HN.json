Second the self-powered feature works good but you have to release the power handle then go forward about 6 inches before the gears release. Third the battery is very very difficult to remove. I attribute these items to poor product testing. Other than those items it does cut good and is easy to use. I purchased a 4 amp hour battery and get about 20 to 25 minutes of lawn cutting with some minor slopes.",

Ordered it, and also only received 20 minutes mow time. Loved it when it worked, possible I got a lemon. Returned",
