The body should be made of a heavier material.The materials are of good quality, there's just not enough weight in the body to support the lid. Maybe if it is kept full of whole beans it would serve better.",

In the past we have tried countless storage methods to hold these delicate coffees, but were always disappointed with the quick loss of freshness and flavor. Always in search of suitable storage, when we came to the US last year we purchased a Coffee Gator. Search over. We were so pleased by the performance of this storage container that we purchased a second Coffee Gator this year. When our coffee roaster friend comes to our house, he always comments with amazement that our coffee tastes like he just roasted it. What better endorsement of a product can you get?",

One drawback I felt was I had to thoroughly clean and wash them on the inside because there was a layer of manufacturing residue, as with most similar products. And about the freshness, the only thing that would make them better is if there was a way that allows the coffee to be taken out without reintroducing air, but that could be a different product altogether.",
