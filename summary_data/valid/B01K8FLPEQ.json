      "text": "My daughter loves feisty pets. This one is pretty cute, but I personally find the relaxed face extra sad compared to her other feisty pets. Perhaps part of that is that is has droopy ears. It came packaged in plastic, with the ears smooshed down and we haven\u2019t been able to coax them to stay up yet. It feels well made and works as it should. Feisty pets are not soft and huggable like your standard plushie. As long as you don\u2019t have expectations of that, I think your little will be happy with it.",

My husband entertained other drivers while we were stuck in traffic on a road trip - complete strangers cracked up laughing everytime! It's so unexpected to see the bunny turn evil! Absolutely love them. Bought the goat for a friend who has always wanted a goat (she loved it), and got the unicorn & pegasus for our 6 & 10 year old nieces, who find them hilarious too! They are well made and a bargain at $25 or less each.",
