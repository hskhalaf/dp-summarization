The only reason it is not a 5 star review is that you cannot put bottled beer in it standing up, I cannot believe they designed this product so that if you put bottled beer in it that it will not close. Quite a disappointment when I stocked it up for the 4th of July party and could not close the lid. If you prefer your beer in cans than this is a fantastic cooler, if you prefer it in bottles then you may be disappointed like me.",

The ORCA is just the right size (have RTIC 45 qt) for every day use when you don't need to carry a lot and also not as heavy and bulky for handling. Like the fact that it was a little larger than the 20 quart size rotomold coolers other manufacturers sold and it had rope handles. Have not tried to keep anything over a couple of days in it so far. It has retained ice very well and kept drinks cold.",

The only downfall is that it does not hold beer bottles standing straight up, we just lay them down. It fits an 18 pack of bottles stuffed with ice, but it could probably hold a 24 pack if you didn't use a whole bag of ice. It is the same if not better quality than a Yeti and half the price, it is also not as heavy as the yeti! Highly recommend!",

You can't go wrong with any of the premium coolers, just make sure you are comparing apples to apples when doing your research and pay close attention to how they measure their volume.",
