Just remember to put your eggs in a bowl full of ice water after they are done. Then your eggs will peel perfectly. This product is so Whimsical. Henrietta chirps when your eggs are ready. When she is unplugged she also makes the cutest sound. The only downside is that for some bizarre reason they used a nonstick surface where the water goes. It doesn\u2019t affect the eggs adversely whatsoever. It would\u2019ve been nice to have a stainless steel interior though.",

I like poached eggs for breakfast, but didn't make them on work days because it was inconvenient to stay at the stove while getting ready in the morning. Now I fill with water to desired line, spray the 4-sectioned divider lightly with non stick spray, crack an egg into the tray and cover. When I walk away the eggs are perfectly cooked and it whistles loudly enough to hear from another room when eggs are done. The only thing that would make it better for ME is if it would cackle like a hen... but my husband says that he would throw it out if it did. LOL",

It sounds like a notification, not an alarm. You still have to unplug it. An automatic shutoff would be better. But we highly recommend this egg cooker.

There is a needle built into the housing where you would poke the egg on one end.15 -20 minutes later you hear Henrietta clucking away. Unplug, rinse the eggs in cool water and done.

It makes eggs at the level of cooking ( soft, medium, or hard boiling) that one wants every time, and my kids like the chirping It makes when the eggs are done. However, the inside water tray, even when cleaned periodically with vinegar, corrodes and has started to release black particles. As such, I'm replacing the product because we love boiled eggs, but I won't be getting another Henrietta, but rather one with stainless water base.",

I even tried making the poached eggs, which I have never tried to do before and I loved them as well. If you like either of these, you won't be sorry if you buy this. It's really great. I would recommend it to anyone.",

We raise our own chickens and use a lot of eggs, and the fresher the egg it always seemed, the harder they were to peel, not with Henrietta! For some reason, after the eggs were cooked and cooled, they ALL peeled like a dream, the shell came off in two pieces! It's a fun product to use and also looks cute just sitting on our counter.",

    "description": "Make hard, soft or poached eggs in a snap. Quickly make perfectly cooked eggs by choosing the preferred type; Poached, Soft or Hard. Henrietta's rack can cook up to 7 hard or soft boiled eggs and poaching tray up to 4 poached eggs. A fun, retro design as Henrietta is shaped and stylized like a hen, which chirps when your eggs are ready. Piercing pin helps prevent shells from cracking. Most parts are dishwasher safe for your convenience. Includes hen lid, egg cooking rack, poaching rack and base/heating plate.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhether you're making eggs Benedict for brunch or egg-salad sandwiches for school lunches, or if you just have a big, hungry family eager for breakfast, this cute device boils or poaches eggs to order and \"chirps\" when the eggs are cooked. Beneath Henrietta the hen's ample form there's a poaching tray that holds four eggs and a cooking rack that holds seven. Tray, rack, and Henrietta nest on a power base. Pour water into the base to one of three levels for soft-, medium-, or hard-boiled eggs; puncture their big ends with the piercing pin in a separate cooking-rack cavity to prevent shells from cracking; plug in the power base; and steam cooks the eggs. The tray, which requires water at level two, rests on the cooking rack if poached eggs are desired. Afterward, all the hard plastic parts except the power base can go in the dishwasher. --Fred Brack",
