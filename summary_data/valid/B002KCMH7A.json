It works great on sucking up dog hair off of furniture and its light weight makes for easy cleaning up for dustboards, walls, crevices etc. I appreciate the long cord - I wanted a corded - as it makes getting around easy. Additionally, it's super easy to clean. Haven't needed to use a lot of the attachements, but appreciate that they were included. At time of purchase, Amazon had the best price.",

For me, it makes less noise than our main vacuum and isn\u2019t an issue whatsoever but when I read reviews people always seem concerned about noise levels haha. It didn\u2019t take long and it really did a fantastic job. Haven\u2019t tried the other attachments yet or for other purposes, or had it for more than a day so I\u2019ll update if anything other than pure amazingness happens but so far so good.",

I bought a brand name cordless with little power and used it maybe six times before the battery was useless. Is this a way to sell replacement batteries? No thanks! I bought this great corded Bissell with great attachments and plenty of power. It should outlive me and still be working great!",

My original one is still going strong after a few years. My dad probably uses this daily, he's retired and cleans a lot, and his is still going strong too. When either of ours breaks, we will likely purchase another one of these!! Sorry, old dust buster that couldn't actually bust dust, you've been replaced.",
