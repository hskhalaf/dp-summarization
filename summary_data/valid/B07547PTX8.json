I could literally see a gap on both sides of the unit where the body had separated from the handheld steamer. The mop head and my floor were completely dry. Because of this malfunction, I had to send it back and order from a different company.",

      "text": "It works under the right situations. It is light and maneuverable, easy to use. I use it on tile floors and it does what it says it will do. If your floors are dirty, clean them before you the steam mop. Otherwise you will be changing the mop pad very often. But it does leave the tile streak free and clean. It comes with only one mop pad which is perfect if you have a tiny little floor to clean. My suggestion is to buy 6 addition pads other wise you will be changing and cleaning the one pad to continue your cleaning... I wonder why the manufacturer would not provide a few additional pads since I paid $100?",

My husband was sensitive to smells of strong detergents and caused breathing difficulties but using this streamer made all that a thing of the past. I highly recommend it. Its easy, lightweight, fast and does an amazing job and its pretty to look at too.",

Not a problem though, because I was able to learn everything from the other reviewers on Amazon and Youtube. Get this mop--you won't be sorry!",
