Not strong enough for larger carpentry panel saws but if you're restoring, making or re-handling a gents saw, dovetail saw or other back saw used for furniture joinery, this does a great job. Dies have a small point which easily finds the dimple left from using a machinist's transfer punch to mark handle screw locations. Reach is about two inches which should be enough for most back saws. Raises no burr and leaves the plate perfectly flat. I recommend always using a little light oil on the die and this sturdy tool should last a lifetime.

Small occasional projects? Great. Could have spent 4 or 6 times more for top of the line commercial quality but simply no need for that. It punches nice round holes in light sheet metal. Perfect for me. I'd buy again without question. I can buy a new pair every 5 years for the next 15 to 20 years and still be money ahead. That's a very hard deal to beat. With light use I actually expect a set to last 10-20 years each or more.",

Over all this was a well made and easy to use tool for it's purpose. The only down side is that it is a little on the heavy side.",
