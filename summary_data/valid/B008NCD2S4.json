These speakers totally exceeded my expectations, Ive had the complete 5.1 system for 5 years now and the sound is great in my home theatre for the total price of about $600. One thing I did was to raise these speakers up about 8 inches off the floor to get more ear level, Compare to Best Buy systems and these are a clear winner on price and quality.",

I'm a (starving) recording artist and spend a lot of time in studio-quality headphones so I know how music is supposed to sound out of speakers. For $200 a pair, it's hard to imagine getting much better. Excellent response all across the audible spectrum. Not boomy like a lot of powered speakers nowadays. Plays the TV nicely, but if you want earthquake-simulating ultra-lows for your movie experience you should probably look at some powered speakers that have a subwoofer with crossover. These are designed primarily for music.",

If your amp is somewhat clinical or unforgiving, you'll want to back off the treble a smidge, but if it's \"musical\", forgiving, and doesn't highlight every little flaw, these are great speakers. They paired nicely with a Cambridge Audio Topaz AM5.

Sound quality was almost discernible from the Klipsch R-26, it just couldn't keep up with the clarity of sound reproduction that the R-26F could push out. At the end of the day, I did go with the R-26F due to the sound quality. If you're on a budget, you will be getting a huge value with this speaker.",

Really recommend these Speakers. But feed them well 50w to 100w of good clean power to make them sing.",

      "text": "There's no other way to put this - these speakers are simply a great value for the price! Reference-quality sound, inoffensive visually. I've purchased a pile of these speakers for myself and my friends. I simply have not found anything comparable to these for less than $500. They're not going to muscle you out of the house by any means, but these are hungry enough to be overbearingly loud in a medium sized room if you give them enough juice. If you're a first-timer trying to design a decent audio system, these things are great for home theater and/or casual listening.",

Amazing and would recommend to anyone who wants some great quality speakers but doesn't want to break the bank.",

They are very, very, clear and precise. They don't produce a ton of bass, but it's reasonable considering the size of the towers. Add a sub if you want punching low notes. A great speaker that I'd buy again in a heartbeat. I also bought the center which is of equal quality.",

And now listening to a cello with the same sharp clear quality. When you can hear key strikes and bow movement you have a great set of speakers. These speakers far exceed my expectations, and I don't even have the sub bass plugged in yet. So worth their very reasonable cost!",
