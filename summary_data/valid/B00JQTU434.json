Both crisper and deeper. Don't know how it does what it does, but was worth every penny. The speaker includes foam sealing tape and screws for installation. Highly recommend this speaker!",

    "description": "This 8\" shallow subwoofer handles 600W max., 150W nominal power, and delivers deep bass with top-notch sound quality thanks to features like Pioneer(R)'s MICA injection-molded resin which gives it the ability to produce accurate bass.\nThe TS-SW2002D4 utilizes an oversized cone structure that provides greater cone and gasket surface without changing its standard external dimension. This cone surface allows the subwoofer to produce louder and deeper bass by moving more air. The mounting depth is just 2-5/8\" - less than half a typical subwoofer in this class.",
