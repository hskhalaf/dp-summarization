Keep in the mind that the actual dimensions include the feet, the mesh dimmensions are slightly smaller. I would suggest setting a padded dog bed on top of the mesh so its softer for the dog if you're using this inside. When I have it outside I just use it with the mesh so that it helps them stay cooler during the summer months.",

The crossbars have curved ends to fit better with the long pieces. This makes it less likely to twist out of shape later. The hardware in general seems to be of a higher quality. 2. The fabric of the cot is heavier-duty and looks like it will be much more sturdy. The name-brand's cot's fabric quickly wore thin and developed holes. All in all, this is a superior product.",

It was simple to put together, even with a toddler trying to \"help\" me. My large rescue dog's long nails (he panics when anyone tries to trim them) have not punctured or damaged the fabric at all. It being elevated means that my old, little dog does not pee on it, unlike literally every other dog bed we have ever bought. My kids (40lbs and 30lbs) enjoy sitting on it, as well as jumping on it, and it has neither bowed nor broken. 10/10",

The bed is easy to assemble and my dog is ok with its construction. I called her over after it was fully assembled, and she stepped on it with caution and then lay down. My dog is a full-size golden retriever that weighs 74lb and she fits perfectly on this bed. The only negative thing I noticed was that the bed seems to be on the stretchy side, because it does sag a bit when she is on it. However, my dog seems to be ok with it.",

I prefer it over the XL size (which I also have) bc it\u2019s just much easier to fit this dog bed on our lanai. It seems durable enough- hoping it lasts at least a year in our covered outdoor space. The green is MUCH better than the gray. I don\u2019t know why I got gray for the XL size. It\u2019s covered in muddy paw prints from the dogs as they walk over the gray one to the green one to settle in.",

The AmazonBasic was a few dollars less than the Coolaroo & I decided to go with AmazonBasic. When assembling the dog bed I noticed it came with hex head crank arm bolts & not Philips pan head screws. I was very pleased as I would be less inclined to strip any Philip head screws. I would definitely recommend AmazonBasic.",
