I bought this because I have 8 foot ceilings and really like the fact that this is adjustable. There definitely is a noticeable oily smell that is diminishing pretty quickly. The bottom legs aren't perfectly parallel because they angle in a little, but it shouldn't impact me from using it. Some screws were a little difficult in fitting in the correct spots. The hardware provided was all there. There is a slight wobble for me (at 205 pounds) but it still feels stable. The optimal weight for someone using this is probably up to 160-180 pounds.",

Only reason for not giving 5 is because there were some scratches on it and evidence it had been put together before.",

The only thing for me, being so heavy, is it's just a little wobbly when doing dips, so what I did was place a shelf of weights (kettlebells) on the rear to reinforce stability. I have been using it for about a month and had no problems so far. I highly recommend purchasing this if you are looking for a great power tower for a price that's hard to beat! When assembling, it really helps to have your own tools on hand. It takes about an hour to assemble.",

The tools to put it together come in the package but if you have a simple tool box it would make it a little easier.
