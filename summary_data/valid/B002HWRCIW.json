    "title": "Leggett & Platt Sanford Complete Metal Bed and Steel Support Frame with Castings and Round Finial Posts, Matte Black Finish, King",
    "description": "Color:Matte Black| Size:KingThe Sanford, and its defining characteristics, allows for the option of having a bed that can act as the focal point or background d\u00e9cor. Constructed of carbon steel for stability and years of everyday use, the 52.25-inch headboard and 31.5-inch footboard are detailed with castings and round finial posts. The Matte Black powder coat application finish marries texture to the surface in a way that mutes and plays with light. The (10) castings locked in place on this bed are intentionally finished in the same black powder coat to show only their silhouette and accentuate their simple nature. The engineered bed frame consists of iron rails, cross arms and glides to provide full support to your mattress and box spring. A good ornamental bed, like the Sanford, will fuse with the surrounding d\u00e9cor, accent other bedroom furniture and transform an ordinary room into something interesting and sophisticated. This unit includes a headboard and footboard panel, bed frame, instruction sheet, and hardware bag with everything needed for easy assembly. The Leggett & Platt Sanford Complete Bed comes with a 10-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects.
