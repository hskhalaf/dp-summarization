The 6 function luxury shower head from Aqua Elegante, the Wantba 6\" high pressure rainfall massage, the Speakman S-2252 Anystream, and the Delta 75152 single function shower head. Speakman: Pros: Good pressure, solid construction. Decent coverage Cons: It is heavy, so caution required when installing. The adjustable settings doesn't change the stream significantly and it is far pricier to comparable shower heads Get this if: you care about an all metal construction and want a high pressure shower and don't mind spending the money",

The first 5 minutes involved me trying to locate my adjustable wrench, which turned out to be just a little too small...so I used a channel wrench. After that, it was easy. As for the shower head, it is the best I've ever had. Fully adjustable from flood to fine. I have kinky, thick hair, and rinsing out shampoo is a breeze. Well worth the money. They recommend using a wax to protect the chrome from spotting. I used FLITZ (available on Amazon), and water rolls right off. I saved the old shower head -- because if I ever move, the Speakman is going with me!",

There is no way to adjust it any lower. Also when washing my body, there is no way to angle the water at the wall and then back when it's time to wash off. The shower head has the ability to make only slight angled adjustments to its spray. If you dont have a shower/tub combo, or a large walk in shower, this shower head will not work well for you. There should be a warning about the very limited adjustability of this shower head.",

Read additional reviews that said you needed to remove flow restrictor for max force. I watched several YouTube videos and worked up the courage to give it a try. Very easy. Don't hesitate..just do it! You really don't need all of the tools shown in some tutorials. Just get a long screw and use a drill to screw it into the white plastic thing. Then use pliers to pull the screw out. The white thing will come out too and you will have unrestricted water flow.",

I was concerned that perhaps the water pressure in our bathroom/house just wasn't that great, and a new showerhead wouldn't solve the problem, but even with the flow restrictor left in place this Speakman is a huge improvement. I love it, truly. It's a heavyweight piece, and after several months of daily use by two people it still looks and acts like it's brand new Not sure why some reviewers are claiming this isn't a high pressure showerhead ... In my experience there's lots of nice high pressure water action. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Love it! We bought a home with well water, first time ever. The existing shower heads would literally drool on you, it was the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. The water flow/pressure out of the lower tub section came out rapidly and with what would seem enough force to allow a shower head to flow well. I researched around and found out about the Speakman, I was actually giddy after the first shower, couldn't wait for my wife to try! Ended up buying another for the second bathroom, and it looks like they'll last my lifetime! Solid, heavy pieces.",

The individual streams of water are almost stinging and about perfect. Not only am I cleaned by the time I step out but totally refreshed and tingling. The perfect experience!

An American Standard... If you are looking for great pressure, do not get this Speakman. That's about it. I give it two stars for its aesthetics, but its performance is 1 star.

I find the nozzle adjustment while it works, when opened up wide for flow it's kind if useless and dialed in tight a little too fine for me.

The method works just fine. After that it took about two minutes to remove the old shower head, wrap the plumbers tape, and install the 2252. God, the pressure is amazing.....you'd think you're standing in a hurricane. Buy the 2252 and you'll never be without one again.",
