Ended up going to Home Depot and buying new bits to complete the job. Shame on me for trying to buy a cheap pack for the job But again, if you are working on soft woods this is a good buy.

I'll give this the benefit of the doubt and give 3 stars simply because of the variety of bits in the set but if they're all as poor quality as the one I used today, it really isn't much of a bargain at all.

Check under the bearing for powder coat slough. Apparently they coat them right up the bearing shaft and then press the bearing on. A number of mine had hardened coating right up against the bearing which contributed to some of them not turning freely.",

They don't seem to be too cheap but then again, they don't look like a $300 set. If you are in construction or a simple DIYer like me and need some router bits on occasion, I think you will find these bits to be adequate for your needs. Anything else, not so much. The wood box they come in was ok, the locks tho I will replace. Other than that, you get what you pay for. Definiitely worth the money.",
