But the one immediate thing I will say is they are SO heavy. It's not really comfortable when they are in your ears. You definitely are constantly aware they are there. The holder and the charging is a bit awkward as well. and as much as I do wish there was no strap, unfortunately there is. I might just be going back to airpods at this point. I had high hopes for these.",

I've swapped ear pieces, manipulated the stabilization elements, and I'm at a loss. I'll continue using them for recreational listening when I want to be untethered, but I'll be looking for something that doesn't fall out as easily",

I still have to keep a pair of conventional headphones in my bag for the inevitable midday charge that is required. The tinny sound inherent to many BT headphones have caused me to relegate these to mostly podcast listening.

What keeps these headsets from becoming great are the 2 major setbacks that still plague this technology... size and battery life... the speakers are large and bulky... and despite their size to allow more juice, battery only lasts about 2.5 hrs on full use after a full charge. I think due to current limitations, this is as good as it can get, but I will accommodate and enjoy the freedom they provide, however brief it might be.

      "text": "I purchased these when my wired Beats by dre buds stopped working due to frayed wires. I haven't used them too much yet, but when I have, they fit well and have decent sound. I'm still trying to get used to the controls and I haven't yet paired it with multiple devices, just my iphone. But so far so good. The only negative is battery life. I went from a full charge to low battery within an hour of use. I'm not sure if I did something to cause that or if it's just poor battery life overall.",

Set came in a really great package with 3 sizes of earbuds, a portable charging case- will provide an additional 1hr of time, standard charge cord and plug. The set functions well and linked up with my iPhone quickly. Drawbacks is that it does not seem to be compatible with my Playstation 3 (PS3) and that it hard to switch from the headset bluetooth connection to my car's connection. Very happy with this product otherwise.",

You can charge and also protect your headphones. One thing I would love from those headphones are more bass and louder volume. Also the light indicator somewhere easier to see. Overall its a good workout headphones.",
