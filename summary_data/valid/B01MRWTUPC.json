Because of the wrong size, they are not super comfortable for me. I like the purple color and the style, though.",

I mostly wear Clarks and because of a foot injury, it has been very difficult for me to wear any kind of cure dress shoe for years. Now that things are slowing getting better, I can usually wear Clarks without pain or fear causing inflammation. If you ever need a pair of Mary Janes, buy these! The only thing that keeps me from buy many more pairs is the limited color choices.",

I got hooked on Clarks shoes a few years ago so I wanted to give these a try. Just as I expected, the shoes felt so good to my feet. I am very pleased with everything about this shoe.

However, it fits well, has a comfortable heel, the insoles are quite comfy, and the style is classic. I'll change my rating after they're road tested. ** So, I road tested this and it's an excellent pair of shoes! Very comfortable. I love the insoles! Loooove the rounded toe cap! I got a half size bigger than I normally wear, and it was a good decision. An all around great pair of shoes!",
