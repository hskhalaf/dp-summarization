It\u2019s super lightweight and packs up smaller and than a football but he fabric, stitching, and reinforced line attachment points are super strong. As the wind picked up I kept thinking I should take it down to keep it from being damaged but this is one tough piece of gear and it held just fine. If it ever wears out, I\u2019ll gladly order another.",

      "text": "With tarps the proof of quality is in the using. Reasonably priced at $45/ea. At a weight of 1 kilogram with stakes and lines, this is a bit heavy for a backpacking tarp. There are 8 reinforced eyelets, one at each corner and one at the middle of each side. Two more eyelets at each side or on two opposite sides would have made this more versatile. The short stakes and thin lines are a bit undersized for the 10x10 or larger tarp. This should work well in light wind or less and moderate rains. If you want something more rugged, I recommend paying more.",

Yes, there are more expensive tarps like this, but unless you set and break camp 100 times a year and year after year, this will work well for most average campers.

Addendum: A year later I bought a second one to expand a camp site set-up. Yes, I'm satisfied, if that tells you anything. I am aware there are higher grade camping tarps on the market, but until I see a first hand reason to upgrade, these have and will meet expectations.",

Update - My Chill Gorilla Rain Fly had a manufacturing defect but Chill Gorilla replaced my tarp and shipped me a new one free of charge. Great customer service! I would definitely do business with CG again.",

The heat from the fire rolled right into my tent and was very comfortable in 24 degree weather. I pulled, wrenched and stretched this tarp with no issues. Also love that it is very easy to fold back up into its pouch.",

Granted it was rocky ground in the Adirondacks, but they shouldn\u2019t have bent so easy. Tarp is excellent and tie out points are robust unlike some other tarps. Tarp held its own during heavy snow and winds around 20 mph sustained with gusts in excess of 35 mph. Definitely recommend especially at the price. Get some good groundhog stakes to pair with it and you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

I've never hammock camped before, so my experience with equipment is limited, but the fly was easy to set up and place, with all guylines and stakes in great shape. My only complaint is that there are six guy lines and four stakes...not sure why, but it's kind of annoying having to use a found stick or rock to tie off the last two guy lines. I would definitely recommend this fly for beginner level hammock camping, because that's the level I'm at, and I found it perfect.",
