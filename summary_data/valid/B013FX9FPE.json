The fender should have been metal not plastic. It will not go on straight at all. This is for our granddaughter that has cerebal palsy and can't ride a regular bike because if her balance issue. She is turning 10 and has never rode a bike or anything. I hope this works for her. It's alot if money when you don't have it to give. I sure hope she is not disappointed.",

The wiring in the box was wired and there was 2 electrical tape where it had been reassembled or something Factory would not use electrical tape iin a newly made Trike. I called the repairman in Vegas and he said it would cost more to repair it That I should buy another.",

      "text": "First, it actually is an upgrade from the 1 pictured: has slightly larger front tire and goes faster than 22mph, have clocked at 30+. Second, these scooters were never meant to have a seat, designed to be ridden standing; seat puts weight to rear and high up, can flip backwards or to either side when turning. Also, the motor in the front wheel will not have proper traction with weight on rear. Standing gives you better balance and traction. This is my 3rd, second MotoTec. It is recreational and can ride it anywhere you ride a bicycle, etc.",

Why not make the rear wheels solid, I don't think that the ride would be that uncomfortable. With a wrench I had to stand on the handle to loosen the wheel nut. I'm sure that the company has heard of a torque wrench. The battery wire harness created another problem",

One front tire has a separation causing trike to wobble and 1 rear tire has a bulge in the center of the tread. Trike does not have a brake lock, not a rear light, both safety issues. Tires spin a lot, need better gripping tires, such as knobby type tires for better traction.",

It will be great to help my wife get around until her broken ankle is fully healed. I'll use it to check the mail. This scooter isn't for children.
