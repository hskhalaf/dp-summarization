I have to stick my own reflectors($4) on the end now to be DOT compliant but it saves me the hassle of drilling four new holes in my trailer. The LEDs are very bright, brake, turn, and running. Don't use the wire nuts provided. Instead I'd suggest soldering the leads and using heat shrink. Came with a wire harness too. These can be installed within an hour timeframe.",

One word of advice is if using trailer a lot, especially in salt water, make sure to solder all connections, then shrink wrap tightly. Another thing to eliminate iffy performance is to connect ground wires and run a solid wire forward to plug, instead of just grounding to frame, which gets corroded over time and causes lights to start not working. It's worth the few minutes it takes to do this and saves a lot of frustration in the future.",

I drop my boat trailer in saltwater once a week and it still works great. I use to buy my trailer lights (non LED) at West Marine and they would fail after three to four dunks in saltwater. I would stop wasting your money on cheap incandescent trailer lights. They are not made to last! I will update this review in 12 months.",

    "title": "Blazer C7280 LED Low Profile Submersible Trailer Light Kit",
    "description": "Style:LED_Rectangular Low Profile SubmersibleThe Blazer C7280 LED low-profile submersible trailer light kit is designed to conform to applicable US FMVSS108 and Canadian CMVSS safety standards for trailers over and under 80\" wide. The driver\u2019s side features a combination of 8-function stop, tail, turn, rear and side reflex, rear clearance and side marker and license illumination functions. The passenger side has the same functions as the driver\u2019s side with the exception of the license plate light. This kit is not only ideal for boat trailers, but for any utility, camping, snowmobile and motorcycle trailer where LED lights are desired. The life of an LED trailer light far exceeds traditional incandescent trailer lights. Lenses are sonically sealed to provide protection from moisture and corrosion. Additionally, all electronics are potted with water resistant epoxy for a second layer of defense. These stop/tail/turn lights are individually replaceable with model numbers C7288TM and C7298TM. The kit includes (2) submersible stop/tail/turn lights, wire harness, license plate bracket, mounting hardware, and trilingual instructions, everything needed for easy installation and DOT compliance.",
