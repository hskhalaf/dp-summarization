Yeah, more pieces of Caillou to find at night when the OCD kicks in and they need ALL OF CAILLOU in order to sleep. :) His cap doesn't stay on at all, another piece to lose under the couch.",

      "title": "Generic Caillou Doll",
      "text": "This doll is okay but nothing really great. Very generic looking. For a very young child this doll might pass, and keep them happy for a little while, but they lose interest in it quite quickly. It's just too plain. It was a good price, and I guess thats what you get for trying to keep the cost of a toy down. I would recommend that if you are going to purchase one of these dolls that you spend a little more and get something of better quality.",
