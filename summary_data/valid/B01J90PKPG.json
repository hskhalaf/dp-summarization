This is super high quality, no imperfections in sight. It also come with a vesa mount If you want to be daring. The size and resolution combined is perfect for how far away it is from my arms length and the picture is perfect because of it. If you're looking for a monitor that is definitely bigger than a normal 1440p monitor this is the one to get. I'm honestly looking into to getting another 32\" monitor after my experience with this one! Hope that helps.",

      "text": "This is probably not the best screen for desk use, but would be okay from a short distance. The PPI was just a bit too high when compared to 27\" in the same resolution. The pixels just seem big and noticeable; it's just not as crisp and clean an image as 27\" 2560x1440. But that's not this monitors crux. The Freesync Range is 48-75hz, which means no LFC so whenever it gets below 60fps in game, the flicker is an absolute nightmare. It feels like a slideshow. I couldn't handle this, I had to switch it for a 1080p panel that doesn't have as bad of flicker.",
