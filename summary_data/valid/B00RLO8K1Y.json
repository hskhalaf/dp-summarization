      "text": "Great unit, but took a few updates for the transducer to not lose bottom. Had a lot of false readings (negative inches in many feet of water), but eventually firmware updates sorted this. My real sticking point is that I can't record sonar logs using my Navionics chip. The hardware is a bit underpowered....takes ages to boot. It also prompts me to send updates (I'm guessing uploading my gps logs) at the worst of times, and I haven't figured out how to disable this.",

It is very clear and precise got it linked up with a Hook 4 and my trolling motor and it is amazing how well they all work together. This was an up grade to my 2004 Lund that was using the original electronics. Funny how they all gave out in the same winter. But can't complain I got thirteen years of use out of them, Amazing! Hope I get half that much out of these new ones. :-)",

HDS Gen3 fish finder/chart plotter displays are a revolutionary step forward in product for the marine electronics industry. Technology is not slowing down. Are you keeping up? HDS Gen3 is a bottom machine that goes well beyond finding. HDS Gen3 gives birth to an exclusive new interface that allows you to fully control functions through either multi-touch or full key pad operation depending on user preference and on-the-water conditions. This hi-tech generation advances the award-winning Lowrance target separation by combining simultaneous use of cutting-edge CHIRP sonar technology and our widely-held Structure Scan HD sonar imaging to produce unparalleled views of fish holding near the bottom and around structure. In order to better replicate the underwater home where fish live and how you interact with the display, Lowrance has developed and specially tuned a visibly better screen delivering better definition of sonar returns, dynamic dimensionality in menu elements and a layered, strong and subtle color scheme for striking on-screen detail. To drive the latest in electronics technology the HDS Gen3 benefits the angler by turning out the fastest HDS ever. The advantages of new technology don\u2019t stop there. Total control of trolling-motor, outboard motor and entire electronics system is now achievable in one integrated HDS system. Lowrance Smart Steer allows seamless switching from electric-steer trolling-motor and outboard pilot steering. Add-in any NMEA 2000 certified device, available engine interface cables or Lowrance data sensors for a professional-level system that is effortless-to-install and easy-to-use.
