The rim is very shallow, so it constantly leaks over. I propped it up to tilt the proper direction, but any cups etc. near the edge still drain over the side. We're not talking drips...we're talking pools. I've finally decided I don't need this everyday aggravation in my life and I'm replacing it with another. I bought it because of the brand name, but it definitely doesn't meet their usual standards for great design. Such a pretty thing though!",

Most of the time we always have a big stack of dishes to wash since we're a big household, so the bigger size is a big plus. I'm very happy with it.",
