      "text": "I use these small bowls for my homemade yogurts. After awhile the lids that came with these bowls where getting harder to put on. It seems like the lids was shrinking or maybe from the hot water I use to wash them. I tried to find replacement lids for the bowls, but with no luck. Then one day I searched again and found these silicone stretch lids for mason jars. So I bought a set of ten to try it out. They worked great, but you must be sure the silicone lids and bowls are dry to work properly. So if you need to replace the lids try out these lids. Here are some pictures to see how they look.",

They are thick glass and not only durable, but pleasing to the eye. For the price I would buy these to use for making gift candles or natural face scrubs etc., as well. The lids really are top rack dishwasher safe after multiple washings and continue to fit tightly.",
