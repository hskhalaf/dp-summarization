Then pick a Cranium Card and keep it a secret. Without saying any of the words on the Cranium card, you must get the other players to guess what's on that Cranium card by expressing it in the style of the Action card. For example, can you get your friends to guess \"milk a cow\" while acting like a zombie -- or \"fried chicken\" while drawing with your eyes closed -- in just 60 seconds? Be the first player to collect 7 cards to win! Cranium and all related trademarks of Cranium, Inc. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Hasbro Games",
