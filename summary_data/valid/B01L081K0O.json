I was skeptical, but thought it was worth a try. Since I started taking K2, my bone density numbers have been steadily improving. This is the only change I made. I know that one example is not scientific evidence, but I can offer my own testimony that this product is working for me.",

They seem to work well to help calcium get targeted toward bones where it is needed, so they are a good supplement.",

Made in India does not instill confidence. \"Vegan\" label doesn't help much either - I am interested in the supplement, not people's random belief systems. I will use them, not return them, but this makes me inclined to avoid this brand in future.",
