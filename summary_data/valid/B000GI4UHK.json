I seriously question if this product is authentic from this seller, as it does not have the \"certified yellow sticker\" that Clinique uses when a product is purchased. I have been using this soap over the last 12-15 years (purchased from a Clinique counter) and the one from this seller has a distinct smell (which none of the previous ones I purchase from Clinique has any noticeable smell at all). And my face seems to be breaking out with the product from this seller as well, and I've never had this problem in the past either. This product when authentic is awesome, I advise buying direct from Clinique online/counter.",

      "text": "I like that this facial cleanser is easy on the skin but cleans well. There is no scent which I also like because scented cleansers tend to irratate my skin. The only complaint I have is that the bottle dispenser it comes in doesn't allow you to get the last little 1/4 of cleanser out of the bottle. I always have to take the lid off and try to get the remainder out by putting the dispenser upside down. Overall great product for any face/skin type.",

I love buying it on amazon because it seems like the price is often dropped lower than what department stores sell it for. It does pretty good at getting my makeup off except for my gel eyeliner (which nothing can get off except my marykay eye makeup remover).",
