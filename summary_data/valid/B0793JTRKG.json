      "text": "This is an absolutely beautiful architecture set. Some other builders have stated that they don\u2019t like that there isn\u2019t more detail in the face; I agree that it could look better to have some, but I don\u2019t feel it detracts from the simple beauty of this set. I really enjoyed this one, as I build the architecture series of places that I (and/or my family) have seen. This one is different from the others in that it really gives height to the set, which allows for the folds of fabric in the statue to be seen and explored. Just a lot of fun to build, and I think this one will definitely get many comments. Kudos, LEGO !",

The lack of face works for me; Modders have tried a brick-built face that looks like an Easter Island statue and I feel a printed face would have looked unsettling. The instructions give some great history and cool facts about the real statue! Pick one up for yourself or someone you know who is a fan of cool architecture!",

Now the rest of the build was not remarkable, or easy, which was made more difficult by poorly written instructions on glossy black paper. But the Torch is the worst. When you put it in, 2 or 3 other pieces fall off, and then the torch itself falls apart when you try to adjust it so that it looks right. There is more I could say, but I've got to get back to building.",
