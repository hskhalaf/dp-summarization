This does not come with an AC power adapter, but I just used the one that came with my phone--works wonderfully! All the cords fit into the system securely and it powers on and off properly. Al external buttons are operational. I bought this unit \"new\" from \"Cotree\" but the language was was not set to the default and there were saves on it from whomever owned it previously, so I suggest buying it from another seller.",

Only thing was the short wire on the controllers but the 8bitdo wireless adaptor fixes that. True blue also adding 100s of games was worth it. As long as your paying 40$ or less it is great. Launch price and limited games and short wires and dual shock controllers hurt the launch an reputation of it. But as I said true blue usb sticks and a 8bitdo wireless adaptor fixes this (still won\u2019t be able to use the right DualShock unfortunately but that is because of the emulation software on the ps classic)",

It is a little more than the used disks online but worth it as we have found that we play one of the fighting games, tekken, a lot. That alone is worth the cost and has been a blast. We usually play it in the past at a vintage arcade. This also made my son realize we could do this on raspberry pi. One negative thing is the cord for the controller is short. A solution was to get a long hdmi cable.",

That alone made the PS1 classic a masterpiece. It gets better if you get your own flashdrive and add in your own PS1 games and even incorporate Sega, NES and SNES games as well. You can go as far as included Arcade games but it'll take some tampering.",
