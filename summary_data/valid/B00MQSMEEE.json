      "text": "I got this for a trip in May 2018. It worked well during my time there - I would get around 3 full charges for my iPhone X before the pack would need to be plugged back in to recharge. However, by November 2018, it is no longer holding a charge as it initially did. After being fully charged and unused (with absolutely nothing plugged in - not even a charging cable), I was disappointed when it showed zero charge whatsoever when plugging my phone in a month later during a power outage. While I was initially very pleased with this product, I found the declining quality to be disappointing for the price after only six months of use.",

It has dual ports which my wife and I have also been able to utilize simultaneously which is great. It comes with 2 charge cords as well.

Actually, these batteries (I have 4 of them) will even do the same thing at my home where we have only wifi service, all day and night and I never hear the Bose announcement, \"Only 5% battery remaining, please charge now,\" that used to wake me when I wore the wireless QC30's. You can listen to whatever, charge a Watch and the noise cancelling feature on the corded headset at staggered intervals. I can't imagine life without these long-lasting, sturdy devices. I've dropped one while hiking and it had no ill effects even months later. Highly recommended.",

I have also found the 2.4A charges my particular phone at a rate of 1Battery point in 50seconds. So in short - takes about 45 minutes to charge my battery up 60 levels.

Also, the charger is light weight, so when I go on hikes or trips I hardly notice it in my backpack, included is a fantastic flashlight too. In addition, I have used this charger while playing Pokeman Go for over 3 or 4 hours long, the battery life is outstanding. The quality and durability of RavPower charger is well constructed. I recommend this charger.",

I found with this very high mAh, that it takes more than 12-hours to fully recharge. Something like this is nice to have in case of emergency, when the power in your home goes out, and your phone battery is dead. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends. Money very well spent indeed. Have a great day.",

The Haidue , and the RavPower  We took both on vacation used them several times, charged them and put them on the shelf until our next trip, about six weeks. At that point, the Haidue was dead, would not take a charge and is still non- functional. The RavPower is much the opposite. It is very powerful and have great capacity. It is very fast, charging a dead battery on a Samsung S5 in under two hours, much faster than the A/C powered Samsung smart charger. I have fully charged my phone 3 times and still had reserve in the RavPower charger.",
