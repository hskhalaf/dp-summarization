      "text": "Wanted to love it but it's just not loud enough for my needs. Even with daisychaining it to other Clips it wasn't loud enough. I lead bike convoys that need music for everyone involved. I really need a Megaboom, I think, but this was my first attempt at \"small and portable, but loud.\" Sadly not so. But my boyfriend has this exact one, rubberbanded to the breast of his backpack strap, and he LOVES it. The sound quality is great, and when it's that close to your ear, sure, it's plenty loud. But for my needs, not so much.",

The power constantly just 'turns off' for no reason, and then I have to turn it back on and re-connect, only for it to happen again 10 minutes later. The batter doesn't last nearly as long as I'd like either; I'm usually outside for about 3 hours in a stretch, and it won't even hold a charge that long. very disappointing considering JBL is usually synonymous with quality.",

A good tip is to listen to music and audio in the highest quality you can, like 320 bitrate or higher. It makes a huge difference with a speaker like this. Another tip is to buy manufacture certified refurbished, it will cut the price in half and each device is rigorously tested by an actual human being before it's shipped out. It came in like brand new condition, in the original box.",

When the battery drains--and it will in about three hours from full charge--it will be nearly impossible to re-charge. I see from other accounts that many of us have had the same experience. Sometimes it will appear as if it is charging, but play it and ten minutes later it's dead. And those are the good times. Most often, it will not charge at all. Ultimate assessment: a 99% ripoff that should be removed from the amazon/amazon prime offerings.",
