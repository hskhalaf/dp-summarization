Charging normally takes about 30-35 minutes for a fully drained battery. It's nice to just pull the mower out in the spring, slide the freshly charged battery in and mow. No gas, oil, carburetor cleaning, spark plugs or tune ups. I love it and have had no problems in the first 2 full seasons.",

The wet grass sticks to the inside of the machine, clogs up the side discharge and then wears down their battery all while making the machinenshake violently. In order to get it to work again, you have to scoop out the entire underside and dischae chute with your hand, now you have a pile of dead grass to clean up, one of many, because you'll do this numerous times. Out of a full charge I got about 20 minutes of cut time. Absolutely worthless. For less than 1\\3 you can get a lawnmower that actually works. WASTE OF MONEY. DONT BUY.",
