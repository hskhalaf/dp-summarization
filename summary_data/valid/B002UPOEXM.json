Too bad the manufacturer didn't include a piece of steel or aluminum angle across the bottom bar, so that these things would continue to look nice for a few years. Although they looked perfect upon installation as seen in the first attached photo, they began sagging in the middle (where there is no post) less than 6 weeks after being installed, as seen in the second photo. The other two photos show the sagging at nine months after being installed (straight yellow lines added to photos for reference).",

After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this trellis and I'm glad I did! It was so easy to assemble! You just need a power drill and some crazy glue (for the top decorative pieces). We used the spacers that were included to mount it to the fence. From start to finish...probably took less than an hour. I thought about getting the white, but I'm glad I got the mocha. It has a more subtle and more natural look. Definitely want to get more of these later.",

I was able to complete the assembly with no further problems and then mount it to 4x4s so I could use it as a free standing visual divider in my garden.

We put the post side to our fence and the rough side of the post to the trellis. Naturally we had to drill the steel post then bolted them together (without the spacers).

      "text": "Assembly is required but I was amazed how easily these went together. Lots of holes to line up but they must have some excellent jigs or tooling at the factory so everything fit together easily and quickly. Sturdy but relatively light weight; I hung them from a cedar fence. We got the mocha color and it went well with the yard, not overwhelming. Put three side-by-side.",

All five assembled and mounted in less than 4 hours. Lots of compliments, and my sweet autumn clematis finally has a much needed home!",

      "title": "Vinyl may require training",
      "text": "While this trellis looks as nice as advertised, we have found that plants have a hard time staying attached to the trellis, and they are unable to naturally climb through the openings. This is most likely attributed to the vinyl surface, as the same plants easily adhere to our wood fences. With some training, the plants will stay attached to the trellis, but a wooden unit (while not as weatherproof) may be a better option.",

      "text": "I used a pair of these trellises to provide some privacy from a nearby road. When the vines I've planted mature, I'm sure they will do that and more, but in the meantime, they give the front walkway of my mid-century home a little gravitas. I found them easy to assemble--working alone it took me about 45 minutes per trellis--and they are attractive and sturdy.",
