I know it\u2019s just like the movie, but I was a little freaked out with his glowing head, blue laser eyes, and sporadic cries that occur even when no one plays with him. Sometimes I think I am living with Chucky or a poltergeist, but my son loves this freaky toy. I always wanted him to play with dolls (I thought it would make him more empathetic), and I can\u2019t believe he chose this. Sweat dreams people- don\u2019t fall asleep with this toy in your bedroom; you will probably have nightmares.",

Craddles it... pats it...says its ok Jack Jack I'm here... and he laughs at all the noises it makes. If you press and hold the button though, it does some semi scary things (in my opinion). He makes some really angry noises and flashes red and even does a lightening thing at one point... the eyes will flash... reminds me of a Chucky doll a tiny bit! :D However, my son isn't phased by it. He thinks it's cool... I think its a bit much. :D",
