Update I contacted the supplier via email to question the hum. They responded in less than 24 hours. After confirming it was properly installed, I received a replacement unit within 96 hours. The new unit is installed and hum free. The old unit was package per instructions in the replacement unit container and being returned via UPS. Incredible customer service.",

      "text": "I reall appreciated (which has nothing to do with the product itself) but the fact that I went with the free shipping which in all fairness couldve taken 2-3 weeks to get. I received it in 1 week. The fireplace is fantastic. I've seen, and installed, quite a but of electric fireplaces being an electrician and all, and the flame features on this look very realistic. Some fireplaces dont have very good graphics and this one looks fantastic. Very pleased with the product! It's a very reasonable price for the quality as well. The only thing that its lacking is a thermostat to keep a regulated temperature but it's honestly not a big deal.",

My only issue is that the flame settings weren't working on my unit, but I spoke with their customer support and they replaced my unit (they shipped quickly, but I'm still trying to deal with UPS to track it down \u2014 UPS is the worst :/)",

After which, I have to wait about 5 to 10 minutes before I can turn it on again. The low heat setting is working fine so far though. I love the visuals, but...why is it not working as intended?",
