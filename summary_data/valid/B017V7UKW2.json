I let my wife try them after her work day and after 5 seconds she could feel the lacrosse massage balls hitting trigger points very effectively. This is a very worthy purchase! Another friend wanted to know if it left marks on the wall, and that hasn't seem to be a problem.",

VERY durable (able to withstand a lot of weight and not flimsy or hollow) 2. Not soft, but also not hard like a rock, sort of like very tough rubber. 3. Small enough that I can leave them in the corner and rub my feet on them when my feet are tense.",

I didn't realize that Lacrosse balls are the heavy ones, and you also have light massage balls that are squeezable.

Aside from my stupid mistake, I actually like these balls and discovered that they have their own use as well. Not good for throwing and catching of course due to their heavy weight, but great for massaging sore areas in your muscle.",

      "title": "Stress or Pain Relief",
      "text": "I purchased the Kieba Massage balls not knowing what to expect. And now I\u2019m glad I did. I use one for gripping as a stress ball. However, the benefits of using both massage balls for pain relief is just as effective. The ball is made out of a hard rubber so you don\u2019t have to worry about damage due to wear-and-tear. In short, it\u2019s an inexpensive alternative to either pain relief or, as in my case, stress release. This is not a paid advertisement/ fake post. I do recommend. Cheers!",

I used Acupoint massage balls in past they are also hard but provide a slight give so they are less aggressive. Product itself arrived well, shipping was good and customer service was good as I inquired about returning these because they do not work for me. 2 stars simply for the actual usefulness of the product as I will likely just throw them away since $10 is likely not worth my time to return.",
