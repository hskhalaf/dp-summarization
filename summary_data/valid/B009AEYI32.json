It turns off unexpectedly from time to time (the issue is most likely hardware one and seems to be a common flaw for this model, as a quick google search reveals), and sometimes the power on switch does not work. For such a pricy laptop, you would expect a reliability: you do not want it to switch off in the middle of an important skype call, online test or a presentation.",

My advice is to check the drivers page for win 8.1 on the official asus support page. Especially, check if there is a software version for the trackpad - it no longer has gestures after the update. Also, I have some issues with the graphics - it is crisp in windows, but on third party apps it is blurry. Wait to update.",
