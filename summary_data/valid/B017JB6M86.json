      "text": "This is an amazing value! Hemp from North America for $5.24? Sold! I enjoy the taste plain, but it's green, nutty flavor is best blended with other ingredients. I often add a tablespoon or two vegan protein shakes for added protein and fiber, as well as to cut sweetness. Some people might find the texture bothersome. Hemp protein doesnt mix very well with thin liquids; some separation starts occurring. This is less of a problem with thicker liquids like smoothies. It also is pretty gritty. If that bothers you a great deal, it may not be for you. Make sure you rinse glassware after drinking - dried on hemp mixture is really hard to get off!",

Gluten free dairy free and has a lot of protein and not a strong taste so it\u2019s a win for me. Will be buying again",

      "text": "Every once in a while it hits $3.14 per can ... at that time, it's by far the best value for protein out there. This is made/grown in Canada too. For the price, it's an amazing value compared to the vast majority of protein powders from China. Hemp protein is 35% albumin, one of the easiest proteins to digest and the same protein in eggs. The other 65% is Edestin, which has a whole range of benefits (google \"edestin dna repair\" and \"edestin hormone production\" for instance). Even at $6 per tub, the usual price, it's a solid value. This particular brand is also high in fiber ... basically a protein, greens, and fiber supplement in 1.",
