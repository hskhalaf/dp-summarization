Please note: these bones do wear down over time until they are too small to allow your dog to chew. After they become a choking hazard please discard. Chewing can cause your dogs gums to bleed. That is the PURPOSE. Your dog develops tartar/plaque just like we do and as they chew it wears away the build-up on the teeth. Just like ours may bleed during a dental cleaning. Dogs need bones and rope to promote healthy teeth and gums or they will rot and cause extreme pain. This is not a flaw.",

      "text": "I recently adopted a third dog, and so I'm beefing up my toy and chew supplies. I purchased several Nylabones- this one in Medium, a synthetic cow hoof, a synthetic antler, a chicken flavored dental bone and on a whim, a Philly Cheesesteak flavored bone. This one is the least favorite for all three dogs, including the 'original' flavored souper bone that's really too big for all three dogs. The shape is awkward for them. The two round ends don't fit comfortably in their mouths to chew, and the center bar is not really accessible. I suspect they'd like it more in a more traditional shape.",
