I went to the GroVia website for the best advice on how to use them and chatted with a very helpful representative who advised me to treat my washed diapers three times (one packet in a hot wash, two cold rinse cylces) followed by a 1/4 cup diluted bleach cycle (same hot, two cold rinse). My diapers smell amazing now! She suggested treating them once every 6 weeks or so because I have hard water. Very pleased!",
