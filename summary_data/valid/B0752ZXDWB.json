      "text": "Awesome pocketbook design and the mystery block is a head-turner whenever spotted. Pros: 12 Cartridge slots in a wallet sized case . Build and materials are high quality, easy to clean, each slot has and individual slot for a Micro SD card as well. Cons: (more like personal opinions) The latch swings loosely when the case isn't shut, it's not a big deal but I'd prefer a stiffer latch. Although the rubberized interior is great and everything is snug, this case is NOT waterproof! So don't get too comfy. Form and Function is what makes this a great product. I'd give it 5 if it created a seal when shut and the latch was a bit more secure.",

I put it in my switch carrying case overnight, took it out the next day to grab a game and there were these scuffs on the question mark that will not come off, no matter how I try to remove them. The photos don't show how bad they are but, the scuffs are far worse in person. It doesn't prevent the case from doing its job, but it's annoying to look at, so based on this it gets 4 stars for me.",

They are soft enough to hold the games without damage, while firm and tacky enough to keep them inplace. I have zero worries about damage to the cards or the cards being secured inplace. My kids leave the case open all the time and after multiple falls off the book shelf there has yet to be a game card come loose.",
