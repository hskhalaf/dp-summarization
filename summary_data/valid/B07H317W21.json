I honestly thought it might be difficult to get the cat to use this enclosed pet house, but I was wrong. After assembling it, I put a bowl inside with canned cat food, and the feral cat immediately went inside and ate. Now that the weather is getting colder, he stays inside it most of the time, which tells me he loves it! I now feed him outside the box, but am so glad to know he can sleep safe and warm.",

Had it not been for this purchase, the stray outside would surely have died. Because I provided this heated home, she is in it all the time and has gained trust for us, and now she eats when we feed her. She was weak, starving, and freezing when we first saw her. Now she is fattened up, healthy, loving, warm, and happy. So worth the money and peace of mind knowing she is warm AND has a place to safely deliver her babies since we recently noticed she is pregnant!",

He still won't use it if I put the front door on but it's only a matter of time before he gets accustomed to that. The heated pad must feel like heaven to him.

It was fun to decorate Murphy's house this past holiday with battery powered Christmas lights attached along the roofline of the house. We received many compliments. Both Mr. Murphy and our family are more than satisfied with this product!!! : )",

Highly recommend this house and advise keeping it out of the weather.",

Hopefully he/she will enjoy coming in from the cold and lay on the heated pad inside. Waiting to see, as Boo Boo comes for dinner everyday. Very nice product and wish Lisa well in her venture.",
