I had to take two stars off because the keyless chuck is designed in such a way that the there is just enough room to have your finger pulled between the chuck and the body of the drill. I love Makita and have many LXT tools but this is a dangerous design. Do not use the drill to open and close the keyless chuck or it will grab your finger.",

Needs a speed adjustment to force it into lower rpm if needed. Chuck was awkward to adjust with possibility of finger pinching. Overall this tool needs a redesign. Seems to be from the same blood as the older generation of Makita tools and is not a serious job site tool.",

The battery is somewhat large (although small for its power capacity) which sometimes can make it awkward to maneuver in very tight quarters. The screw-in side handle helps with control, but here again, can get in the way in tight quarters. Overall, though, I'm very happy with the drill. It has done what I needed it to do.",
