If I ran it on less than 100% power, the loud sound stopped and started. Beware... Before buying this unit, please notice the consistency & repetition of several concerns raised in these one star reviews & the descriptions of customer service responses. It is astonishing! This is not a reliable product. I have returned my unit to amazon. The alternative unit that I also bought through Amazon is much quieter. Frankly, I think Amazon ought to stop selling this particular model.",

It seems sturdy and I really appreciate the dark grey interior after having so many white ones that show every bit of spatter, plus it looks sleek. The light is bright enough that I can clearly see what's going on inside. I don't have any complaints about the sound level. I would recommend this product.",
