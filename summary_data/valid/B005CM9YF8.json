But buying it by the case, I can afford to glug a few. You can pay more for the more expensive bottles, but they don't improve the quality of what's inside, despite what you may have been told. This is rich ginger content without bitterness. Buy it.",

I am in no way a professional so I review this with a \"generic\" understanding of flavors and such. I'm sure true mixologists would have a more focused palette to go by. We thought these were great tasting, very carbonated and for the price, hard to beat! They had a very nice ginger taste to them and weren't sickeningly sweet. Also none of the cans we received were dented!",
