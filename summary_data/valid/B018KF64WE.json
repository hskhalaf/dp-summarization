In the instructions for trouble shooting, there was not even any mention of an issue with coffee grounds nor on their website. Also, whoever wrote the instruction manual doesn't understand english as there were mispelled words, incorrect phrases and other issues that make no sense. Won't buy again.",

It's not fancy, doesn't have all the bells and whistles of other coffee brewers, but it works! It takes any pod (even ones I had left over that Keurig wouldn't take), and it brews a great cup of coffee. That's all I ever wanted. Water reservoir is smaller, but makes 3 large cups before re-filling. Beep-beep tells me my coffee is done! And..it actually brews coffee that doesn't taste like colored water! I'm in love.",

With a coffeemaker run a TB or two through the coffee cycle and then run several cycles through with just water to get it all rinsed out, works like a charm. With a dishwasher, fill the detergent cup with citric acid through a heavy cycle, it will clean out the scale buildup in your dishwasher.",

The water dispensing sound is a low, light, growl..........different but not objectionable. Overall, a very nice product, very fairly priced and a good value.",

Several times, I haven't noticed that water needed to be added and ran the machine. I don't think any permanent damage was done, but it does make a terrible sound and there's a bit of a burning smell. A Keurig won't let you run the machine when the water is low. Other than that, I've been really happy with it. It's a great value.",
