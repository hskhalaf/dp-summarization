By the way, the reason for the purchase, I have remodeled my office and it did not require a large chair mat. Buyer beware!",

I put books and weights on different sides and it still finds ways to slip. I consider it a deadweight loss at this point.",

Just opened the cardboard and laid it on the carpeting and that's it. My chair is a heavy gaming chair but it moves super easy on this relatively hard mat. It's perfect. I never knew my chair moved so easy 'til I put it on this mat. This is not one of those squishy mats you get at regular retail which I hated and returned.

I purchased this one (and paid premium for it) with the idea that it would last much longer, but it ended up breaking much sooner than thinner and cheaper mats used on the same low pile carpet. It also has a tendency to slide around much easier than other mats, which required constant repositioning. Now this mat is noticeably thicker and less flexible, which is probably the reason for breaking so quickly, since it doesn't \"give\" as much as thinner mats. Disappointing, but a learning experience.",
