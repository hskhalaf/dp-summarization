      "text": "Recently Added this to my 4 y/o red footed tortoise\u2019s diet . He LOVES it , it\u2019s has a very strong sweet fruity smell. It\u2019s a lot easier than keeping fresh fruit around, and avoiding fruit flies, gnats and mites. I feed it every 3 days, I sprinkle some of this fruit mix on top of his pellets with a lil water and calcium. I used to feed fruit n veggies from my garden but I could not keep mites out of the tank, no matter how many times I washed them. So now I freeze the fresh fruit and veggies n no bugs no waste, and now with this product I\u2019ll definitely be using this for a long time.",

It does not re-constitute and remains so rubbery that I was worried my pets would choke on it. NO FEAR in that department-THEY WON'T EAT IT!!!!! Finally able to get some vegetables for my picky eater boxies. They seem to love it! I soak a teaspoon in water for a few minutes, strain and then mix with an equal portion of their protein du jour. They've been scarfing up every bit of this! and so easy too!!!!!",

I ended up force feeding him jarred baby food and prune juice just to get something in him and hopefully move his bowels. He finally pooped and tentatively began eating again, but it was hard to find foods he really liked, he absolutely refused any greens or other vegetables. I decided to try this omnivore mix, and I'm really glad I did. It's the only thing he not only eats, but gets excited about.",

There is a nice mix of insects and vegetables so your beardie will get a balanced diet. It hydrates in a couple of minutes; feeding needs almost no prep time at all. Plus, since it's dehydrated, you don't have to worry about it spoiling. My local pet store charges almost $14 a bag for this, so I order it pretty regularly on Amazon. If you have a beardie, give this a try!!",
