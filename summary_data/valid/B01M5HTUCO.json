I also found using the remote control with the parrot app made it much easier to control the speed of the scroll. the remote is overpriced at $20 - but it works.",

It came well packaged, which also serves to safely store the unit when not in use. The overall quality of material was very good. When I ordered it my expectations were not very high because of the low price. However, I was pleasantly surprised! You may need to add a black \"drape\" to go between the prompter and the camera - depending on your lighting setup.",

My only issue with this product is that the black cover is not very durable BUT there is a 5 year warranty for parts failure from normal use. Bottom Line this prompter works and it works well -- just handle with some care. I would have given it 4 stars for the material but the replacement parts solves that issue. Good product for the price and efficient regardless of the material.",

Took everything out of the box, read the instruction sheet, looked for the clips, no clips, tried putting it together, the glass fits, albeit loosely, in its slot, the thin card stock used for the cover/lens opening would not hold together (hence the need for clips) and felt very flimsy, not sure I want to put a tablet/expensive phone on this thing as it has no way of securing said tablet/phone. I decided to reinvest in a better made model that will probably last a lot longer. As I did not get to use it I cannot say if it works as intended, others here say it does.",

We're talking a tripod-mountable piece of chipboard with cardstock and some reflective glass. My video came out perfect shooting through the glass with no noticeable effect on exposure with my Canon T5i or Samsung S7 Edge. It's not huge, it's not glamourous, but if you're on a fixed income or need something for that one-off project, it works quite well. Easy to follow instructions. Be careful handling this - the glass is just sort of hanging out in the pre-cut crevice and will fall if it's off balance.",
