Despite having a rigid-looking construction, many users attested to its lightweight properties.\u00a0While there are lots of positive attributes going on with the Glenhaven Mid shoes, wearers have to recognize that it may not give an easy on and off wear.",

Only thing I have to comment on is the size runs a bit larger as they got broken in. I\u2019m usually a solid 9.5 in this style of shoe, but these are a little larger by almost half a size. I could probably do an insole or thicker socks, but I\u2019d buy these again if I ever wear them out.",

Being a lover of Chuck Taylor type shoes I also thought this would be a comparable shoe in many ways, it is not. The sole is incredibly thin and the overall feel is too tight for my sizing. I had to return these. I think Keen failed to deliver on this shoe.",

I absolutely love the style and the look however after trying it on and wearing them around the house for a couple of days the leather upper on the shoe is so stiff and uncomfortable that I could no longer wear them. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think that the leather will ever soften to a point that they are comfortable.",

If you're used to the KEEN shoes with the wide toe box and the rubber bumper on the front (like I am) then you'll find these to be significantly narrower. I went up half a size and still found them to be too narrow. Disappointing. (same problem with the Winterhaven -- I went up a full size and still had to use a shoe stretcher to get them wide enough to be comfortable.) They must have hired a new designer who doesn't understand why KEEN shoes (and sandals) were so popular. These just don't feel like a KEEN product.",

This latest pair are in my view not of the same quality, the leather of the uppers is extremely hard and unforgiving making them difficult to put on and initially uncomfortable to wear. Hopefully they will soften up the more they are worn, time will tell.",
