I returned the camera with sadness as this would have been a great camera if i could have been able to take good photos.",

My biggest disappointment is with the Dropbox sync feature. I had to spend an hour updating the firmware first, then I found out the Dropbox feature does not automatically upload photos. You have to select them one at a time in groups of 5 photos. It feels like a sham. Shame on Samsung. Maybe they will add an auto-upload feature in a future firmware update? If so, I will change my review to 5 stars.",

They turned out so clear and easy to use. The shutter speed is very fast and the camera can easily process multiple fast pictures. Most of all I love the wifi mode.

However, when you are in a well lit area this camera takes fantastic pictures and the zoom can really reach out. I has a bunch of artistic features to add to your pictures. You can also do some basic editing of pictures on the camera itself.",

Also if you are going to use the super zoom, which is why i bought the camera, buy yourself a good tripod or you will wind up with blur. On the positive side; It's great for portraits and landscapes the colors are true and vivid. Compared to the competition it's a good buy for the money.",

    "title": "Samsung WB2200F 16.3MP CMOS Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 60x Optical Zoom, 3.0\" LCD and 1080p HD Video (Black)",
    "description": "With a dual-grip design and solid professional appearance, the WB2200F is comfortable and easy to hold. Its Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) makes photographers\" jobs easier and more pleasurable, and the device\"s unique i-Function control offers advanced elements that facilitate full manual control at the touch of a button. Amateur and expert photographers alike can also benefit from more fully automatic SMART Modes ranging from capturing the beauty of a setting sun with \"Sunset\" mode to reliving the excitement of a fast-paced sporting event with \"Action Freeze\" mode.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCapture and share photos with ease--wherever you are--using the Samsung WB2200F SMART Camera. The WB2200F sports a 20mm ultra wide-angle lens and 60x optical zoom, so you can get great shots whether you're close to your subject or far away. With Tag & Go features such as Photo Beam, AutoShare, and Mobile Link, the camera lets you easily share and send photos to compatible smartphones anywhere, while Remote Viewfinder lets you use a smartphone to control the camera from a distance. The Dual Grip allows you to handle the camera like a professional.\n\nGet more of your subject in the frame with the WB2200F's 20mm ultra wide-angle lens. View larger.\n\nHone in on the smallest detail with the 60x optical zoom. View larger.\n\nEffortlessly share photos via Wi-Fi and NFC to smartphones. View larger.\n\n3-inch HVGA display.\nView larger.\n\n60X ZOOM WITH WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nWith the WB2200F, you can capture the moment just the way you remember it--whether your subject is up close or far away--thanks to the camera's 20-1200mm ultra wide-angle and super-telephoto lens. Even when you can't get close to your subject, the 60x optical zoom allows you to capture every sharp detail. \n\n16.4-MEGAPIXEL BACKSIDE-ILLUMINATED CMOS SENSOR\nThe Samsung WB2200F SMART Camera is equipped with a 16.4-megapixel backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor that needs less light for proper exposure and quick focus than conventional sensors. This allows you to take properly exposed images in low-light situations without having to use a flash. \n\nHANDLE THE CAMERA LIKE A PRO WITH DUAL GRIP\nThe WB2200F contains a Dual Grip along with an additional shutter button that make the camera comfortable to hold and use. Samsung used the extra room for the grip to give the camera more battery capacity, allowing you to take up to 500 photos before you'll need to recharge. \n\nI-FUNCTION SYSTEM FOR PHOTO ADJUSTMENTS\nUsing this camera's i-Function control, you can quickly and intuitively adjust the aperture, shutter speed, EV, and ISO range with a single button and a value ring on the lens. This function also lets you program existing buttons with frequently used settings and set up shortcut keys. \n\nConvenient i-Function controls. View larger.INTELLIGENT LCD SCREEN AND ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER\nOn the back of the WB2200F is a brilliant 3-inch HVGA display that allows you to easily preview your pictures and navigate the camera's menu options. The 200K-dot electronic viewfinder (EVF) operates like an enhanced optical viewfinder, so you can accurately frame your shots. \n\nFULL HD VIDEO RECORDING\nWith the WB2200F, you can shoot Full HD (1920 x 1080p) video at 30 frames per second with lifelike color and extraordinarily sharp details. The camera shoots video in the H.264 format, which allows you to record for longer than with a camera using MJPEG. \n\nPHOTO BEAM TO SHARE PHOTOS WITH ONE TOUCH\nLike other Samsung devices, the WB2200F features Photo Beam technology, which makes it a snap to share photos. Simply tap the camera on any NFC-compatible smartphone to automatically share whichever image you're currently viewing. \n\nSAVE PHOTOS IN REAL TIME WITH AUTOSHARE\nWith Samsung's AutoShare feature, you can send photos instantly to an NFC-compatible smartphone or tablet--just as you're shooting them--over a Wi-Fi connection. This makes it easy to back up photos and share them wherever you are. \n\nSEND FILES USING MOBILE LINK, EVEN WITHOUT WI-FI\nBased on NFC technology, Samsung's Mobile Link app lets you select and send photos or albums to a designated smartphone or tablet, even when you're away from a Wi-Fi hotspot, and without having to send the photos as a text message or an email. The app also lets you manage photos on your smartphone and save the changes automatically to the camera. \n\nTAG AND GO\nEffortlessly share photos via Wi-Fi and NFC, Photo Beam, AutoShare, and Mobile Link. Share images with compatible smartphones anywhere, while Remote Viewfinder enables control of the camera with a smartphone.\n\nREMOTE VIEWFINDER TO CONTROL CAMERA AT A DISTANCE\nWhen you connect the camera to select smartphones, you can use the Remote ViewFinder app to turn your phone into a viewfinder. You can control your camera from up to 30 feet away and preview images, adjust camera settings, frame the scene, and tag the shot location--all from your phone. When you need to take a group shot with yourself in it, Remote ViewFinder makes it easy. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nSamsung WB2200F SMART Camera, Li-Ion battery BP-1410, USB cable, power adapter, lens cap, lens cap strap, and quick-start guide.\n\nWB2200F SMART CAMERA\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 60x optical zoom with 20mm ultra wide-angle lens\n * 16.4-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor for shooting in low light\n * Dual Grip to hold the camera comfortably and securely\n * 3-inch HVGA display and electronic viewfinder (EVF) for framing shots\n * Long battery life lets you take up to 500 photos per charge\n * Tag & Go features, so you can easily save and share photos\n\nDual Grip lets you handle the camera like a pro.
