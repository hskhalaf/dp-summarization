I don't think this is worth the money and it was certainly not worth the multiple attempts to get it operational. I went back to using the Apple devices until someone tells me how to get better coverage in a 3200 sf home. Do not waste your time or money trying to get this POC to work effectively.",

The worst if I place the baby monitor right next the pc, I get disconnected when downloading files or taking forever to connect to the web. I have searched for some information that how to fix this right, I just needed some 5 Ghz signal for my wifi pc. my TP-Link is dual band, so I just needed dual band router which is D-Link AC1900 just works great for all.
