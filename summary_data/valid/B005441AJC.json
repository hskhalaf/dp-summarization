I realize the 3 is half the cost, but even at that, I'd say just get a pair of 1's before i'd get a 3. It has kind of a \"tin like\" boombox type sound in my opinion. At louder volumes the bass does kick in and overtake the mids to which it sounds a little better, but still nothing like the 5. I also have the play ones with a sound bar and sub that I enjoy for what it's worth. Good luck :-)",

Normally with Alexa speakers you can place them in groups so you can play music in different areas at once. NOT SONOS. !!!! you can either play music on it alone or other Alexa speakers. In other words just a glorified bluetube speaker. If I had know this would not have paid the price they wanted. So yes it works with Alexa but not how normal people want. Was going to buy others, but no thanks not worth the money for dumb speakers. yes it says that it will someday but no updates",

This feature works great on Android phones and tablets. Unfortunately, the Apple iOS products can not access the Sonos network.

All of my songs are captured in iTunes and they all live on a NAS box in my basement. Sonos was smart enough to access both the music on my NAS and my playlists and so I can access my entire library without having to turn on my computer. Very nice!",

      "text": "I was surprised by how well these little wireless bookshelf speakers perform. They are spendy, but if you are into Sonos you know what you are getting. I like the combination of reasonably good sound in a small form factor. When combined with the PlayBar and Sub, you have a great surround system. The nice thing is that you don't have to run any speaker wires. This system makes it super easy to retrofit a room for surround sound without having wires running all over the place.",

I've contacted Sonos support for a couple of minor issues, and am very satisfied with their support and extremely satisfied with the system as a whole.",

I would have been fine with just the PLAY: 1s. The rooms in the house are not that big, so I don't think the difference between the two is obvious, although it may be noticeable in a house with bigger rooms and a more open floor plan. Still, I absolutely love the Sonos! They are amazing. I recommend starting off with one and testing it out, then building off of the system, depending on what you need.",
