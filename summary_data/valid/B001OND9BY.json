Dislike: VERY hard to use (requires a lot of muscle and the ability to push challenging metal buttons while pulling), metal started to bend on second use. Ramps slid all over the place despite grip-like coating. Ramp scratched the heck out of my car when I tried to use it. Bag it came with started to rip after second use. After reading the reviews I'd hoped this would be a good tool for getting my 55lb travel electric wheelchair easily in and out of the family Grand Jeep Cherokee trunk and save us some muscle. It did neither and I'm returning it.",

      "text": "We have a sunken family room that is two steps down, a twelve inch heighth. I needed wheelchair ramps to move my wife's chair into and out of this room occasionally. I have used them for a couple of months now and really like them. Being two entirely separate ramps they can be spaced exactly to your width needs. They are very easy to collapse and to stretch to their full length. They are perfect for the need I had.",

If you're using them frequently I would use a permanent marker to mark where to place the ramps so you don't have to guess or eyeball it every time. It is a little tricky to get them lined up perfectly.",

    "description": "DMI Telescoping Retractable Lightweight Portable Wheelchair Ramps, Adjustable from 3 to 5 feet\n\nThese retractable, adjustable wheelchair ramps are a handy item to have in your home so wheelchair users can easily come and go from rooms that have steps. They are also great to have around for visitors if your entrance has a step or curb. Wheelchair users will also find them invaluable when visiting friends or family who may not have accessible entrances. Light and compact, these portable ramps are easy to travel with or store in the truck of your car. Each ramp weighs only 6 pounds, making them easy to lift and position. They extend from 3 to 5 feet, so you can use them on different step sizes and heights (see measuring directions). Each ramp can support 330 pounds (660 pounds total between them). \n\nHow to Use \n\nTwo ramps are included. To extend the ramps, pull sections one and two until the locking buttons are fully extended into the holes and snap into place. After use, simply retract them and put them away in their convenient nylon carrying bag. They are easy to take with you when traveling.\n\nHow to Measure for Wheelchair Ramps\n\nTo calculate the length of the ramp you will need, first you need to measure the rise. The rise is the measurement between the ground and where the top of the ramp will be placed. The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public areas have wheelchair ramps with an incline of 4.8 degrees or less (a ratio of 1:12). This equals one foot of ramp for every inch of rise. For residential areas such as homes, ADA recommends a 2:12 slope. This equals one foot of ramp for every two inches of rise. To calculate the ramp length you will need, divide the rise by two. For home use, these ramps would work for rises up to 10 inches.\n\nNext, you need to measure the width of your wheelchairandrsquo;s wheels. These ramps have an inner track area of 4 inches. Be certain each wheel is no wider than 4 inches before ordering.\n\nFeatures\n\n * Two telescoping, adjustable wheelchair ramps easily extend for use with steps, curbs or vehicles then retract for storage\n * Strong rust resistant aluminum construction with durable non-skid u-shaped tracks for added safety\n * Easily adjustable from 3 to 5 feet with push-button lock mechanism; see measuring instructions before ordering\n * Each ramp can support up to 330 pounds for a total of 660 pounds between them\n * Ramps are lightweight (6 pounds each) and portable in a convenient nylon storage bag; great for travel\n * Inside track area: 4 inches wide\n * Retracted size: 6.5 x 29 inches\n * Easy to assemble with no tools",
