There is no shot meter and the mechanics heavily favor the AI giving them more points and making them near impossible to beat as you progress in the game. I regret this purchase. It's not \"Jam\" it's not \"2K\" it's just crap.",

      "text": "The game is actually fun! The key is getting your timing down for your shot using the shot meter. Unlocking new playgrounds is done by beating tournaments. You unlock players as well that you can turn around and use. You can play online which adds to the fun and the game is challenging. If you don't want a complex game like NBA 2K, this is the game you can pick up and start playing from the jump. Definitely worth the price of admission. I got it on the PS4.",
