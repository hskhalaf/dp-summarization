I have ordered about 20 of them for a project. 3 of them failed after less than 10 hours. 1 failed today, less than 15 days after installation. Have to go to job site to replace ALL of them out with SSD from another vendor. I am not sure how OCZ can let such a failure rate pass their QC. Very disappointed. A huge waste of time. Amazon is always super. Request refund without any issue. Thank you.",
