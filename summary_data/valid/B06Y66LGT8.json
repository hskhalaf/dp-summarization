The only issue I have with landing pad is the weaving loops where you slide the yellow plastic holding spikes slide in horizontally, meaning you need to slide the spike horizontally then twist 90 degrees to drive down into the grass/terrain. I have a quick solution for does that also have that same issue; simply go to Lowe's and buy a couple key rings then slide them onto the weaving loops. Enjoy your flight, Cheers!",

This one looked like a good value. It folds into a compact package. You need to practice the technique for folding it. It is similar to folding some photo reflectors. So far it is holding up well. I haven't had to stake it yet, but they are also included. This is a nice package and a GREAT gift idea for someone just getting in to droning.",

If you\u2019re taking off from concrete then you can just unfold this thing and go. If you\u2019re taking off from grass or any other uneven surface I find it best to place cardboard under the pad. Other reviews indicate the pad falling apart after folding too many times, I\u2019ve had mine for about 3 months without any of those issues. All in all a good option for a takeoff landing pad.",

When first learning to fly high grass can def hit the blades, but this pad is large enough where you have a good buffer. People also love watching the drone take off and land on it's own little helipad. It also makes you look that more proficient when you get your drone to do a perfect center of the pad landing.. I have a Mavic Air and the pad works great with it.",

Make sure you hang on to the rim when you open it as it has a very strong spring inside and can open quite quickly.",

I followed some online generic instructions and the pad popped open at the metal joint on the ring and there is no way to get it back. The metal has bent at the joint. There must be some instruction included on how to refold this as it pops open so quickly upon opening there is no real way to tell what happened. There is absolutely no documentation with it including how to send it back. I am traveling tomorrow and really disappointed.",
