That's certainly not what you want from a product like this. It often misses recording people as they walk toward the door, but records them as they walk away. But that's not much help in identifying who they are. The recorded audio makes a whistling sort of sound. It's annoying, like fingernails on a chalkboard. I bought this doorbell camera because I have the Ring security system, which is quite good. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the doorbell camera.",

Although I was frustrated with the installation, it was due to trying to wire it to a doorbell with a bad transformer. Anyway, all is well now. BTW, once it was working again, Aaron recommended a second app called Rapid Ring.

With so many deliveries these days, it\u2019s become an essential tool for me since I can\u2019t just get to my door like I used to. In fact, seeing a car pull into my driveway before the delivery person hits the stairs, gives me time to get out my disinfectant and head for the door. Knock on wood...fingers crossed, right?",

The mounting plate is too flimsy to shim, so I'm trying to find an aftermarket mount that could turn the camera in *and* down -- but just a little bit, not the 30-50 degrees that most mounts offer.

As soon as that is over, the app has trouble connecting to the device, the video is pixelated and laggy, and sometimes when you go to live view I just get a black screen. Convenient that the return policy is for 1 month, and if you don't purchase the cloud service the device has issues.... If I could, I would return the doorbell in a heartbeat.",

      "text": "This might be a good product but I only bought it b/c I want the camera to work with my Echo Spot. According to Ring.com's support site, only the Ring Doorbell 2 and Ring Doorbell Pro work with Alexa. After enabling the Ring skill in Alexa, it just gives an error that it can't connect to the camera, even though live view works fine on my phone. They (Ring) say they are working on Ring Doorbell 1 support but who knows when that will happen for a device that is now several years old.",
