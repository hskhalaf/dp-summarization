If however you use the phone for apps like Pokemon Go, the phone overheats and shuts off... Even at 70 percent charge. The sad thing is that it will also shut back off if you try to restart it. I'm not sure why that is, but the best solution is to keep it plugged into an external power source to keep it on. Other than the overheating and power issues its a decent phone.",

Seems to hang on to existing comm resources regardless of the strength of other signals nearby and switching to stronger sources when the existing signal is no longer viable.",

The screen is very sharp and the response is great with an 8 core processor. The pictures look very good front and back as long as you have steady hands and good lighting. The lcd screen is durable and doesn't scratch that easily. I wish they would upgrade android already! It feels dated! It runs on android 5.1 and it uses a BLU theme that I don't like. They would have been better off leaving it stock, but that's my opinion. Overall I am happy with the BLU pure XL.",

My only complaint is the touch buttons on the bottom don't light up other than that this phone is beautiful. I hopefully wish this phone gets the 6.0 Android update and in the near future I would also like to see a blu pure XL 2. The speaker is loud and I love the fake call feature.

It's supposed to be 3500mah but lasts about 24 hours in standby mode with minimal use. With average use less than 10 hours. Average use for me is 30 minutes of call per day, 10 times checking my stock portfolio, few text & whatsapp messages. The camera is fantastic. The design is great & call quality is very good.

I've received many compliments regarding how crisp and realistic my screen looks and that was from people who owns the galaxy 6 and apple 6plus.

The screen is bigger than a note 5, the resolution is perfect, and the 8 core processor and 3gb of ram means everything runs smoothly. And the fingerprint reader is a great feature too. You don't even have to bother with the unlock screen because touching the reader will skip it and go straight to the main screen. Excellent value here.",

This is my first Blu phone, but if they continue to put out products such as this at low price points then I will continue to be a customer. If you're looking to buy this phone, DO IT!
