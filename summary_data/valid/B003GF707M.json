I had a class and needed an extra grinder, this one came in the day before my class. Put me in a ruff spot. This was purchased/sold in the United States. Said NOTHING about having a 220v European plug in its description. WHY WOULD THIS HAVE A EUROPEAN PLUG??? I can\u2019t say it\u2019s easy to clean, easy to use or anything else about this.
