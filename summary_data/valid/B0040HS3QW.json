      "text": "This thing is solid - seems to be 1/4\" plate steel. It's heavy and I'm confident that should it be installed, it would deter thieves. Now, the bad - it will also deter the owner of the valuable contents! it's not functional. The rotating lock/unlock plastic knob simply broke off in my hand rendering the lock moot. The \"multi-product all purpose\" directions were clear in that a key needed to be inserted in the mechanism, but no lock exists that would allow the key to be inserted,...very weird. And I ordered it NEW and it was delivered clearly USED - very irritating. This would make a great boat anchor. I am rarely THIS disappointed with an amazon purchase.",

I tried everything I could think of, including all the recommendations in the reviews, with no luck. Safe #2...the door opened easily. I installed the safe and it works as it should. Safe #1 was returned. I am a 70+ year old female. The weight was a problem so I installed brackets to hold up the safe while installing it. I was concerned that having it sit in the drywall while being screwed into the studs would crush the drywall. The safe is great and I installed it with no help!",

I added a cabinet pull knob to the front of my unit for easier open and closing of the hinged door.

My prior wall safe had handle that easily unlocked the safe and was easy to pull. I wish I realized it sooner, before installing this one. Also during the install the safe color chipped off quite a bit, I am assuming since paint quality if poor. I do not recommend since it will be very difficult to open.",

This is a great value for the money. As far as installation goes, I located the studs with a finder, cut the hole with a sawzall.

The major issue is that the locking mechanism takes up a lot of space. THE ENTIRE MIDDLE SECTION TAKE UP 1/3 OF THE ROOM. The locks are cheap plastic. About the only good thing about this is the sturdy metal box.",

Mine was stripped out upon shipment, so I had to drill it out. The key is required when it is delivered to set the keycode. If I didn't have the product defect at arrival I would give it 4 stars.",

Lock and unlock mechanism seems to be without any issues. I would definately buy again as the price is great and it serves the purpose.",

Just hope I'm never in an emergency situation where the batteries are dead.",
