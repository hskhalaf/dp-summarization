I'm still keeping them though as I like them. I have several different pairs of sketchers and I am very pleased with them all",

Very disappointing, particularly given how little they've been worn. Thought I'd got a bargain but it's true you get what you pay for :(",

My only slight criticism is that although the sole areas last well, the heal wears down a bit too quickly. However that may be down to the way I walk as I do have this problem with some other shoes.

The memory foam inner sole appears to be all around the heel end of the shoe which means that there is little padding under the ball of the foot, and the thiness of the remaining sole becomes very apparent and you can feel stones under foot.
