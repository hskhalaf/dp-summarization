Naturelo seems to care about the quality of their products, and their customers. Here is my initial old review. Why do they have a CA-Lead warning? Why is Amazon selling vitamins with lead? Also, I have had dizziness - wonder if it\u2019s because of this product. I will not reorder. Good thing I read the other 1-star reviews.",

For those who don't have the gene or don't know, you can still take this vitamin. It is the reduced form of those, meaning, it has been broken down so that the body can easily utilize. So many other companies want to charge an arm and a leg for this, but Naturelo has a fair price and you only need to take one per day. 60 capsules=2 months. 120 capsules=4 months.

My doctor recommended I take 2 per day, and I had an immediate improvement in kidney function, so I'm using a bottle a month. Cheap compared to paying for additional prescriptions...",

It took a few weeks of taking them daily to notice a difference in how I was feeling, but gradually I just started feeling MUCH BETTER. I have more energy throughout the day , brighter and smoother skin, and my hair has been growing really fast. I stopped taking them briefly and really noticed the difference.
