In all eight (8) over a six-hour period measurements from the C6 underestimated by about .035. The cheaper lessor technology won. The BACtrack GO tracked closer to the app. I realize there are a lot of influences that affect readings. but I would rather overestimate than underestimate.

Its difficult for me to get it above .08 even if have drank 6 + beers. If you drink a beer and immediately blow it will show very high like .16 which is expected since alcohol is freshly in your mouth, but if you wait an 1/2 hour after drinking it shows more accurate I guess but I still think it seems low. I would definitely recommend but don't rely on it to heavily. If it shows 0.00 then your good I think which is handy for IID.",
