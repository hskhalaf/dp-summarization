I only had to run a block or two before it was around my legs. Sadly, for me it is worthless. For walkers though or maybe people with large waists it might be very good as it is comfortable.",

I have soaked the bottles, run them through the dishwasher several times and no matter what I did to them after holding water for 15-20 min the water in the bottle is undrinkable. There are no resin markings on the bottle So hard to know what the issue is with the plastic. Save your money lots of other options out there.",

The bottles were easy to remove and I love that there was a spot on the outside for my GU, that way I didn't have to try and unzip the pouch. My Samsung Galazy S5 fit perfect and without a hassle. Very happy I made this purchase, I highly recommend it!!",

    "title": "Running Belt with Water Bottles | Running Hydration Belt has Water Resistant Waist Pack to Fit iPhone, Samsung, Android, etc | Adjustable Belt | 10oz Bottles | Attach Race Number | Hiking & Cycling",
    "description": "The high quality BRINGIT running belt is built for comfort and durability. The water- resistant neoprene pocket is 7.5\u201d long and 4\u201d tall and will hold ALL smartphones including the iPhone 6 Plus and other smartphone brands & models. Additionally, there are interior pockets to store your driver\u2019s license and a credit card. Use the pocket to fit keys, gel fuels, and/or sunglasses. The high quality zipper will secure your valuables and also give you easy access to your items. \n\n The two 10 OZ plastic water bottles with pull tops will provide more water than the many models that only have 6 OZ bottles. They are secured in the bottle holders with a loop strap. The water-resistant neoprene water bottle pockets also have a reflective paint strip AND there are two more reflective tags on the side of each pocket. A total of four reflective tags and two reflective paint strips assist in your safety.\n\n The interior surface of the belt has gel-activated bumps that increase comfort and grip while reducing bounce and chafe while you run, cycle, hike, or walk. The soft, stretchy adjustable waist strap provides a flex-fit for 26\u201d- 41\u201d waists, but the strap can stretch as long as a 47\u201d fit if you don\u2019t mind a tighter fit. The blended strap material is soft and durable with a high quality snap buckle for a secure fit. Wear your belt with the bottles in the back or front. We have found that the belt stays more secure when worn tightly on the waist as opposed to on the hips. However, this hydration running belt will tailor to your comfort. \n\nBOTTLE REPLACEMENT: Lost or damaged a bottle? No problem, BRINGIT also sells additional water bottles to go with the belt!\n\nOUR PROMISE TO YOU: BRINGIT's mission is to provide you with the best product experience while you \u201cbring it\u201d during your exercise sessions. 100% Money Back Guarantee!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR CARE: Wash bottles before use. Dishwasher safe- top shelf only. Hand wash belt.",
