The ladder is very dangerous. The angle doesn\u2019t allow for the children to anticipate where to put their feet and they have all fallen through the bars. I will not use this ladder again as it is a dangerous situation. I am currently in contact with the company to see if there is an aIternative ladder or something the kids can use. I am happy with the rest of the playset however, I need this situation addressed.",
