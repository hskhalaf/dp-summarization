Some people really don\u2019t need straighteners and complain about frizz and I just giggle as they have no idea of the daily struggle for those of us with super thick curly frizzy hair. Now these GHDs glide through my hair like a hot knife through butter, they\u2019re amazing and my hair is now sleek and straight and swishes!",

My hair was getting very thin and dry, after setting my old straightener high (the only way my hair would stay straight for any length of time) for too long. I wondered if my ghd Platinum, with its fixed temperature of 180 degrees would leave my hair straight all day. It does and the condition of my hair's really starting to recover now. One of the best features for me is the totally cool wall. I had tried a couple which actually burnt the skin on my neck and brow as I used them. I'd recommend this product on many levels",

People always recommend GHD's so i thought why not give it a try. I can safely say that if you need new straighteners look no further. These heat up super quickly, leave your hair soft and shiny and straight within minutes! They are well worth the price. Although they do not come with a heat mat just a heat sleeve that can be difficult to get off especially when hot so that should be considered. They look great too!",

They are very smooth and it really doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re powerful enough to straighten but as soon as you look at what you\u2019ve done you can see how perfectly straight it\u2019s made your hair.

My hair feels healthy and looks amazing after using these. They heat up super quick and 1 pass straightens my hair so I don't need to continually go over the same section. I use the platinum+ along with the GHD heat defence spray even though it states you don't need to use heat defence with these. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "These straighteners are fantastic! I have had an original pair of ghds for years & was quite happy with them. However, when I began to notice they weren't working quite so well I decided to invest in these. They are expensive but I can see why, they really work! I have very thick, frizzy, generally hard to tame hair, which rarely stays straight for more than a couple of hours, but these make it look sleek & smooth very easily & it stays that way all day! Plus it doesn't feel dry or damaged like it did after using the old ghds. Can't recommend these enough, they really are worth the money!",
