The happy faces on them is a nice touch. Quality is solid. I think these will last for a very long time. I use these to save leftovers and also to save \u201cwater for later.\u201d Check out my video of the leak-proof test. It totally works if you find the right size for the right container. Trickier with rectangular containers, but doable. It takes forever to dry if you don\u2019t lay it out correctly on the drying rack though.",

I find it difficult to cover and uncover while keeping the container/bowl perfectly flat. So, for foods - perfect. for liquids - not so much. (That why just the 4 stars, rather than 5)",

Also, when using cellophane, bowls with chopped onions or garlic (for example) - you can still smell that in the refrigerator or on the counter. With stretch lids, no more smell! Stretch lids are made for round containers, and don't work well with oblong or square containers -so I still use ClingWrap for some things.",

Also-- and I guess I didn't measure my bowls ahead of time so this is partially my mistake-- this set only reallly fits things ranging in size from approximately a juice glass to a small-medium size bowl.
