When I finished the set up, I was told that the drivers had been unsuccessfully installed, and that I needed to contact the company. I ignored this and went ahead and tried to print a sheet and was successful. My main complaint is that the printer arrived without a power chord. I was lucky in that the power and USB chords from the old printer fitted. Just be aware that while the ad says \"power chord included\", this may not be the case.",

      "text": "The Canon Pixma MP 160 printer is a fairly convenient printer and prints quickly. It lacks the ability to copy documents more than one page at a time, since you must place the item to be copied flat on the document screen prior to copying. However having a flat document screen does make it easier to copy a page from a book or magazine that can't be done easily on some other printers. The color copying is very good, and the colors are clear and seldom need adjusting. I received this printer in used \"very good\" condition and it works fine.",

Not bad when you look at more current models cartridges, that cost the same or more, and only print about 160 pgs. Not the greatest printer in the world (the scanner was pretty bad), but IMO, not the worst either.",

    "description": "This no-compromise Photo All-In-One lets you get more done, right at home. You'll print beautiful, long-lasting photos, along with copies that are truer to your originals' images and text. The unique Z-Lid lets you produce clear, complete scans even of thick originals like personal notebooks. You can even print photos directly from a PictBridge compatible camera or DV camcorder--no computer required!\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Canon PIXMA MP160 All-In-One Photo Printer lets you print, copy and scan photos and documents quickly and easily. Whether working from the home office, helping a child with his/her school project or simply printing out pictures from a family trip, Canon provides solutions that satisfies consumers' preferences in look, feel, design and functionality. \n\n\n\nThe PIXMA MP160 All-In-One Photo Printer lets you print, copy and scan photos and documents quickly and easily. View larger. \n\nThis printer makes it easy to print and share digital photos at home. \n\nWith a sleek, slanted design featuring rounded corners and a space-saving low profile, the stylish MP160 livens up any home or small business office. As more and more consumers begin to familiarize themselves with the benefits of a multi-function unit for the home, the demands go beyond just having the best technology. Ease of use and reliability have come to the forefront. The MP160 is designed to be extremely user friendly while delivering optimum results time and time again. Fast, Reliable Home Printing\nThe MP160 is a system that lets you get more done, right at home. It allows you to print beautiful, long-lasting photos, along with copies that are truer to your originals' images and text. The unique Z-Lid lets you produce clear, complete scans even of thick originals like personal notebooks. You can even print photos directly from a PictBridge compatible camera or DV camcorder -- no computer required! With home-office AIO printers becoming everyday household items and digital photography's popularity increasing by leaps and bounds, Canon has created a new generation of multi-function printers, like the MP160, that further link the photographic world to that of the home office. This multi-function unit harmonizes printing functionality and performance with imaging excellence and a sense of home decor/style, making it a great long term investment.\n\n This four-color printer, with true-pigmented black and high intensity color inks, is ideal for printing text, web pages and photos. Affordable and cost-efficient, the MP160 offers resolution as high as 4800 by 1200 color dots per inch (dpi) and the ability to copy up to 22 pages per minute (ppm) in monochrome and 17 ppm in color. Borderless photo printing is equally fast: 4 x 6 inch photos print in less than a minute. For added convenience, the MP160 also allows for printing photos without a PC, thanks to the PictBridge port.\n\n Sharp, Crisp Copying\nThe MP160 employs advanced copy technology to help give you vivid reproductions of original images and documents. Dual Color Gamut Processing Technology improves color accuracy by independently controlling brightness, hue, and other elements to make sure that there are minimal differences between the original and the copy. In addition, with Text and Image Separation Technology, the system can actually differentiate text from an image, making black text and fine lines darker and sharp. Now when black text appears over an image, the text on the following generations of copies can be virtually as clear as the first. These technologies plus hardware improvements in scanning and printing can help make a copy almost indistinguishable from the original.\n\n Quick and Easy Scanning\nThanks to the MP160's multiple capabilities, there's no need to purchase a separate scanner that will take up extra space in your office. Instead, you can rely on this compact unit to scan with a high resolution of up to 600 by 1200 dpi (optical) and 19,200 by 19,200 dpi (interpolated). With a 48-bit internal color depth and the capability to deal with documents up to 8.5 x 11.7 inches, the MP160 will give you professional results in minutes.\n\n ChromaLife100 Technology For Image Permanence\nThe MP160 uses the Canon ChromaLife100 system, including the FINE print head technology for great photo printing. When using select genuine Canon photo papers and inks, prints can resist fading for up to 100 years when stored in an archival quality photo album. The up to 100-year-lifespan rivals that of many traditional film based photos, long considered by consumers to be the benchmark for image permanence. Prints produced on Canon Photo Paper Pro with ChromaLife100-compatible inks have an up to 10-year gas fastness when exposed to open air. In addition, ChromaLife100 prints, when created using genuine Canon photo paper like Photo Paper Pro or Photo Paper Plus Glossy, have up to 30-year light fastness when displayed under glass.\n\n FINE Engineering and the Inkjet Nozzle\nLaunched globally by Canon in 1999, the Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) advanced print head technology is one of the keys to the impressive speed and high photo quality in Canon PIXMA photo all-in-one printers. Canon FINE uses a groundbreaking high-performance multi-nozzle print engine that ejects consistent and microscopic ink droplets. The results are high-resolution photos with detail and clarity in less time.\n\n The MP160 comes with a one-year limited warranty.\n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nPixma MP160 photo all-in-one, power cord, cartridges (PG-40 black, CL-41 color), easy setup instructions, document kit (setup software and user's guide CD-ROM, registration card, and cross sell sheet).",
