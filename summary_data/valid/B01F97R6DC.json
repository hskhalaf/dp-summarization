Bought this ball and am extremely impressed with the way it handles any type of lane. It fits my style of playing and has helped me to improve my game in a relatively short period of time. It's durable, does not scratch at all and looks as if it will run the gamut of anything I can literally throw at it. I can recommend this ball without exception!",
