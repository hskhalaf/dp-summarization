      "text": "Update: This lasted just shy of 3 yrs. Looking for a new memory foam mattress. This one finally failed. The support is gone. Starts out fine ,but like any other mattress my hips and shoulders are in pain when I wake. The hubby complains too. There is the dreaded hump forming in the middle. So this is an honest update. We basically are laying on the density foam within an hour of falling asleep. HARD on joints. So beware long term. Most of these reviews are for the first few months, but I felt like doing an update on someone who has slept in this for a few years. Disappointed, thought it would last longer.",

But the thing is, once you open the box, you will never able to put the mattress back to it. And UPS refused to take it unless you can vacuum it and put it into a box again(Which is not possible at all). So I contacted the Amazon customer service, I'm glad that they allowed me to keep this defeated mattress so I don't waste money on this thing... Overall, I'm very unhappy with this mattress... The Replacement works very well so I change my score as 4 star. The new one reached 13 inches after only 2 hours.",

It's a pretty firm mattress but still not uncomfortable for achy joints, etc. It dis not expand to the full 14 inches, more like 13. And the edges are softer so when you sit on the side you can kind of slide off. But honestly, this is a good mattress and worth the money spent. But don't get if you are expecting to sleep on a cloud.",

I've read the reviews a little bit more in depth and it appears that most people have issues with Queen sizes and up. This is an issue since i'm a tall man who requires enough length so that my feet don't hang off.

I'm sure there are nicer beds but I'm not willing to put 1,000s into it. This bed is a great deal. I currently have the queen and will buy the same bed in king when I get a bigger house. This is an amazing bed! I have had the bed over a year and it is so comfortable. I was sleeping on an older bed before but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one of these in the future for another room of the house.",

When you first set up the mattress and lay down on it you will feel how firm or hard the surface is.. oh but don't you worry, after a couple months the hardness of the mattress will fade away and if you're lucky enough to give a year or so of use you'll find yourself with terrible back pain in the mornings. This mattress caves-in in the middle leaving you with terrible back pain. Skip this one. Look for an alternative. Do research. I was unfortunate and read the good reviews only..don't make my mistake.",

My frame is custom, so I was able to adjust it (adding a shortened & ripped 2x10 on end beside the box) to account for this, but this could be a problem if you have a factory frame.
