      "verdict": "For a silhouette from Vans that has been prominent for about 40 years, it only proves that the Old Skool can still be a relevant piece, despite being donned in varying colors and profiles. The Old Skool Platform carries the same silhouette as its predecessor.The thick rubber outsole gives an emphasis this time which proves that thicker is bolder. This slight change not only upgrades the sneaker's style game but also enhances its comfort and durability.",
      "pros": [
        "Several of those who have purchased the Vans Old Skool Platform find the thickness of the sole perfect",
        "The Vans Old Skool Platform is an excellent spin on the classic Old Skool, one online commenter has observed",
        "One who has used these for skating says that it provides the right amount of balance",
        "Compared to the Chuck Taylors, these hold up better mainly because of the thicker sole, one of the testers have said",
        "Because of the added height, it exudes a narrower silhouette, which is preferred by a reviewer",
        "A couple of buyers think that the platform version is better than the regular sole",
        "Few have observed that despite the thick sole, it remains to be lightweight",
        "One mentions that these are more comfortable than the regular Vans Old Skool",
        "Some users highly appreciate the colorway because it doesn't show up dirt quickly"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "One wishes that there are extra shoelaces that come with the shoe",
        "A high number complain about the shoe falling apart for only a short period of use",
        "Many users hope that there are more colorways available for the platform version of the Vans Old Skool"
