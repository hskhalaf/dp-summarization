The microcontrast seems to be better on the G series lens when shooting high key shots at the same aperture. I like both lenses because sometimes I want natural flare in my shots but when I don't I slap on the G series.",

After reading some articles on the internet... the one that made the decision for me was where they were both tested for sharpness on the D800e. they were almost identical. I can still use my 77mm filters with a step-up ring, have not noticed and bad shaped bokeh.. so im very happy with my purchase. This lens make for an AMAZING portrait lens. I am using in on a D610.",

I was mostly concerned about the build quality as I've read reviews claiming it feels like plastic. I don't find this to be the case - the lens is not heavy but definitely does not feel cheap in my hands. Paired with a normal-sized DSLR (I use it on my D7100), the result is a perfectly balanced, not too heavy but not flimsy feel. Love shooting with this and the results are amazing.",

There is a difference in comparing the two in their rendering at more open apertures with my preference toward the f/1.4G. That said, the f/1.8G is wonderfully sharp across its range and once stopped down to apertures that you would use for landscapes, there is no perceivable difference between the two. Considering the vast difference in price between the two, one can only have love for this lens.",

      "text": "Just bought these today. The shipping was superfast (Placed order at 12:30 A.M and it was at doorstep by 10:30 in the morning..same day). I have Nikon D5100 which I am replacing with Nikon D7100 soon. I also own the 50 mm 1.8 G and this lens was a natural upgrade for me. For the price, this lens produces some very sharp images. The color boundaries are very distinct and being a 1.8 G allows you to capture photos at low light levels. Overall, a very good purchase. A must have for enthusiasts.",

If desired, autofocus can be over-ridden by rotating the lens focus ring while the shutter-release button is pressed halfway (or, if the camera is equipped with an AF-ON button, while the AF-ON button is pressed). To refocus using autofocus, press the shutter-release button halfway or press the AF-ON button again. The fast maximum aperture of f/1.8 performs brilliantly under any lighting conditions and delivers beautiful, natural background blur that brings out the best in any subject.
