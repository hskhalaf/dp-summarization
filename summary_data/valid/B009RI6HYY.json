Also sturdy enough for coaches to sit on with players. One of us was was north of 200 pounds so it definitely can take some weight. Set up and tear down are super easy and quick. Nice carry bag to put it in for lugging to and from field. One of my friends bought the same one after seeing mine to use when camping around the fires at night. Works great for that too.",

Otherwise, my daughter and her white shorts would've been sitting on wet grass before trying to play soccer in the mud. Sturdy. Held up to 6 players that are about 100lbs each and a grown adult at 120lbs at one time. Plenty of space to put sports bags underneath, and they didn't fly over like the expandable benches with the backs. The pack folds up super easy- one person can handle set up and closing it down. The carrying case holds like a foldable chair.",

The first time I picked it up by the straps, they both tore. Can't use the cover to carry the bench and that makes it awkward to carry. If the cover wasn't garbage making it terribly awkward, I would have given the bench 5 stars.",

      "text": "We have used this bench for this current soccer season for two teams. The bench itself is holding up great. I love having the kids sitting up off the ground. We can put all the balls and bags behind the bench and it encourages the kids on the bench to focus on the game and cheer on their team mates.",
