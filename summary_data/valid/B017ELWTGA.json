These may be ok for stirring iced tea but not good for ice cream unless possibly half-melted soft serve. The handle near the rounded part is so thin, it feels like it will break if you put pressure on it. I do not recommend these spoons for anything more than stirring. This spoon is the middle one pictured, decide for yourself. Would give it 3 stars if I purchased this for stirring, 2 stars off because of the thinness of the handle as seen in my photos but not shown accurately in the sellers.",
