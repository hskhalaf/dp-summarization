      "text": "I have a 38\" waste so I bought the large size which turned out to be perfect. The belt is wider than I expected which is a good thing and provides excellent back and stomach support. It is well made and very sturdy. I like the velcro system of tightening rather than a belt buckle as it allows me to easily and quickly adjust the tightness to any level. My only concern is will the velcro gradually lose its fastening capability over time - a common problem with velcro fasteners that get heavy use. Time will tell. Other than that this belt is exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price.",

The support and flexibility this belt offers is great though when performing Olympic lifts. I ordered a large belt, as I have a 34-36 waist, and unfortunately it's a little big. Which has become more noticible as I've shed a couple of pounds. If you're inbetween sizes I'd recommend going down in size. I plan on buying another belt from this company in a medium size. I don't think you can go wrong with the quality of this belt.",

However, transporting these heavy leather belts can be a pain. So I wanted to see if I could find another belt that is easier to pack in my gym bag but still provides the needed support during my workouts. Thus far, I think this belt is the answer. The velcro held\u200b better than I expected and provided the perfect cinch or size. Good purchase. A bonus that the company is family-owned and veteran-operated; as a military veteran, I love this!",
