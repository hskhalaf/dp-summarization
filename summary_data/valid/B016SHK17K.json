AM cream is good ***Warning*** When using the PM regimen- start very slow- use less than one pump the first time and gradually build up if it's working for you. benzoyl peroxide is strong stuff and it took me a week to recover",

    "title": "DualCare Acne Treatment System: Organic Tea Tree Oil and 3% Benzoyl Peroxide Lotions.",
    "description": "dualosophy's dualcare is a next-generation anti-acne regimen that provides deep-pore delivery of 3% Benzoyl Peroxide in combination with organic Tea Tree Oil. This two-component kit, which consists of a morning (AM) and nighttime (PM) regimen, works synergistically to eliminate acne while moisturizing and nourishing the skin, day and night. By physically separating the Benzoyl Peroxide, which is oxidizing, and Tea Tree Oil, an anti-oxidant, dualcare overcomes the inherent instability that results when the two are mixed together. Furthermore, by incorporating benzoyl peroxide into the PM regimen, dualcare effectively eliminates the photosensitivity concern associated with Benzoyl Peroxide and the burdensome requirement for co-application of sunscreen. Fight acne day and night with dualcare. Great for adult acne or adolescent acne.",
