This hole developed with less than 3 months of light household/kitchen use. It is cleaned upon emptying every 2 days or so, which includes filling with soapy water, and using a kitchen sponge to remove any film from the inside. The warranty is only for 30 days, for a $30 item.",

Supposedly you can buy compostable bags, but that's another step and more to decompose that I'd rather not deal with.",
