When we got to Halo 3 Bungie stopped remastering because I guess they thought it was good enough. The problem is in Halo 3 local co-op splitscreen mode is letterboxed and is annoyingly small, even on a 75\" 4K display - boo. Aside from that we love it.",

Most of the data is downloaded. Not much seems to be actually one the disk which is kinda surprising. I tend to think they should have used more disks in the box and then added things to the install.

While the older games are fun to play as a throwback and the story mode is perfect, the online version of the game does not work as it should. This does not have to do with the seller, but it has to do with the actual game and the makers of the game. I would recommend waiting for a new updated version when all of the bugs are fixed out of the game so that you get exactly what you're paying for when you buy a game as awesome as Halo.",
