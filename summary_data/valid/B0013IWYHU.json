Customer support acknowledges problems with many squeezebox units due to the latest software update -- they need to fix it!! I would not recommend this product to anyone, its pricey, the software is buggy, the unit just doesnt work and customer support is ill equipped to address issues..",

The setup was a breeze, and controlling my library and internet radio stations is virtually lag-free and completely painless. Added android/iOS support is a nice bonus (the apps also happen to work well too). Whaddayaknow, sometimes tech companies get it almost totally right...only minor complaint is the build quality of the remote - feels a bit on the light side, and that battery door is also a tad squishy, but really no big deal.",
