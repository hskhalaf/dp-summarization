Initially had trouble installing but it was alignment, then just needed a good push and it wound right in place. These had the double seal like in the pictures, and like some have said the hole is a bit larger than the oem one. No leaks. Working well. And do run a gallon or so through it. You can see the powder debris in the first few cups of water. Then all is clear.",

I purchased these filters last week, removed about a gallon and a half and I'm very happy with the outcome. My two main concerns were water quality and the rate at which the water dispensed. I've bought a 'knock off' brand in the past and though the water tasted fine, it seemed to take forever to fill a glass. From my experience with the Icepure filter, water tastes just fine and it dispenses like the Samsung filter did. So in my opinion, a great buy for the price.",

      "text": "This refrigerator water filters works great! Just as well as the more expensive brands, and for less. Instructions make it seem that the old filter can be easily removed by grasping it and turning with your hands. But my experience with this an other filters was that I needed pliers to turn/remove the old filter. This is NOT a defect of the product, just difficult to remove without pliers. I recommend this filter!",

It was worth a shot, but I would not recommend unless you are hard of hearing.",
