      "text": "I had previously bought the TR8 in a different color from Nike website and loved them. I was looking for a black sneaker and was glad to find these. Pretty much the only place I could find them. These are MEN'S shoes and they do run a bit small. I wear a 9 or 9.5 in Women's Nike. I have 2 pairs of the TR8 in both a MEN'S 8 and 8.5. Both fit but I prefer the 8.5. The two white collegiate pair I have are holding up well in spite of throwing them is the washer and letting them air dry.",

They are also stylish enough for daily wear around town. The Free Train V8 is really a shoe for everything, I am very pleased with them! If you need a very good shoe that you can do any type of excercise with, look no further!",

This pair has fallen apart the fastest. I'll repeat myself i have always bought Nike shoes but this will be the last pair i buy because their quality has gone down. What a shame if it wasnt for the soles coming unglued so easily I'd still only buy nikes since i love their shoes...... well i did. If you get these add some shoeglue to your cart you'll need it.",
