Some out there don't understand why the right ear-bud has a longer lead cord than the left. The right ear-bud wraps BEHIND your neck. Some of us don't like having cords dangling down both sides of our face. If that's you, these are the right choice.",

I can word in the yard, workout, or whatever and there is no interference between the cords and whatever my hands are doing because the cords go down my back instead of hanging out front. The tone is very good and the middle sized earbuds fit better than any other that I have tried. If I loose these I would definitely buy another pair.",

      "text": "These headphones sound fantastic for the price; most noticeably they can produce a nice degree of bass, something which most sub-$50 seem to totally miss. However they do feel pretty fragile and are prone to tangling. The cable for the right earphone is also longer, designed to go over the shoulder from the left side and some may not like this style though it seems better for running, exercise etc.",
