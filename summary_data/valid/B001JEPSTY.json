So, I would suggest if you are having trouble, ensure your electrical connection is firmly in place. We've purchased this brand of heated mattress pads several times in the past, and the pads help us reduce heating costs in our house with high ceilings. The mattress pads are very comfortable, but they usually last about 2 years maximum, which is acceptable but not great.",

I turned on some \"white noise\" to try and mask the sound, but unless I had the volume way up, I could still hear the buzzing.

As far as we can tell they are manufactured by the same company and this one is much less expensive. The sleep number pad lasted for 5 years before we wore it out with multiple washes. This warming pad performs every bit as well as the old one. In fact, the old one had discolored electrical wires from using the high heat setting. This pad does not have that issue. The transformers do not make any noise as other customers have mentioned. Very happy with our purchase.",

    "title": "SoftHeat | Smart Heated Electric Mattress Pad with Safe & Warm Low Voltage Technology, Dobby Stripe, King, White",
    "description": "Size:King| Style Name:Dobby StripeWe\u2019ve designed a safe and incredibly soft electric mattress pad that not only warms your bed, but also rejuvenates it. Due to the all over penetrating warmth of this low-voltage mattress pad, you\u2019ll start saving money on your energy bill while lowering your thermostat. The 233 thread-count 80% poly/20% cotton dobby stripe shell is incredibly soft, soothing and supportive. Constructed within the pad is the patented Safe & Warm low-voltage technology. This low-voltage mattress pad includes a small power supply box that changes 120 volt AC home current into non-hazardous low voltage DC current (very similar to a battery) to provide warmth, protection and safety even if the pad becomes wet. Unlike other warming pads with their thick bulky wires, the heating wires in the Soft Heat pads are so small, they are virtually unnoticeable. During construction we place the ultra thin wires 3-inches apart and evenly distribute them from head to toe. The benefit to you is a pad that gives more of an even heat and has no annoying hot or cold spots. The king size pad is divided in two separate zones and comes standard with two easy to read, easy to turn, non-slip computerized controllers to adjust the temperature of each side of the bed giving individual comfort and control. For cozy sheets before bed time, it has an automatic pre-heat and hold feature. You simply turn it on and the pad will warm up on HI until it reaches the temperature that you pre set your dial on, and then adjusts itself to hold it there. For your safety convenience and power conservation, it has an automatic shut off feature that will shut the pad off after 10 hours just in case you forget. It also comes standard with built in over-temperature protection for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind. On the controller, a giant backlit display with auto dimming feature provides more convenience for night time adjustments with out having to turn on the lights. A fitted skirt keeps it all in place.
