I have an ear for music (thanks to many years of being in band class), and have struggled with good sound quality in headphones or earbuds. I finally bit the bullet and ordered these Bose headphones, and think it may have been the best purchase I've made this year. You cannot beat the quality of Bose listening devices. The carrying case also makes it easy to pack up and take with you. These are not noise canceling, but the way the earphones cover your ears makes them do a good job of canceling noise anyway. No need to spend extra on the noise canceling varieties.",

I have to turn my music up kinda loud to really enjoy the sound. Also if you turn the music up sort of loud other people will be able to hear your music. If you are someone who enjoys booming bass like I do these headphones don't really do the job. They're decent but if they were to break I probably would not replace them with another pair.",

Much more comfortable than the Beats I bought the first time. I wear glasses, and the Beats hurt after awhile. Not these.",

I was proven wrong these sound way better then the around the ear set and they do a great job of blockIng outside noise. If I could do it over again I would have purchased two sets of on the ear instead of one around the ear and one on the ear.",

One criticism which can't be ignored though: as you raise the volume, these become a high quality set of *speakers*. They don't hold sound in and are not good for privacy. I intended to use these at the office but I can't. Luckily I have a use for them at home.",

It could just be that my head is too big, but just want to give you guys some heads-up. It seems that you can't adjust the width. So if you are not picky about sound quality, and you have a relatively small head (say compared to Asian guys), then this product is OK.",
