      "text": "To the reviewer who compared this camera to a smartphone mentioning megapixels and number of lenses - you forgot the single most significant difference between this camera and any smartphone camera - the sensor - which is about 8 times the size of the one in your smartphone! This camera is capable of taking absolutely superb professional grade photos. The lens is also one of the sharpest you can find on any camera or amongst any prime lens. Combine all of this with a leaf shutter and tiny proportions of the camera as a whole and you have something that leaves any smartphone camera in the dust.",

      "text": "Really small but really comfortable to hold. 28mm eqv. takes a little getting used to; not super-wide, but a noticeable jump from 35mm. DNG raw files are easy to work with but don't have huge range for recoving shadows or pulling back highlights. B&W output is excellent. A lovely tool to carry in a pocket and extremely quick and satisfying in hand.",

Beside this, I think this is a perfect DC, it has the best operation, small body to put in pockets, and good quality because of the aps-c sensor!

    "description": "Style Name:Camera OnlyThis new model combines compact dimensions - perfect for snapshot photography on the street - with high-quality, high-resolution images delivered by a large image sensor, equal in size to the one installed on PENTAX digital SLR cameras. It also provides a range of smartphone-support functions, including wireless image transfer and remote shooting.Developed as the next generation of our highly acclaimed GR series, the GR II inherits the product concept of the GR series: a perfect balance between exceptional image quality and outstanding portability. It is also the first GR-series model to feature Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) functions for easy pairing with smartphones and other mobile devices. It provides outstanding basic specifications, including: a high-performance lens, acclaimed to be the best in GR history; a large, APS-C-size CMOS image sensor; the high-performance GR ENGINE V imaging engine. Its imaging power has been further upgraded by reprogramming the white-balance algorithm to improve the precision of AWB (Auto White Balance) control and fine-tuning the compensation program to prevent high-sensitivity noise. It is designed to accommodate a wider variety of scenes and subjects by adding new creative tools, such as six effect modes and a wireless flash discharge function in combination with an external flash unit.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nRicoh GR II Digital Camera, Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery (DB-65), USB Power Adaptor, USB Cable, Software CD-ROM, Hand Strap, Hot Shoe Cover",
