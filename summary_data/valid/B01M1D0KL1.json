Your viewing angle needs to be looking pretty close to straight at it. But that is okay with me. What I did to ensure this was not a problem I ordered a tilt wall mounting stand ($10.00.) This way it is easy to adjust screen for perfect viewing. Also, I am really surprised more people haven't bought this TV if you're looking for something around 16 inches you can't beat the price.

One complaint would be the location of the HDMI plug input is in a very awkward location behind the TV stand which makes it difficult to plug-in and requires a bit of a bend on the cable. A more flexible HDMI cable will solve that (or a 90-degree adapter). I just did not have one handy. .",

The output volume barely changes through its range and should be relabeled less horrible->horrible. Actually I believe it would be difficult to design a sound system this bad. And because the whole design centered around size the thought of adding auxiliary speakers to compensate is silly. The setup experience is among the worst I've ever encountered. Terminology is not defined. There are controls the remote that don't appear to do anything. The Good: Cheap and acceptable picture quality You get what you pay for. Basically it's junk.",
