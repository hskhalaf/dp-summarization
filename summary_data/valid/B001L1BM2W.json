The label does say the Welactin Liquid had more Omega 3s than the capsules, but the product information of the liquid does not say how much more, except it is more than twice the cost of the salmon oil. I had to prick open and squeeze the capsules on my dog's food, because she didn't like the consitency of chewing the gel cap. So I will be looking for a liquid with a pump in the future.",
