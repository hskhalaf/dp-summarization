If you do buy them I encourage that you do a quick A/B test listening to your headphones plugged directly into your phone, and then the same audio from your phone via blue tooth to the Trond receiver and then to your headphones. You will immediately hear how much of the highs are muted and distorted amongst an overall sound degradation. I bought 2 of these units at once and both have the same problem, so it's not just a single bad unit. I've had other similar Bluetooth transmitter that work fine but these have noticeably bad audio quality.",

Even after pairing, these device/transmitter will do that same dance every time you try to turn them back on and reconnect. Waste of your time.

The reason I bought this, however, is for gaming with bluetooth headphone. This device supports apt-x low latency that minimizes the audio lag. To fully take advantage of this feature, your other device (headphone in my case) should also support apt-x low latency, otherwise TROND will fall back to other codecs.",
