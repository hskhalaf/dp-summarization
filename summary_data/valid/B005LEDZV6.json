Instead, it was immediately clear as soon as I removed the carousel from it's box that the outer body was covered in some sort of plastic, wood colored, wood patterned laminate. It's pretty brazen, because even the box it comes in says \"Wooden Carousel\" but there's no being fooled once you view and handle the item itself.",
