They run true to size (I'm a 6-6 1/2 and the 6 1/2 fit perfect) and feel like walking on clouds. I am petite, so I appreciated the slight height of the platform style and the cut is very flattering--kind of makes your foot and your legs appear longer and slimmer. I have had strangers stop me to compliment me on these shoes!",
