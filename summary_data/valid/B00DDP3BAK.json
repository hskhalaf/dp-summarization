I ended up rolling my jacket up and using that as a pillow instead of this - this is not real camping gear. This is yuppie trash.",

Perfect size, comfy, really pretty and well made, good quality and everything I hoped it would be. You can easily take the case off for washing and the bag it comes in is easy to carry, doesn't take up much room, and the pillow slides in and out easily. I will probably buy another one because it's so good. It saved my life in Alaska and gave me great nights sleep. The quality of the fabric and pillow is outstanding and very durable.",
