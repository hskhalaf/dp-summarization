Second surge started tearing so bought a blaze since the bands could be replaced. The battery just died less than 14 months and fitbit has no repair option.

I wear the watch most of the time, except while showering or near any moisture. Just recently, I had developed a small skin allergy (itching) at the corner of my wrist from the band. I contacted Fitbit, was given a case # and was told a Rep. will call me back....I STILL WAITING! My first call, I told them I love the product; however, do they have a hypoallergenic band (cloth?), especially during sleep-time. STILL WATING! I'd like to use my watch.",

Have lost four pounds in thirty days primarily by just meeting my step goal daily. The only negative I have is I can't sleep with it on, have tried but with no success, so I'm not using the sleep tracking feature. Otherwise I have no complaints. Five stars from me.",

      "text": "I must say that this watch is pretty slick. Not a lot of extras but everything you need in a fitness tracker. I own a gym and am recommending our clients purchase fit bit products. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is the extra step involved in getting to some of the info. for example, depending on the screen, you will have to tap a couple of times to see your heart rate, when you are not exercising. Overall, great product and worth buying. I would recommend this to anyone interested in keeping track of daily stats and real time exercise stats.",

In less than two years, battery charge lasted less than 24 hours and therefore could not track/use sleep tracking features. FitBit advised watch could NOT be fixed. They offered 25% discount on A new watch but only if purchased on their website at full MSP. So bottom line is good watch but expect to replace after 1 year when warranty ends. Hope this helps.",
