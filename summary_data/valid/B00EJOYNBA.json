Fortunately for us (unfortunately for the review) we have not had any spills or accidents. Sadly we had to euthanize our 15yr old dog, which is why we bought this item originally. So unless we sit for some friends that have a dog w/ a weak bladder we probably won't be able to evaluate the resistance to liquids. Overall I would recommend this product simply to protect your mattress from excessive perspiration (hot nights no air conditioning) this thing is perfect.",

I do recommend buying two so you have a little time to wash and dry before you need it again.",

This one is great - there is not clammy feel or extreme heat retention, which makes sleeping on it more comfortable. There has been no reason to launder it yet, but I'm confident it will do very well in the washer and dryer. Also, it fit his extra long mattress snugly without being hard to put on. Update - After two months use and many washings, this mattress protector is proving how good it is. It is soft, not clammy, and washes and dries without any problems.",

However, it does fit very nicely, it's not hot from the plastic lining, it isn't noisy when you move around on it due to the plastic backing. So although I was expecting one much thicker, I have to say this one seems to serve the purpose of protecting my mattress while fitting appropriately and being comfortable.",
