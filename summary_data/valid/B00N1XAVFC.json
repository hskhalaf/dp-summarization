I would like to replace the cedar Shelves with the trays/drawers however from NewAir they are $40 each, it would be cheaper to buy a better quality unit that already came with them. So far the unit works, quality control is garbage though, i would consider this purchase a bit of a gamble with your money.",

I suspect when summer is finally here, it will keep the temperature around 65\u00b0 F. Otherwise, it seems well made and works as advertised. The hygrometer is pretty close to dead-on using my calibrated digital hygrometer. Lots of room, too. Inside light is not overly useful as it\u2019s in the \u201cceiling\u201d and can\u2019t shine through the shelves. I use a flashlight if I want to look inside.",

      "text": "Excellent unit. I had a larger NewAir as a humidor, and needed a smaller one for overflow. Very quiet, lightweight and holds humidity perfectly. My active humidifier(hydra) rarely comes on, yet the humidity is properly maintained. The only thing preventing a 5 star is the hygrometer is worthless. It is cheap and was way off. I used a calibration kit, but it still won't accurately read. To be honest I knew I would have to replace it anyway. However, with such a nice unit, they should consider upgrading the hygrometer. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a humidor. The temperature control will eliminate the threat of tobacco beetles infesting your collection.",
