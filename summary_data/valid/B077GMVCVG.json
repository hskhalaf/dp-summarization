    "title": "Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Heat and Humidity Gel, 8.5 Fl oz",
    "description": "Humidity: It's every curl's nightmare. That's because curly hair's unique structure exposes its cuticle. When humidity gets in, curls expand with unwanted volume and look frizzy, undefined, and dull. Use Advanced Climate Control Heat & Humidity Gel to seal every strand, lock in moisture, and lock out humidity. Wheat Protein and pliable styling polymers form a weightless flexible lattice that expands as heat or humidity rises to hold curl definition without frizz. This high-performance Anti-Frizz Nano Technology with a protein derived from silk seals the cuticle to keep essential moisture in and humidity out. A dedicated UV filter helps protect against damage from environmental aggressors. The result: Flexible hold that won't leave hair crunchy, sticky, or weighed down. Frizz-free, perfectly defined curls-in any climateDivide damp hair into sections. Rake a nickel-size amount of gel through each section, using fingertips to seal and smooth the cuticle from roots to ends. When finished, hold the ends of hair in each section and shake to create curls. Let hair air-dry or blow-dry with a diffuser.\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua (Water), Butylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-28, Sericin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Lawsonia Inermis (Henna) Extract, Wheat Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein/PVP Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Panthenol, Polyquaternium-7, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Hexylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum (Fragrance), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool.
