Well if I've learned anything when buying from the internet, read the ingredients/formula because the slightest variation can make all the difference in the world.",

The soap lasts 6-8 weeks for me which provides excellent value. It's also a bonus that this is a family-owned company which does a good using quality, safe ingredients.

Our Story: Sofi Tucker started selling Shea Nuts at the village market in Bonthe, Sierra Leone in 1912. By age 19, the widowed mother of four was selling Shea Butter, African Black Soap and her homemade hair and skin preparations all over the countryside. Sofi Tucker was our Grandmother and SheaMoisture is her legacy. With this purchase you help empower disadvantaged women to realize a brighter, healthier future.
