More complicated to have my electrician install, requiring 40 amps and with quite negative reviews - especially reliability - I went on Amazon to see what else I could find. The TurboCord looked like a possibility. In checking their website, I found it only requires 20 amps which in my older house meant a great savings in wiring. Voile ! I have not had one bit of trouble with a failed charge or blown circuit on 20 amps. I'm also charging in 3.3 hrs just as promised.",

Charge times are faster than the ETA on the dash, and if you understand common NEMA 240v wiring, installing a plug at a friend's house takes a matter of minutes. In sub freezing weather I had problems with the charger, it would charge for only a few minutes before giving up. I took the charger inside and after a few minutes the ice melted and found water to be dripping out of the cracks in the plastic. This was concerning, but after drying, the charger continued to work and still does months later.",

I now have a similar problem with the replacement plug which will require me talking to customer service then to technical support and likely to replace the cord and mail the old cord back.

If you're providing screws, a pair of pre-drilled holes wouldn't be the end of the world. But honestly, that's such a minor thing.

      "text": "Charges my Volt in about 3.5 to 4 hours. Make sure you get the 240 Volt wall unit plug and check the circuit breaker to make sure the Wattage drain is not too strong which could cause a fire. You may require a larger breaker on your electrical panel but it's a small price to pay for this exceptional unit. HIGHLY Recommended if you want FAST charging at your home.",
