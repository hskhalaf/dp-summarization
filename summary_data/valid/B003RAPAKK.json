The Echo Pen plugs right into your computer with a standard micro USB cable (which makes it easy if you have to replace it). The audio is great, I've recorded a ton of lectures, concerts, and even a few stand-up comedy shows. The best use by far is for Studying though. You can upload your notes and corresponding audio to your computer. and if you want, you can even convert your handwritten notes to text! amazing, especially considering that you can pay the same amount or more for a pen that does none of this!",
