Since we switch around 4 of our favorite kinds we knew it wasn't any of them but once we switched to Blue Basics Salmon and Sweet potato it took two weeks and she was back to her old self! Her hair has since grown back in and the constant itching has stopped (thank God). And her smell is back to normal also.",
