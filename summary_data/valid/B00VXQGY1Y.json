Now after 2 weeks use, I love Ghee in my coffee, & cooking with it is easy. Found my keeper.",

In that sense, it is very similar to organic valley's ghee butter. I liked this ghee and will come back to it from time to time but will be using another brand for my go-to needs.",

    "description": "Size:9 Ounce (Pack of 1)Fourth and Heart's grass-fed ghee is very lightly salted and gently whipped to add flavor to just about anything. Ghee is a type of clarified butter that is heated, reduced & triple-filtered out and what you\u2019re left with is the pure healthy fat, which is lactose free & dairy free, good for digestion and metabolism. It is an iconic ingredient and food staple with a history as rich as its taste. It originates in India and is used extensively in cooking and to promote health. Ghee alone is an excellent alternative to butter for those who are lactose intolerant and who want the taste of butter, without the disadvantages of processed margarines. Unlike other oils it is rich in butyric acid, a short chain fatty acid that is great for your overall health and digestion. Ghee\u2019s buttery taste and high smoke point (485 degrees) makes it an excellent addition to your everyday cooking oils, is extremely easy to cook with and delicious simply spread on a piece of toast. Fourth & Heart grass-fed ghee uses the highest quality grass-fed butter sourced from a cooperative of farms in New Zealand. Grass is naturally high in Vitamin A, D, E, K and CLA. When the cow\u2019s milk is rich with these vitamins it goes directly to the butter and therefor the ghee. Replace your everyday butter & oil with 100% Grass-Fed Pure Spreadable Butter. Please note: ghee naturally melts at approximately 90-degrees farenheit, which can occur during transit and delivery. This is perfectly normal and will not damage the ghee, which will resolidify if left at room temperature or refrigerated for 2-3 hours.
