I bought a table cloth (vinyl top/cloth underside) to give it a more garden look. I would definitely consider buying another one. This is a very good buy for the money.

He is happy I am happy so it's great! I think I may have to purchase another just to have when we have cookouts it would be perfect for that as well.

I've used wood and wire to stabilize it. And although better, it's still not good enough to stop the wobble completely. I currently use the table as a shelf. I put boxes and stuff on top and underneath it. That's all it's good for really, other than using it for a picnic, I suppose. So the moral of the story; get a proper computer desk if you need a computer desk :D",

      "text": "My table arrived early this morning (about 12 hours before the promised delivery date), and I am thrilled. There was zero assembly required: Just open the box, pull out, unfold, then unfold the legs, use your foot to the bar nearest the floor in prep to pull up on the ends of the table, adjust via the silver push bottoms on the legs, and you\u2019re all set. Couldn\u2019t be easier. The table folds easily, and has a canvas carrying handle. It is weighty and very sturdy and stable. Great value. Great price too.",

The bad thing is that, on it's shortest level, the table is not high enough to be of any practical use as a table. The center and high adjustments are fine, I would say the center adjustment is a normal table height. The problem is that when you fold it to put it away, you can only do so at the lowest setting. So every time you go to put it away an open it up to use again, you have to adjust the legs, which is a bit of a pain in the you know what.",

The shortest two positions are close to each other then you have two other settings that are rather far apart.

      "text": "We needed a folding table for my husband to use while working from home during COVID 19. However, I am finding so many uses for this table. For starters, we have found the following uses so far: Game table, portable desk, outdoor BBQ table, sewing/craft table, rummage sale table, and extra seating table, just to name a few. I love the fact that it folds in half for easy storage and portability, it's fairly lightweight, and has an adjustable height of 22\", 29\" or 36\".",
