I did find the color I picked out way too YELLOW. I got the bamboo beige and would definitely choose a different color next time. I doubt I'll rebuy it though. I just found one I like MUCH better and it's nowhere near the price. It's called Bella Mari...all natural and is so moisturizing...best for normal to dry skin though.",
