It's not that hard to fold back the tent after 2 try. Just make sure you are holding all parts correctly. Opening the tent is very easy. The zipper on the back of the tent is nice too. You can unzip it if you want air to blow through. Or if the kids are playing hide and seek. The hold thing is not heavy.",

I added that myself and really like the results. Always gets peoples attention and makes our weekly beach trips way better. Self contained atmosphere so no matter how busy the beach is you get privacy.",

The description of this product stated that it was a four man tent. We could only fit two adults comfortably. Maybe you can fit 4 kids/teens. The directions to fold the tent back up and into the carrying case were not clear. We had to shove it in the trunk of the car to come home and try to figure it out the next day by watching the vidoe. It would be nice to have clearer step by step instructions.",

I bought this to replace another tent that broke when the pop-up mechanism wouldn't release and one of the poles snapped. Don't have to worry about that with this one and it truly was easy to take down. It's also light so easy to carry. It easily fits two beach chairs and it's deep, so there is room for bags, etc. behind the chairs. Very happy with this purchase.",
