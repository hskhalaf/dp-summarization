      "text": "So if you compare this car seat to the track contender, it\u2019s a lot more compact but it does have more room around my son. The recline options are really good because my son doesn\u2019t want to be at a angle anymore and wants to sit upright so even though he\u2019s rear facing, his car seat isn\u2019t extending the head area, to the the center console. It seems like he has more room around his arms and legs and is much more comfortable. This car seat also has new born inserts so I high recommend this car seat over the others. Even the deluxe. It really does help people with smaller SUVs",

However the seat is really easy to install and a heckuva lot easier to remove than all the other car seats I've owned. The anchors have buttons that you simply press and it releases. My daughter still uses the first backward facing setting but it appears fairly cozy. Love the fact that she won't need another seat for a long time, if ever. For the price, this has to be one of the best deals out there.",

This seat is comfortable for baby and front passenger. I gave it a 4 star rating because the straps can be hard to tighten if they are not evenly distributed.",

Extremely difficult to pull tight enough so that the car seat does not move more than an inch side to side. It is the lock mechanism on the strap that is poorly designed. Everything else is great rhough. Just be prepared to spend an hour just trying to get the seat tight enough where it actually feels secure.",

The buttons on the 5 point harness are comfortable for my arthritic fingers! My son liked this seat so much he purchased 2 for his cars! Would recommend.",

Easy to install and remove. I love the way the harness adjusts with the back of the carseat. Great little carseat.",

The slim design fits well in my vehicle. It\u2019s easy to install. The straps loosen and tighten so easily! And the push button used to adjust the shoulder strap height without having to rethread is a GAME CHANGER! I haven\u2019t found anything about it I don\u2019t like. Though I haven\u2019t had to wash it yet... but still, I\u2019m planning to eventually replace all of my car seats with this one. Skipping the infant carrier kind and going straight to a convertible like this one for any future babies!",

    "description": "Color:AnnabelleThe Graco Slim Fit All-in-One convertible car seat saves space in your backseat, while giving your child plenty of room to grow. The unique, rotating cup holders simply rotate away, making the seat 10% slimmer to save precious back seat space. It's a rear-facing (5-40 lb) and forward-facing (20-65 lb) car seat, as well as a belt-positioning booster (30-100 lb). The Simply Safe Adjust Harness System means you can easily adjust the harness and headrest together, to accommodate your growing child with ease. With 4-recline positions, you can keep your child comfortable, while the In Right Latch system makes installation easy with a one-second attachment. The seat is side-impact tested, and Safe Seat Engineered, giving you peace of mind. With all these great benefits, in a sleek space saving design, the Slim Fit is the perfect car seat. Note-Latch consists of lower anchors and top tether anchors, which are built-in to your vehicle, and connecting hooks that are built-in to your car seat. Lower anchors are used instead of the vehicle seat belt to secure the child seat to the vehicle. Top tethers are used in addition to the lower anchors or the vehicle\u2019s seat belt to secure a forward-facing car seat to the vehicle. Do not use the lower anchors of the child restraint anchorage system Latch system to attach this child restraint when restraining a child weighing more than 45 pounds with the internal harnesses of the child restraint. Harness straps may be spot cleaned. After reaching the maximum forward-facing weight and height, they also recommend that children 4 feet 9 inches tall or under should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat.",
