I do know that it survived falling off of the wall twice before I figured out how to install the suction cup. The written installation instructions are poor \u2014 watch the video on Amazon instead. Use all of your strength when rotating the base (NOT the mirror) to afix the suction cup to the wall. I suggest installing the base high and then positioning the mirror at a slight downward angle to keep it free of shower spray.",

The description implies it only will not stick if tile is very textured, but our tile is smooth with a slight texture and it wouldn't gip no matter what. Luckily, we have a glass wall on one side, and that sucker holds on for dear life to glass! The anti fog coating really works. Just do not wipe the mirror!",

      "text": "Likes: Lightweight, Clear good mirror image, stays fog free provided I don\u2019t keep hot water on for long which I don\u2019t usually do, good price and arrived quickly and in perfect condition. You may not like this one if you shave while taking long and hot showers, as it does fog up pretty quickly. Also, mirror image is not magnified. Neither of those two things bug me, but they might bug you. I use a shower caddy hanging from the shower spigot and just arrange the mirror appropriately on that, so I didn\u2019t attach suction gizmo, and so cannot comment on that feature. I\u2019d buy again given my simple needs and good price.",

      "text": "I love this mirror for a few reasons. 1.) The sticky part/adhesive sticks and you can actually lock it in there, in the month we've had it up in the shower it hasn't fallen once. 2.) It's very movable so you can push it off to the side and swivel it out when you need to use it. The four stars is because it does fog up sadly after the first use, but wiping it once with your hand will keep it pretty cleared up for the rest of the shower :) For the price and how convenient and well it worked, I would reccomend it.",
