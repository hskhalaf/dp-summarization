Hitting the product with a real golf ball makes it sway and spring around. 1b. Using the stakes to hold it down still doesn't keep it upright at ball impact. 2. I expected better customer support and service from Rukket. 2a. Shipping took forever regardless of prime shipping (3 weeks). 2b. I contacted Rukket about my order 3 weeks ago and still haven't received a response.",

And the bottom one if I want the ball to roll to the cup? If you come up with these tips, will you let me know? I'd like a copy.

Both are extremely flimsy and poorly made. The foam practice balls should have been the dead give-a-way... You can probably use real golf balls, but it doesn't look like it will stand up to prolonged practice.",

Just 2 little \"tent poles\" and your up and running. Takes literally 20 seconds. This is not picky and not a \"fault\" with the product but I do wish there were some little stakes or something to secure this. It will blow over if there as any sort of wind gust hitting the backside of the net. This is the only reason it isn't 5 stars. Would recommend this to friends",
