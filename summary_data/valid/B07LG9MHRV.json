Also the tray underneath which pulls out, has no easy stops or snaps to keep curious pups from pulling it out along with any absorbant pads you might want to use. some sort of velcro tabs to hold the grass on securely, and keep the drawer closed would make it much better. Also if the edge of the artificial grass was stitched or melted so it would not fray so easily, it would keep the masses of green \"blades\" from turning up all over the house and clogging up the vacuum cleaner and washing machine.",

If you cut a piece of news paper (several layers) in the drawer it keeps the urine from getting all over when you need to dump it. I found it sprays off well with the hose outside and simple green, cleaner. Just be sure to get all the cleaner off. The only reason I have to get another one, my ex threw out my old one. That one went thru over a year with my beloved Teddy Bear \u201cMarley,\u201d (my Westie yorkie he passed away \ud83d\ude2d), and over a year with my current yorkie.",
