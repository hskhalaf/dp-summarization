Upon the impact, one of the motors got disconnected, the drone has marks on it, and the propellers are scratched and bent. This is ridiculous considering the fact that it s a new drone, this drone probably has some defects. I hope no one goes through that.

The free Android app seems to function well as does the optional Flight Plan ($20) which allows you to pre-program flights with waypoints, etc. Pros: Compact and light No external gimbal to break Appealing design Apps are well written Cons: Image quality isn't as good as expected but is acceptable",
