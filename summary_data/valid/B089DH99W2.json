No instructions on what or how much chlorine to use. a lot of head scratching and googling still not much the wiser have had an additional fortune on various bit to go with it. Spend more money or wait a while and get a different pool. 2 very disappointed kids who have a full pool with no working pump and no idea of how much chemicals to put in. Not to mention a day wasted trying to work it all out. Very very very unhappy",

      "text": "This took me an hour to put up on my own, dead easy as long as you follow the instructions. Took all afternoon to fill up - but we have very low water pressure where I live. It's big enough to get 2 or three strokes in and for two lilos to bob around on it. Very good quality no scratches or nicks anywhere - and certainly no leaks - beyond pleased had great fun in this as it's deep enough to snorkle as a laugh. Couldn't be happier.",

So far in the 4 days I've had it ive had two adults, two 16 , one 14, two 5 , one 12 and one 2 year old in it almost constantly and two 14 and one 13 year old popping around for a dip. Well worth the money . Only wish I had bought the pool chemicals and the ground sheet before hand (but they are on their way) and the filter pump isn't that strong .",
