Let yourself get acclimated to it before drinking it and then, say, driving into work where there is one shared bathroom for your entire floor.

About 30 minutes after having my nightly cup I fall into a coma until my alarm goes off lol. Normally I can't sleep through the night but have been ever since starting Total Tea. My first day after drinking it I pooped my brains out but after that it's had no effect on my stomach. Highly recommend as a sleep aid; can't speak to the detox as I think detoxing is bs.",

I suggest the website do better job at rating which detox tea is worth the purchase. Smh",
