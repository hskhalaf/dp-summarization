Anker normally corrects their mistakes, I'm willing to change my review if it's a faulty product. Anker sent another so I'm increasing my review a star, however output is the same in direct sunlight on a cloudless day. But with the 2 panels combined it almost makes half the advertised output.",

At night it turns off. So I wakeup, boiling in ny tent with no fans running. It turns out youhave to close it up and re-open it for it to work. Such a crappy design and it's long past my warranty period. Thats a lot of $ wasted!",
