Expanded to full 14 inches in 15 seconds. Amazing comfort. It is firm with a cloud softness feeling. Total support for side sleepers for sure. I wrote this review without being paid or encouraged.

I let my mattress sit and fully inflate for about 24 hours before I slept on it. I have slept on the mattress for about 3 months, other than it being much warmer than a traditional mattress, it is absolutely fantastic. The Memory foam is soft, and yet the bed is firm, I think it was a great buy, and I would do it again.",

      "text": "It's comfortable enough right now as far as mattress density is concerned, but I am afraid it may overtimes will sink down. It's not as hard as some reviews' posted. Before opening the plastic wrap, make sure to face the bottom and topside in the right direction. Don't rely on video instruction or written instruction that came with the bed. I follow video instruction, it was wrongly instructed. And once the plastic is cut, the bed rises up quickly and it isn't easy to flip the opened king-size gel-infused memory bed. The package came torn and open, but the mattress wasn't damaged. Thank goodness for that. This (memory bed ) would be a nightmare to return them.",

First, if you are looking for a memory foam mattress that can be used on an adjustable platform this works just fine.

My fiance\u0301 did not like it the first few nights but now his back and neck pain is completely gone and he sleeps sound through the whole night! Great price and product. Would definitely recommend and hopefully it lasts a long time.",

    "description": "Style:Cool Gel 1.0 Mattress| Size:QueenExperience cloud-like luxury with our Classic Brands cool Gel Ultimate gel memory foam 14- inch mattress. This mattress offers a plusher and incredibly comfortable sleeping surface. Starting with a whopping 2-inch top layer, which consists of breathable ventilated cool gel memory foam that conforms to your shape and has a faster recovery factor than conventional memory foam. A second layer of 2-inch memory foam works with the 2-inch comfort foam support providing you with the ultimate sleeping experience. The 8-inch base layer maintains the strength and effectiveness of the layers. Know the size and height of your mattress ahead of purchase to make sure you are ordering the correct size. Keep in mind that you should combine the height of your bed frame, foundation, or adjustable bed base with the height of your mattress to get an approximate idea. Our advanced packaging technology means we can roll-pack our mattresses and ship them at one-third of the normal size. A mattress that is roll-packed still retains its initial quality, as each will quickly recover and return to its original shape when opened. Look for more innovative specialty sleep products from Classic Brands. Our mattresses are CertiPUR-US Certified. Certified flexible polyurethane foams have been independently laboratory tested.",
