      "text": "Had a problem with the first pistol upon opening, it didn\u2019t transfer gas from magazine to B.B.. Amazon customer service sent me a replacement. Work great for about 550-600 shots. Then the magazine valve (nipped part) protruded further out for some reason. Now the magazine cannot be inserted or pulled out of the handle without releasing some gas due to the protruding nipple on valve scrapping the inside of handle. Another magazine is around $30. Not worth the initial cost and then have to buy extra magazine. Don\u2019t know if extra magazine will malfunction also. Came out to be an expensive 550-600 shots.",

      "text": "This is a faithful 1911 replica and amazingly well made. Other than the dramatic difference in recoil between this handgun and the real thing, it's hard to distinguish, so ot has excellent value as a trainer. It was very satisfying drawing from a holster when cocked & locked, disengaging the realistic safety during the push out, and doing emergency/tactical reloads. Now, it won't help with training on a quick follow up shot, because of the unrealistic recoil force, but because it is milder, it can conceivably help to train someone out of their habitual flinch. This gun shoots well, is fairly accurate, and way cheaper to run... and so much fun emptying the magazine as quick as you can!",

Added some faux stag grips and it's a dang near perfect representation of Walt Longmire's service 1911. I've had a LOT of fun with it in the couple of days since I received it.

Shoots rather accurately: from ~30 ft/10 m I can hit a target of about 4x4 in/10x10 cm. A BB will pass through several layers of cardboard (I use a big box packed with waist cardboard to catch the BB's for recycling).Initially disassembled and oiled before shooting. Oil it once in ~300 shots. For disassembling and assembling the gun see one of the reviews -- very helpful. Enjoy!",

I would get rid of the warning writing on the right side of the gun, sort of takes away from an otherwise excellent replica of a 1911 handgun.",

      "text": "This is an excellent replica BB gun. I'm disabled and can't get out and shoot as I used to so I shoot indoors with airguns. This is a smooth bo5re BB gun but at 10 to 15 feet it pretty much keeps the rounds within a quarter sized group (aside from the occasional flyer which you always seem to get). I shoot mostly blowback BB guns now as they feel more like a firearm. This is one of my 2 favorites and the other has developed a problem. This is one great BB gun.",

A lot of reviews I read say it is to hard to load. This is true if you follow the directions. My method is to hold the mag spring all the way down with my finger nail and pour the BBs into the little square hole at the bottom of the mag. Hold it on an angle over a plastic bowl to catch the extras. Nothing to it except the broken finger nail. Highly recommended.",
