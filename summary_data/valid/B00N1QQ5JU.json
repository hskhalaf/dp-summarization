Make sure to either use gloves, or do like I did and put masking tape or something on your finger if you'll be doing a lot of casting. After a while, the line will eat into your finger a lot compared to monofilament. And if something unusual happens it can quickly rip your skin open if you try to grab it, so be careful! It definitely has much more \"feel\" to it as it doesn't stretch, although it is harder to tie in some regards since you're not supposed to use the \"regular\" cinch knot on braid.",
