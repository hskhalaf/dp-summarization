But they had various weak connections, which meant a lot of fudging, to get a clear signal from each channel. These don't do that. I've got a 25' 1/4\" to 1/8\" adapter connected to them, and I never lose a channel. I'm not easy on my headphones. I fall asleep on them in not-sober states. These have held up, and are still working in 2018 (though the ear pads have degraded, they are a $20 replacement item).",

More bass is the noticeable difference in comparison to my previous models. I like the thicker,and shorter,cable considering where I sit and use the 225i. My set-up is right next to me so a short cable works best for me. The only that I don't like are the L cushions. I can't stand them because of the way they sit on my ears. I find it annoying. I switched to the G cushions which cover my ears and I find that more comfortable while not affecting the sound quality.",

First, do yourself a favor and invest in the Grado G cushions. The sound opens up and is considerably more balanced top to bottom. It's a very noticeable difference from the get-go. Second, before you listen with either set of cushions, take them off and wash them well in water with a few drops of dish soap. It softens them up a little. -dm / FL",

I figured that since I use either the USB adapter that came with them or onboard audio, the audio quality from my computer would be the most limiting factor in terms of fidelity. I could not have been more wrong. The 166's sound muffled and horrible compared to the SR225i's when playing internet radio music. This review is not about comparing two headphones that are naturally worlds apart, but to let people that upgrading headphones is well worth it, even if you're not using an expensive receiver or sound card.",

    "description": "Newly upgraded Grado SR225i headphones feature an innovative diaphragm and UHPLC (Ultra-high purity, long crystal) copper wire voice coil specially designed for increased bass response and a larger perceived sound stage. The diaphragms are put through a special 'de-stressing' process in order to enhance inner detail. An improved headband spring provides ample comfort, allowing the listener to relax and enjoy the fine tonal spread and balance. Bass, midrange and treble are incredibly open. What does the letter 'i' stand for in the new SR225i from Grado? Improved, that's what! The main features are the same as the SR125i, with its new driver, cable, and housing designs, but this headphone also has an increased rear air flow, utilizes Grado\u2019s larger ear cushion and has closer matched drivers. Airflow is increased by 50%, which is achieved through an improved rear metal screen. The use of closer matched drivers and the larger cushions results in an enlarged soundstage, while the improved rear screen frees the headphone from colorations. \"The SR225s sound unlike any other headphone. They have an amazingly solid presentation, packed with weight and presence. There is also a pleasant richness in the midrange that benefits all types of music,\" reports England's What Hi-Fi? magazine. \"When it comes to classical music, the Grados reproduce instruments with both believable timbre and solidity. The treble boosts fine detail and no hint of aggression\u2026 These Grados are hard to beat!\" Although the SR225 is similar to the bestselling SR125, its design increases air flow by 50 percent via an improved rear metal screen and closer matched drivers. The result is an enlarged soundstage achieved from closer driver tolerances, while the improved rear screen frees the headphone from coloration. \"Music flows through this headphone organically and believably, with irrepressible dynamics and bounce,\" reports issue 163 of Hi-fi Choice magazine. \"It gives good expression to the d",
