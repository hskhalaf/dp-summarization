Also if you take the small lid (On top of the strainer) off first the other will come off easier. But really , you don\u2019t have to jam It on real tight, it won\u2019t leak.",

The shaker holds a decent amount of volume for martinis and cosmos, which is really good. The main problem that I have had with other shakers is that the removable spout gets \"welded together\" with the top and you cannot remove it, even with adding hot water. I have read that this has a lifetime warranty, so if this ever happens to me with this shaker, Mr. Guy Shalit you can count on me contacting you for a full replacement!! Please LMK if you have any comments. Thanks, Anthony",
