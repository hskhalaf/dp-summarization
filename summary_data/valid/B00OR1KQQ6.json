Before I had a stupid wicker table to put my stuff on...and of course things would fall over easy if they didn't have a wide enough base. Cons: None. I will say though, if you're one of those people that expect $200 worth of quality out of an over $20 product and rate this product low because of the quality you should have expected, then you shouldn't be writing Amazon reviews.",

(fortunately, those are the purposes they're intended to serve here.) easy enough to put together; took me about five minutes, although bear in mind, i'm pretty much an expert at putting together pressboard furniture pieces (ha), so your mileage may vary. ;) (really, unless you're five years old, you can put these together.)",

Some inconsistencies in manufacturing resulting in imprecise edges and overlapping of edge material. Remedied by putting this edge to the back. Assembly: Simple and straight forward. If you do not have or want to use a rubber mallet to seat the leg connection on the top, gently place your heel on the piece and carefully apply pressure (do not stomp). There will be two 'pops' if you choose to use this method. Excellent value for the budget wise, minimalist and/or space saver.",
