      "text": "Since I was a child my mother & father would only buy 1 brand of toilet paper, and as an adult I continued using the same brand until I used Angel Soft, which is better than the previous brand. Angel soft is great, because it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and it's 2ply, and the rolls are triple the size of most brands.",
