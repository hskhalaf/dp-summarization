These brushes apply butter to pans and egg wash on baked goods very smoothly and evenly--much better than any silicone brush. Definitely a must-have for any baker! I've been careful to keep the brushes out of standing water, so the metal band hasn't rusted at all. They're easy to clean with a squirt of dish soap and hot water. Air-drying them works well. Overall, an excellent product that I recommend and would definitely buy again!!",

Soft and flexible natural boar bristles properly absorb liquids for easy application and promote smooth and effortless spreading. Great for applying egg washes, sugar glazes and flavorful spice mixes to fish, meat, pastries, cakes and other baked goods. Easy-to-grip handle made from beautiful handcrafted beechwood with a steel joint between the handle and bristle for durability and lasting quality. The wood is untreated and color will vary somewhat from product image due to natural variations in the wood. Comes with 2 pastry brushes sized 7-1/2\" and 8\" ideal for a wide range of cooking and baking tasks. To clean, handwash then gently dry with a cotton towel. Not safe for dishwasher.\n\nThe first handcrafted B\u00fcrstenhaus Redecker brushes were produced in 1935. A lot has changed since then. Today, the name B\u00fcrstenhaus Redecker stands as it has for many years for an ideal combination of natural quality, function and design. It lives from the blend of inventiveness, sound craftsmanship and creativity. Handcrafted in Germany, B\u00fcrstenhaus Redecker brushes are made of domestic woods, bristles, hair, and plant fibers, and have been for decades.
