Only reason it's not 5 stars is because the headgear likes to come loose every now and then (usually at the most inopportune time) and while it's a quick fix, it's annoying nonetheless. Great hood otherwise. And don't listen to the people who say the chin is too high, they obviously haven't realized there is a 4 position height adjustment on both sides of the hood.",
