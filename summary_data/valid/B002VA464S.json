It took three weeks to get an RMA and after I sent it back I was told a replacement would be out 1-2 business days from arriving. Here we are 6 weeks later and no microphone, no response from Blue customer support, not update on my RMA, nothing. Avoid. We have to hold companies like this to higher standards. Just because you make a good and affordable product doesn't mean you can have customer service this bad and stay ahead. Buyer beware.",

I figured it might be a cord or usb port issue, so I tried connecting it with 3 other usb cables to 5 different ports and it did not work with any combination. This proved to me that I was sent a faulty microphone, which is upsetting for such a highly rated product. Also, the usb port on the microphone itself feels very loose and my cords would often fall out if I simply moved the microphone a few inches. My snowball has been great so I was looking forward to this upgrade, but I ended up very disappointed.",

It's clear and crisp and picks up astonishing detail. This mic will pick up a whisper from 2ft. away (looking at you ASMR folks). I can go from singing soft to belting without having the sound blowout. If you are looking to move up to a nicer mic and have $100 to spend, buy this before you spend $500. I couldn't be happier.",

After a year the headphone jack became loose and the wire for the headphone has to be held precariously still. And before either of those bits of planned obsolence, it was useless to use for playing a game over the Internet. There was a two second delay before it started pushing any sound out (on multiple programs/platform/systems). I hate the Blue Yeti, I wish I never bought it and I hope you read this and start to hate it too.",

We use Google meet and sometimes the button mutes, other times it doesn't, and the mute symbol never comes up on the screen so we just stopped trying. Not a big deal really. The reson I knocked a star off, is that within a few weeks my stand was broken. One of the screws just turns and turns. I put the mic on an old stand I had laying around but it was disappointing.",

They also agree that everything in the room with me also sounds loud and crystal clear as if it were right next to the mic regardless of location in relation to the mic. The gain switch doesn\u2019t work and I\u2019m not too sure if the direction settings work either. There is no noticeable change when I switch it from front facing to surround sound or two way. It picks up everyone loud and clear. So, if you live alone without pets in a soundproof room then I recommend this mic, just don\u2019t breathe too hard.",

I did some research and found out that this is a common problem with both the Yeti and the Snowball. Also, the quality when recording now that it doesn't show up as a Blue Yeti is no better than the cheapest mics out there.",

Seems like the Yeti needs an ample amount of power to operate. So, certainly you could plug it directly to the back of your computer -- but if you use a hub, it may not operate if there are other connections present.

      "text": "This is the first microphone I've ever purchased and let me say, it was worth every penny. There's just so much that I want to say. The build quality, the options you can select for the environment, and the sound quality.....just magnificent! The ONLY downfall that I see, which others may see is that it's HUGE and HEAVY. From an estimated guess, without the stand, it weighs a good 3-6 lbs. So it'll be a challenge to keep this mic straight with a mic boom. Do I recommend this product? Why yes indeed. $120 may be a lot but with the sound quality you're getting, you won't think about the money you've spent for a second.",

      "text": "I've tried everything and I cannot eliminate the static behind my voice. No one is available to assist. Forget leaving a voicemail at the company as no one will call you back. There's no \"best practices\" on how to set this up. And hours of watching YouTube videos has been a waste of time. I just bought \"Amazon's Choice\" for $29.99 and so far it works like a charm. My guess is that this microphone is so sophisticated and is designed to be used in a professional studio.",
