After using this diligently 2x a day, I noticed a massive improvement in a few days and after a bit over a week it was gone completely! I also love that the inhaler is ceramic and that they use a BPA-free rubber stopper showing their focus on quality. I know ceramic is a bit more fragile, but it looks nicer and I feel better not inhaling from a plastic inhaler.",

I was worried about what I may have inhaled and exposed myself to. And, there are NO returns, not even for defective items. DO NOT BUY!",

I spied this inhaler on my night stand. I'd used with middling results for occasional sinusitis. I was surprised that within a few deep, slow draws, my sore throat and stinging lungs were soothed and quieted. I still have a voice two octaves below normal, but I was able to start a normal morning routine that otherwise would have been much more uncomfortable! Highly recommended!!",

      "text": "I watched Dr. Oz and took their recommendation to try the salt inhaler. Of course; how could it hurt right? Well, I think the effort of inhaling deeply is the reason this treatment works vs the actual salt dust entering the nasal passages. Deep breathing expands the lungs and creates a greater space for an oxygen exchange over the alveoli in the base of the lungs. If you are oxygen dependent I would encourage you to try this treatment as it would enhance the oxygen exchange therefore allowing you to breath with greater ease.",

I notified Amazon both times and returned the product to them. Amazon was going to investigate and get back to me. They never did. For a short time they pulled the product, but now I see it is back on the website. If you order from North Georgia Mercantile make sure you get the product you pay for and which should be exactly as the picture in the ad. Both of mine were not and they have been returned.",

Amazon was sold out so I bought it with a seller through Amazon but he was higher priced than Amazon so technically I paid for shipping. I bought this for better immunity or shorter colds but all it is doing is drying and irritatng my throat. My doctor told me to stop using it when I told her about it. Was it a good investment ? NO!!! Save your money. If you must, gargle with warm salt water. It's a lot cheaper.",
