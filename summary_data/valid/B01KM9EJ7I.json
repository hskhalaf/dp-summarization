Efforts to tame this using eq merely make the listening experience dull. The mids are too recessed and the bass feels overwhelmed by that dominating top end. It's also a tiring listen. I've used them with various sources and the top end remains intrusive. It's less of a problem with my phone, but only because I can subdue the sibilance. Disappointing!",

Separation of instruments is outstanding and the imaging is very good. The bass is rich and tight with no muddiness to be seen. Bass hits just hard enough to to have noticeable impact and without distracting you from the rhythm of the highs and mids. These are also built like a tank made from Tempurpedic. Very solid.

The cables it came with are solid (even though it took FOREVER for it to straight out) Wearing these 10+ hours and was not uncomfortable at all. They do come with two different pads, and I found the analytical pads had just a bit more bass if you need just a bit more.",

The sound staging is the first thing you will notice compared to the DT990's. You will find yourself hearing one or two things you didnt know existed in your music. I am very happy with the DT1990s and the incremental upgrade it provided. That being said if you have a lower budget and have not moved to this type of level yet I would start with the 990s and save your money to focus on better dac and amp.",
