The instructions stated that I turn it \"on\" when i want to use it and turn it \"off\" when I'm not. Thats exactly what I did but, for some reason, after about 3 weeks, I've been coming home to a wet floor because water keeps leaking out of the toilet/bidet connection. I tried fixing it and waiting it out for another week or so but the problem is persistent. I have no choice but to uninstall it. Its very annoying because i can't even return it at this point.",

The trick is you really have to get the nut that connects to the water tank to be super tight. The nut is rounded that makes it super hard to use the wrench to tighten it, especially in a small space. For us there is very little space between the toilet and the wall, and it almost makes it impossible to turn the wrench in some angles. It would be great of the manufacturer can make a normal six sided nut that the wrench would be able to turn in any angle. It works great after successfully installed.",

Installation could have been a lot easier (like 5-10 minutes) if I had more space behind my toilet. Material is good, matching color with my existing hardware is a bonus. No leak, so far. One important feature is the water flow is adjustable through the T valve. I wish the hanger (to hang the head on toilet bowl) is adjustable and the latch/ unlatch is smoother.",

If you have a regular toilet, I'm sure this would be a piece of cake to install and use, though I'm really unsure about the gasket problem ( maybe even more plumbers tape?).
