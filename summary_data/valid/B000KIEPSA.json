The end plate that covers the internal bearings unscrews while it's being used. No idea if it was properly torqued from the factory or not, nor do I know what torque it should be at, nor a tool to tighten it properly. I put a dab of BLUE locktite on the threads and tightened it down as best as I could. Hopefully that keeps it from coming loose again.",

The metal this live center is made from is far, far too soft for turning metal. Do not buy this if you intend to use it on a metal lathe. My center was basically destroyed the first time I used it with stainless steel. It is now used for roughing woodwork because I can not return it. This would be pretty good for woodwork that requires a live center, but that is the limit of its usefulness.",

All the actual funtional parts seem unharmed though, so not too much trouble, especially for the price point. I would recommend, seeing as anyone buying this product would be able to fix it using the machine it is used for.",

(If your socket/holder has both ends open, just a tap with a dowel from the rear will work just fine!)

It was a simple matter to get a sleeve for the 2MT shaft that adapts it to 3MT. I have used it a couple times now and I am pleased with it, especially at such a cheap price.",

The steel is extremely tough, and the quality of the internal ball bearings allow it to spin extremely smoothly, even after years of use. It fits precisely into a MT2 mount. No complaints about this product, it is worth the money!",
