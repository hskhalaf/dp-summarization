      "text": "I have to give it 5 stars because they are too darn cute. They were not what I was looking for, but they will be handy. They are \"small\" so don't think you're going to get a funnel that will fill a large container. It will work great for re-filling my salt and pepper shakers and other spice containers I have. I think the largest is about 3 inches in diameter. For me, they will be functional. Mostly, I got a good chuckle!",

The smaller one fits in the end of a large straw and I have actually used it with a straw to fill something from a distance. If you're looking for standard size funnels, these will probably be too small for you. Liquids pour pretty fast through them so the larger one may still work. Just be sure to pay attention to the size of these before you order to make sure they will fit your needs.",

They will work great with spices and nut meals (or grain flours) and liquids and oils. The nice long spout will help ensure no mess.

They've held up for me since 2012 - no breaks, no rust, doesn't seem like anything is getting caught it the (tiny) seams. I've been very happy to have them around.",
