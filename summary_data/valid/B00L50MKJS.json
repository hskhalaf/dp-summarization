The Astro has an adjustable regulator built and can obtain higher speeds than the 3m. This tool also a locking mechanism for changing the belts which makes it easier. Also the 3m you are constantly adjusting the belt tracking...Astro you set it and forget it.",

The part that broke is cheap but I would use this professionally and wouldn't want to spend that much money on replacing wheels all the time.",

Almost all air tools are a little noisy, and you should be wearing ear protection anyway. I use this tool in the auto body field and it performs exceptionally. Grinds OEM spot welds and wire welds like there is no tomorrow. Extremely easy to change the belt, and once in place,...... DOES NOT wander. Again, very good well built tool.",

Also there is not safety lock so when you lay it down if the handle is on the side you lay it down on it will run. Ruined some wires because of this. Won't do that again.",

This tool does metal finishing, at least on exhaust pipes, as good or better than a hand file but in a fraction of the time.

I did replace them maybe every 20-30 minutes, but they never ripped. Replacing the sanding belt would be hard if you don't have strong hands - the spring is strong.
