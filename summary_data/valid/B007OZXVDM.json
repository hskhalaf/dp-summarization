Within the email I asked for more help with the product and/or a credit for the product with not an email back. (It's been more than a week) So ultimately, if you would like to spend your hard earned money on something that only works once go ahead, dont expect any customer service or a functional product from this company!",

The other con is the balance of the large fry basket (haven't tried the small ones), if it is lightly loaded, the handle will cause the basket to tilt back so you have to load it heave on one side or some of your food might come up out of the oil. All in all I love it! Will buy another for sure when this one give up the ghost, hopefully a long time from now.",

      "text": "I love this product. I cook for a family of 5 and the size is perfect. I love the fact that I can cook two items at the same time or one huge basket of one item. My only complaint would be that the timer isn't actually a timer for food (I discovered this the hard way) but a timer for the heat source. Be sure if you are cooking and the timer goes off that you turn it back on or you will have oil soaked food. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend.",

I'm sure the two smaller ones will work just as well. It took me a while to figure out that you have to use the timer to get it to turn on but that really isn't a problem. I highly recommend this fryer",
