The other car got driven across two lanes of traffic and into a light pole. Both cars were totaled. The seatbelt stretched and my daughter's seat tilted way over but it held and the only marks on her were on her legs from the harness. She was perfectly fine. Very thankful for this seat.",

It\u2019s actuallt really easy to install if you take the time to read the manual and/or watch videos on how to install it. I was skeptical about buying it due to negative reviews but went ahead anyways because Graco is a great brand. Very impressed with this $83 seat that can rear face for up to 40 pounds. Recommended for sure! Only downfall is that it arrived with some small stains.",

So if you worry that it may be a bit big for your car, don't worry. We're first time parents and installing was super easy. Car seat manual was easy and well explanatory.",

I\u2019ve purchased 12 different car seats, ranging from $500 - $100. I couldn\u2019t find one that wouldn\u2019t allow my kids heads to fall forward while they slept. Since my kids immediately fall asleep, this was a crucial selling point. I recommend this seat to everyone!",

It is also pretty bulky rear facing so if you have a smaller car like a Corolla and are very tall, you may need a different car seat.",

Yes it is comfortable for my son, but it takes up sooo much room in my backseat along with my other sons highback booster that no one could sit in the middle, granted, I do drive a tiny Nissan Versa. Other than that, it is a good well made seat that I feel very confident putting my son in!",

Nice recline too, I hate it when their heads fall forward and it just doesn't happen with this seat. Update- a down side I've found after owning for a while is that the fabric stains easily. If they spill anything on it it leaves a great big water mark. I feel like I'm washing it out all the time just so it doesn't look all dirty.",

Comfy in seat, have cup holders, could use a removable bar across the seat for dangling toys.",

I would say the only negative would be it does take up a lot of room in the car. Either way, we love this product. Thanks Graco!",
