      "title": "Cute, really nice high-end blush palette",
      "text": "Was looking for a multi-pan blush palette (mattes and shimmer) for use on fair- fair tan skin tone. From a presitigious/label name brand. Absolutely beautiful! Multiple shades to compliment my skin tone (if I'm going for a warmer or cooler/shimmer look). Def got what I wanted (I have a separate palette for bronzer/highlight/shimmer). Apply with ELF tapered blush brush or RealTechn Blush brush on top of my contour/bronzer. Along the hairline, under jaw, and slight bit on nose. And def gives the \"label snob\" appeal of NARS. ALL women should wear blush regardless of makeup taste or skin tone. NOTHING gives more of a feminine mystique to the face than blusher (thank perhaps lipstick... which really compliments blush all together).",
