It goes perfect in the nursery. I filled it with old clothes and sheets. And I used ALOT LOL. I couldn\u2019t believe how much fit in there but it\u2019s not gonna Move around on me! I can\u2019t seem to get it as even as I would like everywhere but I still love it. Thank you so much for my beautiful pouf!",

We just moved and I didn't have enough to stuff them with so I used a 18\" seat cushion on the top and then went to good will and stocked up on queen blankets at half off (Score!). Stuffed them and they are HEAVY! and the seat cushion helped shape the top. I went back and bought the blue one. In the Summer they will be used outdoors a on a covered patio and ill put them inside in the living room come winter. Stuffed you can get them up to about 18\"\" Sturdy heavy metal zipper and it seems to be well sewed.",

The ottoman is high quality and well made. The size and height is perfect, just what I was looking for. It arrived folded flat but did not have any crease marks when opened up. I was going to rate it 4 stars for the color variance, but it is so beautiful it gets 5 stars.",
