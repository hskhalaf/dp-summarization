Also, one tube of this lasts me about 6 months. A little bit goes a long way. I used to buy this on Sokoglam, but they stopped selling it. Glad to find it here!

It's also HEAVILY scented, which is always a bad sign. My skin got worse after I started using it, but I always use products for at least 8 weeks before I decide they aren't working. I'm almost all the way through this tube and my skin has maintained the terrible breakouts, so I will not be repurchasing.",

I do use this product a couple of times a week, never twice a day, and once on the weekend with my scrubber. It is a great for exfoliating, but with my skin, I have to limit my use. I would recommend this product, just use your own judgement on what your skin can tolerate.",
