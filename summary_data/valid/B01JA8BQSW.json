It is in between heavy coverage and light coverage and still covers my splotchy complexion. I would recommend this to any age group. I am 58 years old. I hope this helps.",

      "text": "I've used this product for years -- even when doing acting in commercials - the makeup artists love this product! Great coverage - hides the red color my skin is - gives me an even skin tone. My face is so HAPPY/soothed with this product on -- keeps me from breakouts, too. Lasts all day - and I can wear when swimming, and it stays on nicely! Again, covers imperfections and red very well! I HIGHLY recommend this product.",

This foundation lasts me all day, keeps my skin matte but doesn't look dry and doesn't dry my skin out, and doesn't feel too heavy on the skin. I am really happy with it! The coverage is pretty good too! I would say it gives medium coverage but is buildable. I'm not a full coverage kind of person so that's fine with me. Especially if you use concealer I think you could get full coverage from this foundation. Definitely worth trying it for yourself!",

After reading several reviews and watched numerous youtube videos, the color was still off. Even after baking and using setting powder it seems kind of dark. I will be exchanging maybe for Golden Caramel.",

      "text": "It lasts quite well, transfer proof as long as there is no moisture involved. I used this brand all summer knowing I'd be swimming. This foundation lasted a full day at a waterpark with my face being submerged multiple times. By the end of the day I had only a small area on my nose where the foundation had rubbed off from holding my nose while in water. Only downside in my opinion is that when you do want it off you have to use good soap and at least two cycles of washing your face to get every last bit off. It did dry my face out a bit, but personally I have very sensitive skin.",

I'm usually combinational oily during summer and combinational dry during winter, so maybe it might be more suitable for summer time. But I won't recommend to use it in winter unless you're really really oily and never need to worry about skin flake problem.",
