I have an 18 inch umbrella base underneath with a 7 1/2 ft umbrella and it all works great ! You could use a 24 inch base if wanted for larger umbrella but not sure I do that look with a small table . This was definitely worth the money ! My husband put it together in about 15 minutes. Love it :)",

I was able to do it in 10 minutes, with a drill and a wrench. I've included a Photo of the table and the one I had before. The old one just took up too much space was hard to walk around.",

Not counting the time to get everything out of the boxes and bubble wrap, it took less than 10 minutes to assemble. Hint: don't tighten any of the nuts until all eight bolts are in and nuts are threaded just a couple of turns. Otherwise the legs would probably try to pop out of the slots on the underside of the tabletop. (Rocket science provided free of charge.) We like it and hope it holds up well. Probably have supper on it this evening.",

The legs are not adjustable for me to fix it, so it forces me to put something under one leg to even it out, which makes it look tacky and cheap. My inquiry about the solution to the seller is pending.",
