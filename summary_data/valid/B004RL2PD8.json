As long as you're installing it in the corner of the screen door where you can access both sides, it's easy enough for one person to do. The mounting process is very smart and very easy using only a screwdriver. I then used one of my sharp pocket knives to cut out the screen when I was done. Very basic. I ordered the Medium Large size and my 53 pound black lab got used to it quickly, using a few treats at first.",

I've tried the other smaller doors available on Amazon and very few stores, but even my corgi couldn't fit through, especially now that he's full grown. This door solved my issue. It was easy enough to install, and has held secure since last May, even having installed this quite close to some damaged parts of our screen. The only downside of this was the shipping, since there was no U.S. distributor available when I ordered this, but it was worth the wait for this thing to make it across the Pacific Ocean.",

Once we figured that out, it was simple to install, although it did take 2 people. Once installed, it is very sturdy and easy for the dog to figure out and use. Highly recommended.",

The magnetic lock doesn't work real well ... even a small breeze can open it .... so if locking the door is important to you, this is not the one. But overall, a good product.",

It also has very thick door hinges compared to other flimsy plastic that bends and breaks over time. Very easy to put together and highly recommended.

      "text": "The instructions were not in English, but the pictures were pretty self explanatory. The screws that came with it were difficult to work with, and I ended up using some bigger ones that I already had. Now that it is up, and my cat understands what to do, it seems to work well. I would not consider myself handy, but I managed to install this. You probably can, too.",

I did have to add a couple screws to reinforce the frame, but it's a great smart product rather than getting up everytime to let the dogs out and keeping the bugs away as well.",

We put it up a little higher so she wouldn't have to bend down too much and hit her back on the top of it but our 2 small dogs need to leap over it because it's a little too high for them but it worked out perfectly. We highly recommend it.",
