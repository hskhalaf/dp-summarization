      "text": "Although this suit is cute, the cut lays a little awkward on my petite 24 lb 3 year old. The 3T size sags on the bottom, but somehow covers adequately at the same time. I'm not a fan of the top bikini cut, but it's a small dislike. I like it well enough to keep, but not well enough to recommend.",

      "text": "The details of this swimsuit were set for a 3-4 yr. old. My daughter is 3 1/2. The swimsuit fit lengthwise (from shoulders to bottom), but the bodice was way too large. You could pull the swimsuit away from her back about 4 inches. No offense, but it seemed like it was made for an extremely chubby child who was the same height. It's a bummer because it was really cute.",
