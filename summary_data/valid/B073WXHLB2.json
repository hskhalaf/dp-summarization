The shoes are comfortable with an attention-grabbing design that\u2019s meant to turn heads. The quality does not lag behind either as users have praised the shoes for being well-made. They do cost more than other shoes and the fit runs small.",

The gum around the shoe is true white but the actual shoes are off white grayish color. Attached picture with the shoes on top of a white t shirt for color reference. Sadly I didn\u2019t notice this until I had worn them outside, so I can\u2019t return them. If I can sell them on eBay or Craigslist I will come back and try to find a pair in the true white style. I do think I\u2019m gonna buy the black/chrome style though \ud83d\ude01",
