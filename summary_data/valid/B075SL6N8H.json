Set up was a breeze, and even the transition to the new Hydra experience has gone smoothly (though not glitch-less). I do miss the old interface, but I do see some strong advantages to the new one. The voice feature I thought was going to be another IoT me-too gimmick. It's not. I find myself using the voice on this more often that typing in a channel, or setting up a OnePass.",

The greatest invention in TV since color! - Voice search that actually works. And gives results for streaming options as well as from the guide - Apps for many of my favorite streaming options (HBO, Amazon Prime, YouTube) - App to stream movies from your PC (Plex). This is huge for me as I have a large movie collection. Cons: - Setup can be tough depending on your cable service provider - Amazon Alexa integration is iffy. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't - Could use some more apps",

The second went better in that it at least got to TV channels, then worked for a few minutes before...like the first...constantly rebooted itself. There seems to be a heat or power problem with the 3TB model as both ran hotter than the 500MB.",
