We have been easing her up to the two tablespoons, but even at the lower amount she seems to be thinking clearer with less confusion. Only time will tell, but we're very hopeful. Of course I ordered it from Amazon because of their quick delivery!!!",

I also use this with cayenne pepper and vodka to make a hair root stimulator. This oil works for everything. Also great after showers to soften skin. So far this is my favorite brand.

Our favorite recipe is freezer fudge: 1 cup coconut oil 1 cup nut butter of choice 1 cup cocoa powder 1/2 cup maple syrup 1 tsp vanilla Melt all ingredients gently in pot, then pour into a 9x9 pan lined with wax paper. Freeze. We use a knife to break off chunks. SO delicious and also healthy! I also use coconut oil on cuts, etc. Coconut oil has great antibacterial and antiviral properties.",

It's a great hair conditioner. I work it into my dog's coat when I shampoo her as well. I have even used it to condition the wood of an old antique hutch I bought!

It dosent take much. We are used to so much lard soaked food that you won't need it with coconut oil. I used it even for sunny side up eggs and they tasted so much fresher. Cooked in less time and didn't have the burned edges as the heat doesn't have to be so high. My health food store has this same brand and the price was comparable. Very happy.",

I divide my damp hair into four section and apply the oil from root to tip, giving the ends a little extra coconut oil, cover and sit under the hairdryer for 20 mins and the result fabulous mositurised locs. My sin sure loves it, shiny and smooth, without the oily feel. As for perfume, coconut is mine. just yummmmmmmm. This size is a steal for the price, and the quality is the same.",

It works great as a moisturizer (especially for the face), make up remover, and hair treatment. I even found that it helps reduce razor-burn if you put it on after shaving. I've been trying to use only natural/organic beauty products as name brand's have tons of added synthetic chemicals, preservatives, and other harsh ingredients. I don't have to worry about any of that with this product. After using this coconut oil, my skin feels much cleaner, and looks better than ever. I recommend it to everyone.",

Keep it at room temperature of below, otherwise, like most oils, it liquifies, making it easy to spill if you open it in a hurry.

I use it to cook, add it to oatmeal, and any time I think of it. Is it working? I do not know, but I know we love the flavor. When cooking our veggies, I add a couple of tablespoons, potatoes/asparagus/peppers/onions and cook slowly while my meat is cooking. What a tasteful dish.
