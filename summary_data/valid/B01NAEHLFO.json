Definitely toxic, definitely an alergy. Horrible. I've had the plant based protein and it works great also. However, I wanted whey isolate protein since it's preferable when having any type of work out regimen for muscle growth and recovery. I FOUND THE PERFECT FIT! NO MIGRAINES, NO NOT ONE. I'm on my fourth purchase of this product, and I definitely RECO for anyone that suffers from MIGRAINES. Hope you find the right fit for you. Consider it.",

The flavoring is the best I've tried, and I've tried probably about 15 protein powders. It's important for me to have grass fed whey protein because if the cows are fed grains, it's not clean. I like that it's sweetened with erythritol, which is also a clean sweetener that tastes WAY better than just straight up stevia alone. The macros on this are great, low carb, no fat, and high protein.",

Highly recommend if you're looking for a grass fed whey protein that mixes well and is not gritty and has great flavor.",

      "text": "I purchased this because I like another products of there's and wanted to try to be healthier in regards to the supplements I used. I've tried a lot of protein powders and this one was awful unfortunately. I got the chocolate flavor. It tastes like melted plastic. It is by far the worst protein I've ever used in regards to mixing. It clumps up worse than anything I've tried and I bet it won't even mix well in a blender. I will however continue to purchase their other vegan protein they make. It has a subtle taste and mixes well.",

      "text": "Good taste, mixes easily. Rich chocolate flavor versus some of the others I have tried. I usually order Mercola whey and this was a good substitute. I understand that powder settles after filling but it is really a shame to receive the container half empty and waste so much plastic. Seems like GOL should switch to a more ecological bag. Or you could just buy two, combine and toss. :)",

    "description": "Flavor Name:VanillaCertified Grass Fed Whey is designed to refuel and repair muscles. Intensive training and exercise breaks down muscle tissue and then the body repairs and rebuilds to make them stronger. Our premium quality, clean Certified Grass Fed Whey is not only free of hormones and antibiotics, but we are also very proud to have the ONLY Non- GMO Project Verified Whey. Due to these third-party certifications, Certified Grass Fed Whey is also NSF Certified for Sport and Informed-Choice for Sport Certified. You can rest assured there are no athletic banned substances in this clean whey protein.For Garden of Life to launch an animal protein, the entire system had to be different from other \u201cso-called grass fed\u201d protein. We needed a holistic approach to our protein that started at the farm and traced every metric straight through to the tub. Although many whey protein products may call themselves \u201cgrass fed,\u201d our research showed this wasn\u2019t truly the case. Almost all dairy farms still used animal feed full of soy, corn and GMOs. Why? Typically, there are too many cows to feed year-round on grass. Our search ultimately ended in Ireland with a coop of 4,800 generational family farmers whose herds feed only in green pastures.",
