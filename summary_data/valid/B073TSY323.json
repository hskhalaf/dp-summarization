I did get insoles for Rome, just because of all the walking on cobblestone. I wear them here with and without the insoles. Also - great in rain! I get so many complements, LOVE them!",

Update 20/4/18 Shoe is still going strong despite the threading mishap. I took a lighter n burn the end so it wouldn't loosen ( it worked).

Also the soles of the shoe are not attached to the shoe. Seems like if they had fit they would have been pretty comfortable, which is why they get a few stars.
