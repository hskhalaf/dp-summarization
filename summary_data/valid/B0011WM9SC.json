I love that the mixing bottles have lines that tell you \"to make purple, add red up to here and then blue up to here\" etc. I thought I'd have to eyeball it but that was really helpful! I did end up getting extra gloves, but all in all it worked out very well. Price was a little high, but it's good quality and I have no other complaints so I'm generally satisfied.",

This is the perfect size for a one time project in the classroom. Everything you need is included, except the shirts and buckets for soaking. Just be sure to tell students not to go crazy with the dye. They will get better results if they leave areas of white.",

Highly recommend it though even with not having enough yellow.",

You need to buy buckets or plastic bins to soak the shirts in for 20 minutes with a solution (included) and a tarp or a grassy area that can get covered in dye. Otherwise, it was very fun and user friendly!",
