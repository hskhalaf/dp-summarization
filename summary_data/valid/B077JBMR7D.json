The center bar, on the bottom bunk, bends a lot even with a small amount of weight so I don't expect it to last very long with my two teens. One of the legs damaged the laminate floor. The bed was delivered with damage to the side bar which I only noticed after I had almost finished building it. The supplier refused to send a new side bar and asked for the whole bed to be repackaged and returned which I couldn't do because I had discarded all the packaging. I would not recommend this bed or the supplier!",

This was for our two girls, one is 10, the other 5 1/2, and this works so perfectly for them! The space save design is perfectly functional and works great. Our girls also share a room with their baby brother who is 7 1/2 months and in a crib, and this bunk bed fits in the room with the crib and room to move and doesnt feel to cramped! It's not a very big room either, typical apartment kids room, on the smaller side, yet this space saving design makes the room feel bigger!",

Just pay close attention and make sure that all of your holes are on the correct side or facing the right direction before tightening the parts.",

It is a squeaky bed though and my sons have actually complained about the squeaking when they move at night. I wish there had been maybe plastic washers or something that could have helped prevent squeaking. Otherwise it's a decent bed at a good price and it gets the job done.",
