Plug soundlink in to wall charger - Hold down the play/pause button for 15 seconds. - Then, BEFORE releasing the play/pause button, unplug the charge cord from the unit. - Release the button, - Plug the unit back into the wall charger. - Press the power button, and your unit should power on.",

Sound is much better than what the Dot, or even the full-sized Echo, can produce, and I am very pleased with its performance.

And, yes, \"everyone\" has a wall plug anyway. But to package a product without all necessary accessories is just not right.",

I contacted Amazon and they thought that it might be a bad charging cord. So, I bought another charging cord. Nope! Wasn't the charging cord. I tried to call Bose Tech support but they are closed. So, i am leaving this review so that people know that it might start out great but can very quickly leave you feeling like you wasted $130. I cannot recommend this speaker to anyone.",

As another reviewer noted (which I didn't see until I received mine) it grayer but not a cool true grey. If I'd known I'd have gone with black - it doesn't blend with my decor as well. 2. You need to activate a button on the speaker to connect even if its a remembered device. (I have another bluetooth speaker by a different company I can connect my phone to without physically waking up the speaker).",

      "text": "This speaker did not live up to the reputation associated with the Bose brand. First off, it would not charge quickly- and would lose charge extremely quickly. In fact, there were problems charging this speaker despite every single trouble-shooting procedure outlined online and in videos. After 2 days of futile attempts, it was time to send it back. I have since bought a JVC Bluetooth speaker which is terrific in every regard - and even cost a bit less.",
