I have another Belkin with lower mAh\u2019s & the difference in recharge time is phenomenal. I think the only faster charger is Belkins model above this one. This was one of the best investments I have ever made with regard to smartphone accessories & portable chargers. Don\u2019t hesitate to bring this one home! The recharging time of this Belkin unit, itself, is very fast, as well.",
