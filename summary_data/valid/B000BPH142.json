      "text": "I bought the Travel Drive because it was the largest capacity small drive I could find. Plus I trusted the Memorex brand. What a mistake. Mine just died after 8 weeks of use. Because I rely on it for my work I need it replaced ASAP but I first have to e-mail Memorex, who says they will respond the next day, and then my drive will be replaced in 3-4 weeks! Considering that the drive is an expensive and crucial piece of hardware I would think they could replace it sooner than that, like in a day or two. This is the last time I'll be buying any Memorex product.",

I loaded one file from the first computer, and by the time I got it to the second computer the thing was DOA. Won't even try the others, I need more dependability with my data, and expected much more from Memorex!",

Since these devices have moving parts they are prone to breaking without warning. Both units of mine were not dropped or experience any extreme conditions but failed anyway. I will purchase flash drives from now on.",

All the data is lost and there is no way to recover it, even by professionals. What a waste! Stay away. Memorax is great for CDs and DVDs, not so great for HDs.",

The problem is I dropped it 2 feet while not plugged in and it died. Not very good for a portable device. Memorex said they would replace it but that cost extra money for S&H to fix a product that would still be broken as designed.",

Then the honeymoon was over and after about 2 weeks it would just spin and click - dead. I have a replacement request submitted to Memorex but I am going to be nervous about the new one too. I'd steer clear of this item.",
