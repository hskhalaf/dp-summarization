It's maiden voyage was at Havasupai Falls and the temp dropped to 30 degrees in early morning. She was comfortable all throughout and even had to unzip a couple of times since she was also wearing thermals; appreciated the additional loft of the sleeping bag since she used an ultralight Air pad.

All I wore was one pair of thermals that I got at walmart that were fruit of the loom. I did use a hand warmer or 2 because they are amazing, but I didn't have to.",

Overnight temps in the 60s, so this bag was kind of overkill but it packs small enough and is light enough to justify taking it for summer trips. Build quality is great too. Seems to be a great bag at a great price-point.",
