The spray nozzle looks poorly made, like it will break very easily. There is no pressure relief valve, but it's not difficult to keep the nozzle down to relieve the pressure and store. By no means are these complaints, just observations for other buyers. I am happy with the purchase and it does exactly what I need it to do, if you need something more refined, you won't find it at this price.",

Assembling the sprayer was a no-brainer. Two minutes later I was filling the tank testing the pump. The sprayer put out a good stream of water onto the popcorn ceiling. I let it soak and sprayed a second time. I was so pleased. Four hours the day before became 1 hour in a larger room. Excellent sprayer. I will update this review in a few months.",

It's light enough to carry around with relative ease and the adjustable spray nozzle gives you a variety of spray patterns with just a simple twist. You can get the sprayer to shoot up to 8-10' depending upon the way you set the adjustable nozzle. I've only used the sprayer with a mixture of equal parts of liquid soap and olive oil as that combination works well in keeping spider mites and white flies in check.

In addition, this is a very low priced sprayer. One word of advice for users : when finished spraying, hold the top pointed away from you as you unscrew it. Here's why. There is always a bit of pressure left in the sprayer. If you don't point it away, a mist of sprayer contents will go to your face and body. The results could range from amusing to dangerous depending on the sprayer contents. I have to remind myself of this everytime I use this sprayer",

There is no provision for a shoulder strap nor is there any provision for clipping the wand to the sprayer when it is not in use. The spray is easy to adjust from a steady stream to a fanned out mist so the sprayer does the job it is intended for very well.",

Still, it only took about 5-10 minutes to unpackage and assemble.",
