Second, I wanted an alarm with an on-off switch. The info on Amazon says, \"no on-off switch for patient safety,\" which I misread and expected the device to have a switch. Third, while the choice of 3 volume levels is a nice feature, to change the volume or replace the batteries you must remove a tiny screw that locks the battery compartment. I just hope we don't lose the tiny Phillips screwdriver that came with the alarm.",
