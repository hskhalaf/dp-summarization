      "text": "I bought these after previously owning a pair of under armour engage trainers. These trainers are comfortable but do come up a bit bigger for some reason and seem slightly wider. The reason why I didn't buy another pair of engage trainers was that the heals wore down quickly and they were not reinforced, where as there's ones seem sturdier in the heal. For the price you cannot really moan and they do the job. Good trainers for gym classes.",
