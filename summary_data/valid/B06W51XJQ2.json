Like Seresto, this product takes time for the medication to build up in the dog's skin. During that time, your dog may experience an allergic reaction to the medication. If that happens, do not do like another reviewer on here. Take the collar off. Not all dogs are allergic, but some are. If you have fleas and ticks on the dog, use something to eliminate that infestation first. Like, this product seems to be best at keeping fleas and ticks away.",
