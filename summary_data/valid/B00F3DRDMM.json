While there is great suction and no flying dust, the issue is large chunks of charred wood/coal will get sucked up and clog the thing immediately. I've have yet to use it and this not happen. Needless to say I rarely use it anymore but every time I think I'll give it another chance, it happens. Of course when you go to unclog it, you'll get ash everywhere so it basically defeats the point. Wish I hadn't bought one....",

The bad - the attachment is ok at best and is not easy to get in tight places which is really needed for parts of the pellet stove. The power for suction is what I would call below average. It does the job but there is not super suction. All in all, I would recommend based on the price but just know the limitations of this vacuum.",

This by itself makes the Snow Joe product a superior one because IT DOESN'T SPEW ASH. The difference is the massive particle filter which PowerSmith lacks. Other advantages: higher hose diameter (doesn't get clogged as easily as PowerSmith). Great cable storage. Much cheaper. Cons: a bit under-powered (may be a good thing because it's easier to control what is being picked up). Also, no wheels, which in my case is a good thing but in general feels cheaper. Overall, very happy with the replacement",

Also, do not try to vacuum large pieces of charcoal - it'll gum up the hose. Finally, I tuck both ends of the hose into each other's opening before carting the contraption to its storage space - no more ash dust! Totally satisfied customer - indeed!",

I like it enough to keep and use and the price is great. If the hose were longer and didn't have a strange angle to it, it would be a five star item.",
