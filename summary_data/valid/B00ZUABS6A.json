      "text": "I bought this because the all plastic versions last maybe two days, so I was stoked to see this was metal. However, when we assembled it was clear this will have very limited durability as well because the connectors for attaching upright to the legs are flimsy plastic. I am sure they will break very soon. See my pictures. Why would someone design such strong framing then connect it together at the most critical point with such a sub par method? I was willing to pay more and ended up with something just as fragile as the cheaper plastic models",

Like another reviewer said, the piece that connects the upright posts to the base is made of plastic. So there's some concerns of longevity there. Also the bolas are nice and soft, however right out of the bag 2 of them were leaking sand. After a few uses, the bolas that are leaking are noticeably lighter. May need to invest in another bolas set. Other than those things, the set is great.",

It was very easy to assemble, and the metal ladders will clearly not break with normal use. The bolos are soft which are perfect for us since we have younger children. No need for someone to get accidentally hurt when trying to have fun. We plan on enjoying this set for a long time.",

I think if you want it to last you will need to burn the fraying of the strings, seal the bolas with a glue, and use a spray glue to hold the score sticker. Lastly, you can add some sand to the bottom bars since they can be sealed to make it sturdier. It is a fair to decent set but has room for improvement.",

I recommend they reinforce the bag at the end where the rough end of the metal pieces make contact with the bag.
