      "text": "This is really a great stroller. I wish I could say that I did a ton of research, but I was looking for a lightweight (but very solid) stroller that would fold up easily and be great for travel. This is totally that stroller. It is easy to fold up (we also bought the travel bag) and great for everything from a farmer's market to the airport. It reclines just enough to get a little nap and can hold a ton of extra bags on the handles and in the basket. (Biggest issue is when your toddler decides to get out -- watch out for the tip back). This was a great purchase.",

      "text": "I love this stroller. Its a beautiful color and it is so easy to fold up and transport. It's very light weight and we use it when traveling frequently. The canopy is large too. The space under it is a little small though. We can't fit our diaper bag in it, so when we load it up, I have to only take what is totally necessary. There is room for a cooler bag with two 8 oz bottles of formula, a few diapers, a toy, a change of clothing, and a flexible changing pad. But not a diaper bag. Easy to push, I've used it on grass and pavement. Recommended.",

Although it is lighter, I prefer the features of the city mini, the sun shade is a joke on the uppababy, the handles hurt your hands after a while and it doesn't recline as well as the city mini. Only benefits of this stroller is it is slightly lighter and has a carry strap.",

The only drawbacks I've found are that the reclining positions are way too far back, especially for a child over ten months old. My little one strains to sit up and see things. The other drawback is that the handles aren't adjustable.",

Our daughter has the UppaBaby Vista and we wanted something more compact that would maneuver well on uneven downtown streets. This fit the bill; well designed and sturdily made, it has all the features we were looking for. The only (slight) negative is that it doesn't have much side support, but that hasn't seemed to bother our grandson since he sits up well on his own. All around, a good purchase. It's pricey but I saved some money by buying an open-box new stroller listed by Amazon Warehouse, which arrived in perfect condition.",

On Amazon and in the UPPAbaby promo photos the color looks like a solid purple, and it says 'purple' on the box. But when we pulled it out of the packaging - we instantly agreed it was fuchsia, bordering on a dark pink, and not even close to the photos. It's not a bad color if that's what you want - but it wasn't for us - so we got to experience Amazon's easy returns. No harm no foul, but come on, UB, use a lighter touch on those Photoshop vibrance/saturation sliders...",

      "text": "Did not like this stroller once we received it. The canopy is not big enough for sunny California. Which is a huge factor for me. Plus the amount of money this thing costs, it should feel a bit sturdier. Wheels seem too small, but this is an umbrella stroller. I also did not like the bottom basket. It seems cheaply made and is hard to access, especially when seat is in recline position. I ended up returning this and I am still on the hunt for the \"perfect\" stroller. The only good thing was that it is lightweight.",

There are two things that have caused problems for us. The back left wheel sounds like a bicycle with a card in it. The older versions apparently could have the wheel replaced...but it's super loud. The second problem is the rainshield is worthless. We've gone through 3 of them in a year. We now have to replace it after a year and three months which shouldn't have to happen. We don't abuse it...just normal usage.",

Plus the purple we picked is gorgeous. The very first time we took it out a stranger complimented our \"beautiful stroller\". We already have a BOB Flex stroller, which is amazing and our preference for homes, long walks, etc. But we really wanted something to keep in the car that didn't take up the space the BOB does.",
