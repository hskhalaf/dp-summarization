With the weights in place, the stand easily wobbles from side-to-side like a San Francisco high-rise in an earthquake. You just need to be careful with the stand. The stand could have been easily made out of a couple pieces of stamped steel with very little extra cost. I checked Amazon and other sites for a similar size and designed steel stand w/o luck.",

The weights arrived well packaged and the manufacturer (JFit) included a note in the package assuring me that if I had any issues with the product that they would be there to take care of it. They provided an email and phone number. I could not be more pleased!",

I have large hands so it doesn't make a difference to me - in fact, the 3-lb. is almost too small for my hand! Other than that, it's a great set and comfortable to work out with. I use them all the time. I haven't assembled the rack yet, but it looks easy enough for when I stop procrastinating!",

The product came in 2 days, was easily assembled and I was using the weights within hours of receiving. I've been using them now faithfully for days and I'm still satisfied. I like that the stand was easy to assemble (5 minutes tops) and that the weights are made of a soft outer material which is easy on the hands.",

I also wish the weights had a larger diameter around the and bits- It's hard to do plank flys and plank kick backs while holding them because my hands dig into the ground. Comfortable grip and the material seems sturdy.",

I'm more inclined to just set them on the floor-- which is easy because they have that convenient hexagonal edge so they don't roll around. Also, only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the larger 8 lb weights handle area is too large to fit comfortably in my hand... And I have average sized hands for a female.",
