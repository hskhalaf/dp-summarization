      "text": "I'm very disappointed in this product. It looks great. However, more than half the time, the hose will not wind up all the way. The last 6-8 feet never seem to be able to wind up inside the unit. We end up wrapping the hose around the whole box, which defeats the purpose of the retractable hose. I would've thought that maybe I received a bad one, but I actually received the wrong hose the first time (it was the longer hose) and it also did not wind up all the way.",

I'm using this almost daily, so quality problems won't be tolerated. Love the way Amazon processed the replacement and return immediately, but it would have been better if it just worked out of the box.",

It says it is white in the description, but it is definitely not white. I'm going back to UPS again and shipping the second one back tomorrow. I love Amazon and rarely have problems with purchases. So, I just purchased thus exact item from Target and it's still not white. This is a manufacturer issue.",

I love how easily it was to install and setup...I can easily reach all of my yard with it, and when I'm done give it a tug and drop it and winds up every time. I've seen other reviews on this hose reel, and people have had issues of leaking?...have never had that problem once! Great product. Will probably buy another for front yard now",
