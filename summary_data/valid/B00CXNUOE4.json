Each arm has 1 pocket hole screw that should help to hold the arm but the screw was too short and didn't reach the wood it was supposed to be secured to. Very disappointed. I tried wood glue with large wooden clamps, but the overall feel of the chair is shaky at best and makes us nervous to hold our baby knowing the arm may give out at any second",

The other issue have with this chair is that the arm cushions slide down so they're not provided cushion over the arm rests. They need at least daily readjustments just to slip off after the next feeding.",

I'm a smaller person so it wasn't being pushed to limits or anything. It started squeaking first and WD40 didn't help. The arms separated from the chair body and the the back piece actually cracked. It's unfixable. I'd rather have spent $200+ dollars on a solid wood rocker. Don't waste your money.",
