The stand and saw had been opened, partially assembled, abandoned, poorly repacked. Hardware pouch was taped together and about 30% short. The stand was also incorrectly drilled - well actually not drilled at all. Which likely explains the return in the first place. See pic. These pieces should be identically drilled, otherwise it\u2019s impossible to assemble. Would have returned if I had an option.",

The box had a few dings, but the packaging inside is good. Set up was fairly easy. I check the 90 and 45 degree stops on the blade with a Digital Inclinometer and found it to be dead accurate on both settings out of the box. Saw runs smooth and quiet. Soft start is nice. The fold-up base is super nice and convenient. Easy to move, set-up, and put away. Cuts great with included blade. Nice saw!",

I checked the parallelism between the saw, slot, splitter, rip fence, the perpendicular of the saw, fence side with table. Almost everything is perfect setup, no extra effort. The only issue is sled bar has a play around 0.1 mm. Anything to improve? I think Bosch needs to work out the dust protection for the motor lifter. Whatever how I improve the vacuum there are always plenty of dust attached to the lifter bar and screw, soon cause it hard to move up and down.",

The arbor is not deburred and very hard to thread nut onto arbor.The rip splitter is plastic instead of metal. Overall a very cheap version of a great saw. Sorry to see bosch sell out.",

This week it started to get more more difficult to raise the blade. After stripping out the hand wheel, I tried to figure out what the problem is. Discovered the motor/blade assembly rides up and down on two smooth rods. The screw that drives the assembly up and down causes the assembly to become slightly tilted and then it binds up. The only way to raise the blade is to remove the blade insert and grasp the blade and pull up while cranking... Disappointing for a saw of this caliber.",
