Even though it says it's used, I couldn't tell from looking at it, the only thing that gave it away is that it wasn't in an original box. It was still very well packed. Only complaint I have is that it didn't come with a USB cable, but they are only $6 so it was simple to get a replacement one.",

The only reason I don't give it five stars is that the handling is not ideal for me.

Setting aperture and exposure compensation can be tricky, and I found myself often accidentally pressing the wrong part of the controller. Otherwise this is a great, lightweight camera that is easy and comfortable to carry in one hand.",

HUGE fail which makes it almost worthless. No digital camera should be harder to adjust things like aperture and shutter speed manually than on an old fashioned manual camera.
