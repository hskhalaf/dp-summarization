It does work, however, when the bathroom door is open and I just walk by on my way to another room, the light will come on and stay on for a cycle. I'm wondering how much faster the batteries will run down since I do pass by the bathroom often. I suppose I can just keep the bathroom door closed but know I won't remember to do that half the time. I'm still glad I got it but that will also depend on how often I'll need to change the batteries.",

Men with the seat up tend to get it dirty as well but it is attached to a toilet so that's a given. But at night when you walk in the bathroom and the bowl lights up automatically and starts changing colors you'll say \"Oh, cool!\" then it's worth those minor inconveniences.",

It lights up the toilet brightly at night so there are no more little boy messes on the floor in the morning. By pushing the button my child can chose one color or a rotation of colors. It is definitely a novelty. However, I'm tired of changing the batteries once a week. Writing reviews is a fun hobby for me. If you found this review helpful please click \u201chelpful\u201d below.

The only con is that the way it's made could be tweaked so that when the toilet seat is lifted for cleaning, that it would stay on/attached. As it is, it falls to the floor, if you raise the seat which holds it in place. This could be easily remedied with a slight tweak to the design.",

The sensor on this thing is great it notices you from about 5 feet away and also turns off right when you turn the light on.

He says the light is bright and very responsive to motion. I didn't realize when I bought it that the light goes INSIDE the toilet - yuck! I definitely don't want to be cleaning that! And neither does my dad. So instead he looped it around the toilet paper roll holder, so he gets the same benefit.",

This little light in the toilet bowl does not bother anyone outside the bathroom (even with the door open), and it provides enough light for all of your toilet business. It's nice to have the motion detector, instead of fumbling around for the wall switch when I'm half asleep; there's enough background light at night to make it work - amazing!!",

She was afraid to go to the bathroom at night because the nite light wasn\u2019t enough lite for her now her mom says she\u2019s not afraid anymore. So you should get two big treats for this",
