Also, I thought these would have pockets for the hand warmers on the palm and top, but it\u2019s just the top. I have reynauds, I\u2019ll need more than that. I\u2019m going to improvise pockets on my usual lighter weight gloves, as I originally planned. I do think they are made well and would be good for playing in the snow but I\u2019m in Southern California, not much occasion for that!",

I look forward to using them in the colder months and will keep updating the review as winter moves in. These are a great value for the price my only question is why don\u2019t they have them in colors.",

Switching to gloves leaves flaps exposed and in the way. Bought them mainly for use when snow blowing and they're just okay for that. Used them when attending indoor hockey and ended up sitting on them most of the time for bench warmth instead of hand warmth.",
