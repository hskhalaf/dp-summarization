      "text": "We had another set of pack and play sheets that were so loud when our little one moved in the night. She would scratch at them and every little noise became so loud, it would wake her up. We found these sheets and they are perfect! Just enough padding to add a barrier and keep things quiet, and much softer than normal pack and play sheets. They\u2019re a win-win in our book!! Also, she sleeps so much better with this sheet than her old ones! **If you found this review helpful, please mark as helpful!",

We didn't want to use a different mattress for safety reasons and this was a great alternative! Makes the mattress just a tad softer so it's a little closer to crib mattress firmness without being unsafe. Would definitely recommend these for anybody using a Pack 'n' Play for baby to sleep in.",

It's not so quilted that I feel it warrants the extra cost over a regular sheet anyway. I returned this product and purchased regular sheets.",

It has a slight padding to it which makes the hard board that comes with the Pack 'n Play more comfortable, but not enough padding for a comfy mattress-like feel for naps. We do not use this product with a mattress--only the flat, foldable board that comes with the Pack 'n Play. In my opinion the Quilted Playard Sheet is worth the few extra dollars compared to the fitted sheet, which was very loose and very thin.",

The padding isn't excessive, but the material is very nice to touch, almost like a micro-flannel. It's great for the cool nights when standard cotton sheets can feel very cold. I'm pleased and would buy it again if I need another.",
