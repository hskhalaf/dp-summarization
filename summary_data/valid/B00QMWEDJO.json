      "text": "I've been mowing grass for 59 years (!) and this is easily my favorite mower. Great \"out of box experience.\" [Swing the handle up, connect it, put the grass catcher bag on the frame, hook it in, pour in the oil (included) put in some gasoline and start it. Total time: 15 min, 11 of which was to decipher the diagrams in the booklet.] I bought it because I had a front wheel drive lawn mower that was heavier and the self-propeller just way too much work for me at my age. But this mower: you really do just lean the top bar forward and start walking. No pushing at all. Everything adjusted properly from the get go.",

Removed filter, cleaned up the excess oil, it did start back up without the filter. I have to go get a new filter so I can finish my lawn. I was about half done.",

Confusing would be an understatement. It took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to set up the unit. It should take about 10 minutes. Once I got it running, it's a gem of a machine. I would recommend using Mobil 1 5W-30 if you live in the Northeast or an area where temperatures vary significantly.",

Am able to control this with one hand, easy to back up, relatively easy to turn from a stopped position, cuts grass and picks it up very cleanly. One pull to start! My other mower(s) required multiple pulls and various \"Navel quotes\" before they would start!!! Very please with this mower and would recommend it without hesitation!!",

The bolt that holds the side discharge flap came apart within the fist year and have been wiring and duct taping ever since. The seal for the grass catcher never did work completely. Without a proper seal, grass blows in your face and all over the mower. Hope they have resolved these issues. Now, the mower won't start no many how many pulls. You would hope a mower would last at least 3 years without major hassles - and it's more than just the spark plug.",
