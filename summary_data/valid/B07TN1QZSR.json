The shoes feature understated colorways that can be worn with everything, and the appearance of white soles (for most colorways) gives them a pop that\u2019s hard not to stare at.\u00a0The comfort is surprisingly tops for these retro kicks, although enhanced arch support might make them feel all the better. Some feel that the soles are not as well-constructed as with other Puma models, but hopefully, it\u2019s only true for a small batch of the shoes.",

This V2 Smash is the same length and the toe box is the same width, but the mid shoe is a quarter of an inch wider (measured by putting sole of Smash against the sole of Smash V2.) So the Smash fits my narrow heel foot nicely, but the V2 feels bigger in ankle-heel area and doesn't provide a snug fit around the heel. There is no indication on the product page or the product packaging of Width. Giving a three-star for inconsistent fit. Five stars for color and quality. I decided to return them.",
