I gave this a try and it sure is matte and strong, but it's also strong enough where my fingers can no longer comb through my hair after the product's mixed in. I'm keeping it for when I travel to some place more humid, where a stronger hold is required to combat the humidity droop, but I'll stick to my other hair products for the day-to-day.",

I haven't had hair that thick since I was in and out of the ocean every day and ran out of conditioner. Not saying it's not a good product, just saying the thickening capabilities far exceed that of any other \"clay\" grooming product I have used.",

If your hair is too damp, it won't take, bit even after 2 shampoos, you can still feel it on your hair. All in all a decent product, though. It's way more spreadable than other clay products, but beware, it dries quickly, and holds that way, so you need to style quickly. You won't have a lot of time to fiddle with it",
