After a week of using these JVCs, I went back to my old ones. The sound quality is terrible on these. Muddy, vocals are buried, but bass is also weak. Some other reviews say they sound decent with an amp, but I'm not going to spend the money to find out. Another problem with these is comfort. They seem comfortable at first, but the hard plastic over the speakers pushes against my ears and eventually causes soreness. They are very plasticy and feel flimsy. I don't recommend.",

Of the more modestly priced options, one was wireless and kept emitting white noise whenever I moved my head in certain directions, and another had a cord but I could not increase the volume above a whisper. Then I found these JVC headphones. They are comfortable, perfectly loud, and a great price. I've recommended to several of my friends.",

I've fallen asleep while wearing these, which I probably shouldn't do because I'm afraid I'll roll over and break them, but so far, they're very good at staying in place and holding their shape. Good clear sound. The long cord gives me a lot of freedom of movement, though I do have to babysit it when I wear them in the kitchen.",

I really love the quality of sound these stereo headphones offer. I am a music lover, and it is important that I'm able to hear the instruments clearly and intensely. I really appreciate the bass boost that aids in sound quality. Also the stereo sound helps to make my meditation CDs more effective. I've noticed that other headphones that offer stereo and higher quality sound are often more expensive, especially with the popularity in gaming. These headphones, however, are very affordable.",

I got a pair of \"OBiDi - Airplane Travel Headphone Audio Jacks\" and attached them - necessary for four of the six flights she has used them on so far.

While you can hear through these phones while mowing, they do not block out the noise from the mower well enough, and the volume of your device needs to be turned up quite high to override the mower noise. Prolonged use at such a volume could cause hearing loss, so I would not recommend these be used with a power mower.

I do not have a streo to try them with so I can not say but assume they are better suited for a home audio system with a headphone jack that offers a better output. Even with my phone after adjusting the audio mix was only marginally better.",
