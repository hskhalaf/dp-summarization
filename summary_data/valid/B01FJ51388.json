The cushion fits perfectly across the top of the basket and is at just the right level. Works wonderfully. It's not quite how it was intended to be used, but it works for me.",

      "text": "I'm using this for my chronic nerve low back, left leg and foot pain. I have severe fibromyalgia. Sitting has been a big problem. Reading the ad for how using this cushion will increase circulation and decrease my pain of back, leg,feet. This has proved to be true. I even use it outside when sitting on my patio. I can sit much longer without increased pain. I suggest making a cover that can be used inside and out. I would buy it! Let me know if you make one. I will buy this second cover to use outside!
