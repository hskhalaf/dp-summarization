      "text": "This laptop has everything I need. I's powerful enough to run virtual machines and the display is such high resolution, that sometimes virtual machine or remote desktop display appear so tiny that it's hard to read. Windows 8 can (mostly) scale applications well, so there is no problem with such high resolution. Ubuntu Linux has also excellent scaling mechanism built in the latest version. The laptop is large enough that it may not fit some laptop compartments, but it's thin and light. It does not have Ethernet port built in, but Dell offers a nice USB Ethernet adapter for it, for about $30. Overall I'm very satisfied with this laptop.",

It's basically the same specs as a maxed out MBP, but it has even more: touch screen and better nvidia graphics. I like OSX, but the software I use only runs on Windows, so I feel like this is a great alternative to a MBP, oh and I saved 1000 dollars with this PC compared to a MBP.",

The keyboard lights up, the screen stays dark, and I've had it sitting for five minutes or more like that - with no sign of anything other than the fan running at full tilt and heat being generated. I'm forced to power down and power back up again. This happens more than half the time when I open the lid and hit the power button to wake it up. In the course of a week, I've also had three BSOD's upon waking and/or startup.",
