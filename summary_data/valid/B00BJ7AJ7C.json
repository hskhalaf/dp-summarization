      "text": "I purchased a pair of these because I like to play the Battlefield series in three screen wide-angle mode and they have been perfect for that, yielding good frame rates and smooth, stutter-free gameplay. In truth, there are better values in graphics bang for the buck but I was willing to pay the rather steep tariff for the ultimate graphics experience and I haven't been disappointed. These cards tend to run right at their rated temperature limit of 80C but they have been flawless and reliable. For those who want the very best and don't mind paying for it.",

I have an i7 3770 on an H77 board, so it's older and not designed with OC in mind. I'm very happy with the Adobe Premiere encoding speed which was dramatically faster than before.",

The installation was also much more trouble-free than my previous Radeon HD 7950 (I had a hard time trying to install AMD driver in linux). It is possible to enable fast double precision in Linux. However, the Linux driver doesn't allow one to change clock frequency, change fan speed, set up a target temperature, or overclock the monitor. These functions are not necessary, but NVIDIA should have added a \"windows only\" footnote when they advertised about these features.",

The only down side is that it doesn't come with the same software as it's EVGA counterpart, but you can download the good stuff from EVGA and it works just fine!",
