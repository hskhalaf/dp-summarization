It was stupid easy to put together. The design of this bed frame was well thought out. I was quite impressed really. The cross sections that go from head to foot are jointed in the center so it makes for a sturdy/solid sit on the floor. I'm sure this will be 100% fine for extra curricular activity, The center section has 8 bars running across that have a special notch with special markers on them. Its all labeled well.",

After about another month, and now the bed squeaks so much just from getting in and out of bed that it disturbs everybody. I can't even shift my sleeping position in the morning without waking my partner. Dislike!",

I must have misunderstood the meaning of 18\", though I do think the actual clearance should be denoted as 16\", since it is likely needed for storage. Realistically decreases storage room by 960 cubic inches. Otherwise, seems to be just fine. I will update this as things progress (sturdiness, ease to install headboard, etc.).",

I'm single, so there isn't any extreme activity truly testing out the bed frame. And, no, the dogs haven't figured out they have room to sleep under the bed yet.",
