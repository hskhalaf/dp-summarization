      "text": "This was so easy to install. I love that it is removable so I can run it through the dishwasher from time to time to really get it clean. It is really secure and will not fall down. It's a tension suction which is more effective that just a standard suction cup. It looks nice and functions perfectly. It keeps the soap in great condition, with a proper amount of drainage.",
