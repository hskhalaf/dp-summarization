They dig in a little- not recommended if you have a healthy-sized booty like myself. PRO: An important pro- it does not roll down. It has a gel or rubber top which keeps it in place.",

I haven't had any trouble with them rolling and they are long enough for my 5'10\" frame (hits an inch or 2 below my bra). The compression is only in the waist so the panty part is very comfortable and doesn't dig in funny. The material is also thick and seems to be good quality. Very pleased so far!",
