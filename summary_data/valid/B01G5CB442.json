Because they aren't cheap I crumble them up and sprinkle them on her food with canned dog food so I'm not throwing money away. They aren't brown either - they are green and really soft. Maybe they will work for some of you. But for me it is just easier to go back to the packets.",

It has been a pain and an absolute mess at times. Grotesque. I won't go into further detail. You get the picture. These have been a GOD SEND. While they are a little bit pricey they are absolutely worth it! They keep them healthy and helped one of my dogs gain the weight he so desperately needed. They are pretty picky eaters so it took them a while to get used to them but now they love them like treats. I'll be ordering forever!!",

He is doing great now and I feed him these treats more infrequently for maintenance. Can only recommend this product :) By the way, this is one of the rare occasions, where you not only have Probiotics, but also the needed Prebiotics all in one product.

I have tried chewable forms of supplements before and never had much success as they would turn their noses. They love these as much as treats! Absolutely a must for anyone with a k9 that is experiencing tummy problems. PS: My lab is also shedding less which a miracle in itself.",
