It was fine for about two months, but after that, I couldn't get the shackle to lock/click in the body of of the lock; it simply stopped working. Accidentally, I applied pressure on the shackle before I had it lined up with the hole, and it clicked into place OUTSIDE of the hole. I'm not terribly worried about theft, and think it will work fine in this limited way, but I would much prefer it work properly. I'm sure the product, in general, is a fine one. I just got unlucky.",
