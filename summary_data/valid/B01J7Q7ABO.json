      "text": "We as a family have used Britax car seats for all 3 of our children. Needed a second for other vehicle and this car seat was a upgraded style of original car seat. I have to say the steel reinforcement frame is great improvement over plastic frame of older one, but I do like the cover of older one better comfort wise, but the new style is much easier to clean though, this feels more plastic. Overall very happy with car seat, and always trusted Britax to keep our children safe in cars, Praying we never have to rely on this to keep kids safe.",

      "text": "We bought a Britax infant car seat and stroller for our current (2nd) baby but he's growing out of it so that one will be going to our 3rd baby arriving in a few weeks. When this car seat camr we put our 10 month old in it and he looked very comfortable. There's a lot of room to grow and it has plenty of cushion. The fabric seems east to clean and durable. We'll see how it hold up for the next couple of years between 2 babies. So far we have loved the infant seat and we love this one!",

      "text": "Here is a graco booster smallest setting for my 2 year old 25lbs The britax. And the graco marathon sized up to fit my 35lb 5 year old . I love graco for many reasons including the ease of pressing the top button to adjust shoulder straps but the metal framing and ease of latching has me swooning over the britax. My 5 year old is tiny and thin at 35lb barely 3 feet and she could fit into the britax but she was in between sizes for the shoulder straps. My 2 year old looks so snug in the britax. Def wish i splurged and got it when my 5 year old was a baby.",
