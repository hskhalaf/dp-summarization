      "text": "I have done some simple testing of PM 2.5 with visibility and other PM measurements. Also by turning my HEPA filter on and off in my rooms, and the meter seems accurate. I have discovered that to turn the monitor off it is really necessary to hold the on/off button down for 3-4 seconds. If this is not done, the monitor will go into a standby mode and continue to drain the battery even though the screen is off.",
