In terms of size they are bigger than they look on images and won't fit smaller ears. And what's also important the call quality on the other end is quite bad.

The foam ear tips are so much more comfortable then the usual rubber kind. battery life is great, sound quality is great and the be aware mode is nice for when you need to hear your surroundings.",
