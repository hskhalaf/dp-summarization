It is sturdy enough, but something about the slide material seems like it would eventually give in, either from usage or breaking down the slide one too many times.",

Aside from that, this slide doesn't look safe at all. It's not that sturdy. And we had to help our 2 yr-old to get up on the slide since the steps are a bit steep.

It's a good angle so they actually get a little speed but obviously so short that you don't worry about too much speed. All in all the perfect kiddie slide!",
