I bought these to replace my old 608v3 shoes, and I bought the same size and width. While the old 608v3 shoes fit my feet perfectly, the new 608v5 shoes are much too narrow up front, causing my big toe to jam into the side of the shoe. The rest of the shoe feels the same in terms of length and in terms of width along the rest of the shoe. I don't know why New Balance would make such a dramatic change in the fit (or last) but keep the same model number. Very disappointing.",

As a result, it presses against the bottom of my ankle and causes my little toe to go spastic. A mile into my walk, my ankle and little toe are numb on my right foot.",

      "text": "These sneakers fit me well and are comfortable. My only complaint so far is that the little loop in the tongue to keep it in place is high up on the tongue and gets in the way of tightening and loosening the laces when putting them on and taking them off. Using the top holes for the laces is not comfortable for me. Last year, I had trouble finding sneakers in a wide width at a reasonable price, so I was happy to find these. I've been walking between 3 and 4 miles a day in them. Haven't had a chance to do much else in them because of the pandemic.",

No pain or discomfort at he end of the day. So overall I would highly recommend these shoes over the rest.",

      "text": "They do look pretty good, but the comfort and materials they're made from are terrible... Through the original (V1 which was great) up to this V5, these have gotten consistently worse and worse. Padding in the tongue is virtually gone now, so the laces dig into the top of your foot during most any activity, even just walking. The padding around the ankle opening is virtually gone too, allowing pressure points and your heal to slide up and down. The sole bottom is now flat with minimal tread features - looks like something you'd get at the dollar store. Congrats to the designers for finally getting the mfg costs under $1...",

As I continued to wear these I actually developed a sore on the toe and they started to hurt to wear them. Since the return period was long gone I put these in the closet and purchased another pair (difference style). Hoping these don't develop the same problem. I purchased these instead.",
