I didn't like the large pregnancy pillows that wrap around the whole body as I felt they were very overwhelming and hard to flip from side to side in middle of the night without waking up the whole neighborhood.

I change sides a million times every night and it is so much easier to flip over in the middle of the night without getting tangled in blankets and a giant pregnancy pillow. I also like being able to place this pillow in different areas that I feel I need a little extra support!",

It's just more comfortable for me.",

So far I've washed the pillow cover a few times. It does pill after a few washes. Highly recommend as it will keep your hips aligned while sleeping.",
