I ordered three of these, and the other two worked fine, but the third one isn't safe to use. . . it's very resistant to being \"opened\" (having the blade pushed out), and once it's out all the way, the blade won't go back in. I almost cut myself, multiple times, just trying to get the blade to go back. And then I couldn't get the knife open to try to fix it. Definitely a problem. Would be okay if I could return it, or get a replacement, but apparently that's not an option.",

I was shock to find for such a simple product, it must got out of factory without even going through some basic test.
