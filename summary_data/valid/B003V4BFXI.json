What's even better... you can plug in HEADPHONES so you don't have to hear them as they practice if you have other things going on or need some quiet time while they're still playing. :)",

It wasn't damaged and plays but I kept the packaging for a bit to make sure it wasn't all damaged.",

All the different tones and rhythms provide endless combinations for the curious and experimental young (and old) minds. Great keyboard!!!

Once it came out of the box, she was immediately noodling around on it, and playing with the numerous sound effect features. We'll do our best to encourage her to stick with the self-paced lessons, but even if she doesn't, this doesn't break the bank. I'm finding it to be a lot of fun myself, so if she gives up maybe mom will take a crack at tickling the ivories. :-P",

I looked at the DVD on my computer and TV the lessons are great. I believe with practice he will learn the basics of playing, however, the quality of the DVD needs to be better. For that reason I gave it four stars.I am very pleased with this product! I do recommend it.",
