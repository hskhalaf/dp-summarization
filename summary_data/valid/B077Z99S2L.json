      "title": "Great $25 pair of gym shoes!",
      "text": "I always try to weigh performance and affordability when it comes to gym shoes. I give my gym shoes a pretty intense beating and inevitably run through them pretty quickly. I expect these to hold up quite well for longer than expected. I normally wear a size 11.5-12 but was told to buy a size smaller. The fit, width wise, was perfect but for some reason the length appears to be a bit longer than expected. Definitely not a deal breaker. I'm not crazy about the pinkish/reddish color either but also definitely not a deal breaker for $25. I would recommend these if you're just using them for working out or casual wear.",
