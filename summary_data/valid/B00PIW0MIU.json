I have not raced or anything in them, and not sure if I would as I have not had them very long, but I have done roughly 15 miles in them, and they are holding up well and they seem to be the shoe everyone has been talking about on here.

Having said all that, I'm an underpronator (supinator), mid-foot striker so I need a neutral shoe like this and I'm hoping the small amount of added rubber to the sole increases the long-term wear of this shoe.

I'm a heel-striker and the offset on these shoes really helped with that. I had some mild back-pain from running, but these shoes really helped to minimize that with it's plush cushioning. It's hard to find a pair of running shoes that have Cadillac cushioning but remain on the lower end of the range for weight of running shoes.",

    "description": "The Zealot ISO supplies maximum cushioning, minimal weight and dynamic, foot-hugging ISOFIT in a low-profile package to push you further than ever before Upper A revolution in upper construction, the Saucony Zealot ISO Running Shoes feature intelligent upper engineering, designed to work with the mechanics of the the foot throughout the gait cycle to create one of the most dynamic and adaptable fits on the market. According to the Running USA 2013 National Runner Survey, 92% of respondents surveyed selected \"fit\" as the most important criteria when purchasing running shoes. Capitalising on this their designers have created a revolution in fit. ISOFIT. A plush, ultra soft inner sleeve crafted from a malleable air mesh, contours to the wearers foot, creating an almost sock like feel. Binding the midfoot together and providing structural integrity the floating support cage cradles the midfoot; adapting to the foot's size, shape and movement, allowing the shoe to respond to the individual runner's gait throughout each stride. Midsole Complimenting the design and technology of ISOFIT an open toe box construction enhanced the already plush feel and delivers superior comfort. Creating a truly unique feel and experience Saucony have re engineered their PowerGrid technology, creating PWRGRID+. By adding a Powerfoam material and integrating it with GRID technology, Saucony have created a system that effectively centres the foot, absorbs impact and distributes pressure. The PWRGRID+ platform's increased stack heights deliver over 20% more cushioning and 15% more resiliency than the previous version, increasing versatility and prolonging the longevity of the shoes capabilities. The re-engineered geometry and materials work with the runners stride, maintaining a smooth and fluid transition, for an unmatched ride. Outsole Working in concert with the re-engineered PWRGRID+ technology, SRC impact zone provides durable shock absorption at impact",
