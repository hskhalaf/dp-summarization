It does keep trying to pair if he doesn't turn it off at home, which confused us a few times as we heard something talking down the hall late at night as it tried to pair with a phone that was a bit too far away. Lesson: turn it off when you're not using it! Our 4-year-old has also discovered that she can listen to music on the hat, and will appropriate it sometimes.",
