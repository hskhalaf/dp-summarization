However Microsoft have written net meeting to use random ports so you can't configure the router around this. The only thing to do is switch the router off which leaves you completly unprotected while video conferencing. Read up on your firewalls before you buy and find out if they have issues with the internet software you use. I still use it but wish I'd looked into it a bit more before buying",

I have to turn it off once inwhile from it losing its settings or something. Other than that I can only hope the firewall is working(not sure how to check). Good item? up to you to decide.",

THerefore, you cannot host more than one web site. Also, you get no real control over the NAT, and no way to turn it off. We returned the product and and looking at the DLink DFL 300 instead.

    "description": "D-Link DI-704 Internet Gateway and Firewall with 4 Port Switch (View amazon detail page) ASIN: B0000504DH\n\nAMAZON.COM\nDesigned for home or small-business PCs, the D-Link DI-704 is a broadband gateway with four switched Fast Ethernet ports that delivers complete hardware firewall protection for a PC. Allowing multiple computers to share one IP address to access the Internet via a cable or DSL modem, the DI-704 provides four 10/100 dual-speed Ethernet ports and one 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port for a cable or DSL modem or other broadband access device. The DI-704 can support up to 32 computers with firewall protection using the same ISP through its Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) that provides dynamic allocation of IP addresses.\n\n Installing the system is easy: simply plug the DI-704 into your DSL or cable modem, then plug your computer's Ethernet cable into the DI-704.\n\n The DI-704 acts as a natural firewall to protect your computer from intruders. Once your computer is set up to access the Internet through the DI-704, your network is invisible behind the DI-704. However, because some games and Internet applications work only with direct computer interaction, you can open specific ports to operate without the protection of the firewall to ensure that these applications will run properly.\n\n Advanced options, including NAT firewall protection, DMZ host, setting the IP range and domain name for DHCP, and changing access rights for different computers, can be set up via your Web browser. Compliant with IEEE 802.3 standards, the DI-704 works with any Ethernet device and multiple types of machines and operating systems.\n\n D-Link provides a lifetime warranty on the DSL/cable gateway and four-port switch.",
