The first one i bought when he was a yearling and hes now 4 yrs old, so hes since graduated to his \"big boy\" halter. The colors are vibrant (& stay that way), super adjustable, the poly cord is very flexible. Not stiff and not floppy. Even after being well used for years! I will continue to purchase these specific halters, from this company, for the rest of my life & would gladly recommend them to anyone interested in a great quality & affordable halter! ~Extremely satisfied customer",

Just to give you an idea on how well this halter works as far as pressure, I use this halter as a bitless bridle. My horse responds better to it than she did when she rode with a bit!",

My filly (5 months old) has a very small delicate face, the nose is a little small/ snug, but she has lots of room to grow through the pole (weanling size) . Because of this I'm probably gonna have to get her the yearling size here really soon and it's going to be huge all around. Love the quality and craftsmanship of this halter! ** Friend added the para cord to this halter, it does not come with the pretty details. Halter was snug before para cord was added.**",

This halter has the same, stiff quality that's important for subtle, vibrational cues and tiny corrections. My horse now stands and tips her nose into it, because I promise to be very careful with the nerves the knots contact. I recommend anyone who's using rope halters do the same. A little vibration goes a long way and is generally all you need to communicate effectively.",

It stays tied where it is suppose to, and I have even used it as a bit less bridle when riding my older horse. Good all around piece of equipment.",

It fits perfect, other than the noseband knots being slightly too close together for her nose (i wish they were slightly farther apart so it seated on each side of that nose bone for better control). I love this halter regardless- the pink is more of a coral pink than a hot pink but it's still beautiful. My old-timey vet says this is like the original rope halters and loves how stiff it is.

I am not a professional trainer but felt like this halter gave me the edge to halter train my colt on my own. Would highly recommend this.
