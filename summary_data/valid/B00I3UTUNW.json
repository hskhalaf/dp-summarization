Picture quality is great if you know to use the focus knob on the side of the unit. Sound is good for how small the unit is. Picture is clear in lighted rooms with even small print. It works with my Iphone 5 with no problems with the correct cable bought from amazon. Just Plug and play. Unlike other reviews i haven't had any issues with the product. I would recommend to everyone if your looking for a awesome projector at a good price this is it. I use my for a non-profit group for seminars and more.",

I had misread the discription and thought it came with an HDMI/mini-HDMI cable. The MHL adaptors are hard to find, and didn't come with the projector (nor the ASUS laptop or my Samsung phone). Might be returning this due to the adaptor issue. ASUS failed in not providing another connection. Really - how much would it be for ASUS to include an extra connector? Or at least recommend the purchase of the connector with the unit.",

I bought this to watch occasional movies in my small condo with minimal setup and clutter. I still store it in the coffee table drawer, but there's set up required and then a cord I have to step over. 1/2) You need a very dark room for viewing. My place is pretty dark. so I can watch in the day, but my boyfriend's apartment is too bright even with all blinds closed. Also it's hard to multitask without light. Makes it hard to eat and watch, for instance. I'd still recommend it for the price.",

I'm able to leave my side lamp on and it not interfere with brightness from the unit. The on-board sound works fine for a cozy quite environment. I'm using an HDMI cable to my PC where sound is abundant. Real-time battery life is around a movie and a half. Charges fast. I also use a blue-tooth transmitter when I go portable to send sound to an amplified device. Small footprint, great price.",

Our first movie was Hotel Transylvania while lying in bed with our seven year old granddaughter.

I use it with cheap CCTV stand in my living room and on ceiling in bedroom (I get about 1,8m screen diagonal in both cases). Watching movies and browsing web is a true joy, but place needs to be dark. As you can use only HDMI as input source so I recommend Chromecast and link it with compatible device (screen mirroring). The nice thing about it is that projector can power up Chromecast, so you are in no need to seek for power elsewhere.",
