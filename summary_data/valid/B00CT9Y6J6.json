Sooo, if you need something heavy-duty, this won't suffice, and if you don't need heavy duty, there are much less expensive options that will suffice. This is a waste.",

This unit is has improvements in on/off switch and speed adjuster over the first, but the beaters don't seem to be in proper sync. I could run the original mixer at full speed, and batter would NEVER splatter outside of the bowl. This unit is horrible with that. Even on slow speeds it splatters batter all over the danged place. I expect to clean a mixing bowl, but not the counter top, wall, and nearby appliances after a round with this beast. I can't recommend this item.",

      "text": "My old KitchenAid hand mixer was starting to make noises. I purchased this because of the different speeds and the attachments. Which I do like. Really like the Soft Start. I have a little bit of a hard time pushing the arrows up and down and it\u2019s heavier than I anticipated. I do like the speeds. I\u2019m a little concerned that it smells like wiring burning. Nothing smoking just smells. Maybe it\u2019s because I have only used it twice. Overall I like it",

I didn't think there was such a thing!) Also, there doesn't seem to be a huge difference in the power behind each successive increase in speed. In other words, the highest setting isn't a whole lot different from the one several notches below it. The KitchenAid definitely feels a lot sturdier than my previous mixer, and I hope it will last longer.",

I like the options the accessories give me, and it doesn't hurt that this mixer is pretty. I'm especially looking forward to using the dough hooks for meatloaf to save my hands freezing (as another reviewer recommended). Initial impression = five starts. Should anything change, I'm pretty good about updating reviews.",

Helpful tip is definitely use the speeds recommended in the booklet to achieve the end product you are hoping to make. I absolutely love it. Am not sorry that I bought this instead of KichenAid's stand mixer. Probably if I baked and cooked more frequently, but being user of this mixer every other day leaves my counters free for other small appliances used daily.",

This one has a specific blade for each side, a turn on and off button and then arrow keys to increase/decrease the speed. Just a bit awkward. I do love the dough hooks though. The mixer's performance is excellent. I just find that I fumble when operating it. It matches my red appliance theme nicely - if that matters.",
