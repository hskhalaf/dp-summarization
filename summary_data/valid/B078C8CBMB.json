      "text": "I ordered this portable Spin Dry to use in our motor home that did not come with a washer dryer installed. I do not like spending money in a laundry mat on vacation and I thought this little unit would be perfect for our needs. It did what I wanted BUT I still had to take the clothes to the laundry to finish drying them. The good news though is--it took only about 45 minutes to completely dry three loads of clothes in one dryer. Just a few minutes for each load was all that was needed. I can live with that. I know I will get many years of use from this small portable spin dryer.",

This spin dryer gets approximately 1 to 1,3 liters of water out of laundry removed from the washing machine. The drying process after that is a lot faster using either drying rack or dryer. Runs without a lot of noise. Saves time and energy. Almost all parts are made of plastic but I think that keeps the price reasonable.",

Jeans may take longer, but almost anything else is pretty dry after using this spinner. It's great!",

They should put some rollers on the inside of the case near the top of the Laundry Basket (the part that spins) so when tips it can't go so far that it unbalances the load.",
