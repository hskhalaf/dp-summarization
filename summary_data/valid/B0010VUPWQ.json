But the handle is glued on with cheap rubbery crap and the rivet on the sheath is loose. After twenty bulbs, the handle detached from the shaft. I can certainly fix the problems with about ten minutes in the shop and a little quality epoxy, but its annoying to have to fix a brand new tool before you can use it. Makers of tools like this should have a little pride and ethic about their finished product and have the sense to use glue of a quality equal to the components.",
