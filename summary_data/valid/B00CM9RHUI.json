I was trying to contact seller but they didn\u2019t respond it\u2019s already been couple of weeks. Don\u2019t buy this juicer especially from this seller! It was $300 when I bought it and they promote that their warranty is 15 years. That\u2019s obviously not true. I\u2019m really upset and disappointed with this purchase. I end up buying Slowstar 2000 from Tribest juicer. And it\u2019s so much better!!! Easier to use and clean and doesn\u2019t clog itself at all. Faster but with without worming the juice. Omega was warming the juice a lot!",

I have had perhaps a dozen juicers over the years, but nothing has worked well with leafy greens. Also, the other types of juices really aerates the juice too much and waste a lot of the green juice. I purchased this to supplement my diet with more green juice. This machine is tough enough to have replaced my other juicers for now. I am really impressed.",

I'd say juicing takes about 15-20 minutes tops to make the juice and clean up the parts. I make about 2 pints per session. The juice that results is very delicious, and the machine appears to be very efficient extracting the juice as the remaining pulp is extremely dry. Also the machine, being a horizontally layed out, fits conveniently on the counter top. I would recommend this juicer to anyone.",

It makes a loud sound squeaking sound when on (no food was in chute, it shouldn't do that) & the filter area is so tiny on this thing (see pic) that when juice is pressed it cannot go thru the filter after a short period due to build up of pulp that didn't get pushed out at the end. (P.S. the juice quality is amazing when it actually comes out). Also on the design, it looks like a sewing machine, not a juicer. I ordered the Omega VRT, hopefully that will work better & I'll update. :)",
