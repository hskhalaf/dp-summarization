I installed all the clips backwards, thus needed a whole new set of clips. I followed the replacement instructions on their website and received new clips within 4 days. Amazing company response.

The slow delivery and reordering process is why I subtracted a star. Overall, I would recommend for a child, but probably not ideal for an adult.",

I was initially worried about the way the slats were designed, however once it was assembled I felt it was very sturdy. The storage drawers underneath give plenty of storage space while looking nice and tidy. My daughter absolutely loves her new bed, even our dog approves. \ud83d\ude01 Overall I am very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this bed to others.",

I'm very handy, it took over 2 hours to put together, instructions are a little bit vague but I kept looking at the pictures and followed the letters marked on the pieces and compared them to the photo's. You MUST decide which side the drawers will go on, bf you assembly, you can change your mind but it's more work to change. This in not cheaply made, but it's not for adults. You dont use a box spring, mattress sits on the wood slats (fairly strong).",

Overall, we love the bed but the smell is KILLING us... such a bummer.",

We were about done (putting together the drawers) when we realised that we were missing the peice \"s\" which is four whole pieces of the drawers. Needless to say we were not able to finish the bed that day. Idk about you, but if I had known that it would have been such a hassle, I would've bought something else.",
