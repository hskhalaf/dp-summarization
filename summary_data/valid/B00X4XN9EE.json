Makes the whole trellis look cheap. The instructions say to use a hammer to pound the poles into the ground. DON\u2019T DO THAT. The poles are made of fiberglass. Thus the hammer will pretty much destroy the tops of the poles. Also stand upwind when drilling or hammering the trellis. Otherwise get ready to breathe in bits of fiberglass fibers. Yuck.",
