For some buyers, the Gel Epirus may have flaws like a narrow fit. But just like other Asics shoes, its pros outnumber its cons. \u00a0Once broken-in, the level of comfort that the Asics Gel Epirus provides is unparalleled. It flaunts an easy-to-wear aesthetic that evidently gives the nod to its classic roots. Also, it is lightweight and offers excellent support.",
