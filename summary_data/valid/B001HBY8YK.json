The unit I received was in a blister-packed package in which the plastic cover was only stapled to the cardboard backing. So perhaps this was a return that the seller resold without verifying whether it worked. In either case, regardless of whether the manufacturer or the seller is to blame (or both), I'd return the thing in a second if it wasn't only $6. Not worth the hassle of repackaging, labeling, etc.",

I\u2019ve broken the mirrors on them all at some point. The telescoping handle on this mirror is robust... in a good way. It reminds me of a snap-on/bluepoint mirror. It doesn\u2019t bend. Also it extends quite a ways past the general mirror. I\u2019m impressed quite honestly. I\u2019m buying another.

The length is easily adjustable holding its position well as does the mirror itself. The 2\" size seems to be about right to get into nooks and crannies. I'd like to point out thie mirror itself is made of glass with the shaft a chrome plated metal Overall I think this is an excellent product, especially at the price. 5 STARS",

The Telescope is lightweight, but very good quality! (I really couldn't believe it was this reasonable.) The neck of it REALLY adjusts to whatever angle you move it to.

Overall, it's very affordable, looks good, and functions well. From this viewpoint, the product met my expectations. I wish the mirror was a little bit bigger, but, again, it really depends what you use it for. The mirror remains stable, and I like that the handle is covered with the black material that makes it more convenient to use.",
