As many other people commented, you can see the particle board showing through at the corners of each piece, but I just used a brown Sharpie to cover them before I put it together. I haven't \"pulled\" the table around because I don't want to risk breaking the bottom shelf but I was considering adding some wheels to make moving it easier.

      "text": "This is a pretty cool inexpensive piece of furniture. Of course it was kind of a pain in the butt to put it together but that is the case with most of these things that you have to put together yourself because you don't pay very much for them. It had a few scratches but otherwise was in good condition. It is very sturdy and The Lift Top is the best part of the whole thing. I lift it up and down at least 2 or 3 times a day. It is sturdy and seems to be holding up",

I would definitely recommend and would purchase other Sauder products in the future.
