They scan, fax, copy without a problem. Scan in Color, gray scale, or B/W. You can copy from the flat bed or through the auto feed. We print our envelopes and own letterhead. Of course I would buy it again.",

Has all the other features scan, copy, fax, etc. It paper jams frequently where the 5470 rarely jammed. The dual trays are not compatible with each other so they have to be bought separately. Toner is expensive on both, the the newest one is even more so expensive, wish I would have just replaced on the old one the laser fuser which runs around 150. Or just found that model for sale somewhere.",

My laptop is on the first floor and my printer as far away as possible on the second floor. However, the WiFi has functioned perfectly. Second, setting the printer up was a major task. The instructions provided little help and I called Customer Service. The service rep was excellent and very-I stress \"very\" here, patient. It took about 1/2 hour with the service rep to get the printer fully functional. My suggestion for Brother is to provide better instructions as the set-up was far more technical than the set-up manual indicated. I would buy this again.",

It prints super fast and easily handles the loads of printing we do. A big selling point was the built in USB port at the front so we can scan docs to a flash drive right from the unit. Good all in one without the bulk of some other models. Recommend!",

After roughly a year (and after the warranty had conveniently expired), every page that came out of the printer was wrinkled. Some pages were worse than others, but all had some sort of wrinkle. Brothers response was that since it was out of warranty, we would have to take it to an authorized Brother repair shop and the closest was several town away. So instead of traveling with the printer and having to pay to get it fixed, we bought a new HP printer and are happier with that",
