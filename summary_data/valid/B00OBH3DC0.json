I have killed so many of the others, all because the split design of those models, supposedly for \"easy cleaning,\" but the problem is that if even a little bit of water gets inside, that always ends up jamming the axle shaft, or my last one from Cuisinart had a cheap plastic driver that the axle eventually wore out. This one is an all-in-one, solid metal model, so there should be no problems like the split models.",

It is the whisk blade that works so well, and when my cheap chinese stick blender with this special whisk blade broke that I decided to purchase a Bamix. It's so awesome because you can dump all the mayo ingredients in with the oil and it just emulsifies it like magic. No oil drizzling. This recipe is available at ProbioticJar dot com. After years of wanting to make healthy mayonnaise, I finally have the tools and the know-how. Here's a picture of my favorite tomato sandwich on sourdough!",

It is still going strong, however I left it for my \"X\" because I didn't think that I would miss it. After 10 years of being without it, I finally ordered this one, not knowing the model # that I originally purchased. With the quality and reputation of this Hand Blender, I was not afraid to purchase a used one. It was $113, however I decided to apply for Amazon Visa in order to get $70, additionally taken off the price...so I only paid $43!!!! Way to go Amazon.",

For the lady who complained she couldn't separate the bit from the stem -- keep a glass of warm, sudsy water handy. Run the mixer a moment in it Every Time before you put it up. Otherwise, crud builds up between the spindle & head. UPDATE: A year passed and I love it even more. Tiny blade puree's an 8Qt pot of beans more efficiently than the C brand (which now wobbles). Don't know if a year of big bean pots will wear this out, but it does a wonderful job. High speed can flip breaker switch sometimes.",
