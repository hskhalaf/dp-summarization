He doesn't seem to care for it any more than any other brand, but that seems to just be his personality. He seems energetic/lively (for a 10 year old greyhound anyway) and otherwise in pretty decent health. Gave it 5 stars because I don't really see any reason to rate it negatively. Seems like a decent brand of dog food for senior dogs.",
