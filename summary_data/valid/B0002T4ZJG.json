Only herb-like spices work fine; my garlic and onion powders (for example) are hard balls and cannot be used. I'm very disappointed in this product.",

The lids were a bit flimsier than expected with a light plastic rather than glass. The spouts work well and the prepackaged labels were that static cling material that you find with window decals. Tossed them as soon as we opened the package because they looked kind of tacky.",
