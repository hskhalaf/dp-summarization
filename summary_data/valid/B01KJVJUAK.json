I think this one is much sturdier even though it's got Velcro. Having said that, we've only been out with a few times. I'm hoping she can't get out of this one, but we'll see. I was very glad for the size chart and instructions - it fits perfectly. It's also ridiculously cute. The tiny pockets are functional! I just thought they'd be decorative. It's not like I'll cut anything in it - it would maybe fit a dime! - but it's a really nice little feature. Maybe I'll try to post lics later.",

The material isn\u2019t too thick which made it easier to sew things on. And it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll be too terribly hot because it\u2019s pretty lightweight.
