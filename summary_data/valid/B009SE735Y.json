However one issue that seems to be present in all versions of this is that if you move too much while playing the cartridge wiggles a bit in the slot and tends to freeze. On that note if you stick something else in the slot to fill up the empty space the issue is fixed. Please make the cartridge slot a bit skinnier in the future if you can, otherwise fantastic product.",

Eventually you won't be able to switch between the two without forcing the cartridge into the connector and actually holding it down to play. The screen shorts out depending on how you hold the device. It's overpriced for the quality. I returned mine the next day when it didn't work new out of the box.

Take what the YouTube gaming channels have to say about the unit with a grain of salt. As most were given the red version for free. I really wanted this to work. I returned the item.",

The box's seals had been cut and the adapter's plastic baggie had been opened as had the power cable. The actually device was like new but did not work perfectly. the screen often flickered and i could not play an actually game for more than 30 seconds. The games worked fine on my other snes systems, so it had to be the device. I am in middle of returning this item and filing a complaint. Beware buying from Deal Cavern as a seller.",
