We're keeping it to use on the golf cart and craft room, and it's back to the drawing board for my son. In AudioPet's defense, their company website does say it might not work with the Nano, but I didn't find that until after we started having problems. My bad for relying just on Amazon reviews.",

      "text": "Warning...these speakers work best if you have an Apple phone. Very problematic if using an android phone or tablet. The speaker is very cute and petite but was sad my husband couldn't use it with his pixel phone or android tablet. It was a gift for him which he can't use. The speaker tries to take over the keyboard and keeps scrolling and randomly changes settings. It was a fight to get music or a show to play. Works great though with our Apple products.",

My 10, 9, and 6 year old all agree with me that this little sucker packs a punch - it comes with a small drawstring to loop into the ear and hang on their backpack or a hook in their room. Also comes with a usb cable to charge the speaker which I used with our regular iPhone wall charger and voila! it's perfection. Great buy, planning on gifting for others in our family as well!
