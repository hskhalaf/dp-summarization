However, I don't recall it saying on the box or in the instructions that there are lighting options. Originally thought I had a defective unit because only two lights came on. By accident a friend pulled the chain again and the other two lights came on. A third pull, we were getting the hang of it now, turned on all four lights. The product itself is good, just be aware.",
