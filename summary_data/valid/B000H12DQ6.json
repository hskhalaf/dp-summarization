The plastic insert plates aren't level with the table. The electrical switch with lock out capabilities is nice, but getting your router plugged into it is burdensome.

The universal mounting worked very well, and I had no issues mounting a RIOBI router from my old routing table, and getting it set up. I highly recommend this routing table, esp. if looking for one to fit the 4512 like I was, and not being stuck with a proprietary mounting system is a big plus.",

Secondly, the router can be installed two ways on the mounting plate, but only fits one way.... The correct install is the wood handles placed horizontally... Lastly, the small set screws meant to level the surface. Do Not turn then all the way in, you only need about half....",

I then found out that half of these routers were out of production. In the end I chose the router based on what fit the table, a very small selection, rather than the router that fit my needs. In the end a router table is a pretty simple tool one main purpose and this table accomplishes that purpose very well. Sturdy, good surface work area, well built, light weight. If you are looking at a router table, try to find the list of routers it supports.",

Was considering several, including the other Bosch table, but the quality of this table FAR exceeds all that I know on the market. Start with the base, and concern that it is constructed of plastic, not to worry, very stout. The table and fence are aluminum, and machined. The router insert is heavy aluminum, with eight screws for plane adjustment with the table, although this requires some patience to get precise, will support any heavy router. Assembly took a while, but the instructions (included) were very consise, and well ilustrated.",
