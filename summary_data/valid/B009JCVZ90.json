It was easy to assemble. My toddler and preschooler have yet to knock this one over, and it balances coats far better than our previous wooden rack did. I love the lower layer of hooks, as do my three children. They love that they can reach to hang up their own jackets and get them down. It's sturdy, balanced well, and is thus far holding up well to the daily use of a family of five. I am very pleased.",

      "text": "I wanted something we could use for both coats and swim suits/towels. This works great. I was able to eliminate the middle section to make it lower, because it is a very tall coat rack and we aren't using it in an entry way. I wanted something a little lower that is more discreet and easier for the kids to reach. With a few modifications it is working great as a multi-purpose coat rack and drying rack in our sunroom. The quality of this is very good. It is sturdy, well made, and looks very nice. I highly recommend this as a great priced, great quality standing coat rack!",

Has 4 legs which makes it very stable and I am able to place our coat on it without the worry of it tipping. Great product.....highly recommend and would buy again if I needed a 2nd one.

If the manufacturer sees this review and mails me the 1 missing screw, I'll be glad to change this review to 5 stars. Other than that... this is a solid piece for the $21 price. I mean, what do we really want for $21 standing coat rack for a bachelor pad? This is just about right for the price.",

Excellent metal/paint quality. Stands perfectly, does not rock. It is taller than I am! So make sure the height will work for you! I highly recommend this product.",
