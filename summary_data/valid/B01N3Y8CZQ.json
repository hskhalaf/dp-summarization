It very easily spins itself open so I have to keep it in a tight space in my bag so it doesn\u2019t just twirl around in my bag.",

Super easy to use, looks great, easy to tuck into almost anything, and it's durable. Not sure why people are complaining about only 30 sheets. Since it's retractable, you are not ruining the first one each time you need to use it. We've had the larger roll type previously with our two white long hair cats, but every time you need to use the roller the outer sheet is a throwaway. Plus the refills are inexpensive and also available on Amazon. Great product, love the design and will be getting more in the future.",
