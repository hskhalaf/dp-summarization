I actually think it fits into the 18in doll accessories like the cars and campers better than the big ones. Gave 4 stars because of the hair. It's so uneven and drives me crazy. American Girl wont help since I ordered from Amazon and I'm passed my limit to return so I guess I'm stuck with it. A friend got her little girl the same one and ordered it from AG and hers is fine, which makes me wonder where this one actually came from.",
