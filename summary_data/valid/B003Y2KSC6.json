      "text": "Works great with my Logitech 922 webcam using the Zoom videoconference platform. The greenscreen effect is flawless. I can set this screen up in seconds at home and do videoconferences with a virtual office background. So much easier than keeping a room, and more importantly all of the stuff in the background, clear and clutter free for video conferences. Highly recommend this for anyone who teaches online or does lots of business video meetings (Zoom, Skype, Webex, etc.).",

      "text": "I really like the concept of this, but it does take some time to \"learn\" how to properly fold it when finished. It does have a blue side and green side to make video effects easier and seamless, however, it seems to be a bit smaller than needed width wise. Also, it can take some practice getting the screen clipped into the holder. This is best for stationary locations as it's a bit difficult to maneuver and tote around. Overall, not bad for a green/blue screen, but it could use some improvements. The price is reasonable.",

So if you're going to need to take in down often, this might be a bit frustrating. I haven't needed to. Because of that, I haven't folded it either so I cannot comment on how easily that might be done. I would buy this again.",

I used the blue side and it looked very impressive. With Zoom video conference, the software is able to recognize the blue side as a \"green\" screen so no need to move it around to change your background. It was tricky folding up, but after watching the how-to video, its a breeze. Just fold it like a taco!",

    "description": "Style:Green/Blue| Size:5x7 Panel + Support StandThe Fotodiox 5x7ft Chromakey green and blue background panel kit is professionally designed to be used by anyone in any scenario. The 2-in-1 design allows you to choose what chromakey color your shoot calls for and makes it easy to setup with the included support stand. Simply pop open the background panel and use the clamp on the support stand to hold your background into place. Whatever your needs are, the colors are quality ensured for an effortless chroma keying process from the shoot to post production. This is perfect for any content creator on the go or for use in a small space. The steel spring frame pops open the backdrop in seconds and helps maintain its shape. When folded down it is a compact 30x30 inch disc that can be stored in its included carrying case.\n\nNote:\nUse the green side when replacing the background with a daytime, bright, or outdoor scenes. This helps with the color cast green causes due to it being a bright color. The opposite works with the blue side when your background replacement scene is dark or at night.\nTo avoid color spill, be sure to allow enough space between your subject and the background. \nBe sure to properly light the backgrounds. The green side will need less lighting than the blue side. \nNever shoot on the green side if your subject is wearing green. The same can be applied to the blue side.\nAll pictures are for illustration purposes only. Actual product may vary slightly due to ongoing improvements in design.",
