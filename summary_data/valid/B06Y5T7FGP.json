The back of the right shoe is scuffed from driving since the soles do not extend to the back. They are ok but quite pricey for the level of quality you get.

I'm pretty sure the \"suede\" is fake, since it's backed by either fabric or sticky plastic depending on where it is. I trusted the name Aerosole, so I am really disappointed. They cost just under $50, so I expected them to be \"real,\" but they're most likely not even Aerosoles.",
