I need a new end hose water stop connector and adapter because whenever it's connected, the hose leaks.

The plastic thing that you put into the drilled hole in masonry and the screws it came with didn't go all the way in. I think it's because it was slanted going in etc. But I don't want to drill even more holes in my house to fix the mistake and now I just have this $250 hose that I can't use and holes in my house.

At over $250 each, German made, I'm shocked that the company would let them off the assembly line like this.

One thing for sure, it's a lot nicer not having to wind or roll up the hose. The spring back works well, a lot like the way Mom's canister vacuum cord would spring back into her vacuum.

      "text": "According to my husband, this is one of the best purchases we ever made for the house. In fact, I'm just about to place an order for our third unit for a different area of our property. The quality as well as the effortless, smooth, recoil of the hose on this unit is amazing. My son stopped by our house to water our plants while we were on vacation and he made a comment on the unit as well. Now he wants to get one for his house. Although they're quite pricey, we believe they were well worth the investment.",
