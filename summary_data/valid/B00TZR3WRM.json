      "title": "ARG! Wheel scrolls by itself!!!",
      "text": "This mouse is great, except that if you leave the wheel in free mode (instead of ratchet) then sometimes the wheel will scroll by itself. I think the problem is that the wheel rolls really easily (good lubrication) but it's also not balanced (maybe because of how the wheel components are glued or assembled). This combination of factors means that, sometimes, this small extra weight on one side of the wheel is enough to push the wheel in one direction or another. Again, this only happens when you have the wheel in free mode (not ratchet). But it's a really annoying flaw in the design. Love the mouse otherwise. FIX PLEASE!!!",

On august 2016 I changed both of my Perfomarmance MXs for 2 MX masters, Now I deeply regret throwing away my old performance MX, Both MX Masters started having the gesture button issue a year after purchase, and now one will stop working suddenly. This mouse has irreparable issues from its design that come from the use of a flexible ruberlike material for the gesture button. There are temporary fixes that you can find on forums or youtube, but they are not permanent. if you want this product buy the performance MX and not this garbage.",

There are lots of buttons here, but I haven't found any great need for anything but the usual left, right and scrolling. And after 9 months of use, the scroll wheel no longer works, which makes it unusable for me. I also don't like the rechargeable battery. Regular, off-the-shelf AA or AAA batteries on a standard wireless mouse lasted for months and were easy to change as needed. When this runs out of charge, it quits working and needs to be taken out of service for recharging. I'm going back to a tried and true three-button mouse.",

V3 is out now, but wasn't worth seeing if the extra cost was worth it to me right now. Only way I could see the design improved is if it were a vertical mouse since none of the current crop of vertical mouses have a horizontal scroll wheel. In short, a tilted MX Master. C'est la vie!",

On the other hand, I've rarely used a more ergonomically pleasing mouse. It have large arthritic hands, and this mouse allows me to stay engaged at the computer for hours longer than other ones.

I have tried for the past week to file a warranty claim with Logitech for a replacement mouse. I have three (3) separate warranty claim case numbers now assigned to me, but no response from Logitech. I seriously doubt that anyone is employed in the warranty department at Logitech. If you plan on buying Logitech products because of an advertised warranty - don't waste your time - the warranty is useless!! There are many, many posts on the Logitech forum about this very issue - you would think they would be embarrassed and ashamed by all of this bad product coverage.",

As long as it worked, we (well, the user in our family who likes it; our family is divided on its design) considered it a perfect mouse.

By comparison, we have an Apple keyboard and a (probably at least 10-year-old) Apple mouse that pair virtually instantaneously and are rock solid.

I do no like the scroll button on the side. It is awkward and cause me to never use it or the buttons on the side. The 2 speed scrolling wheel takes some getting used to. But It has grow on me for long document reading. The connect to other machines works well and is useful jumping to a different machines. The usb rechargeable battery last a fairly long time. I would not mind if it used replaceable batteries instead as they last longer in most mice. Cost to much for what you get.",

I can't install the untility on my work computer, so I cannot use the thumb wheel or buttons, but everything else works beautifully.",

The problem seems to be with bluetooth interference which is basically impossible to avoid if you say, work in an office. Their supports says to use the dongle supplied with the mouse to fix the problem, but that did nothing for me. I highly recommend avoiding this mouse. I have been a fan of Logitech products for a long time, but this expensive new paperweight I have is making me a skeptic.",

      "text": "I'm not a gamer, but I work on my laptop regularly (it docks to become my desktop computer at home, at the office, and I take it to client sites). This mouse ALWAYS goes in my laptop bag, it's an absolute must-have. ergonomically it feels really nice, I rarely use the side buttons but the horizontal scrollwheel is nice, and the smart speed wheel thingy is epic. I run linux, so I haven't had the time to mess with some of the more advanced features that other OS users probably have out of the box, but I'm sure they're also very nice.",

      "text": "I love this mouse. I had one just like it that my cat knocked on the floor and broke, so I was quite happy to find it here on Amazon for HALF the price I paid for my first one. This is the Cadillac of non-gaming mice and the best I have ever owned. It works with either blue tooth or USB. Just be aware you need Logitech's Options software to use it with USB. Otherwise it works with any blue tooth connection.",

      "title": "Best Dark Field wireless mouse to date, hands down",
      "text": "Love every thing about this mouse. I'm disappointed to see so many scathing reviews. As a user of the dark field MX series since their inception, this mouse, by far is the best yet. This mouse fits my hand perfectly, feels fantastic and very responsive. Thumb scrolling is brilliant and the hyper scroll click unlock function of the main wheel is a great idea to quickly get through lots of pages without wearing out the internal clicker. The surface is smooth and it works perfect on a glass surface. The multi channel capability as well as the Bluetooth interface are also fantastic. With builtin Bluetooth now on most computers, this allows connectivity without the use of the mini adapter.",
