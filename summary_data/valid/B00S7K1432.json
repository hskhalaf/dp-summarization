      "text": "The pediatrician told us to get a multivitamin with iron for our 6 month old. The only one available at our local Walgreens was the Zarbee's naturals baby multivitamin with iron. He HATED the taste of it; it made him gag. Plus, the dosage is 2 mL. I just received the NovaFerrum and he swallowed it all first try! Didn't even make a face! I also like that it's only 1 mL, rather than 2. A++++, am definitely buying again once we've gone through this bottle. ******* Update: 3 months later: My baby is still taking these successfully. Doesn't make a face, swallows it easily. Great product!",

As such, they\u2019ve lost this customer, I recommend you look at other options because of how poorly this packaging is designed due to the recent change (first seen in April 2019, prior bottle with dropper in the cap/lid worked great).",

I only noticed when giving my daughter the dropper and noticed foil on the end of the dropper! The expiration isn\u2019t until 2021 so it\u2019s not an old bottle. No idea why the foil is coming apart this way. I recommend removing every piece of the seal if you purchase.",

Even if the iron does get on clothes or sheets, it is a much lighter color than competitor iron products so that's a bonus.

The NovaFerrum has been great, he now requests vitamins every evening and loves the taste. It's great to know he's getting the nutrition he needs and also enjoys the taste of them. We've set up a subscription so we always have some in the house.",

After so much money wasted, I'm so glad I found this one! My baby will take it, with no problems! It has a good amount of iron, as well as some other essential vitamins (A, E D and some Bs). I just wish it was a more comprehensive multivitamin. That said, the most important thing is that it has iron and doesn't taste terrible- so that alone is earning a 5 star rating from me. I'm a happy mama! :)",
