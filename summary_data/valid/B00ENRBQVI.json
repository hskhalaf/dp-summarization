The only issue I had was with one small (but important) piece of plastic that was broken. It's the piece that keeps the bed 'folded'. Until the replacement for this is received, it is easily secured with a cord. If you are looking for an extra bed for an overnight guest, this is a good choice.",

What I\u2019ve found is that the middle sinks too much. I wish I used this bed within the Return period because I would have definitely returned it. But it\u2019s too late now unless someone wants to buy this off me ? Otherwise, mattress is comfy and yes this takes up no space. But I would spend more for a better product",

The assembly didn't take long and is just a few bars and the 4 roller wheels. The cover on the foam has a zipper and so it can be removed to be washed. Your tall guests will appreciate that it comes in extra long. I do recommend this bed.",

I try putting something underneath to stop it from rolling but it doesn't work.",
