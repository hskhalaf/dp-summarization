These feel bad and when they fall out (and they will, even if you're sitting on the couch) it's a relief because they feel so bad. These are marked way down for a reason. If they mark them down to a penny, don't buy them.",

I was so happy to find them here. They fit perfectly - the white earbuds that came with my phone are a little too large for my ears. I can leave these in for hours without any soreness from pressure being applied to my ear. The sound quality is very good as well. I like the hot pink - it's easy for people to spot that you have them in, so they don't start talking to you.. :) I ordered two pairs, one for work and one for home/travel.",
