A charming holly and berry motif graces the surface. Set includes four dinner plates, four salad plates and four mugs.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nA best-selling seasonal favorite since 1974, Holiday dinnerware from Lenox sets a festive table for either everyday or special occasion use during the holidays. Crafted of Lenox ivory fine china and banded generously with 24-karat gold, the pattern features a white background sprightly bordered with a wreath of bright green holly and red berries. This twelve-piece set consists of four of each of the following: 10-1/2-inch dinner plate, 8-inch salad plate, and 12-ounce mug. Instead of a holly border, each mug features a bouquet of holly on two sides, and glows with extra gold trim on the handle and around the base. \n\n Ideal as a gift, this set starts or adds to a collection of Holiday gold-banded dinnerware and items for the home. The gold trim means the items are not microwave-safe but are fine for convenient cleaning in the dishwasher. Lenox backs its products with a lifetime warranty, and will replace any unsatisfactory item or provide the customer a full refund. In addition, under its lifetime breakage replacement program, Lenox will replace any broken piece that is in stock at 50 percent off the current suggested retail price. --Ann Bieri \n\n What's in the Box\n4 place settings. Each place setting consists of: dinner plate; salad plate; mug. 12 pieces total.",
