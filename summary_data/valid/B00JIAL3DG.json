The other tank has smaller ones. 3\u201d average. These crips work for both. I have tried to change to other pellet brands and they refuse to eat them. I have one with swim bladder disease that would always gulp to much air from flake food that floated on surface. Pellets sink to fast to bottom which she couldn\u2019t always get to. This food takes its time sinking to the bottom giving her time to grab and eat. My fish recommend this food but they also recommend variety such as veggies and worms.",
