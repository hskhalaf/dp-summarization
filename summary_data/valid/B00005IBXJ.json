Because it is cheap quality, although convenient, I won't be investing another dime into this product..... from all the other reviews that sound just like mine, I would recommend just NOT purchasing this particular product and try to find something similar from a different company.

When you plug it in it doesn't turn on until you set the timer or place the pan on the drive shaft. The plus version immediately engages the fan motor. This requires users to unplug it after every use. This is a complete waste of time and energy, and is not convenient for most consumers. The pizzazz manufacturer needs to consider the consumer before making seemingly illogical changes. My ten-year-old pizzazz still works, its just seen better days. This is still a great oven... with one major design flaw.",

I now basically only use it for melting cheese, warming the frozen garlic bread( browns them nicely). Cleans really easy!

It cooks the top and bottom of the pizza at the same time. If you buy the square thincrust style pizza, just trim the corners and place corners on the tray. The turn-table is easy to clean and can be stored away to minimize space on your countertop.",

I bought this thinking it would save energy, rather then heaving the oven on.

I am planning on buying another one soon. The nice thing is that you can watch it cook so you can decide when to turn it off.

Its perfect for those who dont want to fire up a stove to cook pizzas, or chicken nuggets or just about anything you want. I even know people who have these out in their garage to eat up something while working out there.",

Once it's hot the younger one lets me take over but the 12 year old does it all alone. Pizza is great of course but we've cooked everything on it that we would have used the oven for since we got it home. Corn dogs, chicken nuggets, reheated egg rolls, tater tots, garlic bread and on and on. Looking at that list makes me realize how much junk these guys have been eating lately... We always have fresh fruit in the house I swear!",

Grabbed this in hope of solving the dual items needed to be cooked at the same time and ready together and this thing is great for that. Fries and pizza done together and a second pizza put on after the first and lets just say dinner was finally easy on food was served and ready at the same times. It actually cooked the pizza better than the oven does even when its the only thing in there :p",

Frozen pizza, nuggets, fries, quesadillas, chicken patties, pizza rolls, bagel bites, etc. I even made a few strips of bacon on this to see how they would turn out. Bacon was great, grease buildup is the only thing that makes it not really doable. I am gifting one of these to all my relatives and friends. Love it",

It's especially awesome for leftover pizza, french fries, chicken tenders, garlic bread, even cookies (make sure you use parchment paper for the cookies though!) just about anything you can heat up in an oven can be made on the pizzazz. I usually follow the package directions for conventional oven and our foods are perfect every time!",

    "description": "The fast and easy way to bake frozen, homemade, take-and-bake, and deli pizza. Also great for preparing frozen convenience foods such as chicken nuggets, jalape\u2013o poppers, fish fillets, egg rolls, cinnamon rolls, cookies and much more. Rotating tray turns continuously to assure even baking. Top and bottom heating elements bake foods from both sides. Heating elements are separately controlled, allowing you to select top, bottom, or both elements for perfect results every time. Timer signals end of cooking time and automatically turns off heating elements. Save as much as 60% in energy compared to a conventional oven. Nonstick pan is removable for easy cleanup and storage. 120 volts AC, 6o Hz only, 1235 watts\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThis 1,235-watt countertop oven makes pizza in about half the time required by a conventional oven. You don't need to preheat it--it begins rotating and baking the moment you plug it in. There are independently controlled top and bottom heating elements, so all types (frozen or fresh) and sizes (7 to 12 inches) of pizza can be custom baked. With a rising-crust pizza, for example, you should run the lower heating element for 10-12 minutes before turning on the top element. For a crisper crust, bake the pizza with both heating elements, then finish it off with a few minutes of bottom-only heating. For extra cooking time on your toppings, leave the top element on a little longer. A timer with automatic shutoff lets you set cooking times precisely, and a cooking-time guide for various pizza types is printed on the pizza maker. For safety, the appliance shuts off automatically if it overheats. With the 13-1/4-inch-diameter baking pan in place, the pizza maker is 13-1/4 inches wide, 9-1/2 inches high, and 17-1/2 inches deep. (The baking pan can be removed for more compact storage.) It carries a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack",
