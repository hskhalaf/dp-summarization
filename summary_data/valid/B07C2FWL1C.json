I needed something this exact size so it is perfect. I wanted something with a door for towel storage and drawers for medicine storage. This is pretty much the only thing that fits all the things I needed so I am happy with the function of it. It was very easy to put together, and decent quality for the price. The only bad thing is the very strong chemical odor that is still lingering after a week. (I changed the knob to match the rest if my bathroom knobs)",

This thing scratched and scuffed with minimal friction. The back piece was the wrong size, so I had to leave it off entirely. One of the drawers split when the screw was screwed in and had to be thrown away due to not being able to fully assemble it with the split. I expect more for $99. I may have been less perturbed if I had paid closer to $30.",

It is incredibly flimsy, the amount of pieces you must assemble with nothing but tiny exploded drawings ( no written instructions at all ) will make you cry, and possibly turn to strong drink. Which doesn't help much. Took me 2 days to finally get it fully assembled, and one side just popped off as I moved it into the bathroom and gently set it down. This thing has ruined two days of my life, and the ONLY satisfaction I will get out of the damn thing now will be running it over with my car. DO NOT RECOMMEND",
