      "text": "The sound quality is very good. Music sounds wonderfully crystal clear through these headphones. However, after only a few months, the vinyl covering the earpads came apart at the seam, revealing the foam inside. (This occurred with normal use - 3/4 days a week, 1/2 hrs at a time.) Even though I reinforced/sewed it back together, at LEAST 12 times over a 9 month period, the vinyl kept separating. For the price that I paid, and the brand, I was both shocked and disappointed by this. To this day, I use them when my wireless ones are charging. And though they are covered in tape, somehow, the sound is still excellent! Go figure.... \ud83d\ude0a",

They used to have to sit really close and only get one earbud from the set and they love being able to have their own set of good headphones while they listen to the same song. Would definitely buy again if we need another set of headphones.",

I'm not a professional when it comes to reviews but these instantly won my vote! The sound is just what I was looking for. Able to adapt to different genres. The bass when needed the acoustic when needed. Light weight. Made phones calls no problems. I'm happy with the purchase and met my expectations.",

They were everything I hoped for and more, the sound Is outstanding it feels and sounds like you are at a live concert. They are great from style, to sound, and easy to transport thanks to the unique way that they fold up. Once you get these you will never go back to beats, these overpower beats by every mean. 10/10",

So far I am very happy with my purchase, usually I don't like to spend a lot of money on headphones but I couldn't be happier with these. I love the design, sound, the color. I will update this after my first six months of having these but if I don't have any problems with them, these will be my go to for getting any kind of replacements.",

He says they're especially useful at school when he's working on audio computer assignments because he can block out the distractions from other computers; and the clarity is good. I would recommend purchasing extra cables because those wear out easy when worn/used much.",

      "text": "These headphone are stylish and have a great sound. I would recommend them to anyone. Their price is similar to that of competitors, but they have such a unique look to them that their is no mistaking the DNA's from all the rest that seem to all have the same style and shape, just different logos on them. I also love the sound quality. I own a pair of Beats and they are great for bass heads (which I can be depending on my mood), but with the DNA's, every instrument/vocal/sound comes thru equally crystal clear. DNA's are great! You won't be disappointed.",

The volume can go up a lot louder than i expected at the same time as it blocks out outside noises. The bass is incredible and can also go up really high withought overpowering the rest of the sound. Also, they are a nice snug fit which allows you to run with them and withought needing to re-adjust them every 10 sec. I highly reccomend these headphones.",

Rather, they provide a true sound level across all hearable frequencies. I was blown away by how clear they sounded. I have experience as a pro sound engineer. These rival some of the best studio phones I ever used. I know some people say the bass is poor. Personally, I might prefer just slightly more bass for listening to my mp3 player, but the sound produced by these is so clear that I can hear things in the music that I do not hear over the car stereo when playing the same songs.",
