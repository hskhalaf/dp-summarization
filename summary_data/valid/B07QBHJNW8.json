Here are the pros and cons of this product based on our past two weeks' experience: Pros: The toy is compact, portable and easy to store. The design is great with the remote controller and tokens. The assembly process is not too hard. Cons: The plastic material could be improved with smooth edges. The music does get slightly annoying, but it isn't too awful bad. Overall, it is really a fun alternative to real claw games. We've all enjoyed this toy.",
