The design could be slightly better in these ways but for the price and compared to the others we have tried, its a hands down winner and would buy again.",

There were strict luggage weight limits coming and going, of course - and they varied from flight to flight. The weight limits also pertained to carry-ons. While our group leaders had one of these portable scales to check weights of all of the bags (there were more than 40 on the trip), I appreciated having one of these myself - easy peasy! Much better than guessing and/or putting the suitcase on an old fashioned scale at home! Don't hesitate - get this scale and take it with you on your trip!",

Other posts talked about the battery draining quickly so I saved the little piece of plastic that comes in between the battery and connection point. When I was done, I simply put it back in between and tucked into my carry on. Repeated the process when returning home 3 weeks later. No battery loss.",

I tested with a baby car seat that I know weighs 7.6lbs and this read 7.3 so that's pretty close. The real test will be against the airline's scale - which you have to just trust, right?

      "text": "We used this when we went over seas on vacation just recently. You literally just open the box and you can use it. No programming, guessing, or wait times. It is so easy and convenient. It saved us so much time when we were packing because we could just weigh things at the house instead of trying to go somewhere to weigh bags. It is very small and easily packed into any bag. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I do not know the longevity of the item/battery since we just bought it in August '18. But, quality, durability, ease of use, etc it is an amazing product so far.",

Well worth it! I tried the scale and measure all my bags that i'm going to bring with me and documented their weight using this scale. Super easy to use! I dont even have to read the manual!",
