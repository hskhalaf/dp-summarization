You must get the ES 30- has a wider wheel base and a key start so you can take on plane. I also got the better seat on Amazon. It attracts attention so have little handouts w the name. Update: after riding it I decided to have the handle bars and seat raised- more comfortable for tall people",

It couldn\u2019t make it up the stadium ramps (I knew they were too steep), but my husband pushed me up! The scooter folds like a stroller & was small enough to put between my legs in the stadium!! We all know how limited you are at a football game!! I\u2019m 5ft 9 & weigh 180lbs. I can\u2019t count all the compliments I received on this sharp scooter!

BUT the cart/purchase page wont let the USA be listed with your address for buying replacement parts. (throttle/batt/controller, etc). So,,,, HOW do I get another Battery on their site? Whats \"wrong\" with allowing customers in the USA to buy parts? I have a plug in/unplug setup but cant get a spare battery.... Why? Italy and UK can but not USA?",
