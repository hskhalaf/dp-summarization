While warm, I haven't felt so far like my feet are overheating. I wouldn't wear them as a daily shoe, but in Chicago we have some rough days these are perfect for. Seem so far to be well made and don't look overly \"technical.\" I bought a half size up to accommodate for socks, a little roomy, but well within the norm of what's to be expected. I used to have a pair of Vasque hiking boots many years ago that were a little tight, but these seem truer to size.",

Since I already own Vasque brand summer hiking boots I was confident of the quality and these Snowburban boots are of good quality. I will be using these in the Austrain Alps this winter:-)",

I generally suffer form extreme cold sensitivity in my toes and fingers, but found the apparent drop off in insulation somewhat surprising - hence only four stars. Several reviewers have criticized the lacing system, however, in my opinion the lacing system is brilliant and much easier to use than the typical speed lacing system. Traction is great through mud and snow, and the boot provides great stability and comfort.",

SOLES - are first class and perform exceptionally well in snow and slippery conditions. 3. WEATHERPROOF - they offer complete protection from water, ice, snow and cold. 4. COMFORTABLE - cushy and warm with a snug fit. They did not need to be worn in! 5. COST - these are the best value of any of the 30-40 pairs I considered before deciding on these. The only slight negative is that they take some patience and elbow grease to get on and off...a small price to pay for all the wonderful aspects of this awesome boot.",
