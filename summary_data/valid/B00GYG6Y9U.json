I'm unable to execute any multiple turns, large grand jete\u0301s, etc. without them sliding off. I had wanted to get some shoes that didn't bunch up when the drawstring was pulled. The fit length wise is perfect though, so I'm sure it isn't a sizing issue. And though I have decently arched feet for a dancer, I really don't think these flatter your arches at all. I will have to save them for teaching class.",

What\u2019s weird is that it\u2019s the same Bloch sizing but the Synchrony sizing was so much smaller. The heel part didn\u2019t cover my entire heel almost felt like it was going to slip off bc it was so low. Plus as seen in pics the leather sole didn\u2019t match up to my heels. I took the same photos for both Pro Elastic and Synchrony and I\u2019ll post the first ones under a review for Pro Elastic. Just odd that the same size would have so much variation between two styles from the same company.",

According to the sizing, it said she should be a size 2.5 and that is what I ordered. She is a size 4 in regular shoes. When they came, she couldn't barely squeeze her foot in the ballet shoe. I'm sure if I would have ordered a size equal to her street shoe, they would have fit. My suggestion would be to order normal size.",
