I was using the gummies to keep his fiber high and assist with his constipation/diarrhea problems. Unfortunately, he doesn't like the taste of these gummies. He has tried others that he gobbles like candy but he won't eat these. I tried them and they have an unpleasant after-taste that may be due to the xylitol and sucralose (artificial sweeteners in the gummies). By themselves, the gummies don't manage his constipation problem so I won't make him eat them. I'll feed him the Fiber One bars which he loves and they work well enough.",
