The other side went in without a problem. You will definitely want your drill to put the screws in since there are around 30. It saves you a lot of time and hassle.

I recommend this product for ages between 2 to 5; however, I should say that I fit inside it :-)",

She keeps pressing but no sound, she is so disappointed. Other than that she loves the house and the little seat and sink! She plays for hours even without the doorbell!",
