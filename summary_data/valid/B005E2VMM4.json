I had to take the wig off too since it was one without hair up top and hair which only came down along the sides meant to wear with a hat. So, I just wore the hat which was far from a hat to be worn alone with no hair! Anyway, I am a small 110 pound person and if this product didn't fit me, it's not going to fit anybody, IMO!",

Since it's made of the same material as nylons I would assume it would be prone to getting runs and have to be replaced every so often, but at this price you can replace it without breaking the budget.
