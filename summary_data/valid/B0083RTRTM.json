This holds a complete 20# bag of pellets perfectly, it's see through so you can see pellet quantity and they even stack! Plus it has a pouring spout. I'm not sure there's a better container for these pellets. Only possible draw back is it only holds one bag and it's not air tight. If storing in a garage or indoors that shouldn't be a problem.",

You have to practically lay on it to get the lid snapped on, but after that it stays on solidly. Don't be afraid to push down on the lid much harder than you think that you need to.

Food used to be hidden in a bucket. Now they can see it, but can't get to it until I dole it out.",

Don\u2019t expect to store 12 lbs of black oil sunflower seed in the medium container. It probably holds 8 lbs instead. Likewise, the 20 lb container probably holds 15 lbs.",

But when I opened the container, not a single ant was inside. These containers are easily stack-able and the handle makes it very easy to pour. I love the two different size openings. I HIGHLY recommend!",

It's only going to cost a couple of dollars to get scoops for the two containers I bought, but it's still disappointing to get an item that is not as described. If I'd known it didn't come with the scoop, I would've purchased a different container.",
