If it just had a an extended tang/flipper to facilitate the advertised \"one handed opening\", I would rate it higher and might become my EDC, but at this point wished I would have tried the Uzi Responder I or S&W Extreme Ops Tanto",

I was impressed with the quality. I deducted a star due to the engineering of the clip that is used to hold the knife to a pocket or belt. The openings in the handle catch on the pocket or belt as you try to attach the knife. There is no provision to mount the clip on the other side where interference is a nonissue. I plan to purchase more of these knives as gifts.",

The opening was initially a bit stiff, but with a couple weeks of use, it's loosened to an ideal level. Blade locks perfectly, no wiggle whatsover. The belt clip is extremely snug - can hook it to my jeans pocket easy enough, but anything thicker can be a hassle. It's light weight, but feels solid when held. Given the price, I highly recommend it. I've had it about two months at the time of this review. Hope this helps.",
