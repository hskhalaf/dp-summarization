I recommend the old flour sack versions for kitchen towels - now THEY absorb.",

Harringdons towels absorb quickly and the large size lets me use the towel in both hands at the same time while drying even my largest pots and covers.

At first use, they are a little questionable, but as they're laundered, they soften up and do a better job. They do wrinkle a bit, which doesn't bother me in the slightest--they're towels, not dress shirts. I think they'd make a nice housewarming gift.",

I can say I pre-soaked half the towels in salt and vinegar for 24 hrs, as suggested by other reviewers and then washed on cotton setting and dried on regular setting. They came out very well and not very wrinkled. I think these towels probably deserve the score of 5 overall, that they have received.",

Over the course of 3 days, there were over 250 comments from embroidering sewers about how wonderful these towels are; how sometimes they shrink but not that much and how lovely they look once the work is done. I'm doing one tomorrow and will update but it was pretty amazing to see that many people comment on how wonderful they were.",

I initially washed the towels in cold before I used them to prevent shrinking or becoming misshapen; after that, I wash them in hot when I do laundry. I do NOT use a dryer sheet because I feel it prevents the towels from being as absorbent as they should be. Also, I stretch/smooth out the wrinkled edges before I toss them in the dryer; they'll still be somewhat wrinkly, but I don't believe in ironing dish towels. These are really great dish drying towels and I would purchase them again.",

It's great having a good supply of them to change whenever needed. We wash them together (in a separate load) with warm water and a mild natural detergent..along with a moderate amount of \"Clorox\" Ultimate Care Bleach...and dry them with medium heat in the dryer. They come out dazzling white...and the strips of color stay bright and beautiful! If you fold them right away, they will be wrinkle-free. Enjoy!",
