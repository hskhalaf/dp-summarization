      "text": "I bought a pair of these for my man cave. I'm a big guy, 6'7\" and about 280 and they are super comfortable and sturdy. I was initially concerned, because they are like accent chairs, many of which are small. But I can sit my wide rear end in the seat with room on either side and the curved arm rests are really comfortable. The chair comes in 4 pieces, 5 if you count the cushion, and was pretty easy to assemble with 10 allen bolts. The interior frame is made from particle board and plywood and feels super solid. Would definitely buy again. My wife wants another pair for the living room.",

      "text": "A very good looking \"extra\" chair for the money. Main seat cushion is a bit too firm for my liking at 200#. All the parts came with it. If you don't mind assembly you save money over a furniture store as chairs are expensive these days. Assembly was a neck-tweaking affair for me and required some patience (a sweaty workout on a hot day for sure). A power screwdriver speeds it along, but I felt the need to use a few different drivers where space did not allow the power screwdriver.",

This will allow you the wiggle room to get all of the screws in their place. You can tell just by sitting in the chairs that they are high quality. It would be impossible to beat the price and we couldn't be happier.",

This chair is more comfortable than any chair I've ever bought! The assembly was super-easy. I was nervous because some of the reviews made it sound difficult, but it wasn't. There were eight screws that went into metal threaded holes. Everything lined up and I was able to screw them in by hand right up until the end where I used the allen wrench to snug them up",

I assembled this alone and it was a bear, took me about an hour. I recommend two people assemble, it will go faster.
