Putting it together took a while, but instructions were easy to follow and the anchor screws it came with help make it EXTREMELY sturdy. I love the added storage I have for all of my knick-knacks and office supplies. Would definitely recommend this! One note to future buyers- As other reviewers have stated, it's a flat surface and there is no slide-out keyboard tray. The way it's built, you might have trouble installing a keyboard tray (see picture), but if you have a monitor riser or something similar, you'll be able to get your monitor high enough to be comfortable.",

The little compartment holders are useful as well. Wish I had one of these when I lived in my old studio apartment! However, it's nice enough for our med-spa.",

I don't recommend using the screws that come with it.. They will probably strip out. However, as frustrating as it was at the time, as soon as I made a trip to the local hardware store it worked out great!!",

My new 5k retina 27\" iMac screen was shattered. It is costing me $606 to repair. There needs to be an option that secures the desk to the wall rather than just hanging. I would return if I could.
