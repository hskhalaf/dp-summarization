There are all sorts of little shapes and details that the kids seem to notice at different stages of development. One time when he came over, he named all the dogs, cats, and monkeys. Another time, while we were playing cars, he would tell me \"watch out\" whenever I got near the banana peel. It's still his favorite toy when he comes to our house. As soon as he comes, he points to the room where we keep it and asks me to bring it out. Orange Car and Purple Car have become steadfast companions on our journey into his imagination.",

He's been playing with it for 2 full hours (and he's not one to stick with a toy for very long). Best $24 I ever spent on a toy!",

The fact that it can be set up in more than one way adds some interest, but he prefers the tall set up so the car can go faster. It's a lot of fun to give a gift that is such a success!",

My girls, now 5 and almost 3, love this \"Umi-city\" and play with it with all types of cars and little figures. Lots of pretent play happens here. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of a metal peg that slowly migrates out when the top portion is lifted and lowered a lot. It only had to be pushed back in about 2-3 times this past year, so it isn't a huge deal. All toys need to be checked and maintained regularly anyway.",

It comes with 2 cars, but I bought him 4 more. He lines them all up and lets them go at the same time. He likes it standing or sitting. He cannot change the position himself, so every once in a while he will point to it and whine if he wants it changed. When it's in the standing position it's tall, but the foot print isn't very big, so it doesn't really take up too much room. Definitely a good buy.",

He also has put various small balls down the ramps, and while they don't stay in the ramp the whole way most of the time, they come shooting out from various locations and he likes it.",

It's sturdy and thought it does require assembly, once put together it is very stable. The only caveat would be that it doesn't work great with hot wheels cars, as the tracks are too wide and there are holes down the middle that catch the little wheels. But my kids don't care and it's a great toy!",
