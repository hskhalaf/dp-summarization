Although I wanted to smash each one on his face, I resisted because theses glasses are so freaking beautiful and it would have been a shame. So 5 stars for that. Although now that I think of it these cups are probably so strong they would have survived a hard throw...so maybe I should have went for it? Oh well.",

They are thick and heavy and have the classic pattern work. Keep in mind that these are only $7.50/each. For that money you get no name glasses that could be very poor quality. This is the low-cost line of waterford but they look great and feel good and are much better than some of the others I tried to buy. I'll stick with these for regular use. Great value.",

They are not worth the price and in no way the 100$ original asking. My pictures show blemishes (these do not go off when washing). They are average or sub-par compared to similar glasses.",

The packaging shows that grandma stored it for few decades and now gifting to grandkids - check the bottom of the box.

      "text": "Ordered a set of four of these glasses. Once received, one if the glasses had a chip which turned into a long crack. We contacted Amazon, and they sent another set of four at no charge. When we received the second set at least one of the glasses had a small crack in the top of the glass. I mean crack when I say it, I am not referring to the seams of the glass. Quality control from the manufacturer is very poor.",
