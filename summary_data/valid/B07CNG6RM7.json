      "text": "I received this device several weeks ago. Initially, it did great frothing the almond milk I always use. But after a while, it stopped frothing the almond milk and the result was an unappetizing foamy mess. I messaged the company about this, but all I got from them was a write up about the properties of almond milk vs. regular milk. They claimed that almond milk would not froth successfully, which is incorrect. I sent them pictures of the earlier froth results from the almond milk and then the current results. They are not apparently interested in sending a new machine. I'm really disappointed in their lack of customer service and their lack of interest in making this right.",

In heat mode, the milk is not moving and it always burns the milk a little. We have been using it in froth mode and only keeping it on for 10 seconds.

I think they use cheap materials and at the end of the day, that's probably why it's so inexpensive. Verdict? Spend a little more on another one that will last you longer! Lesson learned here.",
