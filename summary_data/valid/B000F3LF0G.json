I have not noticed any funky tastes as some of the other reviews have reported. I have the grey ones. Maybe it has to do with the different colored trays as far as dyes or something. I do wish they were a little easier to refill. I have to pull out a small measuring glass with a spout to refill them every time.",

Perhaps if just filling every other spot it might be easier to dislodge cubes, didn't try that yet. Where I do see the merit of using these is if you want to freeze liquid ingredients in small portions for later use. You'll have a nice uniform size to melt more evenly in the microwave and will stack nicely in a freezer container or ziplock.",

Are they worse trays out there? yes, but these take a bit more effort than a good quality hard plastic tray that you bend to release the ice; and 2) they are small. On the plus side, they make very beautiful ice, so if that is your priority, these will definitely do that.",

      "text": "We bought these trays to freeze our son's home made baby food. They are perfect for making one ounce portions. The silicon material is flexible without tearing, but getting the food out can be a little tough. In addition, they do take a little extra care when cleaning since they are not dishwasher safe. We own four total so it's perfect when making multiple batches of food. So if you're in the market for one ounce trays for baby food, I would highly recommend these. Only reason I didn't give five stars is because of the work it takes to get them clean.",

While the walls feel pretty sturdy, the way it was packaged ruined the perpendicular walls, so you end up with slanted cubes. It's unfortunate that mediocre packaging ruined a pretty good product, but I guess that's not the first time it has happened. There might be a way to fix it, but I haven't had time to look into it yet.",

She said yes, but no one(ages at the house that tried was from 85 down to 40, 6 adults) could get the ice out of the trays. Unbelievable. Really? These should be an easy twist and the cubes drop out.
