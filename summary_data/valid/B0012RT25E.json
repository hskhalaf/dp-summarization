I transferred that flip-top cap to the new Made in China product, because it only had a screw on cap. Altogether, I'm beyond disappointed. If you liked the Made in USA version as much as I did, it's unlikely you'll like this product.",

I can't smell it after I first put it on as I've become somewhat used to it, but others say it's very light during the day and really pleasant. I use it as my signature fragrance and have had many compliments on it.",
