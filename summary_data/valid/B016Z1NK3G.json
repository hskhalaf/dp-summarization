We were wrong\u2014- this minibike barely has enough power to go on flat pavement. If you plan on riding off pavement I would not recommend. Very disappointed and wish I had read other similar reviews noting its lack of power before purchasing. We returned for a refund.",

Looks great, fired right up, came with oil and doesnt have a scratch on it. I screwed in the throttle screw and we did some start stop drills till she could do it without thinking then she was off. Kids need to wear full riding gear while on these. I plan to buy one for my youngest son when he's ready and have two 200s in route for my two 13 year olds.",

Showed up without a manual, called customer service and they refused to send me a manual that was supposed to be included. I assembled the bike (very easy) and fueled it up... Will NOT start. Pulled it 50+ times and not even a sputter. I call customer service and they told me to take apart the carburetor and clean it. Typical Chinese crap. I paid the extra $ believing it was American made but nope. I'm going to try and return it ASAP",

On his last ride, most of our extended family were assembled, including cousins, uncles, etc. (and most of whom were a tad bit jealous) and as he rode off, the chain broke. Not just slipped-BROKE. How something like this happens on a brand new product mystifies me. Now we're left with spending money to try to fix something that should not have broken on something so new.",
