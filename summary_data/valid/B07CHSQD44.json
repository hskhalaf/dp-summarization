I've been trying other brands for the last two years because I wasn't enjoying the Mizuno's current offerings but these were a pleasant surprise. They are incredibly light, overall fit is perfect, and the price is great. The two is a bit rigid and designed for a mid-foot runner looking for speed. The shoes run small; I'd recommend going up 1/2 to a full size.",

After I wore them twice I realized I couldn't wear them long distance, they compressed the balls of my feet and wore a bit on my heels. Also my feet get very hot in them, they don't breathe at all. Disappointing, but still usable for activities other than long distance running. After wearing them maybe a dozen times, mostly for just walking around, I realized that not only are the rubber toes separating from the cloth shoe, they're actually splitting down the middle. Ridiculous. Do not buy.",
