How did I live without it?! It feels so good. My scalp isn't super sensitive so I give it a good firm rub with this brush, and it feels like heaven. I have ZERO tangles and a lot more bounce in my hair. My best advice if you want to avoid tangles is to not make big swirls with it. Small circles all over the scalp is super effective and feels like a dream.",

The only drawback I find is that with long hair you have to be careful not to tear your hair which I suppose comes with the territory. I use it only when shampooing but not rinsing because I feel like it pulls and tears at my longer hair when rinsing. With that said, it's good for shampooing and if you have shorter hair, probably OK for rinsing as well.",

I suppose you could draw blood, but that would take some extreme effort. You can flex the brush outward for easy cleaning.
