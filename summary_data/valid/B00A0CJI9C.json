Family member with different phone do not have the same problems. The internet works once connected but needs to be reset when switching towers. Battery life is good, wishit had a sd slot but 32gig is fine. Overall i like the phone foe the price(130).",

Cons: screen isn't so good in the sun and is kind of glossy, tinny speaker, camera isn't so Great, outdated Bluetooth and doesn't work with some Bluetooth devices like fitbit or Jawbone up24. Outdated android and they don't know when/if this device will update to kit kat or lollipop. Other than that It's Great.",

And with Google+ integration, you can video chat with groups of up to 9 friends as well as easily upload and share photos and videos. Other features include:\n\nFace Unlock\nYou can now unlock your phone with just your face using the Face Unlock option. It takes advantage of the front-facing camera and state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to register a face during setup and then to recognize it again when unlocking the device. Just hold your phone in front of your face to unlock (or use a backup PIN).\n\nAnd the lock screen now lets you do more without unlocking. From the slide lock screen, you can jump directly to the camera for a picture or pull down the notifications window to check for messages. When listening to music, you can even manage music tracks and see album art.\n\nHome Screen Folders\nQuickly access related apps right from the home screen by organizing apps and shortcuts into folders--just drag one app onto another to create a folder.\n\nMultitasking\nMultitasking is even easier and more visual in Android 4.0.4. The Recent Apps button lets you jump instantly from one task to another using the list in the System Bar. The list pops up to show thumbnail images of apps used recently--tapping a thumbnail switches to the app.\n\nVoice Input\nThe new voice engine in Android 4.0.4 lets you dictate the text you want, for as long as you want, using the language you want. You can speak continuously for a prolonged time, even pausing for intervals if needed, and dictate punctuation to create correct sentences. As the voice input engine enters text, it underlines possible dictation errors in gray. After dictating, you can tap the underlined words to quickly replace them from a list of suggestions.\n\nANDROID 4.0.4 FEATURES\n * Global roaming in 220 countries\n * Direct access from the lock screen to phone, camera, and text\n * New home screen layout with enhanced launch bar\n * Improved voice input: hold down the search key to dictate emails and text or navigate to an address\n * Face unlock: the device uses the front-facing camera to automatically recognize you when you attempt to unlock\n * Data usage: the new usage center allows you to monitor how much data is consumed each month\n * Android Market for browsing and downloading thousands of free and paid apps \n * Pre-loaded Android apps: Browser, Calculator, Calendar (Google or Corporate), Camera, Clock, Contacts, Email, Gallery, Messaging, Music, News & Weather, Phone, Settings, Video Player, Voice Dialer, Voice Search, YouTube \n * Google applications: Gmail, Google Search, Google Voice Search, Google Latitude, Google Maps, Google Places, Google Talk \n * Google Maps Navigation with spoken turn-by-turn directions showing real-time traffic and 360\u00b0 views of the destination \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECTIVITY\n * Ultra-fast 4G LTE connectivity \n * Wireless Wi-Fi networking (802.11b/g/n) for accessing home and corporate networks \n * Built-in mobile hotspot functionality allows Wi-Fi enabled devices to share the 3G or 4G experience on the go with a laptop, camera, music player, game unit, video player, or any other Wi-Fi enabled device. \n * Near Field Communication (NFC) for sharing contacts, web pages, directions, and more to compatible phones \n * GPS for navigation for access to turn-by-turn directions with Google Maps \n\nHARDWARE\n * 1.5 GHz Quad-Core processor allowing you to quickly switch between apps, enjoy HD gaming and super-fast web browsing \n * 4.7-inch WXGA Touch Screen \n\nCOMMUNICATIONS & INTERNET\n * Web browser with full HTML browser and Google Search\n * Text (SMS) and picture/video (MMS) messaging \n * Personal and work e-mail \n\nCAMERA\n * Rear-facing camera 13 megapixels with LED flash\n * Front-facing camera with 1.3 megapixels for video chats and self portraits \n\nMEMORY\n * RAM two GB \n * ROM 32 GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO AVAILABLE FOR THIS ANDROID DEVICE\nAmazon Appstore for Android\nGet a great paid app for free every day.\n\nKindle\nBuy a book once and read it everywhere with our free Kindle Reading App for Android.\n\nAmazon MP3\nShop 15 million songs and stream your Cloud Drive music directly from your Android device.\n\nIMDB\nFind local movie showtimes and TV listings, watch trailers, and search the world's largest source of entertainment information.\n\nAudible\nDownload audiobooks directly to your Android device, then listen wherever you go, get audiobook news, earn badges, and more.\n\nAmazon Mobile\nShop for millions of products, get product details, and read reviews--right from your mobile device.",
