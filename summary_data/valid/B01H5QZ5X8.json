The only downside for me was that the massage is very focused on the front 2/3 of the foot (toes, ball, and arch). Meanwhile, there's very little done on the heel and nothing for the ankle. It gets the job done, but at this price point I was expecting a little more on the heel/ankle. Therefore 4 stars instead of 5.",

I really bought it for having the balls of my feet massaged, and there it does great work. Beware: You can set the intensity high enough to really inflict pain (but we like it).",

I think if I combine some stretching exercises along with massage my foot pain will all but disappear. Overall I am pleased with this machine so far",

You can vary the degree of pressure from settings of 1-5. the pressure/tightness increases and decreases in a pattern throughout the 15-minute treatment, no matter what setting you have it on, but the higher the setting, the tighter it gets on the increase. Two things keeping me from giving it the full 5 stars: the heat is not really noticeable and the pressure/tightness at the heels is very low, so you don't get as much massage effect on the heels as most people would prefer. Still, it gives a good massage, and my feel feel much better after using it. It is worth the money.",
