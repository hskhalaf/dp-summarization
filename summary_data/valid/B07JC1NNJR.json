These pillows seem to be of good quality and will hopefully hold up better than the pillows that were previously on the couch. One thing that I don't love is that the pillows are overstuffed, so if I fall asleep on the couch, they aren't super comfortable to rest my head on. (I feel like my head is going to fall off the pillow.)",
