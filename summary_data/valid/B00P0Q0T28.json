The wand was completely different and so was the mascara tube. Different color, markings, and look. If you\u2019ve used Too Faced- you can spot a fake quite easily.

From the outside they look identical, but the brush on the Amazon one is way smaller and the liquid is like sticky. Normal great mascara, that's why I was disappointed.",

One coat is great for definition and length, 2 coats is pretty dramatic, and 3 coats it will look like you have false lashes on. I recommend!",

It doesn't flake off into my eyes after hours of wear the way cheap products do, the brush is cleverly designed to get your outer lashes without smudging onto your eyelid, and the viscosity is perfect. Hope they keep this one around for me to continue to buy.",
