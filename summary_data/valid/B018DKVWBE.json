The eyeshadow smells amazing, also, every time I open the palette I'm taken by surprise by that. These shadows have a little more \"shed\" than some I've used, tap your brush thoroughly to avoid getting fallout on your face. Also, as so many reviewers have said, please package these better! Mine came intact but bumping around loose in a big box with other items so I got lucky.",
