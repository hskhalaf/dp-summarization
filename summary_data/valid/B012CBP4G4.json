      "text": "The Burt\u2019s Bees sheets are of nice quality and softness. The fabric does not seem to stretch and make an unsafe crib environment like other sheets can. It stays taught on the mattress but is very soft and snuggly for our baby. Our set has only been laundered a handful of times, but they seem to be the same as when they first arrived. Our only complaint is that they are definitely pricey in comparison to other brands, but you do pay for what you get.",

This sheet hugs the mattress so tight that it caused these sections to slightly overlap, shrinking the overall size of the mattress, leaving a gap between the mattress and the pack\u2019n\u2019play walls. I will not use this and do not believe I can return it since I\u2019ve washed it and threw out the packaging :(",
