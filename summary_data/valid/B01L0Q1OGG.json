I inquired about a few details on this pack and the company was very responsive with 2-3 emails over 24 hour. I'm 6'2 195 lbs and loved the extra length and room up top - GREAT SIZING! This bag worked very well in 25-30 degree weather even with 20-25 mph wind gusts. I did have an underquilt however I feel it would support the temps described in the ad easily.

Zippers very low quality, don't stay zipped, Velcro wasn't thought out on location, stitching is questionable if it'll last longer than a couple light camping trips, low quality materials. If you don't camp often, just need something cheap for a yearly trip, these should be great for you! For the money there are better options of zip together bags though.",

However, I also felt that the fabric did not breathe at all, so it was a bit like sleeping in a plastic bag - and venting the side didn't help. On the pro side: great price, kept me warm down to around 60 F, light weight and compact, can be paired to make a double, nice design features (pocket, straps).",

      "title": "Great sleeping bag for Burning Man",
      "text": "I bought this roomy, long sleeping bag for Burning Man. In the past 9 years, the middle of the night temperature at Burning Man (4,000 feet elevation, 140 miles north of Reno) occasionally goes down to the low 40s and rarely to the high 30s. This year I doubt it ever got much below 50. This sleeping bag was perfect for that weather. Most nights I did not even zip up the bag. I liked the large size, both wide and long, it is a very comfortable bag. Packs up easily.",

At first I was pleased because it is a pretty warm bag that packed small enough to fit in the sleeping bag compartment of my backpack. One year later, I would estimate 20-25 uses, the seams are coming apart. I have always treated the bag carefully; it has never been washed or dried, if it's not in the stuff sack then it is on my sleeping pad inside my tent. tl;dr It was used gently for 1 year and it is coming apart.",

A fleece inside the bag felt perfect when it froze outside the tent. Very light for what you get. Packs ok. There are lighter bags, but this price makes it pretty darn good. I\u2019m keeping it. I also like the foot zipper, but it\u2019s been too cold this winter to use it, maybe perfect in the spring.",
