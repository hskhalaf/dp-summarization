It remains affordable despite its luxurious textile set up. The lacing design doesn\u2019t affect much in the overall fit, but it adds styling to the feminine cut. Although keeping the upper tidy can be quite an effort, the muted color schemes allow users the freedom to put on this charmer with strings of casual clothing.",

I got my usual 7.5 and there was a smidge of room, but I don\u2019t think it would be enough to size down. The pink color is also slightly less bright, but still totally cute. A true \u201cblush\u201d color. They also felt a little flat on the soles, but that is typical for a sneaker. I got arch support inserts and they are now perfect! Highly recommend these!",
