They're a bit more expensive but worth it. They grip well and I feel if I accidentally rolled the camper over the rubber chock it would survive. Conversely, the Camco product would probably be an Ok solution for a lightweight camper, but don;t use on a heavier camper.",

Anyway, the only reason I gave them only 3 stars is because I saw the exact same ones, same brand, WITH the rope at Tractor Supply for under $4.00 each. Camco is selling the ones with the rope on Amazon as a 2-pack for $14.11. I would much rather have had the ones with the rope. :(",

My recommendation is if you are looking for chocks, buy the big heavy duty rubber ones. I had those in my last trailer and really liked them. But they went with that trailer when it sold so I will be getting another set. I will find a lighter duty use for these around the garage though.",

I can say these have worked on a 1/2 Ton truck and a 1/2 ton suburban, lawn mowers, to keep wood from moving, we use them for everything. If they were a bit bigger that would be great.",
