I might should have been billed as a \"SWAGGER STICK STAND\". It MAY have been tall enough for that?! But, it is NOT tall enough for either umbrellas or canes! Had I realized how short it is, I would NEVER have bought it! No wonder they neither gave it's dimensions or illustrated it with umbrellas in it. This \"umbrella stand\" is totally inadequate!",
