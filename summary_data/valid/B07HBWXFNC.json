The Master addition is the one that they wanted so they didn't have to pay for extras and add-ons like on the original Minecraft for xbox one. The game comes with a card with free upgrade codes onit to add special \"skins and $\" to your profile, But it only loads to one persons profile, which makes it not fair in our household. The boys say it still is better than the regular edition, with extras and all, but just that one thing so far",

Although I play to bond with him, I thoroughly enjoy the experience. I could play by myself and still enjoy it, to be completely honest. The game is very simple but the open world, sandbox experience means there is many things you can do. Creative mode gives you the option to literally do whatever you want from a building perspective. Survival mode adds a bit of realism and challenge to it, you have to harvest resources, survive through the night mobs, etc, etc...",
