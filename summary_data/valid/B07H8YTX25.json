The wood (possibly pine, given the texture and weight) also feels really cheap, with an ugly varnish. Seriously, I've seen broom handles made of better quality wood.

So it's probably not the most durable set, but it's good for kids. Also, in order to store everything in the box, you have to take apart the mallets--I'm not sure how long they'll last that way.

You must unscrew the mallet heads from the sticks in order to make them fit. This will become annoying after a few times. Also, this will wear down the threading in the hammer head. I would suggest getting yourself a lager storage bag, and use that.",

It took us a while to set up the game since it had been such a long time since either my husband or I had played the game. Low grass is the best substrate to play on--longer grass makes the balls bump around and get stuck and dirt gets dusty. The wooden mallets, balls, stakes, etc. were all great quality so this set will last for some time. Excellent product, overall!",

If you take this game seriously, then you want a solid sturdy set. So far, I have not had any problems. The sticks screw on tightly to the mallet heads. The colors are bright and seem like they will last a while without fading. The bag is nice to store the set but the mallets have to be taken apart to fit nicely. Overall this is a great set for a serious beginner.",
