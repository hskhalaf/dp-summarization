My wife pointed out that the one thing which helped were these pearls. Hence the reorder. The only thing to be aware of is that they always stick when you swallow them, if you dry swallow pills like me you will need to chase with water as I do now. I highly recommend this product.",

I had tried Earth's Pearl and found using it didn't give me any problems. Easy ball to swallow and now it is time to change off again, so I once again ordered Earth's Pearl. I can't say how they taste, because I just swallow one with a good amount of water. Have a great day and keep healthy! P.S. Great review by my wife!!",

I never have this problem with other capsules that are much bigger but also smooth.",

Today I ate a meal without stomach pain for the first time in weeks and I didn\u2019t have to sprint to the bathroom. I almost felt....normal! I know IBS-D has no cure, but for the first time, I have hope for my symptoms. I am so grateful! I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from IBS-D. Try it. It\u2019s definitely helping me!",
