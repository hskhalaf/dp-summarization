It is NOT however for kids or the average size woman. Even at the lowest 40lb setting. Its hard to initially pull, I thought my wife could handle it, but not even close at all.... Now I need to buy her a regular long bow... I took off the worthless stock sight and installed a cheap whisper buscuit and circular 3 dot truglow sight, which are cheap here as well. Fixed my initial accuracy issues.",

The bow came with a sight which i didn't care for but i didn't buy this for the sight i just bought it for the bow itself and with a new sight i can shoot up to 50 yards effortlessly with minimal practice. Its very lightweight at only 4lbs so its easy to take on long hunts. I highly recommend this bow for anyone looking to take their hunting to the next level for a very affordable price.",

It is an old school teardrop system and does come with an old school sight. It all works perfectly fine, though I did upgrade the sight for easier use for my cousin. I would recommend this as a starter bow or something to just have target practice with. I'll update if I take it hunting.",

The arrow rest is thin cheap plastic which is a safety hazard if it breaks while shooting. The sight pins are made of dull brass that's hard to see. There are no shooting aids to attached to the string. You will have to buy accessories like a peep sight, kisser, etc. I took 1 star away because of the junk arrow rest and barely useable sight pins.

      "text": "amazing, beautiful bow. it didn't come with instructions and I didn't use the original sights it came with because I purchased an upgrade kit, also available on amazon. That upgrade kit is a must buy with this item and was pretty easy to equip to this bow. I took it to my local bow shop and they shortened the draw length for me (free of charge and took 2 minutes). It shoots beautifully and feels great. I went with the all black because i thought it looks cool and it honestly does, makes me feel like an archer from a movie almost, can't wait to take this bow hunting!",

    "title": "Siege SAS 55 lb 29'' Compound Bow w/ 5-Spot Paper Target",
    "description": "Do you want to give your shooters the best chance to develop their talents in archery? Then choose SAS Siege 55 lbs 29\" Compound Bow Set and give shooters the right gear of high quality and durability. \n\nThis archery bow is among the starter compound bows for sale in the market. The bow features a 41.5\u201d axle to axle, 29\u201d draw length, 206 FPS. This compressed ABS limb spans balance, weight and strength to continue the life of the bow. This compound has a strong piece layered limb used to draw weights up to 55 lbs. Loosening the bolt will decrease the draw weight by 5 pounds & tightening it will increase the weight 5 pounds. The limbs are accommodated in place by the back pivoting limb pockets, a strong connection with rigid tolerances for enhanced accuracy. A curb appeal is given to the bow by the riser. The number of cut outs in the riser provides the compound bow a waffle look. When the string is pulled back, the bow takes 55 lbs of force and it happens prior to the twin cam idlers activate. When the string is released, an arrow is launched at an outstanding speed of 206 feet per second. \n\nHighlights: \n\nCompressed ABS Limbs for long life \nAdjustable Bow Sight. \nRight Hand Only. \n\nSpecifications: \n\nDraw Length: 29\" \nDraw Weight: 40-55 lbs \nAxle to Axle: 41.5\" \nLet Off: 70% \nMax Speed: 206 FPS \nRecommended Arrow: 30\" Carbon and Aluminum arrow recommended \nNet weight: 4 lbs \n\nPackage Contents: \n\n1 x Compound Bow \n1 x Accurate Sight \n1 x Paper Target \n\nWarranty: \n\nThis item is fully covered by Southland Archery Supply three year manufacture warranty. Our warranty covers replacement/repair of defective/damaged products only, as determined by our reseller, SAS techs or RMA reps.",
