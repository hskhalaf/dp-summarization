And the greatest part of owning the Dell XPS 10 is that it works hand in hand with the Dell computers we currently own! I'd recommend this product to everyone who wants a tablet at half the cost, but does 10 times as much as an iPad!",

Dell made a good tablet, and Windows RT can be both fun and frustrating to explore on it, but for most people it comes down to software, and Microsoft is in third place for tablets.
