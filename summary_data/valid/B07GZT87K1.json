I bought extra of the things you put in it, I think they are key chains or just things to clip on something. You can also add other items yourself like rolled up dollars, packaged candy or chocolates, etc. The only improvement needed is the height of the machine. The claw will only open so far down so you cannot overly stuff the machine with items. Otherwise great toy for a 12 year old!",

I recommend using nickels or 5 cent euro coin. The plastics coins do not turn the machine on all the time. Well worth the money and recommend highly!!",
