I've never gotten such beautiful curls with so little effort and the rollers do not tangle in your hair. I love these rollers . This is my second purchase of these excellent hair rollers. My daughter loved how it made my hair look and so I bought her a package to send to her in Virginia. Great product!",

I do suggest using some sort of scrunching foam and or light hold hairspray especially if you have straight or hard-to-curl hair. And make sure your hair is damp, not soaking wet, if it\u2019s too wet you\u2019ll be waiting days to get your curls in the curlers to dry properly!

You can spray and hold the curl at any stage to your liking, or you can let the curl relax on its own. Either way, even poker-straight hair like mine has curl, which simply amazes me. 5, economical with a nice storage case. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I love my set!",
