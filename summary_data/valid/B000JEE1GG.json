I will say that the textured surface does result in cracking/drying of my feet if I walk on them non-stop all day. It's been my only ding on the Fannings over the years. It's fairly rare that I'm literally walking on them non-stop all day, so this isn't a common occurrence. But, I have always kind of secretly hoped they'd eventually change the design to be less \"texturey\". Still my automatic buy when a current pair of Fannings gets worn down to the air \"cushion\" in the back heel.",

Usually, this piece is made out of soft nylon or rubbery plastic (which all too often has a seam that also scratches). It's a shame that this one bad design choice ruins an otherwise perfect sandal.

I honestly don't see why that is incorporated in the design. \"I need to open a bottle, OMG let me take of my dirty sandal and open up this bottle that I will put to my mouth\". I really makes no sense. Its a completely useless feature that causes problems because it can snag on things, is a huge gaping hole for mud and street trash to get buried in. Without the bottle opener the sandal looks and feels great.",

They're also fairly supportive (hard to say about flip-flops) and stylish. I'm on my third pair -- the first pair started to fall apart after a few years (no complaints, they held together pretty well) and the second succumbed to my dog's separation anxiety, so the third pair is wearing in quite nicely. I typically wear a 7-7.5 men's shoe but have high arches, so the 8s seem to be fine -- .5 inches too long, if that, which makes me think they may run a little small.",

      "text": "I love Reefs, and I swear by them. I'm not a big fan of these though, because of the bottle opener in the arch. After some time, it always starts slightly stabbing in the arch of the foot. You can either get used to it, or get a different pair. Other than that, these sandals will last 1 to 2 years being worn every day, and it's usually the piece that goes between your toes that goes first. Get Reefs, just get ones without the bottle opener.",

They fit him great and are very comfortable to him. Good enough to me.",
