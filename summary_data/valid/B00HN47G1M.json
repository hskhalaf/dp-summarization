They stated that all locks can be overcome, but stated that this brand takes a lot more effort than most others. Purchased two of these locks, one for each of our bikes. This is a very heavy duty lock. It definitely will be difficult for someone to cut through this twice, in order to steal our bikes. The fit and finish of the lock is impeccable. This was a bit of a budget buster, so hopefully in the near future we can afford to purchase the matching chain locks.",

ABUS will not replace the lock unless I return it to dealer where I bought it for inspection. That dealer was Amazon, and the return window is long gone. I can ship the lock to ABUS to have them inspect it and determine if a replacement is warranted, but it's stuck on my bike/bike rack and even if I could get it off I would be without a lock for a few weeks. I recommend going with Kryptonite bike locks instead, as I have one of those that I purchased in 2005 that still works great 15 years later.",

The other thing he didn't like was that it is hard to lock the frame to the bike rack at his school because it obviously doesn't have the length of a cable lock. It can be a bit tricky to get it locked up but once you do, you can feel good knowing its secure.",

It's designed to resist extreme torque as well. It's easy to mount and rests sturdy. No rattling. Besides its amazing strengths, it's relatively light in weight. This is my main lock. Although, I obviously don't rely on only one lock. The other is its rival in the same category. The other weighs a ton, tough.",
