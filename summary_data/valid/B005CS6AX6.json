This BTL worked wonderfully right out of the shoot, I did have my reservations, turned out they were unfounded. This past week said muscle dog and I went camping, this BTL did it's job even with all the chipmunks and wild turkeys running right in front of muscle dog. Hardly even felt a tug when she would attempt to lunge at the critters. Would I recommend this Bike Tow Leash??? You Betch Ya--!!!",

I used this with my dog, and I have her wear a dog sled harness, which I also recommend, if your dog will be pulling you, that way they don't injure themselves or get bald/sore spots.

      "text": "With no tools required, this device attaches securely to my bike in about 45 seconds. It takes half that to remove it. It keeps my dog perfectly in the heel position and gently guides her through turns, stops, etc. I no longer worry about her pulling suddenly while we're moving or getting caught in or interfering with my rear wheel (she never did, but it was a constant concern for me - now it's impossible!) Interestingly, my dog seems to enjoy going for a ride/run a lot more now than when I was one-handing it with a leash. In short: this thing was worth every penny and I wish I'd gotten it sooner!",

There are a number of u tube videos that help with this decision. I attach it to her 1 inch collar which gives me better control of the ride and she just doesn't want to stop. She loves it.

Now that I have the bike tow leash I am able to get myself and my dogs in shape. The bike tow leash allows me to use my mountain bike on sidewalks or trails I would recommend this to anyone wanting to spend time with their dogs while getting in shape.",

Unlike the springer, this attaches at the center hub of the rear wheel, so it does not affect your balance when the dog pulls. The semi-rigid construction is perfectly suited to guide the dog in the right direction, and especially to keep it from running into the bike. This is a very good exercise tool for that high energy dog. Just let it pull you and you have full control with both hands on the handle bars and brakes.",

Amazingly fun and stable, the Bike Tow Leash prevents tipping and tangling making biking with your dog enjoyably stress free and rewarding. The Bike Tow Leash automatically reacts to the dogs movements as you would with an extra arm mounted low on your bike. It has a shoulder, elbow and wrist resilient barrier between your dog and bike to protect and gently communicate bike direction and speed changes. The Bike Tow Leash's unique patented mast prevents the bike from tipping when the dog pulls, reduces any jolts and gently trains your dog to stay in heel position. No special training is needed and is for dogs 10 to 185 pounds. The Bike Tow Leash comes with use and instructions and mounts without tools in less than 1 minute. When choosing color, for safety, we recommend a contrast between Bike Tow Leash color and bike so people can see your dog(s) are attached to your bike. Fits most bikes on left side and we recommend wide tire bikes with or without disc brakes. Attaches directly to trikes with a single rear wheel and mobility scooters. Contains standard length Bike Tow Leash, Standard Mounting Clamp, installation instructions and is a unique conversation starter with many years of enjoyment!",
