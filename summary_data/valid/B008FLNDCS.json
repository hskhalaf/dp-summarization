The new sets seem to be the same build quality but are now two-tone grey and a yellow-orange. The product photos on here need to be updated to match the new version. Photo posted is of the new sawhorses (with the old version behind them). I would give them 4-stars without that (sometimes they don't sit flat until you kick the legs out farther and put enough weight on them). But I'm knocking off 1 star for the fact that they don't match the photos.",

This helps to steady them. Be sure the wood is very straight or it will cause them to be unsteady. Another reviewer mentioned he thought he had an issue with his and realized it was directly because of the boards he attached being slightly warped. They are easy to use and great for a portable option. An actual handle would be nice, but you can easily grab the legs to carry. Happy with this purchase!",

    "description": "Here\u2019s a set of two of our Portamate PM-3300 sawhorses (the \u201cT\u201d in PM3300T stands for \u201cTwo\u201d). That means you are getting a pair of all steel, heavy duty, rock solid folding sawhorses that will make all of your DIY or professional projects easy. A stable, solid work surface is paramount for good work, and these will provide you that, and when you\u2019re finished, will fold right up for easy storage. Fully assembled, you can use these sawhorses right out of the box \u2013 just unfold the legs, use the locking pin to lock them into place, and that\u2019s it. The quality will be apparent, with one-inch heavy gauge tubular steel legs, and a powder coated, rust-resistant finish. And because this is a pair, you\u2019re getting a 1,000lb weight capacity, so go ahead and do the heavy work \u2013 these sawhorses can take it. You can also attach a 2x4 or 2x6 wood top to each one (they are pre-drilled to accept this). Comes complete with a one year limited warranty.",

Our heavy duty saw horses are the ones that you can bet on to get any job done quickly and efficiently.",
      "SIZE MATTERS \u2013 Each sawhorse has a top that measures 39\u201d x 3. 5\u201d with a comfortable 33\u201d work height, and a wide, stable 29\u201d x 48\u201d stance. Each sawhorse has a 500 lb maximum weight capacity and can support a total of 1, 000 lbs when both are used together.",

      "RIDE BAREBACK OR NOT \u2013 The steel tops can be used, or you can quickly mount a 2\u201d x 4\u201d or 2\u201d x 6\u201d wood piece to using the convenient pre-drilled holes. Its rust-resistant powder coat provides a tough finish for an extended life.",
      "DON\u2019T PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE \u2013 You know how the saying goes, but in this case, you can put the horse in your cart and buy with confidence. This Sawhorse set is backed by a 1-year to make your purchase worry-free."
