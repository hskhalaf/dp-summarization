I spent a ton of money the last three winters on Smartwool, Icebreakers, and REI base layer bottoms, trying to stay warm. They worked to keep me warm but they didn't fit properly; I walked around all winter battling the urge to constantly adjust my base layer. These fit like a dream, and they're softer and less itchy than even my Smartwool. I ordered one, then I ordered two more, and now I'm figuring out which size top is best for me from this brand, because these are far superior to the much pricier merino wool items I've already got in my closet. YAY!",
