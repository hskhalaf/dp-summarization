      "text": "I picked these up after being really impressed with the Creative GigaWorks T20s I bought for my girlfriend's PC. While these T40s are louder and definitely have more punch in the low end, the overall audio profile is actually worse. It seems Creative wanted desperately to satisfy bass hungry teens with these, and the end result is a sound profile that's muddy and muted when compared to the crystal clear T20s. I'm keeping them ultimately as they serve my needs, but those who care about balanced audio and are in the market for desktop computer speakers should save themselves some money and just grab the T20s.",

Although i feel these speakers are a upgrade over my previous Bose speakers nothing mind blowing going on with the creative T40's. The sound is warm, the Bass can give a decent thump (for the size) and the mids are clear but , still, not really blown away. Maybe my expectations were too high. With that said i think its safe to say these are the best 2.0 speakers on the market at the 100 dollar price point. Would highly recommend escpically if you are looking for a minor upgrade over the Bose Companion II. They looking really grill with the grill removed as well.",

Some people say it's not loud enough, which may be so if you are trying to use them to light up a room at a party, but for computer speakers to be listened too 3-4 feet away, it's plenty loud.

The bass comes out of the top (not back, like some other brands), so when laid flat with the bass outputs facing each other, it gives a nice thump thru the middle without having it dominate the treble. If the cables could have angled plugs (especially the power, since In/Output right-angle cables can be purchased separately), then the Right speaker could fit more flush against a surface, but that's such a minor complaint, it's inconsequential in the grand scheme. Not having to reserve real estate or power for a Sub is a huge advantage.",

I don't mute the tv speakers because you see that annoying mute symbol on the screen. When we have the tv speakers and these speakers on at the same time, the sound we get is much richer than we had before. We might get a soundbar for this tv which is in the living room, and move these speakers into the bedroom. I only wish these came with a remote to control the volume remotely.",

These speakers are actually pretty large and if you're looking for something compact I might recommend getting something a little smaller. Pros: Great sound quality with surprisingly good bass Similar sound as a standard 2.1 set Power off/ Standby for when you don't have sound running to the speakers Great design Cons: A little bit bigger than I expected.",

Frontal controls do the job easily (Bass, Treble, Volume, Headphones and Aux In) CONS Not really a con but if i must list one maybe it is the size, they are kinda big, not a problem for me.
