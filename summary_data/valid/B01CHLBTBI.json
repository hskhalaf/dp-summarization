My Chihuahuas need to be brushed but they are more delicate than larger dogs and the other brushes I tried were too harsh for them to enjoy the brushing. The one who hated being brushed now sits there with the look of ecstasy on her face. lol",

The bristles are about 0.75 inch long and are firm but have enough give to them as to not be 'pokie'. My dog LOVES it and it makes her coat super shiny and soft! She now gets so excited when I get it out and show it to her.",

He's a mixed breed with, by the looks of his hair and his size, some Yorkie in him so his hair is fairly long. He lies still for this brush and when I'm finished with one side, he rolls over for me to brush the other side. I'll get a toothbrush to do around his muzzle and eyes. My dog loves it and I love it. The amazing thing is that I brushed him about four hours ago and his hair is still pretty neat.",

This brush works quite nicely; it does manage to remove some hair, and it does not dig deep into his fur so he doesn't seem to get tired or feel any pain. The brush is of a lighter color than the pictures, and does have the legend 'From Russia with Love' on red ink, on the back. That wasn't completely expected. But other than that it's a great brush.",

    "description": "Choosing the Right Brush for your Pet\n\nWe understand that it can be difficult to find the right home grooming brush for your pet, and we want to make it easy on you. With our natural reinforced genuine boar bristle brushes, it is easy to de-shed and smooth your pet\u2019s fur.\n\nOur brush is Most Suitable for the Following Types of Fur Coats:\n\nShort, smooth coats: Retrievers, Hounds, Chihuahuas, etc\n\nShort, wiry coats: Terriers, etc\n\nThin, delicate coats: Yorkies, Maltese, etc\n\nMedium, Flowing Coats: Golden Retrievers, Spaniels, Setters, etc\n\nBuilt to Last\n\nOur brown boar bristle pet brush is 4.25 inches and is made in our factory in Russia that has been producing premium quality brushes since 1922. We believe in providing high-end products that will last for years without breaking or shedding.\n\nStrengthen the Bond with Your Pet\n\nA pet can become a man and woman\u2019s best friend. Dogs and cats are loyal, brave, true, and always so happy to see you. It\u2019s hard not to feel happy around your pet, right? Show your pet some extra love and appreciation with a good brushing session. They'll be in hog heaven, and your undeniable bond will continue to grow unbreakable.\n\nDirections for Best Results:\n\nStep 1) Brush down and out, away from your dog and cat\u2019s skin. Make sure to brush in the direction the hair grows.\n\nStep 2) Be extra gentle and careful to untangle any snarls. If you encounter mats, apply a coat conditioner or mat spray and leave it on for several minutes. Then use a wide-toothed comb or a mat-splitting tool to get through the tangle.\n\nStep 3) We recommend brushing your dog and cat every couple of days for optimal grooming.\n\nGet Your Premium Dog Brush Today and Experience the Difference a Boar Bristle Brush Makes!
