      "text": "Worked great on removing 2 sets of lug nuts on my Honda Acord and Honda civic. The basic battery (not included) from porter cable lasted for the entire 2 jobs. It showed only 20% battery loss. Torqued down the lugs are 100 ft/lbs. This unit broke all the lugs free no problem after being sitting on the car 2 years and 12,000 miles. So much nicer than the loud air tools, plus no cord or hose to deal with! All my power tools are going battery!",

Two came out easily, on one older one made it struggle for a second or two, but then out she came. I'm very happy with it and will be adding to my already extensive PC collection of battery powered tools. For the price, it's great!",
