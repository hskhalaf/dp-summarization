My fiance and I cleaned out a little corner in the garage and this fits there so perfectly!!! It's perfect for my workouts and I don't have to pay Jabz $100+ per month any more. We put two 50 lb bags of sand in the bottom and left the sand right in the bags (way less messy that way). I do wish it was a little bit taller as even on the highest setting I can't do the high lateral punches but other than that one thing, I think it's pretty perfect!",

This is frustrating because a small pool of water will collect on top of the bag's base and you know, eventually, you'll have to disassemble the whole thing and fill it back up again so it doesn't go flying when you hit it. In addition to these issues, I bought the bag \"new\" but it arrived used. I inferred this from the fact that it was covered in sand, as if the base had already been filled with sand previously.

The only thing I dislike is unable to use the bag any longer because of how the screws are set into the plastic base is now stripped. I don't know if I would buy another one, but I would refer the bag once again to others. No power shots should be thrown on it. just use it like a shadow box mode.",

I want to send this back as for it does not even have the right parts for complete set up!!",
