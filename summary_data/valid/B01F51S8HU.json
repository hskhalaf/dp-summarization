I noticed that the plunger was kind stuck in the tube and once i pulled it out there was a gummy oil type substance inside the tube and on the plunger that smelled like rancid oil. I tried to wash it out with hot water and dish soap but couldn't get it off or out of the bottom of the tube as the picture shows. Hope this was not a previously used and returned product and then resold to me. :( Not a good outcome here. Requested a refund and returning the item.",

Product seems pretty well made. Plastic essentially wrapped in stainless. I did try the needles before I took it apart and it looked like it would be a great injector. Might have to order one to actually use it for what it\u2019s intented for.",

The plastic holding case is kind of jank, mine arrived bent a bit and so it doesn't stay snapped closed, I put things on top of it to keep it closed. It's fine though.",

The item came apart easily to clean and stood up well to the marinade and the sharpness of the needle made it easy for it to go smoothly into the flesh of the meat with no tearing. As if all that weren\u2019t enough, it even came with a case for easy storage of all the items in one place. So happy with this!!",
