Best feature is the fact that the lense does not project from the camera when zooming out. Makes it easy to take pix undetected. Slide cover keeps lens protected. Drawback is that it's so small that its hard to hold, but I overcame the situation by attaching a tripod base to it. This allows for a good grip, and lets the camera stand upright on a surface for unattended pix and videos.",

Good for beginners and intermediate photographers. Not your typical point-and-shoot, especially with the 7X optical.
