THIS year, I bought the Clip 3, with 1000 mAh, and had it cranked on high for over three hours. Great sound out of such a small package and it clips right to the bottom of the net or a beach umbrella. I couldn't be more pleased.",

Alas, the following week the arm broke off and I can't use the clip to hold it on my bike. Terrible waste of money!",

A little tweak maybe on the design of the USB port, I wish the cover of the port can twist while being charged so that the plug is not in the way. I have this feeling that after heavy use it would eventually break the silicone/plastic cover. Overall highly recommended for the sound quality, portability and price.",

The hook is made from sturdy aluminum, but the hinge of the hook is flimsy. I wouldn't expect it to last long if you clip and unclip it often. The speaker is also heavier than I expected.

The speaker's excellent sound quality allow me to hear songs, audiobooks, and podcasts with clarity even when the windows are rolled down in my vehicle.

Once sinked with your phone, you never have to worry about it again. Once you turn it on, it sinks to your phone. The sound is good for such a small speaker. I can hear it fine. all and all really good durable speaker.",

Because they have apparently done everything can possibly can to squeeze bass out of such a tiny speaker, it makes the voices sound boomy and sometimes hard to hear clearly \u2014 the speaker really emphasizes the low-end at the expense of the mid-range which is critical for spoken word.

I previously used a Bose soundlink color outside by our pool (which is much more expensive) and this little speaker is two times better. Great product!",

I contacted JBL who said that since it was gone there was nothing they could do about it (which I disagree with but it\u2019s not the fault of the customer support person).
