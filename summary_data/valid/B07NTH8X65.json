Ordered a replacement and second toaster did the same thing - cooked on one side, not so much on the other. Might be serious QC issues since a few reviewers had better experiences. Personally, I can not recommend this toaster.",

My other toaster did the same thing. I've never found a toaster or toaster oven that did perfect toast. One thing I think is important, if you have children please watch them because this toast is light weight and has a tendency to tip forward when you pull the handles down. Also the sides get hot. For my household this toaster is good. Plus it looks beautiful in the kitchen. My kitchen is a mix of grey and black. I'm happy with my purchase.",

Bagels, now, are the very opposite of how you've been accustomed to toasting them forever. I agree, the numbers on the dial are very small and a bit hard to read.
