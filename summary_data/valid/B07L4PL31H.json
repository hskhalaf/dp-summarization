The 'design' of these shoes looks identical, but the foot volume has dramatically reduced to an extent that I could not get my foot into the shoe and lace it because there is insufficient material to cover my foot.. both shoes, so not a production fault. Such a huge disappointment.. and to add a bit of insult I had to pay \u00a314.00 to return them..",
