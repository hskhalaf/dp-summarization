They looks good and save you from accidentally cutting yourself. Just a caveat: Don't try to intentionally test them, the knife may poke your gloves or try to life ot tough hot objects. They are not made for handling hot stuff. Decent buy for your cutting needs in kitchen.",

The knit material feels very comfortable and it has stopped slips with my wood carving knives. I believe that my previous steel mesh gloves were more substantial...but the plastic coating on the palms broke down after a few years and my wood projects all turned out 'blue.' Not gonna happen with these gloves. I might need to be more careful with my Berkel deli-slicer but I never got close to knicking myself with that anyway.",

I took it across the mandolin one last time and the edge of the pinky in the glove briefly came in contact with the blade. The blade effortlessly cut through the pinky.

      "text": "I am left-handed and have always had problems with knives that are sharpened for use by right-handed users since they can slip while I am cutting and I get cut. I used these gloves while slicing onions and I liked that the material is thin enough to still allow me to grip the onion well but heavy enough to protect my hand from being hurt when the knife slipped. The gloves worked exactly as intended and the sizing chart provided allowed me to receive a pair of gloves that fit perfectly.",

I do not recommend getting these to wet as well as it makes the fibers weaker. Would recommend.",

Therefore I was unable to safely hold the knife while wearing it without the knife slipping out of my hand.",

I still loved the knives so much, I bought them. I cut my finger again, as the top skin of the onion slid back and I sliced my ring finger. We decided to buy these gloves to hopefully help with the injuries. I haven't cut myself yet, although they do tell you that they're not 100% cut proof. You can stick the tip of a knife through the weave of the gloves, I don't intend of stabbing myself, just keeping me from getting cut, to which they have worked wonderfully.",
