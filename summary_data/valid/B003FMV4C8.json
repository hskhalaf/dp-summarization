At first this bandeau seemed tight, but it needs to be snug in order to give you any support. I really like this bra. It will give me options, that I can occasionally wear something strapless\u2014or spaghetti-strapped tops. It is made exceptionally well. I am almost 60 yrs old.",

My only complaints are that the edges aren't very soft, I hope that'll change in the wash. The plastic lining on the top seams it's really thin and I'm not sure it'll actually do its job well. And, it seems like the price for what you get should have been a lot lower, like maybe $25. For the actual price, I expected a lot more. I guess, for a Victoria's Secret price, I expected Victoria's Secret quality and it's not even close. :-(",

Either the cups don't fit right, they're too tight or too loose, or a straight jacket for your boobs. But this. This bra--it's comfortable, supportive enough, doesn't squish you flat, and stays in place. I'm in the A cup range and I don't know how this would work for larger-chested ladies, but henceforth this will be my main bra and I'm ordering several more.",

      "text": "After looking for something to go with a deep V dress I own (other than the oh-so-fashionable safety pin closure), I borrowed the Cosabella from a friend of mine. It looked stunning. Not only did it offer the right amount of coverage, it was stylish also-much more so than anything else I tried. I wear it over my bra, strapless or otherwise, and it's perfect for low V tops, see through tops, and more. You could probably wear it alone, but it might not be enough support for anyone who is a size C or larger. I currently only have the black, but will likely buy the skin-tone version as well.",
