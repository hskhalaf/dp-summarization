The balls are great - mini volleyballs. The trampoline piece itself was poorly made. The green legs seemed thin and light-weight. The main disappointment was the net itself. Cheap net with larger holes than expected. We built the unit as per the instructions and the net was loose (not like a trampoline). We tightened up the net, but it was still not as taut as it should be to play this game. Complete joke. I am returning it.",

That just takes practice, but it is a great game if you are looking for a challenge....it takes coordination, this isn't a game that you can hold a beer during!",

The 3 balls included are also of high quality. Overall, extremely impressed with the entire set. Everything feel of the highest quality.",

I do wish the legs could be made to be spring loaded however because it would be nice to have them fold down in the event someone were to step or fall on top of the net. This would add some additional durability for sure. Otherwise, for what you pay it is bargain and you will have countless hours of fun. Easy five stars! :)",

My biggest complaint is trying to keep the net tensioned...it seems like it needs to be adjusted every time we play. If they could figure out that problem this game would be 5* amazing",

Now that summer is in full swing, I have had the chance to play quite a bit and to introduce Slammo to many people, everyone loves it.

    "title": "GoSports Slammo Game Set (Includes 3 Balls, Carrying Case and Rules)",
    "description": "Slammo is an action packed 2 on 2 game that is similar to volleyball, but with a smaller ball and a circular net. The rules are similar to volleyball where each team has 3 hits to spike the ball into the ankle high circular net. Teams volley back and forth until a team is unable to return the ball to the net. The first team to 21 points win. We engineered an improved design over the competition that provides 100 percent net coverage and eliminates the hated 'pocket shot'. The Slammo Set includes two competition size 9cm balls and also one 12cm training ball for beginners or younger players. The game can be quickly assembled and it fits neatly into the included backpack style carrying case. The game is a great workout and much easier to setup than full size volleyball. Recommended for ages 12+.",
