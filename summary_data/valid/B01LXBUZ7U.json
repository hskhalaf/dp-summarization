It\u2019s slighty lacking in terms of stiffness and sensitivity but it\u2019s worth it for the convenience. My only two concerns are the lack of a carrying case and strength.

What it does do though is come very close to the mid range rods for a quarter of the price. My favorite thing about this rod is the length, it\u2019s longer than most non nymphing 3wts on the market and it mends very well. Is it gonna replace your 200 rod? Nope, but it will fish very nicely until then. Worth the buy.",

I am fishing for stream trout usually and decided to go with this rod as it had pretty good reviews and came with a case! And I am so happy I did! It's nice a and light and when you put the pieces together...they stay together! This is yet another great product from a company that cares about quality! Highly recommend! I have since also tried bass and even sunfish and this pole is wonderful!",
