Don't get an umbrella with fiberglass. They are too weak.",

Some reviewers say it's heavy, but I can't really tell/don't really care, but I'm a fairly large man, too. Hence, why I needed a big umbrella. In my experience so far, I think I can say this: if you don't need an umbrella EVERY day, and just those times when it's really rainy, this is perfect for you. I know I'm very satisfied with it.",

You can easily fit two people beneath it and keep dry, and the material seems sturdy and wouldn't rip easily. I was skeptical because it was so cheap, and i've never shopped for an umbrella before so i didn't really know what to expect. I'm happy with the buy and think it was definitely worth it. I would've given it 4 1/2 stars because the pole material seems a little flimsy (it's plastic), but overall it works great and so far has held up under light winds at least. It'll probably last you years.",

Good thing those lights change quickly though, because before you have time to process those thoughts and take action, it's time to walk!",
