Having used both of them for the same amount of time, I think the Stanley is higher quality in every way, although the Thermos has a wider mouth.",

The outside gets warm, which means they are losing heat. Can't tell if it is a cap or insulation problem. This product is made in China. I spend lots of time in China and the hot water bottles there often have the same problem. My guess is that whoever now owns the Thermos brand is not doing their job concerning quality control on the factory in China that is making this for them. Won't buy this brand again.

    "title": "Thermos Stainless King 68 Ounce Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle, Midnight Blue",
    "description": "Color:Midnight BlueAn ideal choice for people on the go, the Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Thermos vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is a superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer. This beverage bottle keeps beverages hot or cold for 24 hours, making it a great choice for wherever life's adventures may take you. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 2 Liter beverage bottle is virtually durable, yet its rugged design is both eye-catching and functional. The specially designed twist and pour stopper lets you pour without having to remove the stopper completely. A simple twist is enough to allow liquids to flow out. This beverage bottle comes equipped with its own built-in, insulated stainless steel serving cup, so there is no need to pack an additional cup. The bottle also features a compact, fold-flat handle for easy carrying that also provides increased stability and handling when pouring. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the beverage bottle just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the beverage bottle with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. Attaching the lid will further increase the thermal efficiency. This bottle stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Beverage Bottle is made of BPA-free materials and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.",
