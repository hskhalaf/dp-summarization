Battery it lasted 8 hours. But if you will have for walking or running or bike, will be nice. BUT if you work in a really loud environment like a manufacturer dont buy it. It's not gonna work.",

I have tested it with my iPhone and it works flawlessly. Sound is adequate for a bluetooth speaker but of course it won't be Bose quality and shouldn't be just based on size alone. The sound will surprise you tho .... much louder and crisper than what I expected. As I stated earlier a Canadian shouldn't have to order a Canadian made device from the US. I hope you find this helpful.",

Happily I discovered that it will clip onto my jersey securely so I don't have to affix it to my handlebars or backpack. It will not win any awards for sound quality, but it is loud enough and feels well made in hand. Blackberry must've lost money on this thing, but we are the beneficiaries.",

I can't speak to its longevity in the environment I chose to use it but for the price I can risk it. Only had the chance to use it for one day so far. Great product for the price I paid.",
