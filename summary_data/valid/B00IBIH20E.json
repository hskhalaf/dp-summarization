If you are printing labels on a large scale, you might want to get something with cheaper label options.",

A high-resolution image of, say a shipping label, would make more sense printed on a smaller width label at 3.5\" for this labeler (versus 4.0\" for Dymo brand labeler). The software really needs to be revamped. Even if you screen grab or import a high-resolution image into the software, the output is still low-resolution. Label appears grainy. iPhone barcode scanner apps will have trouble reading the code. The printed text are challenging to read - not that they are tiny, letters have blurry edges.",
