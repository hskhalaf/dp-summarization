I\u2019ve ordered cartons of the Bounty Select-A-Size paper towels in the \u201cFamily 2 rolls/package\u201d from Amazon for several months now and been very happy. When I placed my most recent order, there was a message on Amazon\u2019s webpage that said \u201cthis item has been replaced with a newer model\u201d. Unfortunately the \u201cnewer model\u201d has 15 fewer sheets/roll and costs $1.02 more/carton. The only way to distinguish between the original Bounty rolls and the \u201cnewer model\u201d Bounty rolls is that the original ones say \u201cSelect-A-Size\u201d on the package and the \u201cnewer model\u201d packages say \u201cQuick Size\u201d. This a very disappointing development from both Bounty and Amazon!",
