That sucks because there's a lot cheaper filament out there.",

Make sure to pay attention to the size, too, if you are buying extra filament. If you stick with the 3Doodler brand, you should be fine. Overall, this is a nice pen to create decorative trinkets like pins and little toys, and some more useful items like small containers.",

It uses straight, rod-like filament that is also thicker than the other styles of pens. The filament feeds into pen easily and you van switch colors out with no problems. This pen comes with several fun templates to try. Glasses (see pic) the Eiffel Tower, table coasters. But really, my kid just loves to create. I think, totally worth spending a small amount more to get something that will last more than 30 days. To me, this pen is of higher quality and a better value as a result.",
