Charging - Never really have to worry about how fast it charges Cons: 3 ports - somehow everytime I'm using 3 ports at once, it will not work. It will charge on and off literally every half second. I usually charge my iphone, ipad pro, and watch at the same time with original apple chargers. I am not sure if it is because the ipad pro is takes too much charge.",

I taped it up, left it alone for a couple days. Then when I went and actually hung headphones from it, I found it all on the ground the next morning. update: vendor is mailing me new adhesive, I'll update based on if it works. But they were also VERY friendly to work with, and tried very hard to fix my issue. Changing my review to reflect quality customer service, and to remind everyone that the device still 'worked' for me, it charges. Just maybe doesn't 'hold'",

The ports lose retention almost immediately, and then as the retention support continues to deteriorate, it opens up the inevitable possibility that the plastic plate inside the ports will simply just break off from the stress of cables hanging from it. Don't bother with this.",

A removable power cable would have solved this issue. The loop isn't very noticeable, especially when you mount it an inch or two back from the face of the desk.

Pros: Really holds my Beats Studio 2's very well and the 3 ports are very convenient.

Usb charging hub, cable channels for headphones and double sided headphone hanger. i stream and Use a pair Of Sennheiser headphones as my gaming headest, and I have a pair of sony mdrx as my 'outside' headphones. Having the space to hang both while charging my phone, apple watch, and echo is far beyond what I could've asked for when thinking of any standard headphone hanger. Highly recommended, worth every penny!!!",

I've had no troubles with it holding my Corsair Void headset which is rather large and bulky. I'm ordering another one now for my home office.",
