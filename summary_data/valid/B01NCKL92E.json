      "text": "If you purchase this ball, be careful removing the small sticker that is adhered to the ball. The sticker has a small QR code on it and was partially permanently stuck to the ball covering. It will tear off the very thin layer of vinyl material on the ball if you try and remove it. It doesn\u2019t appear to serve any purpose and provides no beneficial information, so our son wanted it removed. This ball covering is extremely thin and I question the durability over any period of time based on how easily it peeled off with the sticker.",

Unfortunately, air leaks out fast - like it would have to be pumped every 20 minutes to retain enough air to be usable. I thought I had finally found the perfect ball, but it's another miss for me.",
