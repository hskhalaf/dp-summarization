Don't plan on letting it run constantly so it should last awhile. SO OVER ALL it is a good product that could be made great but would cost more. Here is a thought Styrofoam board from hardware store. Or from a furniture store for free maybe.",

I saw this really cool casket that supposedly moves and makes sounds, etc. I just received it and was surprised to see this small box. First, it requires assembly. Second it is some type of rubbery material (not styrofoam). I see the speaker box inside so, hopefully it is worth the $$$ I paid once it is assembled and set up. The picture shown does not look anything like kit does in the small box that I received.",
