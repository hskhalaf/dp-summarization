I would have given five stars if it would record continuous video. The 360sp 4K splits the video at 30 minutes or less based on file size. I was looking to record up to 2 hours continuous video and this wasn't in any of the specs I was able to find before buying. The battery life is ok at about 55 minutes minimum video recording.

Sample of video at:  Two cameras being forced to work in tandem means compromises are required; a watch is required to control the cameras, rather than an app. Removing cameras from their housing is fiddly, but required every time you want to charge the cameras - which is a lot.",

The Dual Pro Pack is more for the tech savvy type, although after doing it once, you will feel like anyone can do it.
