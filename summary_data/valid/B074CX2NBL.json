      "text": "I would have preferred the that this have AM and PM connected together but then able to split up the days. So if I am taking a trip on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Then be able to interconnect just these days together. The way this organizer is set up, you can only travel with all 7 day strips. And the AM and PM can be used separately, but who needs that??? I would think it better to have them together and then being able to disconnect the various days. I thought that was what I was getting but evidently I did not read the description properly.",

      "text": "I've used for three or four weeks and like the product. It gives you a visual if you forgot your meds. I use an app on my iPhone to remind me so basically this simply keeps the meds in one place and easy to access. The headline is misleading. You can easily still miss your meds as this product doesn't put them in your mouth. Just a great organizational tool.",

      "text": "These are great for anyone that only has a few pills that they need to take during the course of a day. The buttons, while nice for opening the lids are unfortunately the cause of a problem for me which is that they reduce the size of the cups and make these too small to hold all of my daily supplements and medications which, I have to say, is a deal breaker for me. If these came in an extra large version that would change my three star review to a five.",

      "text": "Love the little silicone strips that make the lids pop up and stay open. Simple, foolproof, effective. Work better than any kind of spring. Can open all the compartments at once and they stay open enough to easily fill. Compartments hold 2 large fish oil capsules, a big multivitamin, two large hair and nail supplements plus several smaller pills. I do store it inside a heavy ziplock bag to avoid losing meds to accidental opening. Hasn\u2019t happened while in the bag. Very satisfied.",

      "text": "The lids are spring loaded, and stay up when you open them. This means that when you go to refill all the compartments for the week, you don't have to either try to jury rig a way to keep seven at a time open, or even worse, do them one at a time. Note that I've only had this for a week or so, so I can't comment on its long-term durability, but as of right now I will call it far superior to any other I've had, for that one simple and important reason.",
