While the rental fins were always okay, I'm now spoiled by these great fitting and super comfortable fins. Could not get over how comfortable there were. They will definitely go with me on future snorkel trips, and they really don't take up much space at all.",

Imagine kicking strong for 1 min and making 20 meters of progress, but losing 5 meters (as the current pulled me back a bit) while taking a 10 second break. Other than that, quality is fine.
