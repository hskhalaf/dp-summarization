      "text": "When we left China, I despaired of being able to stir-fry in America. This electric wok gets the job done! It heats well, especially for an electric, and the non-stick surface means I don't have to use quite as much oil as I would in a conventional, cast-iron pan. It's big, it's heavy, the heating element is solid and easy to control, and best of all it comes apart for cleaning. It doesn't get quite as hot nor is it as easy to handle as a cast-iron wok over a good flame -- the way we cooked in China -- but it's the next best thing. Totally worth the money!",

It's what I've come to expect from Breville (although they have had a miss or two). As far as longevity, I have used the pan at least once, usually twice or thrice times per week for the last few months. The bonded anti-stick coating seems to be in good shape, although the center (low point) of the wok is slightly discolored. I will update in a few months regarding the overall condition.",

Be sure to let the wok heat up for 10 min before cooking on the sear setting. The clean up was super easy. You will not be disappointed in this product for stir fry.",
