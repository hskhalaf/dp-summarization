The mascara is not too wet otherwise my fine lashes would clump. But in my opinion, the brush is too big...I contacted Clinique and asked them to make a smaller brush, but who knows if they will. The mascara defines every lash without clumping which is exactly what I needed. I tried several mascaras, including Bare Minerals Lash Domination which does have a smaller brush, but none were as good as Clinique. I tried the sampler combo with primer before purchase so knew I would like it.",
