      "text": "I bought this machine as a replacement for one that I have had for several years made by Xerox that looks just like this one. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this machine, very poorly made. The first problem was that the page guide as made does not fit the holes for it on the machine so that it doesn't line up and cannot be used as a page guide. The worse problem is that the 2 hole punch feature does not line up in the center of a page of 8 1/2 in paper. I need the holes to be centered on the page. I would not recommend buying and will not buy again from this source.",

They key here is \"standard.\" There's no way to adjust the spacing if you need anything different. However, my kids only need holes for paper in their binders, so no problem here. The paper guide is a bear to get on and I still don't think it's seated all the way in. Just don't want to touch it for fear that it will fall off. It's not actually necessary, but minus one star because the guide is so hard to snap on.",

It is definitely meant for a business (or education) office where this product's power is needed. It does fit on a desk but it takes up quite a bit of real estate on the desk so it isn't really meant to be for home or in an office where a paper hole puncher is needed now and again. If a hole puncher is needed on a frequent basis for reams of paper, then this would work as it has good power and it is very sturdy.",
