      "text": "I recently passed the PMP exam with the expert guidance of Aileen Ellis' trio of books: How to get every earned value question right on the PMP exam, How to get every network diagram question right on the PMP exam and How to get every contract calculation question right on the PMP exam. Each book is a quick read establishing parallels between theory and practice. The sample questions spanned the most basic concepts to the most complex. Utilizing Aileen's books give me the confidence needed to pass complex areas of the exam in a short period of time. I highly recommend these books to anyone requiring focus on these aspects of the exam.",
