It hits all the checkmarks: Great lens, manual dials, good low light performance, fast autofocus, super high-resolution EVF with no apparent lag, etc. My favorite feature is all the features they decided to leave out, especially the million function buttons most cameras have today. It has all the old school charm of a film camera with some well executed modern features.",
