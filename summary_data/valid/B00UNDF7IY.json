Not sure if its the processor, memory, or the lollipop operating system. Still a good entry level tablet though.",

Where my old tablet was slow and underpowered, this one is fantastic. There is no noticeable delay when I turn it on or open apps. Everything seems to just work as it should. The screen is bright and the images crisp. The sound is excellent, too with dual speakers. The front and rear cameras both work great and I'm rediscovering the joy of taking random pictures throughout my day.

It is small enough to toss into a purse or book bag, and in fact I was able to scale down my book bag to a much smaller bag now that I am not lugging around a laptop or first gen 10\" tablet. The problem with that is that it tends to get wedged between books, bounced around, etc. So, get yourself a good hard shell type case to protect the screen side.",

Plays app games well, runs quite cool. Stutters on high-demand apps. More likely to crash than overheat. Does basically what it should for its specs and price range which, for the record, should be $99, NOT anything higher. I don't know what these sellers are trying to pull, tacking on an extra $35 or $40 just because this model is selling well. This is a $99 tablet and at that price it's a wonderful little model.

Since there is no flash, indoor pictures can be rather grainy. But outside photos are great. The tablet has met all my expectations so far. Just one thing I can't find adjustment for is the vibrational feedback when I am typing in some applications, and it seems to require a rather hard TAP to register the punch of a letter / number. But the sound is terrific and the HD look of the screen is very good. I'm satisfied.",

The size of the screen is great to video call or just watch your favorite videos. My brother uses this for school work and says he wouldn't trade it for anything else. The picture and visual quality is spectacular pretty sharp images and the camera takes very nice photographs. I will definitely purchase another one of this tablets for my other brother.",
