I did take it in to be cleaned and serviced last year (first time) the service tech said it was a great machine. It only needed cleaning. I see a lot.

It would sew again after it \"cooled down\" but I didn't appreciate sewing on \"Brother\" time. I haven't tried all the special decorative stitches but I'll get there! It's heavier than all get out but it doesn't bounce around the table like the Brother did either. All-in-all, I'm very happy with this machine.",

It has done anything I have needed it to do and for my level of sewing skill and project skill it has done an excellent job and has the potential to do much more than I will ever likely put it through.",

I've never had a machine with a needle threaded, but I love, love love it. Also the automatic thread cutter is a big plus for me. I read a few reviews that had me on the fence about buying it, but I'm so glad that I did. This is the best sewing machine I've ever owned!",

I like the weight of the machine...not too much to haul around but sturdy and won't jitter all over the table when \"speeding\" like my old one. Love the deeper throat for bulky projects. Very pleased with this purchase! Updated one year later: STILL loving this machine. Very happy with it and glad I upgraded! My mom was impressed enough that she just ordered one to replace her Brother \"retreat\" aka traveling machine.",

Those were bulky and came with leg peddle. My first impression on the new Singer - A Great looking machine- compact, sleek, portable, digital and full of features. But we are still exploring. Delivery was on time and the machine came well packaged. For novice user, it would have been nice if the package included video instructions (CD/DVD) rather than manual. Thought I heard that videos were available on YouTube. A very steep learning curve before we can explore all its features.",

I\u2019ve been the actual main user of it since as a complete amateur using YouTube as my instructor for everything from threading a bobbin to actually using the machine. This thing is fantastic! I bought heavier needles because I\u2019ve been sewing waxed canvas together to create covers for many of out outdoor tools like axes that we use in the field that have to carried distances. It works as expected and being able to stitch in a monogram or a phrase /name on a case takes this to another level.",
