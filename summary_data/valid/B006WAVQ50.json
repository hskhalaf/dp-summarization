The sound quality is great, it still looks spotless, and his band teacher has commented on how surprised he is regarding its quality and durability. Like other reviewers, we had an issue with a broken valve within the first 6 months, and the customer service was awesome. We had a brand new replacement trumpet - not just the valve - sent to us within a week. It has performed flawlessly since. We highly recommend this trumpet to any beginner or student musician. The quality is great and we saved hundreds versus renting one for two years.",

That being said, my son noticed several flaws in the Jean Paul right away: imperfections in the finish around, very rough edges on the valves (my son explained it as \"it feels crusty when I press it\"), felt looked like they were about to fall out. None of these problems could be found on the $500 valued yamaha.",

She has to clean it 3 times a practice session and cannot play the proper notes without having to stop (messing up the timing) and pull the levers back up. Bad instrument/bad purchase.
