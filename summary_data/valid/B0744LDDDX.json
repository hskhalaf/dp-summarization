This is a very poor quality pitcher. I would suggest not buying it. It will be at your own risk.",

On the third use, the hot tea quickly melted through the ice, hit the bottom of the pitcher and cracked it. Based on this, it appears as though the glass pitcher is not only thin as suggested by other reviews, but it also is not made of tempered glass which increases the likelihood of breakage.",
