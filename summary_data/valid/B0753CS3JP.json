So that\u2019s most likely the reason why your clothes are wet while wearing the jacket.

Also, collapsing it into itself is not a tedious process (I'm looking at YOU unrealistic sleeping bag packing bags...). Have yet to test it in the rain but seems like it would hold out water very well. Hood is also elongated (to the point where you could wear a forward facing baseball hat and it wouldn't get wet).

      "text": "Great, light, & practical raincoat. It saved me a couple of times on hikes. The coat came folded up, I didn't pay attention to how it was folded. So, if you buy it open it gently and see how it came in. Even though, I do not know how it came in folded so tight and neatly, the coat is still thin and light enough to throw inside a backpack and have sufficient space.",
