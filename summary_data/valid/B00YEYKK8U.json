It is very flimsy and although it made fine coffee for two weeks overall it was a bad experience. I have had OXO products in the past that worked out well but this was a dud. Poorly made.",

For example: water fill is see through glass container, filter basket lid flips open 180 degrees, one button/dial to adjust for number of cups, set clock etc. All in all, a well thought out design that makes coffee as good as you would get if you poured water over a filter yourself. Thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for about one hour and ensures you never get the burnt taste when coffee sits on a hot plate. Deducting one star since it's a bit overpriced. Also because 9 cups is a strange increment and not truly sized to a mug of coffee. Be aware that 9 cups equates to about 3 large size mugs of coffee.",

Although everything tasted great from the first run, the awkward lid makes it a hassle to clean, and if you don't clean it really well, the coffee isn't going to be great.",

You can take the carafe with you to another room and place on any unprotected surface. It is not warm/hot at all on the exterior of the carafe. The insulation on this is a thing of beauty.",

This valve should stop the flow of coffee when the pot is removed from the base, but due to poor design and a weak spring, it rarely closes and coffee runs out of the cone and onto the base. Also, the pot and the filter cone do not align (see photo). This does not affect function, but I think a $200 coffee maker that aspires to \"high design\" should have something as basic as this worked out. Seriously considering returning it.",

You ask about the flavor from this coffee maker? I think it's the coffee blend that we use that produces the flavor we like, not any specific pot.
