When I play it with him, we make more noise than music (lol), but we both enjoy it. I feel like Tom Hanks in the move BIG where he played the floor piano in the toy store. My only recommendation to the manufacturer would be the addition of a volume control button. It\u2019s pretty loud, which my son loves, but it would be nice to be able to turn down the volume sometimes. Overall it\u2019s a great value, my 4 year old loves it and no problems so far.",

I have to put a step stool over it so my three year old doesn't crank it up to max when she's jumping around. The sound should be on the big black box! Maybe it works better for an older child, but if you're a parent of a younger one--put something over the sound buttons and save your ears!",

It\u2019s slid around quite a bit. They had a great time, they were jumping all over it and the volume didn\u2019t seem to impact their fun. Us as parents on the other hand.... well... perhaps some tape or something over the speaker would help?",

With that said, loud toys have never bothered me. I just figure if my kiddos love it, which they do, I love it too!!",
