      "text": "I am a pediatric speech pathologist and feeding and swallowing specialist who bought this chair for my practice. I received it just about a week ago and used it for the first time yesterday. I love this chair! It provides great support and stability, which is key to proper oral motor functioning when eating and swallowing. The adjustable seat and footrests allow me to successfully position both little and big clients for therapy sessions. It was so easy to clean and I love how effortlessly the straps can be removed for washing. An added bonus is that it is so good looking. I love the green cushion. All of my therapists are excited to use it in their treatments, too!",

He was 2 months early so his therapists wanted to make sure he had a five point harness, and a place for his feet and arms that is adjustable, it's perfect. It does have one handed cover removal but needs two hands to remove the entire tray. Excited to try many more foods in this high chair.",

      "text": "I hate this chair. I wish I had never bought it. Stain comes off when we clean it. Turns the rags orange. Food gets in between the seat cushion and straps making it difficult to clean. The cushions are easily bendable, so your little one can take their dirty hands and grab the cushion, pull, and now you have a dirty cushion and dirty wood. It\u2019s so annoying how the table part clicks in. The plastic part covering the wooden table tray doesn\u2019t cover it completely and my LO can his dirty/greasy hands and touch both the plastic and wood part so it\u2019s two things to clean, instead of just one plastic tray. I hate it. SO MUCH CLEAN UP.",

A friend purchased one for his daughter with similar disabilities, and the plastic parts crack and break apart. He is contacting the manufacturer for a solution to this problem. I will update this review, when we find out what the manufacturer responds to his issues.",

A great feature is that you can adjust the levels/heights without using any tools to unscrew pieces. We even used it as an adult chair the other day for a haircut.

The clear, removable tray makes it very easy to clean, and the chair is very sturdy and comfortable. When the tray is removed, the baby can be moved close to the table and enjoy a meal with the rest of the family. Overall, this chair seems superior to more expensive wooden chairs I have seen, because of the tray component. The only issue I have encountered so far is that the seat is rather wide; too wide for many babies younger than 8-10 months.",

We were using an Ikea chair for a while (first timers), but it took up a lot of space, the bucket seat was big enough our kiddo would try and get out, there was no foot rest and we couldn't pull her right up to the table like we wanted. So we did some research between this and the tripp trapp and we are so happy we want with the Abiee. Super easy to assemble, pretty and we quickly moved from using a tray to pulling her right to the table. She is way more comfortable on the pads (because who wants to clean fabric?) and seems to love her \"big girl\" chair. Would highly recommend!!",

      "text": "I love how sturdy, adjustable, and sleek this high chair is. But after just a few weeks of use by my two year old, the cushions are stained despite us wiping them clean after every use. I feel disappointed that we spent so much on this chair for it to be stained so quickly. It is easy to clean each part overall but I can\u2019t rate it any higher because of the stained cushions. I can\u2019t imagine ow bad it will look six months from now or after it\u2019s been used by a second child (I bought it as an investment planning to use it for all of our children).",

I did a bit of research online for high chairs. It was important that I find one that was somewhat compact and this definitely meets that criteria. It's very well made and was quick to assemble. It includes an adjustable footrest, which is not only beneficial for stability but also promotes a healthy sitting posture for your baby. In fact this entire can be adjusted to meet the needs of the toddler/child for years. The chair is super easy to clean and very very cute!! I'm 100% satisfied with our purchase.",

The wooden tray with plastic over top means that baby can happily play on the wooden part once done eating so daddy :) or mommy can get those dishes and the plastic tray clean and ready for next time before baby starts to fuss.

Originally we were frustrated bc shipping took a week longer than projected (amazon shipped, not Abiie) and when we received the chair, two of the bolts necessary to assemble the chair weren't included. We reached out to customer service and received the bolts within a week. A frustrating start, but our little one is happy sitting in the chair, and it truly is SO easy to clean the entire thing. No hidden nooks and crannies for crumbs to hide! That said, it has gotten a bit wobbly after a couple months of use, so we will likely have to tighten bolts from time to time.",

Only one negative - takes 2 hands to open the tray because you need to push buttons on each side. Not ideal if you are holding a baby while trying to open this. That said.. I love it, and would still buy again. Also the bar under to hang bibs is kinda cool too.",

Removing the tray is not hard at all and can be even down with one hand. It\u2019s also lightweight and does not take up much space. My boyfriend assembled the chair and he said it was time consuming but not hard to do. Overall we\u2019ve been using it for almost 3 months and we love it.",

My 8 month old has much better posture eating in this chair which is important when learning to eat his solids. Still love the footprint and how it fits with our home's style. Still finding it super easy to clean and the first chair we bought has held up so well-- It looks just as good as the brand new one.",

It fits better at our table - the legs don't stick out as far, and yet it still feels quite sturdy. It's easier, by far, to clean. It looks so much better - much less clunky. And, most importantly, our baby sits more comfortably in it and is therefore eating much more confidently! She loves mealtimes now when before they were becoming a chore for all of us. Highly recommend this high chair!",

Relatively easy to clean although adjustment crevices create bit of a chore to clean, but no more of a hassle than the Svan. Where we think this chair excels is in adjustment, the Svan would require tools and significant time to adjust to growing children. Where as the Abiie can be quickly adjusted. Very handy when switching between users, which we have daily.",
