Our friend owns an outside bar and suggested these. We hang these from the posts of our pergola, slanted down toward our patio furniture. The airflow is powerful and they hold up under rain & strong wind. They provide enough breeze that we can actually have parties outside! (as long as we stay on the patio) And if one stops working (which has happened once in 2 years), they are relatively cheap enough to replace--unlike the expensive wet-rated fans",

You can adjust the fan to blow up or down, and when I put it down, or even straight a head it just moves to the up position. All in all, I might be returning this fan. If I can't place it the way I like it, then it's just a waste of money.",

Probably not something for the bedroom, too noisy. If you want to move a lot of air in a large area this is the fan for you.",

I would have expected a lot more than 2 years of light use out of this fan. I have USA made Patton fans from the 90's that are still going but unfortunately this Chinese made item isn't up to the task. I have tried to lubricate the motor bearing but unfortunately it hasn't helped. P.S. If you follow this thread, you will see that Patton have agreed to send me a replacement fan. i am very pleased with their customer service and have given them 5 stars for looking after me.",
