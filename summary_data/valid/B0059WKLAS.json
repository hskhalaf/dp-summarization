I did not have to buy any additional fittings and everything lined up! I spent more time researching old and new plumbing and shopping for a faucet that suited my needs and one I could afford. It arrived in 2 days, the faucet was packed in a cloth bag inside the box, in perfect condition.. It is lovely, the hand held showerhead puts out a nice firm spray. I do wish it had a bracket to mount the shower on the. wall..",

It was installed on a tub we hardly use (maybe 10 to 15 times since installed at the very most). The threads for the handle have complete disintegrated, which caused water to spray every where. It is beautiful especially for the price, however, poor quality",
