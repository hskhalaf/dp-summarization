It has soft rubber treads on the steps--probably more intended for climbing with shoes, but not uncomfortable in bare feet. The ladder is sturdy and the steps are a reasonable distance apart. The legs have rubber caps to keep from marring the floor and hooks at the top to hang onto the bed frame (or where ever you choose to hand it). Serves its purpose. I'm happy with the purchase.",
