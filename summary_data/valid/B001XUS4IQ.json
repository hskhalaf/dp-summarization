Not only does it provide you and your spouse a wonderful kick start to your day but to all your friends as well. Only those slackers forgot coffee cups, coffee, sugar, and cream so they have to use yours and share cups. Or they have to improvise with solo cups but the coffee is blistering hot and almost melts the cups so they have to drink it really fast just to hold the cup. So it all so provides entertainment while sipping your brew. My husband recommends using Baileys Irish Cream while using this.",

We put it over an open fire and it worked great and cleaned up well once we got home and cleaned it up with a Brillo pad. I would highly recommend using percolator filters and a coarser grind if you want to keep grinds out of your morning cup of joe. Bottom line, was 100% glad we bought this and brought it with us.",
