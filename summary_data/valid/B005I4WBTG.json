With all of the hype about this brand I expected really GREAT QUALITY hand lotion but there are actually lotions that you can buy in the grocery store which exceed this company\u2019s hand lotion. I bought two, making an assumption about the quality and now regret it . Amazon used to sell another lavender hand lotion by another reputable company (which has been around for much longer) and L\u2019Occitane does not even compare to the quality of the aforementioned company\u2019s lotion Let\u2019s see if this gets posted",

      "text": "I really enjoy this hand cream. I keep it on my bedside table b/c I find the lavender scent relaxing as I'm falling asleep. The lavender L'Occitane is not as thick & creamy as the original hand cream though. It's much lighter and thinner. The scent is very strong & distinct though. I recommend it, but if you're looking for the dense cream in the original or don't like a strong scent I'm not sure you'll be as happy with this one.",
