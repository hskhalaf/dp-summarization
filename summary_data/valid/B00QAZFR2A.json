Parking monitoring will not work unless unit is permanently attached to ignition power - parking will not work off cameral internal battery. Had unit professionally mounted to avoid dangling wires on 2015 vehicle which cost almost as much as the unit itself. However it does look nice and integrated with rest of windshield electronics. Had to use a tiny drop of adhesive to secure rotation of bracket so unit would not move when handled. Tightening screw adjustment will not totally prevent rotation.",
