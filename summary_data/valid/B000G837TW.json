It has gotten a little more noisy over time but overall much quieter than our previous, lower end InSinkErator. Performs well with bulkier vegetable peels. The rubber gasket where the water runs in from the sink is sealed a bit too well, this is likely by design to help reduce the noise. The only issue is that larger peels and pieces of food can build up at the gasket if they don't go through and you end up using a utensil or fingers to nudge the food threw the rubber gasket.
