The camera with the flash is a nice touch. Google also installed a couple of my contacts from my old phone. I did have to add several manually. Overall, for the money this is a excellent phone.",

And it will take 5-7 business days to get me a new one----I asked for one to be expedited but apparently they are \"not allowed to do that\"---frustrated with tracfone and it's customer service!",
