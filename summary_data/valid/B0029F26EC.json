They are breathable, collapsible but not floppy ( unless washed) and reasonably priced. The only complaint I have is that washing changes the hat. Machine washing cold/gentle still will shrink the hat, even hand washing makes the color migrate and removes the starch or sizing that is keeping the hat stiff so that the shape gets floppy and a breeze will blow the brim down in your face. rather than wash I just buy a new one every few months . a small negative though I really like these hats.",

If I could afford it, I would buy more in other colors! This hat is super comfortable, adjusts easily, stays on (even on windy days) and is very attractive (think Audrey Hepburn)! I love that you can put the brim up or down depending on how much coverage you want. It's also shaped in such a way that it never blocks or impedes your view. Which means I can wear it and take pictures! Strong material, great colors, genius design!",

The brim, to the edge, is 4 1/2 inches - 3 1/2 if you turn up the edge. But, because it is angled downward it gives you much more sun protection that if it projected straight out. So, yes, go for it !!!",

Inside, around crown band is a cord that you can adjust, making the crown snugger or lose. Good option if you wear your long hair up or down. I've worn this hat on a windy day. I tightened the cord and the hat stayed put through all the gusts. The brim is moldable, giving you different looks. I love all the color options and I plan on getting another one or two, so my whole wardrobe will have a complimenting hat!",

And, like the Scala, the crown is incredibly wrinkled - especially the \"band\" that goes around the crown, even more so - and no matter what I do I can't get the wrinkles out. The bank actually seems like is almost like \"folded\" - and pressed together - which makes it not stand up as nicely as it should",

It is packable and washable but DON'T dry it! It will shrink. It loses a bit of sizing when washed but I use them for gardening because of good coverage and not washing is not at option after a day in the garden.

In a tropical climate you will get hat head, and your head will sweat. But the hat is attractive and you can re-style your hair.",

Initially when I tried it on, it was floating on my hair and not secure on my head. Once I got my hair volume down and pulled it back, it fit without any need for tightening the inner strings. However, I wouldn't dare wear this on a windy day. But it is an awesome sunhat if you need sun protection like I do.",
