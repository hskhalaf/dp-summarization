If you haven't done this before, it is so good and you get the fresh taste of homegrown corn all year long! Check out Freezing Fresh Corn on the Internet for instructions. It's super easy and I highly recommend using the method described to make it creamy by scraping the cob. You get every last bit of corn and it makes it super sweet!",
