Purchasers gave nothing but excellent reviews on this shoe\u2019s overall performance, comfort, and fit. Its stylish fa\u00e7ade makes it, even more, a fitting pair to buy. Creative elements are seen through its KPU grid detailing and distinctive TPU tubes along the midsole - factors that buyers deem desirable as they are also functional. Overall, this is another highly recommended sneaker from the Danish shoe brand.",

The beetroot colour is more raspberry. The top is a sort of fabric and doesn't press down on my poor hammer toes. And they make me taller - what more could I want.",
