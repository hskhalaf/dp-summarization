My mother who is a Dental Hygenist picked it out for me so I can use while I wait to get my professional one made. I only gave it 4 stars because the directions on how to mold it to your teeth were NOT correct and didn\u2019t work. You actually have to boil it IN the water for a short amount of time, rather than set it in hot water. Trust me on this one.",

The molding process was simple and quick, I did have to trim a little of the rear portion of the Guard with scissors, but I've been sleeping with it for a couple months, and it seems to work fine. No weird taste, snaps in place and stays there, I've never choked on it, and it comes with a nice little storage case.",

I found the hard plastic portion too thick to be comfortable, but that may just be my preference...who knows.",
