The pole comes in 4 pieces which screw into each other and into the base unit. They tend to unscrew as you move the unit around in the spa. You also have to hold onto the hose as it tends to twist the base off the bottom. If it was weighted it might stay on the bottom better. With all that said, it did clean most of the sand off the bottom that had been tracked into the spa.",

Depending how dirty the pool is how many buckets you have to take out of the pool. 20 buckets is a minimal. If you don't do this the pool could overflow. Another flaw is the handle is too light and skinny. For a small or petite person the pressure of the water and the heavy of the hose makes it hard for them to control. I think using the adapter and buying a regular pool pole will work better. But it sucks the dirt up really well.",
