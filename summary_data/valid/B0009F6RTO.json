Can these be genuine UGG slippers after all? To pay over $100 for this level of disappointment. Wow...",

I actually returned the black specifically for that reason and am reordering the chestnut color now. I typically wear size 9.5-10 in footwear and I find the size 10 are a little big but I like the extra room in my slippers. I am an UGG slipper wearer for life lol.

I mean, it's not a deal breaker, however, I do feel given the price, a little more effort and material could have been given to create at least a detectable spongy cushion effect. Other than that, at least until the inside wool laps together, it fits quite nicely and is comfy. The grip on the bottom rather than your typical smooth (with small bumps) surface is appreciated.",

      "text": "Definitely not the older Ugg quality. I've only had these for two months and the fur is such poor quality it's already worn thin and the lining exposed on the inside of the heel. I can even feel the hard rubber sole. Im only 140lbs and wear them a couple hours a day at most. Even the soles are wearing down. The pictures compare the fur from original Uggs I've had for 30 years to these new ones and it's so obvious the quality is not there anymore, they used to be so thick and plush. They also run very large i had to return my normal size 8 for a 7 and they're still large.",

The sole is not as rigid as in the old pair but it is much thinner. And the fluffy part is not nearly as warm - I think it is a synthetic material now. I will never buy another Ugg product since I was cheated and deceived.",
