      "title": "Worst laptop ever",
      "text": "This laptop is the worst laptop I have ever bought, the mouse pad is so sensitive that many things get pressed while trying to use it, and sometimes things happen without even pressing them. Also the laptop crashes on it's own after startup on many occasions ever since it was bought, the laptop freezes and square pixels just appear everywhere. It is not reliable to use with sensitive work due to the fact it crashes all the time. I can't use it with my car and diagnostics software in case I mess up the vehicles ECU whilst connected to the laptop and it crashes. In total it was a complete waste of money and a very nasty laptop",

I use it for work, mainly running office, project, visio etc. I would say that I am not really taxing it. I travel a lot, so I am carrying it around and it has stood the test of time in this respect. Storage is great. Speed is still good. Cannot really say anything bad about it other than the mouse pad (for me) is slightly out of place, too close to the left. So you tend to touch it too much when typing which sends your text off in another place.",

Cheap keyboard, USB connections were unreliable, and the hard drive went POP !!! one day. I thought I would give the Lenovo a chance, I wish I hadn't. Get a Toshiba, they are inexpensive and reliable. Pay a bit more for a Sony Vaio and be happy. Or just go for it and get a mac. Never again, you have been warned.",

The lap top does not come with any office programmes so you have to buy these separately and the same with security software so you need to pay all of this on top of the lap top cost.",

Turns out to be a great system and fortunately I could still run it in Windows 7 mode. The only niggle is that the battery charge level has been erratic showing \"plugged in, not charging\" and over two weeks reducing down to 95% and then overnight going up to 100%; but I'll live with that for now.",

I've upgraded the drivers to no avail. The keyboard is horrible - touchtyping is impossible, and layout is different to two other Lenovos which both have great keyboards, The keyboard was mentioned as a highlight by another reviewer, so very disappointed with it. When I hit the space bar, it registers about half the time. I'm about to replace Windows 8 which may help with the touchpad issue.",
