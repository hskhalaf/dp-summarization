No more having my modem/router being hacked and hijacked because it's so riddled with vulnerabilities. Now I have a really good, dedicated modem with the power to do the job it was meant to do!

Smooth sailing ever since, so far with my 200/20 service! Easy setup, and it's nice to have a push-button power switch in the back of the device like my modem has in case I ever need to reboot it.",
