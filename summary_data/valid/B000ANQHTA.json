The real kicker is that the amazon box is in absolutely perfect condition, so they packed it knowingly damaged and sent it out anyways.",

Well, I listened enough to: 1) thoroughly read the instructions (on the off chance the other negative reviewers hadn't) and 2) try it out on a scrap piece of oak with a freud roundover bit before trying it on a real project. Conclusion: this router will NOT hold its depth setting; it started slipping to a deeper setting as I began to slowly and carefully start down the piece of oak. This is a real surprise; I have the larger Bosch 1617 and it has been a great tool...no issues whatsoever with it. Stay away from the Colt.",

      "text": "I'm thinking that variable speed is not really needed in this tool so you can save yourself a couple of bucks and just get the fixed speed model. Making fine adjustments to the cutter height is difficult. You have to anticipate how much that adjustment is going to shift as a result of locking down the clamping lever. It even mentions this several times in the manual. The fine-adjustment knurled thumb-wheel is difficult to operate and gets very tight and sticky. In a tool like this, rock-solid height adjustment is pretty dang critical. The sketchiness of the height adjustment is why I down-graded this review.",

If it has a weak point, it is in the accuracy of the depth adjustment, but you can easily compensate for this by using a measured wood scrap to reset the depth as needed between blade change outs.

I broke it the first day I was using it when I got in a hurry messing around with a piece of wood. Was just practicing some free hand grooves on a piece of pine and the bit got in a small bind. Collet busted and I just thought it was my lack of skill. After researching it a bit, I discovered this is a common flaw and replacements are sold in 2 packs. So, go ahead an order the Colt. Nice product, but order a package of back up collets to have on hand!",

This router is easily maneuvered one-handed, and the variable speed allows me to slow down the rpm to make it a much quieter tool. The single-wrench and shaft-locking button makes it easier to change bits, and is a wonderful improvement over two-wrench collets. The included edge guide is very crude, but work well enough when needed.",

The router would still be useful for laminate trimming and small edge moulding, but precision rabbetts and dadoes will require checking the perpendicular alignment after each height adjustment. I'm a little disappointed, but will be keeping it anyway.",

It has sufficient power and speed for all applications which I would expect to be using it for. I only gave it 4 stars because with a router this new and for this amount of money, it should have built in LEDs to illuminate your work. It does not resulting in a degree of difficulty in tracking exactly where the router bit actually is.",

Knowing that Bosch has a good name for tools and after reading some reviews, I purchased this item on Amazon. The price was over $30.00 cheaper than Home Depot or Lowe's. I have used this item three times and am very satisfied. Being a once in a while wood worker, this tool will be more than satisfactory for my use.",

    "description": "Style:1.0 HP Variable Speed RouterThe Bosch PR20EVS Colt electronic variable Speed palm router combines power, precision and versatility in a small sized tool. It has a 1.0 horsepower, 5.6 amp motor that spins at a variable Speed of 16,000 to 35,000 rpm. The variable Speed dial is conveniently mounted on top of the tool body. The router features constant response circuitry, which maintains a consistent Speed by detecting heavy loads and increasing power to maintain the selected rpm. It features soft start circuitry, which reduces startup torque. Additionally, the depth can be adjusted by simply aligning and lowering the motor and then locking the router in position with the clamping level. Micro fine adjustments are equally effortless, thanks to the wheel on the back of the router's base. It accepts standard 1/4 Inch bits for flexibility, with an impressive max cutter diameter of 1 5/16 Inch. The motor housing has a palm shaped, rubber over molded grip that allows for comfortable operation. The included rugged aluminum fixed base is durable, solid and precise. Includes: (1) PR20EVS Palm Router, (1) PR001 Fixed Base, (1) 1/4 Inch Self Releasing Collet Chuck, (1) Shaft Wrench, (1) Collet Wrench.",
