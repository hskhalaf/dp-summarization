It never dawned on me until recently, that I should actually buy some Kirby merchandise- and I settled on this little dude. Wonderful quality and craftsmanship- he is very soft yet study enough to not look semi-deformed and deflated. I honestly want to go and buy 10 of them, only to place them randomly around the house. Absolutely adorable!!!",
