We noticed a difference within days of starting to use it vs just regular LED lights. The only issue we have is that the light is so bright or on a wavelength that hurts human eyes, but our plants seem to love it. It's for them and not us. I'd recommend putting it where you don't have to look at it much or often. And just turn it off when you want to inspect and admire your flowers. We are using it in an inexpensive aluminum clip on lamp housing and it's working great.",

Once inside, the tree looses 95% of its leaves by December despite watering, feeding and a sunny room. After putting it outside in late spring it eventually rejuvenates to its vibrant, green self and begins flowering by the following September. This year I ordered the grow lights. We lugged our 30-year old baby into the house well before the first frost, set up the pair of lights, and four weeks into its new home it still has its full complement of leaves and is flowering beautifully.
