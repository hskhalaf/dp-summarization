      "text": "So unhappy with this knife for many reasons. First of all, a Henckels knife made in Taiwan? That by itself was a major disappointment. Next, the knife appeared to have been used, or at least a damaged product as the handle was scratched quite a bit. Although that would not take away from performance, I certainly don't want to spend money on an item with damage. Lastly, it does not cut the way expected, and certainly not the quality of a Henckels knife. Although the price was reasonable, it sure makes me realize the old adage, \"You Get What You Pay For\" is definitely true!",

This knife has no sharpness whatsoever. My other bread knife was only twenty bucks, should have just gotten a second one of those, it has absolutely no challenge cutting. We're talking fresh bread, not stale, and this knife just fails to get a grip, forcing you to smash the bread. I do not understand how this has 4.5 stars. Very disappointed.",

    "title": "HENCKELS Fine Edge Pro Bread Knife, 8-inch, Black/Stainless Steel",
    "description": "J.A. Henckels International Paring Knives are perfectly designed for smaller kitchen tasks such as peeling or coring vegetables and fruits. 3-pc set includes: 3.5-inch paring knife, 3-inch vegetable knife and a 2-inch peeling knife. Lifetime limited manufacturer warranty. Dishwasher safe.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nA crusty loaf yields easily to this knife, whose serrations are big enough to rate--in knife-speak--as \"scallops.\" Henckels' International Fine Edge is an inexpensive cutlery line made in countries other than the company's home of Germany. These knives don't have bolsters and their blades are thinner and less strong. Handles are narrower and shallower than those of the company's premier lines--a feature those with small hands might appreciate. --Fred Brack",
