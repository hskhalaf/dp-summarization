It makes a HUGE, BRIGHT display on the painted wall, and the adjustments for throwing it up high (keystone) are right on the remote making it easy if you move it around, and it retains the keystone setting even though we kick off the power to it every week. It runs quiet enough, with no cycle up/down distractions. I'm using this with a 100' HDMI cable with no problems.",

    "title": "BenQ MX662 3500 Lumen XGA SmartEco 3D DLP Projector",
    "description": "The BenQ MX662 is just the projector you need in any setting. Featuring XGA resolution, 3500 ANSI lumens, and 13000:1 contrast ratio, the MX662 also offers multi display support for ultra-smooth connection. The MX662 also supports PC-less presentation and 3D! As the first DLP brand to incorporate Philips' ImageCare technology into its projector lamp system, BenQ has taken the next step in developing its own SmartEco Technology. The MX662 brings together uncompromised brightness, exquisite picture quality, and optimized lamp life through Smarteco features. Eco Blank mode allows presenters to blank the projection screen whenever they need to direct the audience's focus back on them - or simply when the projector is not in use. The SmartEco Mode cleverly adjusts the lamp power to maximize power savings by delivering the best contrast and brightness performance using only as much light as needed for the image/video being presented. No source detected mode switches the MX662 to Eco Blank Mode if the projector is left on for over three minutes without a display source. When inactive, the MX662 keeps power consumption to a minimum with 0.5W standby power. Insert a Wi-Fi dongle (sold separately) into the USB flash drive slot to display contents from your PC, MAC, iPhone and iPad to MX662 through the Wireless Display feature. USB Drive Display allows projection from a USB flash drive. Save the files you need onto a USB flash drive and insert it into the MX662 to start sharing. File types supported are JPEG, JPG, BMP, PNG, GIF and TIFF. Ecofacts: Arsenic-free optical glass, BFR/PVC-free casing plastics, PVC-free plastic packaging.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe MX662 is just the projector you need to perfect your presentation in all settings.\nView larger Featuring multiple input options to fit every need.

Featuring XGA resolution with 3500 ANSI lumens and 13000:1 high contrast ratio, the MX662 also offers multi-display for ultra-smooth connection, PC-less presentation and 3D-ready projection to keep your presentation looking great.\n\nPOWER SAVING, ECO FRIENDLY\nWORLD-LEADING SMARTECO TECHNOLOGY FOR A GREENER ENVIRONMENT\nAs the first DLP brand to incorporate Philips' ImageCare technology into its projector lamp system, BenQ has taken a further leap, developing its own SmartEco Technology to perfect what DLP can do for energy saving in the 21st Century classroom. Built with this brand-new invention, the MX662 brings together uncompromised brightness, exquisite picture quality and optimized lamp life through innovative features.\n\nBlank the projection screen whenever you need \nto redirect the students' focus.

This saves you the trouble, as well as the extra budget, of getting a separate audio system.\n\n0.5W IN STANDBY MODE\nWhen inactive, the MX662 keeps power consumption to a minimum with 0.5W standby power, achieving what was once a challenge for earlier projector models. This technological advancement in energy saving helps extend the projector lamp life and lower energy costs.\n\nHASSLE-FREE PROJECTOR MAINTENANCE\nFeaturing an easy-to-access upper lamp door UPPER LAMP DOOR FOR EASY LAMP ACCESS\nKensington lock helps protect your projector The upper lamp door is designed for the managers to replace the projector lamp safely and quickly.
