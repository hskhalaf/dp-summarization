Had to stop for frequent cleanouts. Had some little success with grinding through large plate first, then through the medium plate (the size we wanted). This was chicken, without the bones. I\u2019d hate to think what it would have done with beef or venison. Will never buy another from this manufacturer. My old grinder, from Northern Industrial, lasted for 8 years. This didn\u2019t work well even a single use. Now we get the hassle of cleaning it up, repacking and returning it.",

We froze the meat (took the meat out about 30 minutes before using it) and cut it in strips. Process was a breeze, along with clean-up. The unit is not very loud. The price is good for what we wanted.",

You can't do better than this without paying a big amount for a commercial grinder.",

It handles the bones without a problem - having them cold or semi-frozen works best. I grind my own hamburger from huge pieces of chuck. No pink slime. I rarely have to push meat into the hopper as the machine seems to inhale it on its own. I also like the two speed feature and the auto circuit breaker, though it has yet to overheat or jam up. I've already recommended it to friends.",
