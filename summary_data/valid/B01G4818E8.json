The top is a bit trickier, the top folds over only one direction for the clip to slide on but once you have that figured out it works like a charm.",

The piece stops leaking when you shut the valve each time. Although this is a hassle, it did correct the problem. I\u2019m hoping that it will eventually self seal. I tried replacing the valve mouth piece with my old one but I cannot remove it as it\u2019s screwed tightly into the tube. This also makes cleaning this part impossible.",

      "text": "Did the job, just as described. My daughter came back from camp where she had been using her Osprey backpack with a Hydrapak reservoir, which unfortunately she'd left unused (but still wet) for a few days. It had a deep yellow (mold?) stain in part of the tubing. We were able to use this kit to clean not only the tube, but all the other parts of the reservoir and tubing system quite easily. A few days after receiving the kit I got an email from founder of the company with simple usage instructions; more than you'd expect for a relatively inexpensive item. Just one more thing to like about this. I highly recommend.",

The product is solid and better than you'd expect for the price. First time out I fell while running and landed on the pack holding the bladder. Not one bit of damage. Not one drop of water leaked. All in all I was extremely impressed with the product and the company. I'd buy from this owner again in a heartbeat.",
