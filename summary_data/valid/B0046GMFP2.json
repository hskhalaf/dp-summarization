She and her friend slid all morning on this and her sled was faster than her friend's sled, so I would say that it works just fine. The price can't be beat; it's even cheaper today than when I bought it. I still think mine was a good price (less than $8). One person per sled, unless you have two tiny kids, then one each can sit on the front and back indentations. Otherwise, the big indentation is for the rear end; the small one is for the feet.",
