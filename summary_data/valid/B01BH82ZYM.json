      "text": "When I read a review (5 star ???) on here that stated it tasted better than wheat pasta...I should have known. Wheat pasta tastes like cardboard and this tastes like a mushy wet paper towel. I followed directions to a T and failure of epic proportions! Broke into pieces....cooked it again, but shorter time, tastes horrible and turned to mush in my mouth. Sadly had to purchase 5 pounds so I am going to be tossing the rest. There is better gluten free pasta out there for sure. Don't waste your money on this garbage! Also package came opened with loose pasta in bottom of box, customer service NEVER even responded to me complaint",

I find the black bean has a little more flavor than the lentil which requires a bit of salt and/or herbs and sauce or olive oil. Both go well with different sauces and have the heft of old-fashioned pasta, but without the negative side effects some of us experience from wheat. We appreciate Bentilia producing the large 5 and 10 lb bags which are much more economical.",
