      "text": "A great controller with excellent buttons until you discover that the sticks aren't calibrated right. They have dead zones along the edges. As long as you go straight forward, back, left, or right, you'll be fine. What does this mean with games? Well, try to run any direction other than the listed above and your character will agonizingly walk, the game thinking the stick isn't fully tilted, even though it physically is. Disappointing that an otherwise great product would be ruined by such a flaw. If you want to play older games that don't rely on a thumbstick, then this is the controller for you.",

However after a month or so of regular use the right side of the controller stopped working. Took it apart and the ribbon cable is broken. It's just kinda shoved in there and had some hard folds also probably too long. Took it apart and managed to get lights and all the buttons working. But the thumbstick is dead so in the bin it goes. Took apart the wee model to figure out how to put this one back together. That model is better built but this model has l3 + r3 buttons. Your mileage may vary.",

Both controller were new, both didn't work. Leads me to believe there no quality control in the production of these. Just trying to get my money back now.",

Most of the times the controls were partially or completely unresponsive, or pathed incorrectly (i.e you'd turn the joystick right, and the vehicle or player would turn right, then you'd turn it left and it would still turn right) Multiple games, over a dozen tried, not a single one worked correctly. Samsung Galaxy S9, and my own Pixel 4. Embarrassed, disappointed",
