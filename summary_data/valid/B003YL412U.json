But no one has pointed out yet that this printer will drive you crazy with \"Low Ink\" messages starting when a single cartridge is less than about 25% full. I started getting the messages a couple of months ago and it's still printing everything just fine. But it's very annoying because I have to click past the messages and sometimes press the OK button on the printer every time I print. If I were a more cynical person, I might suspect that they set these message threshholds just to encourage people to replace the cartridges before they're anywhere near empty.",

I have used many Canon printers before, but this is the first one that the ink will get depleted even if you have not been using it! The ink as it is, is already expensive enough. I would be okay if I am paying for consumption, but if I am also paying for time and I need to replace it every 3 months without even printing a single piece of photo, the math simply doesn't add up and I may as well print from professional shops. I hope Canon will fix in its next generation of printers.",

When I bought this, I read some of the negative comments regarding short ink life, and I regret not heeding the warnings. I'm not know how the reviews are above 3 stars. Don't buy this printer.",

Yeah, well there's a setting to minimize that, and if you're running this printer in an office with more than 4 or 5 people, get a printer designed for a professional office.

It's all about the ink!!!Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2013Verified Purchase Pros: Great scanner, converts images to jpeg or pdf. The software that comes with it takes getting use to. Wish it was more simpler to use, but some of the functions actually is useful like scanning words to text for you to edit.\n\nCons:\n*Takes about 1-2 minutes to print the first document after it does it's cleaning or whatever checking it's going through.\n*None of the functions will work unless the ink cartridges are in place with ink in it. You can't scan a document, even though you're not printing anything, without the ink cartridges installed. Empty ink cartridges won't help.\n*This machine is seriously an ink gobbler. Hardly printed any colored documents and already the color ink cartridges are low are near empty. Bought a 6 pack of no-frills replacement ink for roughly $10. Barely printed a document and already the light is blinking indicating low ink for the big fat black cartridge. You'd think that would last twice as long as the colored inks especially when you just opened the pack.\n*Seems like when the printer is idled. The area where the printer head is parked (on the right, inside the cover) is a sponge that's suppose to clean the printer head, but I think it's actually causing the inks to leak out.\n\nNotes\n*Copier - haven't tried using it. I was afraid I'd run out of ink.\n*I guess it's Canon's way of making extra money from sales of ink cartridges. Whether it's their ink or a no-frills brand.\n*Yeah, I know the price is really hard to resist, but it's really better off getting a color laser printer or a black and white all-in-one machine. You can get either for under $200 (Brother). The price you're going to spend to replace the ink cartridges will eventually cover a toner cartridge. And if you want to print photos, just do it at a Costco or CVS store instead.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse iMe VINE VOICE 5.0 out of 5 stars Simply AmazingReviewed in the United States on November 19, 2010Verified Purchase Canon has done such an amazing job with this printer, not only performance wise, but also on quality, design and ease of use. I used to own a Canon MP500, but later needed a wireless printer. I was recommended to get an HP because of their good reputation, larger ink cartridges, and lower cost to maintain - which to an extent was true, ink on the HP lasted me about 6-months compered to the MP500's 3-4 months, and the HP ink also cost less. In reality, who cares how much the ink cost, when the HP was the noisiest thing in my office, slower than snail-mail (exaggerating), and it printed the most horrible images and documents. ...or maybe it was just me since I had already experienced what Canon was capable of.\n\nI am really happy I purchased the Canon MG6120. Within the last month, I've purchased a MacBook Air, iMac, Time Capsule and HP Media Server, and all I can say is that I really don't care about those gadgets, I'm simply super excited about my printer purchase - it is by far the best printer I have ever used - it't print quality is on par with the thousand dollar printers my company purchases for media services.\n\nInstallation was a breeze, it's just a matter of unpacking the printer, removing all the wrap on it, aligning the print heads, and using it's cool mini LCD to input my wireless network info. Once that's done, simply insert the driver CD into the computer and follow the on-screen instructions (pretty much just click \"next\" over and over after telling it it's a wireless setup. The only thing that I found a bit annoying was that I had to install using the CD on all 3 of my computers, where on the HP I just had to install one one computer, and after than all the other computers could find it on the network. I might be missing something, so it might be my fault and not Canon's - I'm no network expert. I have been able to get Canon app to work from the iPad; it's only good for pictures though.\n\nThose of you needing high print quality will not be one bit disappointed with this printer. The scanner also works really well, I've already used it to send scans to my computer, and to make photo copies. After creating a photocopy, several people had issues trying to determine which was the original document, which did have an actual pen-written signature.Read more 19 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Amazon Customer1.0 out of 5 stars Canon PIXMA MG6120 Has Not Worked Well for MeReviewed in the United States on February 29, 2012Verified Purchase I purchased this printer on March 2, 2011 based on the wonderful reviews that I've seen everywhere. My printer worked okay until October 2011. The black ink stopped working. After some troubleshooting Cannon sent new ink cartridges. That did not resolve the issue. Then they sent a replacement printer head, but that did not resolve the issue either. In December 2011 Cannon offered me another printer which turned out to be refurbished. I don't know what I'm in for now with this refurbished printer. Well it worked okay in December and January. In mid February 2012 the same problem arose, this time the blue ink was the issue. Cannon has sent a new printer head and I'll have to wait and see how long this one lasts. It has been almost a year and this is (IMO) a lot of issues to have with a printer brand new or refurbished. I print five or six pages a few times a week, so it is not like it gets heavy use. When it works I'm happy. Another thing to note is that the ink is very expensive and does not last long. The mechanism that is supposed to keep the printer head functioning uses up most of the ink. I have done some research via the internet to find a solution to the printer head issue and have found that this is a common issue with this type of printer. It seems that the printer head gets clogged or dries out if you don't use the printer everyday. Cannon support suggested that I leave the printer on at all times so that the printer head will self clean. The research from the forums suggest that I print one color page a week which uses far less ink than using the printer utilities to keep the printer head unclogged.\n\nI have two Dell printers one is 5 years old and one is 8 years old and I've never had any problems with them at all. I needed a wireless printer for my laptop, phone, tablet, etc. My Canon PIXMA MG6120 is just not what I expected.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States \n\n\nWHAT OTHER ITEMS DO CUSTOMERS BUY AFTER VIEWING THIS ITEM?\nPage 1 of 1 Start overPage 1 of 1 This shopping feature will continue to load items when the Enter key is pressed.
