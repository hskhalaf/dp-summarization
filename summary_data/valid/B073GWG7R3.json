My daughter has them in a smaller size, worn them 2.5 years and now starting to split a rear seam at the same time becoming decidedly too small in the toes. I gambled that by going up a size we could get another year or two...but if they made these lavender ones in women's I would have gone for that instead. Honestly, the women's sizes in this style are really boring colors.",
