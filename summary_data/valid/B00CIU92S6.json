My only regret is that I suffered so long with the old juicer. This juicer does everything better and faster. It extracts more juice, is quieter, does everything from pineapple to carrots to kale with ease, is a breeze to cleanup, and doesn't warm the juice.",

I also tried some nut butter, which seemed more of a chore. Tasted nice, but took a while, and the clean up was somewhat messy, so I'm not so sure if I will attempt making my own nut butter from scratch again anytime soon.

Then the extra dryness of the pulp exiting the machine, gives assurance that you're getting great yields. I do find that when juicing cucumbers or apples, you'll need to put a few pieces at a time; then follow with other veggies to push the liquid along.

I was a bit skeptical because I thought it would be a one time thing but since we purchased it we've been making juices every other day, about a gallon in one shot. We use all different types of fruits and vegetables including beets, carrots, kale, spinach, parsley, anything that normally my 14 year old wouldn't eat but he likes the juices. We usually use a pineapple as a base and that juicer works wonders. Very easy to clean and assemble. Worth every penny. Highly recommend it.",

To clean the old one you had to deal with the really sharp cutters that invariably held food particle. This masticating unit disassembles easily and everything washes right up. I was surprised even the screen washes clean easily. My suggestion is to not let it sit without washing because many fruits and vegetables move in for the duration if allowed to dry. My wife and I have fully converted to juice for supper (evening meal) and find we feel much better, sleep better, and are losing weight. I don't see how anyone who does a little research wouldn't convert to juicing.",
