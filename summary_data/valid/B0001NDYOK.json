There is only one screw that you'll need to tighten for installation. The kick stand can also be adjusted to fit on different sizes of bikes. For my girl's 16\" bike, it is on the third last hole, so I think it should definitely work for 12\" and 14\" bikes. Overall, I like this kick stand and it's great that my garage is back to be organized again.",

I think the only issue we have with it, is that it is quite stiff, and doesn't move into, or out of position very easily; she has to hop off of the bike usually to put the stand down. Afaik, there is no way to adjust the stiffness. Other than that, it's a good value for the price.",

I had to take the bottom sleeve off to get it to work on the 14\" bike as it was just a little too long but it works fine. They were a little hard to move to begin with, so I just applied some oil and moved it a few times, and the kids have no problem using these since.",

Even at full length it does not quite extend far enough for an adult size bike, and bends a little as it takes the weight of the bike. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before someone leans on the bike and bends the stand beyond use. I think it would be sufficient for a very small child-size bike which did not require any extension, but this is not for larger or heavier bikes.",
