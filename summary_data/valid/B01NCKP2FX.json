IT FITS PERFECTLY! Also, the orange is VERY bright, which is just what we need to keep the hunters on our mountain from mistaking our dog for something they're allowed to shoot. The velcro makes it easy to dress and undress him, and he seems quite comfortable while wearing the vest. Now I just hope that it lasts longer than the other brands we've tried--so far, so good (after about a week of wearing it daily as he roams the mountainside).",

It provides plenty of coverage, which I like. I will mention it does have a slot for a lead if you dog wears a harness. I am not sure how the fabric will hold up in the brush as it may snag easily.

It would be great if there were an opening for the \"D\" ring on the Harness I have to use because he pulls when we walk. But otherwise, it works great",
