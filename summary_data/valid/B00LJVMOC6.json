After I sent it in it took about a week to get the new one, but so far I love it and I'm glad I didn't just return it. I hope to be able to purchase a second on in the future.",

LED illumination is uniform from edge-to-edge, with no weird edge effects. I particularly appreciate the DC backlight intensity, rather than the high frequency pulse width modulation scheme that's often used, where the pulses are faster than humans can perceive, but it nonetheless produces eye strain. I spend way too much time in front of my PC, and this is a wonderful feature.",

A small rubber foot was used to level it which was much less of a hassle than returning it for another one.",

It also has 2 hdmi ports so you do not need to use a splitter when hooking up a computer or 2nd game system. It has built in speakers which is a plus. They do not have amazing sound but it is nice to have them if you need them. Turning the volume up and down is a little bit of a chore since it is buried in the menu system and not a dedicated rocker. Overall very happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "As some others noted the stand IS very cheap & flimsy which in my case causes the monitor to sag forward. I needed to place a piece of scrap wood under the front of the stand to raise it up around 1\" just to level the screen. Also gave up trying to install drivers from the included cd and checking the Viewsonic website is no help as it doesn't seem to find anything for this model number. The display is fine, it's the stand issue that bothers me the most.",
