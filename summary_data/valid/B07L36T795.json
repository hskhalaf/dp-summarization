A little small for him, at 6\u20192\u201d but workable. Fits me just right at 5\u20197\u201d. As a manual therapist, I recommend reformer Pilates to patients regularly for chronic back issues, and this works great for us. If we were going to classes, we would have spent that much in a month for both of us. It does everything we need.",

I wanted to be able to slide it to other side of room if needed, so I took another reviewer's recommendation to put sliders under the feet. It worked too well and every time my foot hit the rebounder, the reformer slid on the floor so I removed them. I really enjoy this reformer.",
