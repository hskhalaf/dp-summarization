Upon closer inspection, some POS had swiped my stakes, and to give the lowlifes partial credit, used their cheap steel tent stakes to replace mine, which pulled out in the wind. I guess it was better than letting my tent blow away, but not by much. So, take this as a recommendation, these stakes are good enough to steal. Not sure how one would combat that, other than catching them in the act.",

We got caught in a hurricane during beach camping and had to take shelter in a more heavy duty tent, leaving my tent with just a few light bags inside.

The only issue is I wish they sold them in packs of different sizes-- my tent takes 5 stakes so I had to order two sets and now I have extras I don't know what to do with.",

These stakes are expensive too!! They would have been great if they would have been double the length, but they are truly too short for anchoring anything reliably in beach sand. The design is great, but they are simply too short to hold anything in beach sand. Don't spend this kind of money expecting them to work in lose soils or sand.",
