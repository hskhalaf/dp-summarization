Secondly, ALWAYS loosen the cover when done, to relieve internal pressure. This is said to greatly prolong the seal life. I've had mine for about a half year, and it works like new. There is, by the way, a small fine screen filter that should be rinsed on occasion as well. I don't know if I'd leave the pump with any water in it near a window as algae may start to grow, and that's certainly no fault of the manufacturer.",

The stream can go 20 feet--great in a water fight. Con: There is no spray setting on the nozzle. The drip guard gets in the way of adjusting the stream.

Not big droplets that are supposed to be a fine mist, but an ACTUAL fine mist. Is it pretty? No. But it saves me so much time and effort who needs pretty?",

Well-greased for smooth action right out of the box. THE BAD: All of the flexible seals degraded and the sprayer became unusable within a week. Viton, the seal material, is chemically resilient to many solvents. I mistakenly assumed brake cleaner would be fine, but many of the chemicals in the brake cleaner I used - ESPECIALLY acetone and toluene - are not compatible. SUMMARY: Look up the MSDS for whatever you're spraying and Google its chemical compatibility with Viton. RATING: 5/5 product, the seal failure was my own fault, everything else is awesome.",
