Vilain's dynamite clay nailed the texture and it holds up throughout the day. Keeps the hair soft to the touch as well so your girl (and strangers!) will want to run her hands through it. This is my second Vilain product I've purchased and am very happy Water soluble just like everything out there so be aware of the trade-off: Easy to wash out but if you, say, get stuck in the rain for even a split second, the hairdo is gone.",
