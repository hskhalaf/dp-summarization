Also, the created superstar has been a mixed feeling for me. On one hand, it has multiple move-set for your fighter. But I realized they took out the create the finisher. I really hope 2k17 has that.",

Great graphics (with the exception of the unusually large mouths on everyone), best gameplay in years and fantastic roster. I would have liked to see more of the Divas on there but with the community created players and future DLC's, I am sure they will make up for it. The only downside of the game I have is the new Submission system which is frustrating to say the least. I have been playing it non-stop for weeks now and it doesn't let up. Great created character gameplay and replay value is EXTREMELY high.",

I would say I was unimpressed in fact and have grown to say that I am whelmed by the overall game. Sad because 2k games kills when it comes to NBA games.",
