I\u2019m disappointed as i researched for so long and this was what I decided on",

Battery wont charge, but came to us somewhat charged. Appears that vac works but battery and/or charger don't work. I am waiting to get my upgraded battery that I ordered and see what is going on. Kind of feel bad because I ordered upgraded battery for a machine that isn't working.",

Now, though, it clogs with basically every use, regardless of emptying and thorough cleaning. Additionally, much of what we vacuum up falls right back out as soon as it\u2019s turned off. Six months is nowhere near long enough a life for the price.",

      "text": "Really surprised that a brand name like Hoover would allow this poorly designed vac to be sold. The thing works great for about 5 minutes, then because of the poorly designed input to the holding canister clogs with hair or fuzz it becomes useless. The rechargeable battery is really nice, allowing another battery to be charged while using should you buy an extra. I use a thin dowel to constantly clean the clogged area, thankfully I live in a very small home with only a couple carpets. It has trouble with cat litter, and I don't mean a pile of it, I mean the sprinkling that occurs when the cat jumps out of the box.",

It was from pet bedding, so we no longer will be using this vacuum for that. However, it\u2019s absolutely perfect for the rest of the house.",
