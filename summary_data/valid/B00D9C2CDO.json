If u look at most of the pics of the various bags they all appeared stuffed full and easy to install with the attached straps. Mine was about 3/4 full for a trip to dallas. A lot of loose material had to be dealt with. I had used three rachet straps and tied down the attached bag straps and it was a complete hassle. I am glad I didn't spend more than 30.00.",

Plus it has marred the finish on the vehicle's top and the clear coat is damaged beyond simple waxing or buffing to repair the damage to the roof area. The straps became frayed by the wind and were useless after one 800 mile trip both ways. Do not waste your money on this product.",

So, if you're going to use it, I suggest you put items in it that you don't mind being exposed to some moisture, for example, sleeping bags in their own protective bags, sleeping mats (for camping), your tent, etc. Also, make sure the bag is zipped shut and the protective flap covers the zipper. Like securing your saddle before you giddy up, strap this sucker down tight atop your car before you drive off on your next adventure.",

Our suitcases were damp outside but not wet enough to seap through to our clothes. Overall, I am very pleased. Just be aware that in extremely wet situations, there may be some dampness...",

Once it was kind of sprinkling and everything within stayed totally dry. The third trip was nearly full rain and our hard-side luggage which was expanded (the zipper part in the middle which unzips to give you additional space) got wet and some things right by that part got wet. But the bag itself did not have water in it in pools or anything. Glad we bought this--five people and a dog crowd any vehicle on a long trip and this bag definitely get some of the bulk out of the way!",

There is a cover that completely covers the zipper to keep water out. We didn't encounter any rain, but my folks have the same Product (they told me to buy this one), and they've used it through a couple major rainstorms and snowstorms and everything stays dry. You won't be disappointed with this product.",

I went as fast as 90mph and the only downfall is that the straps can bring in water if it rains- but after I tested it I just used ratchet straps and left the original straps out of the car. No water! Can\u2019t believe it held up. I bought a $2 non slip mat that goes under rugs to help it grip more- but ended up forgetting to put it on anyways. Thanks for helping me bring all of my stuff back home from my trip! HOLDS A LOT",

Just be sure that you seal the sides with velcro to cover the zippers, otherwise stuff might get wet. But if you use it as directed, you won't be disappointed. A great investment if you need to save space inside your car. Easy to install, too. High recommend it!",
