      "text": "These are adorable and a great size. As actual bath squirters, they are difficult to fill and only squirt well when quite filled. Holes in mouth point in different directions so not just a point and shoot type of squirter either. My 2 1/2 year old is a huge Care Bears fan so we aren't that disappointed in these. The size is great as they are much larger than the standard figures making them fun for toddlers.",
