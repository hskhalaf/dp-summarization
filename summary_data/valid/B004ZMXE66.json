To wit: a highly specific \"allow\" does not override a broad \"block,\" even though the \"allow\" statement is of higher order. Yes, I'm using the word \"order\" instead of \"higher precedent\" or similar because the set up process offers the user the opportunity to \"reorder\" his rules of allowance and blocking. See picture. I have two of these RV110W routers; each has latest firmware, and each exhibits these design bugs. RV215W seems to be improved, on this point. But it has other problems.

For example, add a VPN user and it changes the router LAN address with a popup saying it is required. Then you get to guess what it changed to so you can reconnect and set it back. The admin interface was glitchy and slow and occasionally did not work at all. Maybe that was due to whatever physical defect was causing the reset.",

The admin UI is intuitive if you've ever dealt with other Cisco products. Think about it, with VLAN, DMZ and a separate SSID you could even build your own honeypot.",
