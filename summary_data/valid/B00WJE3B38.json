I get zero \"bars\" with this 500+ dollar phone at my house while my husband and my mom are able to get 4+ bars on Samsung phones that cost about $120. The phone is defective. I've tried using WiFi connect, but the feature is not available on this phone either. IT'S INCOMPATIBLE WITH T-MOBILE. I'm very disappointed. Don't buy it, but if you do, make sure you return it before 30 days. The worst part is that it forces your phone to have the Muslim holidays on your calendar. You cannot delete them. Don't buy this phone. Just listen to me!!",

Ive also noticed that the phone reboots on itself and crashes ocassionally like Iphones too. Pros: huge difference in the camera, camera features. I upgraded my phone from Iphone 5c into a Note 5 series. No regrets just hope this phone would last a long time like the previous notes my friend have had. I will update if something came up",
