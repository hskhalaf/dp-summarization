Just be sure to wipe them down as they will leave black stains until they've dried out.",

The railings on the rack are too high for the dumbbells so any dumbbell under 30# rests on the handles and will roll in the rack. I did not realize this would be a problem until rack was entirely assembled. Also, the rack sent is made for a more dumbbells than the set purchased so there are excessive spaces on the rack.",

    "description": "The Body-Solid Rubber Hex Dumbbell Set with 3-Tier Horizontal Rack (GDR363-RFWS) includes everything you need to train with free weights in a home or professional gym. This weight stand holds the included set of 5- to 50-pound hex dumbbells (SDRS550), offering a simple storage solution for your free weight collection. The dumbbell stand is made with heavy-gauge steel for use in your commercial or home gym. The tubing is welded on all four sides and the metal is de-burred inside and out for user safety. The sturdy, space-efficient design is safe to be placed against a wall or freestanding in the center of a weight room. Weighing between 5 and 50 pounds, the included set of ten pairs of hex dumbbells features a durable rubber coating that helps prevents damage to floors and equipment, with a beveled steel grip with light knurled finish for a steady hold while you lift. An equipment mat (RF34B) made of durable PVC material is also included to go underneath the weight stand to help protect the floor.
