It works well for that purpose in that it holds 2 quarts of milk, the milk does not burn on the bottom, and there is a small hole in the lid that is perfect for inserting a thermometer. There is one thing that puzzles me, though. The bottom pan, where water goes, is nonstick. The top part, where food goes, is not nonstick. This seems backwards to me. But the double boiler functions and cleans up well, so I can't really complain. :)",

I bought this particular one because all my mom needs is a simple, inexpensive pot. I was impressed with how sturdy and solid the pots feel. The melting pot sits snugly and securely onto the bottom pot due to a flange (ring) around the bottom of it. The bottom pot is non stick and can be used as a regular pot complete with glass lid. The handles are comfortable and feel sturdy in the hand. Overall I think I got a pretty good value with this and my mom is happy as well :)",

      "text": "This is a very nice sized double boiler (3qt). I am buying 4 more for my daughters for mother's day. It is perfect for white sauce and heats up really quickly and evenly. The top pan is very thin on the bottom and conducts the heat well. It melts butter and thickens white sauce very quickly. I am really enjoying it.",
