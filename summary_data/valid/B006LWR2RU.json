I purchased two of these countertop composters, one for home and one for work, so that I don't have to continually go out to my garage to the large compost pail. These are unobtrusive (actually kind of cute) and there is NO smell. I also purchased compostable bags so I don't have to clean these out. A couple of times a week, I simply remove the bags and place them in my large composter. They have a small footprint, but hold a lot. GREAT purchase!",

I fill it nearly every day and did find the filters to be a hassle, always slipping out, but odor is not an issue for me, so I tossed them. Still a five star product in my opinion. The lid fits fine and is so cute! Love the little sprout. I forget to put it under the sink and it looks fine next to the coffee. I considered a few cheaper versions but glad I spent a few extra dollars for this one.",

It's a tad small for a family of five, especially if we've had water melon or corn, but most days its perfect. SO much better than the stinky, plastic one we had under the sink for years.

My only complaint is that sometimes the bag will tear on removal on the side hinges it has. But that can be avoided by not overloading the bin and removing slowly.",
