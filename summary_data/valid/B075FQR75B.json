The one on the right is the real deal, the one on the left is this savage broadhead. overall it's actually slightly larger than the real deal, by almost an 1/8\" overall. it is not AS sharp but plenty sharp enough and easily sharpened if you feel the need to. i cannot attest as to the durability but I suspect it will be up to par. weight was good at an average of +-2 grains of 100 (they all were within 98-102 grains), they seemed to shoot well and group fine, for the money, you cant beat them!",

I may actually use these for mule deer and the magnus for elk. They are a great inexpensive option. I have only shot out to 50 yards with these, so take that for what it's worth.",
