Unfortunately, I usually have to buy men's shoes because they don't carry my size (12.5 -13) in ladies which means my shoes are never cute or pretty. BUT, when I came across these retro ones I was thrilled and bought them immediately! Finally some fun, colorful shoes!!! These do run small though, so I'd recommend buying 1/2 to 1 full size larger than your normal size.",

However, the colors are random chance. I liked the colors on my first pair better, with more reds and blues and less yellow. They are still beautiful though. Love them!",

They still aren't too tight, but what a surprise in the reality of the two. I'm sure the webbing or the sole didn't stretch so you'll have to take some change in stride.",
