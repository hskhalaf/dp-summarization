I am only 4'11\" and it is hard to find an adult bike to fit me. This is one of the few petite women's bikes that I could find. I love to ride and am training for a long distance ride. I can't imagine finding a better option!!",

      "text": "I received the bicycle September 22,2017 and put the bicycle together September 23,2017 for my daughter. Putting the bicycle together was fairly simple. I didn't even read the instructions. I fallowd the picture diagrams. After putting the bicycle together, I inspected the bicycle and realized the bicycle is well made for the price. I'm 6'3\" and weight 210 and I test ride the bicycle and it handled very well. The paint work is impressive. The gears changed smoothly and it handled my weight very well. If you are looking for a quality bicycle for yourself or family member, even as a gift, I recommend this bicycle.",

The only flaw I could comment on is that the rear derailleur hanger came bent out of the box, making tuning a challenge. After carefully bending it back (with breath held expecting a break), the rear derailleur tuned just fine. Great bike for the price.",
