It only works if location services are turned to always, even thought when traveling out of wifi range, this puts a huge load on the phone battery (you use a mobile app to find out where your keys are). Since adding this app, and activating my tile, my battery life has shot down. If I change location services to \"when using the app\" it tells me that my tile has been disabled. This needs to be fixed--much of the time we don't need our locations tracked since the tile is immobile, or we know exactly where the object is.",

Even when I am within 5 feet of the keys, the app will only allow me to find them about 1 in 5 times. The other 4 it says it's out of range. This applies to all 4 of my tiles. The only thing that I do like about the app is that it has always been able to locate my phone no matter what which is a nice convenience. Honestly I am probably going to take the tiles back off my keys as it is not worth having.",

Customer service is nonexistant. No phone # and no email to contact them. Very disappointed.",

The vendor's info is incorrect and they should send me or anyone with this problem, a battery or new tile, and stand behind their claims. Plus it's very difficult, actually impossible right now with the pandemic, to go out and find this battery size.",

This one doesn\u2019t do that and you have a warranty for a limited time which i think it\u2019s pretty good.
