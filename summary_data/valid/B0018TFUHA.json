We received the package and opened it immediately. It looks awesome on our 4Runner. Our two bikes fit perfectly and they are very secure. There is a lock the attached the rack to your hitch and a lock to attach your bikes to the rack. We feel safe leaving our bikes if we need to run in the store or something. I would definitely recommend this bike rack. Great purchase!",

If you tighten the hardware on the rack it doesn't fold down as easy but helps with making the rack tighter.

And I feel extra secure, since there is a hitch lock and a lock for each bike.",

Sturdy- this thing will last 6. Bikes rode for 2000 miles without moving. I never had to worry about my bike falling off like many other bike racks.

No warranty is given for defects caused by normal wear and tear, cosmetic rust, scratches, accidents, unlawful vehicle operation, or modification of, or any types of repair of a load carrier system other than those authorized by Thule. \n\nABOUT THULE\n Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.",
