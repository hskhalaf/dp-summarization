Well the cord is not long enough to make that happen with a truck. So my sending unit is under the bed of the truck. It causes a little disruption with the receiver. It would have been nice if the advertising made this situation clear or that the cord from the camera lens to the sending unit was at least twice as long",

The camera is now fully installed and works great, I\u2019m able to clearly see if there is anything behind me as well as knowing where to stop when backing which was my initial desire anyway. Installation was a breeze, the product was professionally packaged, and I am very happy with the end result. I will buy from Auto-vox again.",
