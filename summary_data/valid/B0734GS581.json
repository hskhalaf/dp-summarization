Shots have stabilized the wet, but the dry and damage macular has left her with bad vision. To our disappointment she tried the magnifier, but it is not strong enough for her to see. So am returning it. If you have one that is much stronger with the LED lights, please let me know. She uses the computer magnifier set at 300, but she needs something for other task such as reading print and etc.. There is nothing wrong with the fine LED magnifier, it just doesn't fit her needs. thanks",
