There are hundreds of very negative reviews of the app- the average is just over 1 of 5 stars. I had the same problem many of the other users had- it wouldn't sync with Bluetooth. That's the second step, after turning it on. Spent 2 hours with customer service with both Amazon and Wacom. Amazon was trying to be helpful. Wacom's service department is just as bad as their app. I sent it back. I'm looking at other brands, and will definitely check the app reviews before I buy anything.",

Now, the large one that actually worked and I LOVED, just stopped pairing with my devices like the other two I sent back. I'm so sad. I thought I had finally found a solution.

The refills are difficult to find right now, not sure if it is due to being a new product or there just aren't that many purchased yet to have the ink refill readily available. Used the product for a few weeks, works well except I have to keep re-syncing the inspace app and the tablet again and again. The inkspace app could use updates so the notes can be organized into folders instead of by month.",
