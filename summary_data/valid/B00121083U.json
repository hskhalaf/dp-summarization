I'm a size 10 and when I tried them on in the store, the shoe fit perfectly with toe room and all. I ordered the light beige, size 10, and they fit a little too tight, honestly, like 9-9.5. Mind you, I wear socks with my Toms also. I did a side by side comparison between my old gray Toms and the new ones I received and the new ones were way smaller. The color is amazing and all, but sizing isn't right; highly disappointed.",

At the price I got them for, they will make good cheap gifts. Extra bonus points to the manufacturer for giving shoes to children in Africa. I don't really think this should weigh into your purchasing decision, though, unless you're a hippie going for conspicuous consumption, in which case, these will probably go great with your toyota prius.",

I don't wear socks with mine but instead, wear those no-show footies that feel like pantyhose (can't think of what they are called- maybe a liner or something?).",

    "description": "Awww, yeah. We thought we knew the meaning of comfort, but TOMS' Classic Canvas slip-on schooled us. Its cool, casual upper has an elastic inset at the vamp and darts at the toe to add wearing ease to its padded footbed and cushioning rubber outsole. It'll be your new favorite.\n\nTOMS Shoes was founded in 2006 by Blake Mycoskie. The shoe is a unique slip-on design comprised of clean lines and lightweight fabrics in vibrant colors and prints. TOMS was founded when Blake was inspired on a trip to Argentina by the traditional, rope-soled Argentine \"alpargata.\" He was struck by the poverty and health issues of the country, and set out to reinvent the alpargata for the U.S. market, and in doing so to accomplish one goal: Making life more comfortable for those without shoes. To realize this purpose, Blake made a commitment to match every pair of TOMS purchased with a donation of a pair to a child in need. It's simple: If you buy a pair of TOMS, the company will give a pair to someone in need on your behalf. During its first year in business, TOMS sold 10,000 pairs of shoes, and Blake returned to Argentina to lead his first annual Shoe Drop during which he donated to the children who had inspired him. TOMS Shoes are now available in multiple colors and fabric combinations for men, women and a recently introduced line for children, aptly titled Tiny TOMS.",
