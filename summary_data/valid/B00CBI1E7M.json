I can't imaging using something lower. It's perfect. Very steady, very well-made. Bamboo cutting board is also very nice. It is not very thick (as others have also noted), but now that I think about it, all bamboo cutting boards are thinner than hardwood boards. It's nice that it is removable for cleaning or use elsewhere. If it were thicker it would be terribly heavy. It went together VERY easily. Just pay attention to the directions and it's a snap. It does go much faster with 2 people. I REALLY like it.",

My only two complaints is that the top of the rack is horrible storage for small bottles like spices and the bottom wooden cutting board is pretty thin which makes the rack look cheap. I ended up cutting a thin piece of plywood for my spices to rest upon it without falling over. 1/4\" or less should work.",

It's sturdy but if I have my Kitchen Aid Mixer on high (i.e. kneading bread or mixing big batches of cookies), the rack will shake, so I wouldn't recommend using it this way and move the mixer to the countertop. Love it regardless.",

The second shelf from the bottom holds my longer glassware and my large mixing bowls. I was able to hang all my cookware that cannot stack in the cupboards. Thank you for a wonderful product.",
