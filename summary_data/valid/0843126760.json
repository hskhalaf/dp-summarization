Mad Libs has not changed very much in the past 20 years and it remains entertaining for both adults and the kids. The Christmas edition has cute stories and we all had a few laughs. This item is great to keep the kids busy for a bit, it is cheap enough to buy as an extra birthday gift or as a stocking stuffer and I recommend it for all kids - boys or girls.",
