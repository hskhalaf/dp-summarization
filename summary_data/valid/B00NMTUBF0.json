I have bought the same hangers in stores in the past and I got these because I was redoing my closet and it looked good having everything on the same style hanger and having shirts stay in place on the hangers. The only negative I noticed is If I tried hanging slacks (folded in half) over these, the non-slip felt made it difficult getting the slacks on and off the hanger, so I stuck with plastic hangers for my slacks.",

The metal hook is barely anchored Into the plastic of the body, and breaks off very easily even if you're just pulling your clothing out from other clothes that squeeze it a little, or if you don't fully clear the hook from the rod as you're pulling it out. Does not take much at all. So, I'll use these til they go, but I'll be finding another version of this same thing that's more durable.",

The fuzzy coating, which keeps garments from slipping around on the hangers, makes them more difficult to get into the garment and position for hanging. The don't break like the plastic hangers. I think they'll last well. The first time you try to swivel the hanger neck, you might think they don't turn, but they do swivel. Once you decide you don't mind taking your time positioning an item on the hanger, they're okay. We have about a hundred-fifty of these things in use now.",

But the swivel isn't loose like you might be used to with cheap department store hangers, so you don't have to worry about your hanger swiveling around when you're rummaging through your closet.

They have done a fine job of keeping the clothes on the hangers under all but the roughest driving conditions. I enjoyed them so much I bought more hangers for home and found they do a lovely job of not only keeping my silkier tops from sliding off the hanger, but in keeping the shoulders in place and therefore minimizing shifting around and wrinkling. I ordered this most recent batch because my husband and I decided we want to replace all our hangers with these.",

      "text": "Purchased two packages (100 hangers) for my closet. Moved into a condo with limited closet space. Installed a custom closet, then used these when I found my other hangers were too bulky and needed to increase my storage capability beyond what was designed. Could be I have too many clothes given I had to purchase two and still have seasonal items in rolling containers under my bed!",

I ended up ordering two more boxes and added my pants to the list of clothing I will never have to pick up off the floor. I highly recommend them if your clothes slide off of metal or plastic hangers. They are well made.",
