Bought another in early 2016 and while they had worked fine for the 5 minutes that I tested them before putting them back in the box, it turns out in the intervening months they're already dead. The two versions are noticeably different; in the first version the bulb covers were nice and flush, whereas the more recent version has bulb covers superglued on (with string hanging off) and gaps between the bulb and the cover. The boxes they came in also changed, and the wires changed to a darker shade of green.",

Peaches, aquas, reds, greens, lavenders, and blues, pastels and bright jewel tones. These are the lights to get. (I once bought look-alike but they changed colors much too rapidly and it was jarring.) I left four strings plugged end-to-end, turned on 24/7, outside, for about three weeks straight this year, and they never stopped working.",

The changing of the colors was about as gradual as some color changing LED containing candles I have : not so fast as to be annoying and not so slow as to be boring. I'll post about the longevity of these lights after we have them in use for a season. So far, very good.",

My only complaint, and it isn't a real one, is that I wish they changed a little faster. They are so slow you can barely notice the change, but that is cool in its own right. Oh, and we ordered 4 sets, and every single bulb worked perfectly, and chained together right out of the box. Very pleased.",

Slow, subtle, and the colors are not just primary RGB - they are apparently random but somehow harmonious. I am adding a year later that these lights are unfortunately not very durable. After a few months (outside), the lights faded in intensity until they just died. Very sad, as they are otherwise fantastic.",

Well, not! I ordered another brand and when we got them out this year, they didn't work, were ugly, and nothing like these! So thanks to Amazon's 1 day shipping, I reordered 4 more strands of THIS brand and they are simply stunning. I can sit and watch the very slow changing of the bulbs and it is so beautiful! Don't order another brand! These are the real deal and the strand that I ordered in 2014 is STILL working just fine!",

I have them mounted out of the weather under the porch overhang, so I haven't ran into any of the difficulties with moisture or fading mentioned by some here. They do take some getting used to if you had some other version of string lights on your porch (or wherever.) They start off flashing through their colors rather slowly and seemingly synchronized at first but within a few minutes they are flashing fairly quickly and in an unsynchronized manner.",

Either they had a bad batch or the people didn't understand how the lights were to perform and what size. I decided to go ahead and order them and I am very happy. I am going to order another set. There is a photo of the lights next to their plug and that will give you an idea of the size.",

Otherwise they're as advertised and can be linked together.",
