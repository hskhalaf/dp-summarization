If you have ever baked eggs before, they create a hard crust on the pan that is impossible to get off without damaging the pan. I DIDNT use oils or sprays and the eggs slipped out of the pan with NO egg stuck on it. I am so thrilled with the ease of use and cleaning and bought 6 more pieces. Love my new bakeware!",
