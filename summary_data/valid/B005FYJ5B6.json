The Reikken battery I bought from the shop that installed every thing just didn't cut it. My headlights would dim every time the bass hit in my Yukon. Then, when I got this battery, it fixed all issues. My original D3400 battery was given to my dad which uses it in the back of his van for work, he says he loves it too.",
