I didn't want to get the best hammer chisel in the world, but wanted something that would work and allow me use it over the following years whenever I needed it. This one has plenty of power. It seems to have no trouble pounding the chisel and elevating the tile. I also got the Bosch chisel  highly recommended. Does a great job. If you need a hammer chisel and don't want to spend a fortune, I would highly recommend this one",

The unit I received however has a tendency to slip out of whatever mode you set it on to the next mode. For instance, I wanted it on hammer drill, and during use it slipped into hammer- only mode. I have set it on drill mode, and it has slipped out of that during hard use. That was a major problem for the project I was doing.",
