These shoes are so freakin' comfortable, I almost never want to take them off! The only downside to them is the sole tread; they have an open tread with about 1/4\" 'holes' in them. When you're walking on gravel or acorns, things wind up getting caught in them, so if you have hardwood floors or walk on other surfaces that may scratch easily, be sure to check the bottoms and remove any debris you might have picked up.",

Comfort and impact protection is a bit less due to less volume of the boost material. However durabiliy is much better due to a much thicker outsole. Size run very small. I normally wear 11-11.5 and the 11.5 fits very snug although the knit stretches. Recommend going half a size up. For half the price of an ultra boost, shoe is a very good buy.",
