I have these in more than one color. They are great for everyday wear and anytime water is involved. I take them overseas with me. They weight almost nothing. I wear them to the office with dresses. You can dress them up or down. They are my idea of the perfect shoe.",

That being said -the sole part of the shoe and the toe area are perfect! I really loved them right when i put them on. And the dark gray/brown color was great too, but after a few hours that ankle strap really started to dig into my skin, and i dont think its the type to stretch. So im returning them. But im sad because ankle strap aside, i was very very happy with how these looked!",

They do stretch out however after a season or so of non-stop use, so I suggest you order next year's pair in the Fall. I have some pairs that have gone for two seasons, but they get pretty loose into the second season. You have to stretch them to put them on, so that is what stretches them out ... but if you figure I've worn them maybe May through September (120 days) per season, that's a lot of use. Worth every penny.",
