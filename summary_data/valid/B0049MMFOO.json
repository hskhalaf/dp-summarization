      "text": "I ordered this, then read a review comparing this with the regular zo3 so I ordered also both. The pro model is lighter, and cranks in faster, but in my opinion, isn't as well built as the silver zo3. They use some gears on the pro model that is in the bullet. They are lightweight pot metal. The silver zo3 gear ratio 2.9:1 The pro model is 3.4:1 So basically in a tug of war the regular zo3 wins. But with the pro model you get extra marketing, a fancier box, and an extra crank, and cheaper gears.",

It cast much better than i ever expected. There is no comparison between the Zebco 33 or the 202. The reel comes with two spools one with 10lb test and the other with 6lb test, they are easily interchanged. The reel also comes with two reel handles, the single one as in the picture has a round finger knob, and a double handle with flat comfortable finger knobs. I was blown away by quality of this reel. I would recommend it to any and everyone",

Second the drag adjustment sets atop the reel and for a reel palming fisherman it will unknowingly readjusted, for me that was always a reduction in what little drag there was.",

I can't see buying another zebco product if this is reflective of their \"pro\" series.",

So both me and the grand kids have better options. It is a smooth reel and feels substantial. If spin cast is your reel of choice and you want an upgrade to the regular 33 this is definitely a different reel .",
