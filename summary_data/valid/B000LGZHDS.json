His eye-stalks are stitched together, which keeps them from bending in a weird way, getting caught in other toys, and from getting damaged easily because together the stalks are more durable. Again, the colors are vibrant. The toy is not too big; it fits in a man's outstretched palm. Good quality. Packaged well in a tight plastic bag, so it did not arrive with lint or fuzzies or cardboard scraps or other nasty things stuffed animals in transit pick up. Stands up on his own like good little snail, so he is easy to pop onto a shelf. Meoww.",
