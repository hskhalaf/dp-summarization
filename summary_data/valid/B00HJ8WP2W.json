Some fair materials: cabinet, controls and heater unit. Some cheap materials: doors, heat shield, flame generator. Required these repairs: - Opened bulb hatch to straighten aluminum rotisserie (generates the flames) whose reflective paddles struck cabinet rear wall. - Unscrewed cabinet top to straighten bent cabinet sheet metal top lip. - Unscrewed cabinet bottom's heat shield that vibrated as the heat unit engaged to adhere 2 quieting aluminum tape layers.",

We purchased this electric fireplace, received it in great condition and my husband had the legs on it in about 15 minutes, plugged it in and had a glowing \u201cfire\u201d in seconds. It produces good heat from the bottom of the unit and keeps our feet warm! I recommend it as you can also put items on top of this unit (like a diffuser for your oils) without the top getting hot.",

The little doors open and close to hide the electric controls. I have an old house (with old wiring) and was worried, as some of the bigger stoves of this kind will blow fuses. But this one does not!
