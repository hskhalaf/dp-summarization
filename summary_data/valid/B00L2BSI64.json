Personally, after using this product, I like to follow up with toner and a hyaluronic acid cream, because it is a good way to rehydrate your skin without adding oil and clogging your pores.",

      "text": "This is my favorite face wash! I have acne prone oily skin and I use this once a day. I find that leaving it on my skin for longer than 30seconds can leave it very red (chemical burn). So I only wash and rinse quickly. Doesn\u2019t bother me. Leaves my skin with a icy, refreshing feeling. It does have a scent but it\u2019s pleasant. Also, one pump is the perfect amount for my face and chest together. Lasts me a while. Highly recommend if you have acne prone skin! Does not exfoliate tho.",

It helps me with 99% removal or dirt and foundation on my face. I know this because after I use a toner, there isn\u2019t any discoloration on the cotton ball;indicating no dirt in my pores. I also love how refreshing this feels on my face. It\u2019s like I slapped mint on my face.",

Never been more happy with a cleanser! Although, I gave it a 4 out of 5 because of the bottle- it seems like a huge amount but the pump distributes too much of it out at one time. Just fix that and we are golden!",
