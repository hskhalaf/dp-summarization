When it arrived, I followed the simple directions, and then, presto (!), the AC was blowing cold again! It has now been working great for many months, so the problem was solved without an expensive AC repairman bill. Best Regards, PG",

Take your time when recharging the system and wait the recommended 10-15 seconds between fillings to get an accurate reading on your system. Also be careful to check to make sure the can is empty before taking the hose off, the canister does not reseal itself when the hose is taken off. I made the mistake thinking the can was empty and got a bunch of the oily sealant sprayed all over the garage floor.

I called their tech support and some vehicle manufacturers went to 1234yf refrigerant and is not compatible and is a pro-A/C shop or dealer service. This product is for R-134a refrigerant systems. So, basically, if you are driving anything 2014 or newer, lift the hood and check the refrigerant label usually over the radiator or on the hood. They could expand the information, but that would impact sales.",
