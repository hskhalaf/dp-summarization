Crispy top end, very detailed, but never harsh. There is lots of instrument definition and separation, air. But the biggest surprise is the midrange. It is smooth, lucid with proper instrumental timbre. It' s so hard to fault and dislike the quality of the earphones. They are easy to drive with your mobile phone, average dap or standalone headphone amplifier, with better quality source every step is improved. Amazing earphones and highly recommended !!!!!",

      "text": "Had to return these. Very upsetting. These in-ears have excellent sound but the cable noise is horrible. They sound great sitting on the train or subway but then you get up and handling noise is all you hear. Making it worse is the length of the cable and the placement of the remote. It hangs low on the chest with no adjustment. As you walk the remote flops around, hitting your chest and sending even more noise through the cable. It's real shame. These are some of the better in-ears that I've used but poor cable design kills an otherwise great set especially for the audiophile/enthusiast.",
