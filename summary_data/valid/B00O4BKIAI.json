I've had some shoulder damage from my...\"I'm indestructible\" days.(Turns out I wasn't.) You always seem to need a good scratching in the exact part of your back that you can't reach. Enter the \"Bamboo Back Scratcher\"...AAAHHH.... Wonderful !! It came well packaged and earlier than expected, and I've used it every day since. Sometimes I don't even have an itch to scratch...it just feels great. Highly recommended ?? Oh yeah !",

It's a bit on the thin side, but it's bamboo, so maybe that's why. Mine has a crack towards where they set the hole for the string. It also needs a little further sanding where you would use it scratch your back. Otherwise, it's nicely built, looks sleek and has a nice wood-burned logo (albeit off-center). I would buy this again.",

The finish on the wood also is not done very well. There were splinters all over it, no big ones, but enough to bother me.",

    "title": "JapanBargain, Bamboo Wood Backscratcher Back Scratcher Rake Itching Relief Body Relaxation Massager Extra Long 17 inches (1)",
    "description": "Package Quantity:1Bamboo back scratchers are cut from mature bamboo, and are very strong and sturdy. The handle is a comfortable hand filling 1 1/2\" wide, not a skinny stick like you'll find on other back scratchers. The handles are stiff, so the back scratcher won't bend away from your back when you're trying to scratch hard. Each is handmade, no two are identical. Bamboo is a fantastic material. Not only is it strong and durable, but since it is technically a type of grass, it is also very easy to grow and harvest in an environmentally responsible manner.",
