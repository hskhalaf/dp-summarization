These ropes are not indestructible against vigorous play, but have shown the best durability compared to several other varieties/brands we have tried. It can become necessary to trim strands as they begin to unravel (the twisted braid ring seem to come apart the most readily), but that's not a huge problem. Our satisfaction with these has prompted a second order of the multi-pack. Will purchase again as necessary, probably in another 4-5 months given how things have gone so far. Thanks!",
