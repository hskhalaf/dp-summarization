      "text": "I have been using two of these bags on a rotating basis for my pump parts for approximately 10 months. Unfortunately, despite laundering in a garment bag and hanging inside out to dry completely before each use, mold has started to grow near the seams at the bottom of the bag (see attached pictures). Despite the one year guarantee, the seller ultimately only offered me a negligible refund. I have a Bumkins wet bag used for the same duration and cleaned in the same way which still appears brand new. Would not recommend buying these bags if you are concerned about mold/mildew growth. I will replace these bags with another brand.",

The one with the circles is really pretty but I like the simple blue as well. Wet bags are useful for many things (dirty laundry or diapers, packing day bags, use when traveling, with swim suits, storing items in car, etc). Can hold between 6-10 diapers each.",
