With a Sawyer or other filters with pump/squeeze action, you won't rip out your fillings trying to get water. Also, you have to lie on the ground, whereas other filters come with collapsible pouches AND a straw if the pouch breaks. Before everyone down-votes this post, you Really need to watch actual videos of people who use these routinely. Everyone switches to a filter with a pump or squeeze method of filtration. Lifestraws are fantastic concept, but unfortunately, it is just too dang hard to use.",

I would not want to use this on regular camping trips as it is hard to suck up the water from it unless you are using a bottle water and forcing water into the straw. But it does make water safer and in an emergency some water is better than no water even if its hard to suck up the water. Definitely something you want for your camping, hiking or emergency backpack.",

This after having made sure both ends were open, blowing till nothing else comes out, and leaving the straw both upright AND on its side to drain. Maybe I've done something wrong, but I don't feel comfortable using this again in the future.",
