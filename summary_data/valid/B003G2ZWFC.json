The reverse has stripes in various shades of blue and brown/tan. The blend is predominately blue.The stripes make it easy and quick to put on the bed which is a big help in a summer home where there are many more fun things to do than making beds!",

They are much, much brighter (as someone else commented, think college dorm decor) so I'm disappointed not to be able to use this quilt as I had planned. I'm using the blue striped reverse side for now, which is okay, but can't use the shams because they're not reversible and the colors are just over the top for my taste. Maybe they will fade with more time and washing, as other reviewers have noted.",
