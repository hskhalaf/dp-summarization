We overstuffed them with candy and gifts on Christmas Eve, and they didn't snag on anything that we put inside, or even on my wedding ring when I was stuffing things down to the bottom. After we took the gifts and candy out, they went back to normal size and shape. I'm sure we'll have these for years to come.",

For those who knit, the cuff measures 2.8\" in length which is plenty of room to stitch on a name or initials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much can you fit into each stocking?\n\nLarger than a typical stocking, each measures 26\" long and 6.5\" wide (66 x 16.5 cm). They fit all kinds of stuffers including bottled perfume, cosmetics, toy trucks, boxed candies, portable speakers, stuffed animals, books, and more. Don't worry about the weight - the sturdy loops can withstand at least as much weight as your stocking holder or hook.\n\n\n\nHow do I clean them?\n\nThese stockings are made of 100% machine washable material.
