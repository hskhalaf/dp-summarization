I figured sacrificing the quality (a little) was a reasonable exchange for the time saved from not having to iron. Then, by the first week of November it completely stopped heating. Initial quality was fantastic! There is a noticeable drop off of quality before 5 months passes. By the end of the sixth month it is back to the iron.",
