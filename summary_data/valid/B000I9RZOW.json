My husband also used it as some kind of a surfing or floating device in the ocean and it didn't pop... Surprisingly. Nice little pool... Cheap price... Can't go wrong",

      "text": "I bought this to use as a swimming pool and a ball pit for my 17-month old kiddo. We haven\u2019t used it as a pool yet. It works great as a ball pit. My kiddo is able to get in and out with ease. I have 200 balls in there, which I bought from Amazon as well (the 100 balls per bag and are slightly smaller than the typical ones). It easily stores under my kiddo\u2019s crib. It was also easy to blow up - I didn\u2019t use a pump and took less than 5 minutes. True to size as mentioned in the description. Hope this review serves of any help! :)",
