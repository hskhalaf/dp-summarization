You'll get a consistent (enough) grind out of this if you know what you're doing and give it a little time for trial and error to get a specific grind dialed in. I use a Bialetti Italian press and this grinder helps me make fantastic and consistent coffee all day, every day.",

      "text": "awesome affordable grinder, the only thing I didn't like is that you can't wash the grinder itself (only the lid), you must clean it with a wet towel but can't pull it put. I still gave it 5 stars because it's not a real mess to clean , and it grinds coffee and even nutmeg like a ninja",
