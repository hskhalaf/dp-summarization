Being electric you don't have to disturb the entire neighbor hood cranking up the old rototiller! I highly recommend this tiller and believe you will be pleasantly surprised with it's performance.",

All I had to do was take it out of the box, put the handles together and I was ready to use it. It's not quite as powerful as the Mantis but did a good job tilling the gardens. Also, it is wider than the Mantis which makes getting into tight spaces a little harder. However, this is about 1/2 the price of the Mantis and did a good job so overall I'm very pleased. I would recommend it.",

It would kick out 3\" rocks or so and go thru 1/2-1\" roots with little problem. The silver (aluminum?) Housing gets pretty warm so one might need to give it a rest periodically.
