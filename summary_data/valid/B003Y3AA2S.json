And of course her favorite place to pee is in the hallway. I bought this rug cleaner and a black light and was surprised to find so many spots. I'm adding pictures to show how well this cleans. You do need to run deep clean for pee spots but the cycle is 6 minutes and the tank lasts for 3 deep cleans. Well worth the money.",

      "text": "The product works quite well for its intended purpose, removing pet \"accidents\" and stains from carpets. However, as noted in at least one other review, the product has an inherent defect in its hose. The way the hose is designed, it is intended that the hose wrap around the SpotBot for storage. The fit is quite tight, resulting in premature cracking/splitting of the hose, thus rendering the device unable to adequately suction. It does not appear to be readily replaceable. Hence my 3 star rating. (I will probably purchase another in spite of the defect.)",

It will clean about 5 times on the \"quick setting\" before it needs more water and solution. Definitely recommend buying extra bottles of solution with the machine, the ones it comes with are tiny and disappear fast.

      "text": "After using this machine several times, I would not have purchased if I would have seen how it works. It covers a small area, about 8\" diameter. Useful for small clean ups. Took several moves of the machine to cover all the soiled areas. When complete, it left behind about 50% of the water it put down; carpet wet to touch. Got out our normal carpet cleaner and finished the job. Better off buying another brand of carpet cleaner for the same money.",

And when it does break, there seems to be no way to replace it, so you're stuck wrapping duct tape around the hose where it meets the base. Good luck with all that.",
