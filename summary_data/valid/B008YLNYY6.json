I can usually put together things, i can follow the directions. However after several hours of trying, the book case can't fit together flush. I am convinced that the pre-drilled holes are slightly off alignment. I really am disappointed. Its too much of a hassle to return it. I can't use it because it's not assembled right. it's a WASTE OF MONEY. I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this product. I basically threw away $127.50.",

By the time we realized it we decided to assemble the product and see if the damage would show significantly. Fortunately it did not show that much so we decided to keep rather than return it. The product assembled in about two hours and appears to be sturdy and good looking.",

Apparently someone didn't know how to convert metric to Imperial, and I should have done my own calculations instead of trusting the listing. I set up an aquarium far enough away to accomodate a 35\" width shelf, and now I have weird symmetry in the room. It's a bummer, but I still like it and am glad that I bought it.",
