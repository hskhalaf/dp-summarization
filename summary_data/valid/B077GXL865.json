      "verdict": "The unique style and comfort delivered by the Under Armour ArchiTech Futurist resonated well with consumers. Users also liked the stability of the footwear, its lightweight construction, and the sock-like fit of the upper. Though the ankle structure was applauded for the support it brought, the zipper in front caused discomfort for some users. The lack of more color options and the snug fit were also some of the negative points raised by shoppers. Despite some grievances with the shoes, it was still highly recommended because of its overall performance during workouts.",
