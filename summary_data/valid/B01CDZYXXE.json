The phone is very quick and lag free and the display clear and bright even in bright sunshine. There is plenty of memory for apps etc. and it took a 64 gbyte memory card without any complaints. All in all an excellent phone especially for the price as it's comparable to a Samsung S7 - apparently.",

Battery is good, found no difference to my other 3000mah phones. It takes getting used to the smaller screen. Fingerprint is very conveniently located. Build is good, I have not noticed any issues. Wide angle camera so innovative. Battery off course removable. Speaker very good. Micro SD slot. Takes a nano SIM. Original charger cable very flimsy.",

      "text": "This phone look like the pictures shown. It has many features, one of which is using this phone as a TV remote etc. One of many features. The phone's aesthetics are pretty beautiful: it's slim and stylish. The phone is also very light and easy to handle. The only downside of this product is that you need a spare battery, but that's nothing. Unless you're on a budget and need extra batteries. Also the dual cameras hand out very pixilated images, but with the right hand can producs stunning images in 4k. In short I would recommend this phone over the lg g4 or samsung s6 and edge. It's faster, louder and the overall image quality is superb. Thunbs up.",
