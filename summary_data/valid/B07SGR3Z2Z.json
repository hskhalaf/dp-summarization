This model may just be the most perfect combination of aesthetics, efficiency and performance. It covers my needs as a design student and game lover, its performance on high resolution is impeccable and its portability can surprisingly outrun other models I\u2019ve used. Needles to say this models specs are over the top to its size. Overall, one of the greatest purchases I\u2019ve made in my life.",

The second screen is an ever so slight gimmick however one that does often surprise with the extra visual space it offers. All-in-all a fantastic product.",
