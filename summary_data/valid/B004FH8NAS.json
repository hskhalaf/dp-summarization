It feels fine when the gel is on, but once I take it off the skin becomes inflamed and uncomfortable. I really wanted to be able to use this product a lot more, but its just not worth the skin irritation. I have sensitive skin, so maybe its just a problem for people with skin like mine.",

The skin tightened and was a little younger and less translucent looking. They were comfortable to have on and refreshingly cool and moisturizing.
