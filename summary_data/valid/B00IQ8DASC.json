Other than those details, it is a very nice looking table and is plenty good enough for me to practice on, without breaking the bank.",

Needs better rack, suggest getting your own. Table has nice quality cloth and pockets. Shipment was well packed, I had to hire a installation service to assembly. I highly recommend professional installation. Makes for a better experience! I am at the age where I do not assembler products anymore. Go professional Service. Great Table!!!",

Not a big deal but it is an inconvenience. 2: delivery guy just left this 300 pound table outside my home and left. Very rude.

    "description": "The stylish arcade-style Fat Cat Tucson MMXI 7-Foot Billiard Game Table will distinguish your game room with its electric-blue playing surface and sleek look. This billiards table lends an air of a billiards hall to your game room with the easy ball return similar to those in billiards halls. It is equipped with a 3/4\" MDF playing surface, rubber bumpers, and leg-levelers that can aid in keeping your table completely level even if the flooring is not flat. Also included with this table are two pieces of chalk, a resin triangle, two 57\" two-piece billiard cues, and a set of 2-1/4\" billiard balls.
