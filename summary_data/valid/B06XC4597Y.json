But as this was bought from the official Amazon system, on the .co.uk site, I would have hoped it would have come to be with a UK Power Charger. Instead it came to me with a European Charger, and started up in German. The latter is not an issue, but I wish the components were changable. I now have a Useless European charger, and will have to keep swapping with my phone adapter.",

Also the pin tool to open the SD card tray was plastic and bent so had to use a sowing pin. As other people have said it works with a 256gb micro SD card. The pen provided works fine and saves fingerprints on screen. Also it comes with a UK charger plug along with the European one. Charges very quickly on mains socket too.",
