The box was pretty rough when it got to me but the board was protected. It is a nice white board, is easily flipped, the surface is magnetic, and it is easily erased. I only have one negative thing to say and that is two of the screws WOULD NOT go into the stand. In the grand scheme of things it really doesn't matter because there are four on each side (two top and two on bottom) so it is definitely secure it's just annoying.",

Then, it came in a damaged and very taped-up box with all parts EXCEPT for the one of the two pieces that has wheels. I tried customer service. Of course, Amazon's automated customer service is pathetic. It does not qualify for return, so I am stuck with a dry erase board that I have to lean against the wall--all for $152. At this point, I don't recommend buying anything with the Amazon brand, since they do not back up their products with good customer service.",

Also UPS has become extremely lazy and left this out on the street by my mailbox rather than actually putting it by my garage door as instructed. Even worse is that it has been raining about every other day, luckily my wife saw it shortly before it rained and was able to retrieve it.",

It took me about 20 minutes. And I like the full-length pens holder which makes it very convenient. The 2-sided board with 360\u00b0 rotation gives you more writing space. The casters with locks are the plus, especially when you have kids around. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.",

The flipping mechanism does not snap into place by itself, so you have to guide the board into the bottom groove when flipping. My biggest complaint about this thing is the sturdiness. Compared to larger commercial mobile whiteboards, this board is unacceptably unstable. As soon as you touch the board with a marker or eraser, it starts to vibrate and wobble. This is annoying and distracting. So far, the only remedy I found was to hold onto the board as I write on it. I'm still looking for ways to weigh it down to see if it helps.",
