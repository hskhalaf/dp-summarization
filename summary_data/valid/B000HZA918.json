The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide. Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area. It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",

First upgrade to new bicycle was a Brooks Imperial. Some things that were near perfect in those days have changed, not necessarily for the better. Some have not changed, and deliver the same experience they used to. Thank goodness Brooks has not changed.",

Both Narrows came with very stiff leather, which I expect means they will last a long time, I Proofided them well before starting the riding part of the break-in, but they seemed reluctant to yield. Leather Honey helped to move the break-in process along. Both Narrows have several hundred miles on them now and are starting to yield ...it's a process, but well worth the effort.",

The leather is high quality and provides a low-friction surface. I can definitely see this seat lasting for years with the proper maintenance. The copper looks great, but the only downside is that you have to clean and polish it if you want to keep it from oxidizing. I still think it looks much better than the black rivets would have.

Here's the truth prior to 500 miles: the shaping of the saddle from riding helps a little, but most of the added comfort comes from breaking in your own butt. Will update at 500 miles. That said, branding and good looks, so 4/5.",
