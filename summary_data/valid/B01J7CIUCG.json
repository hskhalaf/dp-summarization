We also used it for extra warmth during the night one extra chilly night, and on a warm night I used it for my upper body instead of my mummy bag just because it's a more pleasant weight and texture. This will definitely be a staple for all family camping trips going forward. Thinking of getting another one!",

Why did I examine this product in this way? Because I had heard that some China-made products have these fibers on them. I did not know this item was made in China at the time of purchase but upon unpacking the throw blankets, I saw that they were made in China. So, I inspected them and alas I found long fibers that are \"nano-tech\" fibers and these fibers are not a natural part of the fabric. They are associated with Morgellons Disease. So, I will be throwing these \"throws\" into the trash. What a loss. Buyer beware.",

It packed very easily and was very easy to stuff in my carry-on for the flight over. I still use it for snuggling on cold nights or camping. I just recently whipped it out for an overnight guest. It's also super easy to wash!",

      "text": "Love this blanket! Great on top of bed during the colder months. Light weight, which I love being a back sleeper.it washes great and even better, dries quicker than my old down throw since the stitching keeps feathers evenly distributed. I chose the navy blue which fits in with my decor ,another plus for those who like a cohesive look with so many color to choose from. So pleased I ordered a second one.",

    "description": "Color:NavyThe Benefit of Using Down Blanket \n\n\nThis blanket by puredown can be used both outdoor and indoor. It is the thing that you need when you go camping or stay on couch. You can feel the soft touch and warmth when you get a little cooler. Our down blanket is the ultimate travel partner that fits in any small backpack or purse.\n\n\nHigh Quality Stuffing \n\n\nOur down and feather are selected and disinfected strictly. With its high fluffiness and softness, our product can significantly improve users's sleeping quality. Users will feel less pressure on their body during sleeping\n\n\nStorage Method\n\n\nMany people store their blankets during off seasons. The key to storing your blanket is breathability. Letting the down breathe by keeping your blanket in a cloth bag will prevent any moisture or odor buildup. It should also be stored in a location where it is not compressed and has room to stay fluffy. Give your blanket a good shake when you take it out of the bag next season and it should be ready to go",
