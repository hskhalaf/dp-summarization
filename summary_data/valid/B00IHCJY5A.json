      "text": "Replacing it after two years! Barely used in the last 6 months, because I've spent more time trying to get it to work correctly. After the last major software update, I can't get the scanner application to work correctly. I've reinstalled software, reset the device, removed ALL of the applications, reset and removed registry keys, and done a full dance to the scanning gods. They were probably distracted by others doing the same, and laughing at us when trying to work with Epson support (which is appallingly bad). No Bueno!! The really cruddy thing.... it's the newer software, it's just not compatible with this scanner.",

I followed Epson's suggestions on how to fix multiple document feed problems, but to no avail.",

However, it needs to be air blown often to keep the scanner clean otherwise, the picture has a thin line on the scanned image. So, I recommend, after scan each stack check your image to see if the line exist, then open scanner, blow out and clean with lense wipe. I have scanned over 10K pictures, done that in a 3-hour sitting daily for about 3 weeks. Not too bad... It scans better than my Canon MX920.",

      "text": "Device not even two years old with under 10K pages scanned and lost ability to scan multiple pages with the \"clicking sound\". A small $0.10 plastic piece is the culprit. I've seen posts about this problem all over the internet which tells me it is a very common problem with this scanner. Cannot find a replacement part and even if I could, it requires disassembly of the entire scanner to install. EPSON WILL NOT STAND BY AND MAKE GOOD ON THIS OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW. Shame on them. I have purchased my last Epson product.",

After you get it configured and working for a few days it will just stop with a \"cannot connect to the scanner message\". The epson network config S/W sees the scanner, ping sees the scanner, a web browser sees the scanner but the scanning S/W does not. Very frustrating. Save yourself a lot of trouble, buy another brand.",
