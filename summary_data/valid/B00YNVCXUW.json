I was really disappointed because in all other aspects this metronome seemed so nicely engineered. Well, the company immediately responded, and shipped me a replacement right away, which works perfectly. In their email they mentioned a goal of 100% customer satisfaction, and they certainly delivered on that. I think my initial one was just a weird exception. I highly recommend the product and the company. Well done!",

You definitely need to use headphones...every time. After leaving this review, the seller was kind enough to reach out to me and give me a full refund and forward the information onto their product development team to better the product, even though I did not ask. Great customer service from Kliq. I will definitely buy from them again.",

However, this is positively the WORST most OBNOXIOUS, ear-piercing, headache-inducing, toothache-causing metronome 'click' I've ever heard in my 45years of playing a variety of instruments!! I simply never imagined someone in the musical device business would EVER choose such a sound to represent a tempo count?! It's a shrill, high-pitched 'beep' for the primary tempo. The fill beat sounds actually aren't that bad! Shame you can't swap them for the primary... Good tuner! I gave it to my son to throw in his guitar goodie bag. Not! For acoustic instruments in my opinion.",

That's not a negative comment; it was her mistreatment of it that led to a broken screen. This is a wonderful product and I was going to purchase another before the band director simply gave her one. So long as it's treated with the care and respect any electronic item should be shown it will work as expected.",

BTW, the protective leatherette case is a nice throw-in! Soft, leather feel, open at one end to allow the tuner to slide in and out. Very posh for the cost of this tuner. One possible con: It has a fairly wide \"green\" zone...I'd guess about +/- 3 cents (about 7 cents wide). So if you are looking for that \"perfect pitch\" you've got to gauge where the middle is. For the most part, musicians I know who are that picky about tuning will be tuning by ear anyway...",

I liked having the chromatic tuning option as well for those times playing out of standard tune or when I dabble with other instruments. The functions and switching between each took me a little bit to get used to, but now that I get it, no problems!",

Also, too much digital animation on the screen - it made me dizzy when just trying to keep an eye on the digital pendulum in my peripheral vision while practicing; it should just be a simple flash.

      "text": "If you're buying this to finely tune an instrument, don't waste your money. It must have an \"in tune\" range of at least 20 cents, but I suspect it's even worse. In order to use it with any consistency from string to string you have to tune everything to where the meter bounces between flat and in tune and even then it is not accurate. It's a kiddie tuner with lots of built in eye candy.",

The metronome seems to have all the features I could possibly want. I'm using it with an electric and an acoustic mandolin. The electric one tunes well plugged into it, the acoustic is fine being picked up by its mic.",
