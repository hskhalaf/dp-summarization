I also don't understand why Chicco decided to make warming bottles so complicated. There's 6 steps to turning on the bottle warmer and turning it on....6. The last thing I need as a new parent is to remember to do all 6 steps perfectly. Even when I did, the milk still came out scolding hot. A complete waste of money and piece of trash. Just warm up a cup of water in the microwave and put the bottle in there for a few minutes. It's faster, doesn't burn the milk and way cheaper",

Newborns are complicated enough... this product was adding to the complexity when we thought it would make life simpler for them. Also since they have numerous power outages, they would have to reprogram more often leading to confusion and frustration. For these reasons, we gave it a below par for our babysitting needs.",

It's not too hot or cold and I don't have to worry about watching the time since it alerts when the cycle finishes. It also works well with the little basket for warming food. I'm not a believer in the microwave for baby so this product is great.",
