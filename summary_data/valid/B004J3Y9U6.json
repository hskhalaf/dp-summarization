It also just flat out refuses to take pictures in low light, even with the flash set to on. I am beginning to wonder if I have a defective camera. I can't take a picture of a shot that might move like an animal or a child because by the autofocus gets done with all its gyrations, my subject has moved and I have lost the shot. Really frustrating! I have tried taking it off the auto focus but then the pictures are blurry because there really isn't a way to focus through the camera.",

The only complaint I have (and it doesn't even bother me enough to reduce my rating) is that the shutter is slower when I have the display screen on. I use this mainly for food photography, so if I'm taking a picture of a cake it's no big deal. But if I'm photographing a moving, breathing subject I turn the screen off and use the viewfinder.",

I prefer the quality of the photos that SLRs make as opposed to the point-n-clicks. That said, to the camera. The build is quite solid, but I don't recommend dropping it. I did set it down a little rough and it was fine. The quality of the pictures is perfect for me. The lens it comes with is perfect for portraits and I wouldn't recommend it for anything else. The flash is quite good, but I rarely use it as my hand is steady enough for some fantastic pictures without the light.",

Keep in mind that it's cropped sensor camera, so the exposure plane of the sensor is a little smaller than a full sensor frame camera, which translates that your lens selection will show a little differently, but it also means that you have a wide range of lenses and great features! And with image stabilization lenses available, I take macro photos all day long without a tripod and they turn out perfect!",

      "text": "I've been using this for almost a year now and I have to say it's a really nice camera. It's the only DSLR I've ever owned, so I can't compare it to others, but it really does what I want it to. It's easy to switch to manual and set up a perfect shot exactly how I want it to look. I've recently got into the HDR aspect of photography, and it's easy to do with this camera. You can set the camera to take 3 consecutive shots at different exposures, then import into Photoshop's HDR feature, and it lets you tweak it to get the look you want.",

The only thing I wish is that it had a higher ISO setting like some of the models just above it.

I'm happy with the money paid for this model, and am investing leftover cash in additional lenses, etc. rather than buying a competitive camera for the sake of comparison.",

Went to Canada on vacation for a week and after 400 pictures I came home with over 80% of a charge. NO recharging needed. Cons: My camera only came with one lens. I have noticed some cameras with two starter lenses for the price I paid. Still I give this camera 5 stars for the quality. :)",

I was disappointed with some of the digital cameras because sometimes they had correct lighting and sometimes they didn't, sometimes they were in focus and sometimes they weren't all were auto focus. I was a little afraid to spend the money on an expensive camera( at least expensive for me),but I'm glad I did. This camera is so easy to use and it takes great pictures. I have taken pictures from a distance and gotten home, zoomed in on a subject in the picture cropped out the rest and the quality of the print was wonderful. Can't complain about anything so far. The price was right also.",

    "title": "Canon EOS Rebel T3 Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (discontinued by manufacturer)",
    "description": "The Canon 5157B002 includes the EOS Rebel T3 Digital SLR Camera and the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS type II Lens. This camera and lens is perfect for photographers ready to make the move to digital SLR photography. The EOS Rebel T3 delivers beautiful photos and video, speed, simplicity and fun. It features a 12.2 Megapixel CMOS Image Sensor and Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor for richly detailed images and quick camera response. It has Canon's amazing 63-zone, dual-layer metering for accurate exposures and features Canon's Basic+ function, HD video recording and Live View shooting, plus a convenient in-camera Feature Guide.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nNew Technology for Outstanding Images. \n12.2 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor for high image quality and speed. \nCanon\u2019s CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same new technologies to maximize each pixel\u2019s light gathering efficiency that were first seen with the professional EOS-1D Mark III model. It\u2019s an APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm), and there's an effective 1.6x increase in the lens's marked focal length when attached.\n\n \n12.2 Megapixel APS-C Size CMOS Sensor\n\n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThe improved DIGIC 4 Image Processor ensures that images are captured, processed and saved with remarkable speed. The EOS Rebel T3 DSLR\u2019s new 3:2 multiple aspect ratio, in-camera RAW image processing, creative filters, image resizing and provided S2 and S3 image-recording quality are all possible thanks to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. With dazzling results, the new DIGIC 4 Image Processor also works to capture and process data of images shot at 12.2 Megapixels at 3.0 fps, as well as 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, enhanced Face Detection Live mode, Full HD video recording, Auto Lighting Optimizer and Lens Peripheral Optimization.\n\n\n\n\nExcellence from Dawn to Dusk.\nISO 100 \u2013 6400 for shooting from bright to dim light. \nWith a broad range of ISO settings, the EOS Rebel T3 enables shooting from sunrise to sunset and helps ensure capture of the finest detail. With enhanced high-sensitivity optimization, subjects can be captured clearly and easily at high shutter speeds without flash, with minimized blur and noise. In bright scenes, especially long exposures in daylight, optimal exposure can be achieved with a fully open wide-diameter lens, no dark filter needed.\n\n\n\n\nHigh Definition Made Easy. \nImproved EOS HD Movie mode with expanded recording [HD: 30p (29.97) / 25p], and with in-camera video editing options. \nThe EOS Rebel T3 DSLR\u2019s expanded repertoire of technologies includes shooting video in brilliantly clear, exactingly sharp high definition for playback on your HDTV! Shooting at 1280 x 720 at 30 (29.97) or 25 frames per second, HD video can be taken immediately through the EOS Rebel T3 camera\u2019s intuitive operation and layout. Parameters for white balance and picture style are already set \u2014 just grab and go!\n\nIncredible AutoFocus. \nHigh speed, reliable 9-point AF system utilizing a high precision, f/5.6 cross-type center point. \nThe EOS Rebel T3 has a high-precision, 9-point AF system utilizing a high-precision, f/5.6 cross-type center point. The 9-point AF system uses both normal and high-precision focus depending on the aperture and available light. The 9 focus points can be chosen automatically or manually selected.\n\n\n9-point AF\n\n\nAccurate Metering for Perfect Exposure. \nEnhanced metering with a 63-zone, Dual-layer metering system for accurate metering between exposures. \nThe EOS Rebel T3 features Canon\u2019s newest Dual-layer sensor, with 63 zones. By measuring not only the amount of light, but also taking into account color and luminosity, this new system delivers a very high level of accuracy for better results every time. Since the metering sensor has a color measurement function, exposure errors and focus errors caused by different light sources are minimized; the EOS Rebel T3 gives stable exposure from shot to shot in situations where light changes, such as sports on a cloudy day, or indoor holiday scenes.\n\n\nMetering zones\n\n\nSpeedy, Precise Operation.\n3.0 fps continuous shooting up to approximately 3 JPEGs or approximately 2 RAW.\nThe EOS Rebel T3 operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS Rebel T3 is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 3.0 fps (frames per second), in bursts of up to approximately 3 JPEGs or 2 RAW files, so you won\u2019t miss a shot.\n\n \n3.0 fps Continuous Shooting\n\n\nSee the Image on a Large LCD with Live View Function.\n2.7-inch wide TFT LCD monitor (230,000 dots) with Live View function for improved viewing. \nThe EOS Rebel T3 has a huge, bright 2.7-inch TFT (thin film transistor) LCD monitor with 230,000 pixels and a viewing angle of 170\u00b0. It\u2019s perfect for Live View composition or viewing camera settings like AF, ISO, Metering, AF Point selection and flash options. And the maximum brightness of the EOS Rebel T3 DSLR\u2019s LCD monitor is about 30% greater than its predecessor, which is a big benefit when you\u2019re using the camera in bright sunlight.\n\nLive View Function\nLive View Function enables you to view your subjects directly on the huge 2.7-inch LCD monitor. It\u2019s easy to magnify any part of the scene 5x or 10x for precise manual focus. And now, there are two ways to use Autofocus along with Live View Function in the EOS Rebel T3. You can even choose a grid overlay, perfect for keeping straight lines in your subject straight in your pictures. In the studio, Live View Function can be used remotely via a computer through the EOS Rebel T3 DSLR\u2019s USB connection.\n\n\n\n\nMake Your Images As You See Them.\nExpress your creativity with ease using advanced imaging features like the new Basic+ function, Quick Setting function and Creative Auto. \nBasic+ is a new creative imaging feature that makes it easy to create the image effects you want. It can be set with the Quick Control screen in Basic Zone modes. Basic+ provides two options:\n\nShoot by ambience selection:\nBased on the Picture Style and its parameters (sharpness, contrast, saturation, and color tone), the exposure compensation and white balance correction are adjusted to attain the selected ambience. You can also select the strength of the ambience effect.\n\nShoot by lighting or scene type:\nAlthough the actual parameter set is the white balance, the settings are expressed in more understandable terms.\n\nThe EOS Rebel T3 DSLR\u2019s Quick Control screen gives you instant access to the most common settings, all in one place! It\u2019s a great way to quickly confirm or change settings while you\u2019re shooting. The Quick Control screen is particularly useful when you\u2019re shooting from a tripod or monopod, with the camera at eye level, because it eliminates the need to view the LCD data panel on top of the camera while changing settings.\n\nFor beginners looking to expand their photographic horizons, the EOS Rebel T3 offers Creative Auto mode. While basic settings are based on full automatic operation, shooting guides on the LCD screen enable you to make corrections based on simple to follow guidelines. In essence, with Creative Auto mode, you can learn about photography while taking stunning photographs.\n\n\nPhotography Made Truly Easy.\nNew Feature Guide offers short descriptions of each function and Quick Control screen for easy operation. \nThe Canon EOS Rebel T3 DSLR demystifies great photography by including an in-camera Feature Guide. Appearing on the camera\u2019s LCD, the Feature Guide displays a simple description or advice for the respective function. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during Mode Dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions (during normal shooting, Live View shooting, movie shooting, and playback). The Feature Guide appears automatically during Mode Dial operations and when a function is selected on the Quick Control screen.\n\n\nSpeedy, Wireless Image Capture and Transmission.\nCompatibility with SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards. \nThe EOS Rebel T3 uses popular SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel T3 DSLR\u2019s compact and lightweight body design.\n\nAdditionally, the EOS Rebel T3 is compatible with Eye-Fi* SD cards, which are outfitted with a Wi-Fi transmitter (IEEE 802.11b/g) and internal antenna for wireless, high-speed transfer of images. With an Eye-Fi card installed, the EOS Rebel T3 can display the Eye-Fi\u2019s connection status and error notes with ease, for fully functional wireless uploading of images directly from the camera.\n\n*Canon cameras are not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions, including wireless transfer. In case of an issue with the Eye-Fi card, please consult with the card manufacturer. The use of Eye-Fi cards may not be available outside the United States and Canada; please contact the card manufacturer for territory availability.\n\n\nShooting Made Easy \nCompatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses. \nEF & EF-S Lenses\nThe EOS Rebel T3 is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L Series lenses, and Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer technology are featured in select lenses to minimize the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS Rebel T3. \n\n\nWhat's In The Box \n\n\u00b7 EOS Rebel T3 Body\n\n\u00b7 EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Type II Lens\n\n\u00b7 Eyecup EF\n\n\u00b7 Wide Strap EW-200DB\n\n\u00b7 Interface Cable IFC-130U\n\n\u00b7 Battery Pack LP-E10\n\n\u00b7 Battery Charger LC-E10\n\n\u00b7 EOS Digital Solution Disk and Instruction Manuals \u201cGreat photography is Easy \u201cBooklet and \u201cDo More with Macro \u201cBooklet",
