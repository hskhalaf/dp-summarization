A weed an inch across may take 30 seconds to burn to ash. A weed two inches across maybe 90 seconds. I've found that I'm better off just scuffing the tops of the weeds off of the roots with my shoe as they emerge. If you seriously need a propane torch I'd suggest getting one that connects to a large propane tank. That's what our city crews use. They put out 20 times the heat and can seriously take down weeds along the sidewalk, etc.",
