My dorm room is very small and I don't even take it past the \"starting\" volume. I already know it can be heard through the walls! It's awesome! Great product and I highly recommend!",

It does it with my iPod and iPad so it's not a setting issue. Just to be sure, I reset everything and it still does it. Unfortunately, amazon will only give a partial refund with shipping at my cost. $100.00 paperweight! Extremely disappointed and won't but ant electronics from amazon again due to this horrible return policy!",
