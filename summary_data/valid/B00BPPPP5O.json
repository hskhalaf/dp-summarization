It would have taken just as long to sew the panels on with a sewing machine, and then maybe they wouldn't be torn. Plus two panels only covered one half of the window. As a temporary fix, I covered the other side with a cheap blackout curtain from Walmart. Now I wish I'd done that on both sides; it cost under $10 and worked better than these panels without damaging anything.",

      "text": "I put these up in my daughter's room using a tension rod behind her regular curtains. They block a good amount of light, which helps for little kids' bedtimes when it's still light outside in the summer. They came with hooks to attach to the existing curtains, too. I like that they are the shorter length (length of the window itself) - they block more light because they fit the window more accurately. I tuck them around the side of the mini blinds to help keep them in place since they're a bit rigid. I imagine they'll wear in a bit and fall more smoothly as time goes on. There was no strange smell to them.",

I actually got these to put behind yellow eclipse curtains that did a terrible job at blocking out light. So, they were the same brand curtains I was putting them up against with very different widths. See the attached photo with the thermaliner laying on top of my curtain. I honestly think I would have been better off buying another set of the yellow eclipse curtains and just double up hanging them. Save yourself some trouble and use curtain clip rings to hang the curtains. I just clipped the curtains on and didn't have to even mess with the hooks they give you.",
