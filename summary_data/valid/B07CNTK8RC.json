We were really skeptical for the grinding of the coffee and everything combined thinking that they\u2019re were going to be ground all in it but it was one of the best cups of coffee we\u2019ve ever had! We like how small and compact it is and if we ever have friends over and need to make more the entire machine is able to be completely cleaned and brewing again within less than a minute! It\u2019s so easy my 6 year old can do it!",

The grinder/filter is so small that it only brews very week coffee. Although there is a dial for intensity, it doesn't grind enough coffee for a medium or strong brew. Very disappointed.

I'd already been through three coffee makers that ended up being too big, too noisy, and one brand that broke twice in six months. I like freshly-brewed coffee (as opposed to K-cups) and have a special blend of two different kinds brewed together. It's delicious every time. One pot is perfect for 1 or 2 people who don't use gigantic mugs. So easy to clean, so quiet when brewing or beeping. Haven't used the grinder yet, but I have no doubt it will be just fine.The Vivante Mini Brew Coffee Maker is perfect for me!",

If you're looking for a coffee maker (for 2 US cups; 4 European cups) and you're going to use the grinder for whole beans, seek out the Cuisinart. Viante needs to increase the grind time as no matter the amount of coffee beans; it will only grind half, so two stars. The flavor is four stars because if the coffee I chose, not the machine; and it is easy to clean.",
