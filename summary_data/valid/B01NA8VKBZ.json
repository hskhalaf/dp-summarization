      "verdict": "Overall, the response for the New Balance 1340 v3 was mixed. While many runners enjoyed this stability shoe\u2019s agreeable fit, comfortable platform, and easy-to-secure shoelaces, others criticized its build-quality and its weight. Some people also believed that the in-shoe experience was stiff. When it received praise, the 1340 v3 was painted in grace, but when it was panned, it seemed an entirely different shoe. Suffice it to say that to try it out first before purchasing would be a wise decision.",

        "The shoelaces were lauded for being elastic and easy to secure",

This one seemed like a good bet (considering its substantial midsole arch support) but I got a massive blister on my left pinky toe after my first 5-mile run with it. I figured it needed to be broken in and my feet needed to get used to it so I've attempted to transition it into my workouts these last few months and it still provides pain on my left foot's left side. The pain also manifests itself even when I wear them to get groceries and other errands. I'll be switching back to my tried and true fried - Asics.",

I do not recommend this shoe if you are running on concrete because the shoe is pretty bulky, even if the size and fit are correct. The shoe is okay for jogging (not running). It\u2019s great for hiking on trails because the bulky bottom adds comfort stepping on jagged rocks.",
