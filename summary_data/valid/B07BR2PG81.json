The company emailed me to find out if I\u2019m satisfied with the bracelet, which I am ( except for size). I explained my issue ( not their fault, but mine) and they offered to send me a new bracelet in the new size. This is a rare company that truly values their customers and I appreciate them going over and above what is expected.",

I received it today and it will not fit my wrist nor even come Close to going over my hand. I really wanted this bracelet. Is there away to get one that is bigger and has more beads so it can fit on my wrist because it\u2019s outstanding quality. Or another one so I can combine the two. I\u2019m super sad because I was excited for this because the company told me it would fit a 9 inch wrist and it won\u2019t :( need help.",

Seems sturdier than elastic but the extra length dangles on my wrist. Also it seems to loosen on its own which I don\u2019t think I love.",
