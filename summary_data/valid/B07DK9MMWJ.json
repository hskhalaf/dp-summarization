Great learning tools for kids - remembering what to do for which color eyes is a good skill. And nurturing the \"pet\" is a really important lesson. The dance party setting is great! We are having a blast playing with this toy. I can definitely see this being the hot toy this year. Edit: changed from 5 to 3 stars. 3 days after getting it, the battery died. I replaced it and it is not working nearly as well. Flashing in and out with weird sounds. Very disappointing.",
