The only reason to give them 4 stars and not 5 is that I do get bags (I have ordered several) where a number of the cubes are a bit busted up. Chances are that has happened in shipping and handling, not a fault of the manufacturer. I will keep ordering these as long as we own any rabbits. I would recommend them for rabbit owners, but remember these are a treat and not to be used in place of a regular diet of pellets and greens.",

They lost interest after less than a day and I had to give them Timothy hay to keep them alive. Don\u2019t waste your money on this compressed junk.",
