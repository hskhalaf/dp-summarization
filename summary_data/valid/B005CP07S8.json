      "text": "Like the others have said, this is an amazing deal (thanks Amazon). It appears to be a 1-off guitar from Schecter, very close to their Damien Elite-6 model, but with a special inlay in the neck. The pickups are great, the overal fit & finish is top notch. Mine has a little buzz but just needs a little relief in the neck. If you've never tried the EMG 85/81, get this and enjoy!",

Purchased this guitar on Christmas Day for a ridiculously low price so I had my reservations. The guitar arrived and I was blown away. First off it looks great, sounds great and plays really really well. I would have never ended up with Schecter had the price not been this low but I would not think twice before buying another Schecter now. Oh and the guitar arrived set up perfectly for me.",

      "text": "I have to admit, although there may be a bit of an issue with the curvature of the neck, perhaps from expansion and contraction of wood, customer service at Schecter have been nothing short of spectacular trying to help me work out the buzzing on this one fret!!! Finish is gorgeous... not exact book match of the grain on the front of the guitar, which I am a bit of a sticker about, but pretty nonetheless. Overall, a great buy!",

After that it plays like butter,frets were perfect so no need to get the files out. Its well made from high quality components,Easily the steal of 2011...thanks Amazon for your great price and service.",

      "text": "This guitar is absolutely beautiful. The picture is slightly misleading, as it is not as bright red as it shows, but nothing to worry about. And if the inlays seem too flashy, no worries, they look perfect in person. As for tone, out of the box, no amp or anything, sounds amazing. Crisp, clear tone. Through an amp, clean sounds amazing, and with distortion, this guitar is ready to burn down anything you want with its perfect shredability. The neck is thin, easy to play, and the guitar is very light. Perfect for what ever you want to play. I recommend a Line 6 Spyder amp to play on. 100/5 stars no doubt.",

I have an 8 string schecter and they both are awesome. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!",

That guitar retails for $729 but practically can be purchased for ~$500. So, I was intrigued to see this at $244 and promptly ordered one. When I received it, I can say this is the best guitar I have ever owned. Very nice and it sounds fantastic. The flame inlay is a lot more subdued than the pictures show. Much more smokey looking as I think one other reviewer stated. The EMG pickups kick butt. Quality is incredible. Overall, I think I am now officially a Schecter fan.",

The active EMG's alone are worth $200.",

We tried different amps, different heads and different cabs but it would not go away.",

The emg's give you every bit of what you would expect from an active pickup, they sound truly great. You won't regret buying this....",

The surface all arround the neck is not flat at all, it has little small holes that can not be seen in the pictures of the products. It seems like the maple had bubbles and when was cut and sand the litles holes were not filled. The sound is great and I dont know if this could be affected by those 2 observation in the future.
