Compared to the modern electric razor, it gives you more sharp and clean hair-cut result without giving you razor bumps if used properly. This razor is made from China and the quality is superb-especially considering it's cheap price. The wooden body part is made of fine wood which you can definitely feel it and the steel blade is sharp enough to cut the most detailed and ingrown part of the hair. It has a hollow area in between the wood so it gives much more hygienic feeling keeping it stored.",

After studying the offers, I chose the brand Zertone, because it has the optimal combination of price and quality, judging by the reviews. The razor came to me very quickly, just a day later, despite the General delays in delivery. The razor has a good comfortable case made of soft, moisture-resistant leatherette. In my case, the handle of the razor is made of natural wood. Sharpening the razor immediately allowed you to shave. The quality of steel corresponds to the declared one. There are no chips or rust marks on the blade. I recommend buying for all lovers of classic shaving.",

If you are expecting this to be ready right out of the box you are going to be dissapointed. That being said it is still extremely sharp and will be shave ready with a little bit more sharpening and a go over with a stromp. Most straight razors will run in the +$100 range, which is a pretty big gamble if you have never used a straight razor before. So at this price point I would definitely reccomend this razor to someone who is considering trying it out. However if you do get this learn how to stromp.",

      "text": "I have two more of these in my cart already! I have a professionally honed Dovo Best Quality razor I\u2019ve been using for several years. I bought one of these to have stopped and handy razor for a quick shave and to practice honing razors. Mine required no honing! I hit the linen 25 laps and 50 on the leather and test shaved. Not terrible but not awesome. Went 25 laps on the diamond paste linen, bare linen, and then leather. Shaved fine! No real noticeable difference between this and my Dovo razor. The spine is a little crooked but it closes fine and shaved well. Great value!",

Was sharp enough to shave straight out of the box and polished to an almost mirror finish. Great price and a great product!",
