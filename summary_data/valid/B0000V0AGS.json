      "text": "I was very happily pleased when this arrived -- it seems designed to last a long time, is relatively lightweight, easy to hold and use, and picks up whatever I want, weight limited, of course. All the materials seem first-rate. One caveat -- The 36\" length is sometimes awkward and a little too long, but I can't complain about the reach it provides. I also have a shorter grabber by another brand, and it is easier to navigate, but doesn't have the reach, of course, nor the robust build of this grabber. It will pick up a half-gallon container, but needs two hands on the pole as the weight at the end of 36\" is very heavy.",
