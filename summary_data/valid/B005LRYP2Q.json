I've had them for years and, although they're not as sharp as they were in the beginning (beware how you handle them when you first get them) they are still great.

The serrated edge also will keep them sharp for a really long time and i never had to resharpen them despite daily use. I have been eating with expensive steak knives too, but these Victorinox knives beat them all. Additionally, they also add a colourful touch on the table.

They are easy to hold and I love the curved tips so I don't cut myself when using or hand-washing them. They are very sharp and cut through meat, vegetables, fruit and bread with very little effort. I love the bright colors too!",
