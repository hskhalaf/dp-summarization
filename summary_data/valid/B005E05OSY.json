Assembly was fairly easy and for the most part intuitive, and having a video available on Amazon was a nice plus. However, there are some aspects of the instructions that could be improved to be consistent with the newer design. I discovered this at the tail end of the installation that caused me some delays amidst the excitement of anxious boys. This is the only reason why I gave it 4/5 stars. Otherwise, it's a great value for the money.",

Everyone agrees it\u2019s a \u201creally nice one\u201d. My 11 year old son & his friends love it! Have to force my adult nephews to give the younger kids a turn. LoL...

The basket rings broke after 2nd day of usage. customer service was not helpful in resolving the issue, instead i was told i will be contacted at a later date which never happened until i called again and was told the same thing again.",

After all was said and done it is a nice product when it has all the pieces properly packaged.",
