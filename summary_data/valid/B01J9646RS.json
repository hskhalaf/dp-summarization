So when u throw food down it, the bag doesn\u2019t slide causing food to go outside the garbage bag. I love it\u2019s stainless steel touch and all. They recommend u buy their bags but I didn\u2019t. I have a whole box of garbage bags I bought from Costco the 13 gallon bags, and they work just fine. This garbage can is durable, stainless steel and much reliable when it comes to reducing a smelly garbage and food outside of the bag. It\u2019s worth the money! Hope I helped :)",

We had to soak it upside down in vinegar and water to get rid of the smell and now the lid makes loud irritating sounds upon opening and slowly closing. It will only happen again over time until I give up and buy a new- and different- can. Lesson learned- no plastic parts.",

Regardless, after a month or two, when the lid is automatically closing, it will begin making a grinding crunching noise. It will eventually get so bad that the lid may not close without help. What's going on is friction in the rotation point, where the lid connects to the base. All you need to do is spray both spots with a little graphite spray (other plastic-safe lubricants might work too), and it stops grunching at you. Otherwise, it's a great trashcan.",

After having an automatic lid stainless steel trash can for the last 5 years, I'm happy to move to one without an automatic open (they always break). This can opens with a simple push of the foot (or you can just lift it open) and has a soft close once released. The top surface of the can is stainless steel and when you open it, the round ring that holds the liner in place stays attached. This makes for a very easy liner change. The large opening makes it easy to pull the full bag out. I appreciate so many practical things about this can...it also has a 10 year warranty!",

Unfortunately, he became quite I'll after eating lobster tails and it took him almost one week to recover. I immediately began my quest for a trashcan that not only looked good in our kitchen, but one that he could not get into. After searching and reading multiple reviews, I purchased this can. IT IS AMAZING! Number one, the smell stays in the can which is fabulous. Number two, he cannot lift the lid! Believe me he has tried and is not able! I am so pleased with this purchase!!!",
