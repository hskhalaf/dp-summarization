      "text": "MUST BUY ! This is one of the best Waffle Maker I had ever owned. And even I am using it in Singapore (yes, with a power transformer) it makes the effort worthwhile as it makes the best waffle. We have a situation in which the temperature control is imperative to our use. My spouse likes white color waffle, my mother like it medium and for me, I like it crispy. So, its a one maker for all happiness. The non-stick surface is also great, and with little oil for first use, it works well. Would recommend to anyone.",

I recently decided I wanted one again so indecided to look and I was thrilled to find this inexpensive, ceramic one. It really is non stick and no chemical smell bc no teflon coating. Wipes clean easily and makes delicious waffles. Easy to use and the settings give you soft or nice crisp waffles. I read the reviews and I'm glad I ignored the few bad reviews. This is a great waffle iron! I've used it about 5 times now.",

      "text": "I bought this to replace a $60 Cuisinart Belgian waffle maker. When I first received this one I was worried it would be too small for my family of 5, but it cranks out waffles so quickly that no one really waits to eat. Plus, the smaller size makes it easy to clean. The best part is that I paid around $20. I did see it on sale for even less - about $15 or so. The test will be to see if it lasts as long as the old one. That one lasted 12 years.",
