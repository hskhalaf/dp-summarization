I sent the blue one back for a replacement. That is the reason for my 3 star review. It was a hassel to have to exchange one. If they were all like the red one I would have given 5 stars.",

They are smooth to the touch and somewhat soft, but most importantly really buoyant. We've taken them to the subdivision pool and the river, and they held up great on all adventures, being drug along, pounced on, tossed on riverbanks...mud wipes away with a simple dip into the water. Super fun noodle!",

They get put away in the shed every night - never stored outside - yesterday we noticed two out of the 4 are ripping at the seam - the red one was $39.37 and the blue was $32.13 - the 2 green ones seem to be holding up okay right now. For the cost of them they shouldn't be breaking after one months use. I would like to either get a reimbursement or have new ones shipped to me - we'll see if the company has customer service. I sure hope so.",
