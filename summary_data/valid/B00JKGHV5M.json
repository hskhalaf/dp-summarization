Strange issues. If you get one that is all there and functional then it will work fine. But the quality is really really poor for the price. I sent both sets back.",

We have 3 girls and there\u2019s not a peep from them when traveling. A lot of people complained about them not working. Be sure to check the fuse inside the cigarette lighter plug in (power plug) We did have to replace that but other then that they both work great. I have black leather interior and it\u2019s amazing at how well it matches. Headphones and remotes work awesome as well! Stop thinking and just buy them, you won\u2019t regret it either",

      "text": "It appears to me that most of the adverse reviews here are a result of people not understanding how to install the players, not understanding how to operate them, or not understanding that a headrest is a safety device in a vehicle, not a comfort device. I got them today, installed them using the spacers today, hooked them up today and my 5 year old son was watching DVD's by two o'clock this afternoon with his headphones. No complaints--especially at this price. No, I don't work for the company, for amazon, and I paid full price. I'm retired from the military and had no trouble following the directions although installation was so easy they really aren't necessary.",
