The knobs have about 270 degrees of movement, but only the first 5 degrees do anything. The burner is either full blast or ready to go out with a hair of movement on the knob. The burner \"adjustment\" knobs are completely useless, consider them binary(off/on)",

Very competent basic stove, I like it a lot and is a must if you have power outages (like California's power shutoffs). This classic Coleman stove does well.",

The grill lid not square when closed and the metal is getting thinner compared to older models. Hinges on the cover are super cheap, and feel like they will break after a good long year of use. Overall quality of coleman products I have brought they seem to be going cheaper and cheaper on how its built. Sad to say maybe check other brands that are better built.

I think I will upgrade to one that has both for next year because I found tht when grilling with the attachment piece it only gets hot where the burners are. The middle of the grill does not get enough heat.",

The flame was a bit more than I actually needed and there was no way I could turn it down and have it stay there. Having said that, it is still a very nice stove and served us well. Be sure and buy the propane bottles ahead of needing them as they were almost impossible to buy when the power went out.",

    "description": "Cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner on a dependable stove that packs up easily with the Coleman Classic Propane Gas Camping Stove. The 2 burners put out 20,000 total BTUs of grilling power and are shielded from the wind by adjustable wind-blocking panels. Rest assured, your stove will perform consistently even in extreme conditions thanks to the pressure regulator.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAbout Coleman More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.",
