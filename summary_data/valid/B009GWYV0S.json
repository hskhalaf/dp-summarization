      "text": "I'm am already at my third pair of AKG K495 NC. Each one has been breaking regularly at the same place every 3 months or so. This issue appears to be common among many costumers of the same product (look up 'cnet reviews AKG K495NC' on google) It's an amazing product as far as the acoustics. The problem I'm experiencing is however a design flaw of the headphones which causes the plastic connector to break after 3-4 months of usage. I have been extremely gentle with these headphones and I realize that even a new pair would cause the same problem after 3-4 months due to fatigue stressing of the plastic.",

But I simply can't recommend this product. The extenders that allow you to adjust the position of the headphones is made of flimsy plastic that has a design flaw. I've gone through 2 replacements, despite being incredibly gentle with them. I close the extenders when not in use, and especially in the case, but that only extends the life of the headphones by a month or two.",

I ended up having to shell out for ANOTHER very expensive pair of headphones while I waited on the replacements. Now I only used these in my office and I take the Bose on the road. Given the high price I paid for these, the construction issues are really unconscionable.",

However these AKG phones sound so much better its hard to believe they are not more popular in the market. The fit and finish is outstanding. Wearing them for hours while working in the office is very comfortable. The sound. Wow. They are so clean, crisp and defined with just the right amount of bass. Quite amazing headphones with very good noise cancelling qualities. If you are serious about sound quality, these are the ones to buy.",

Read the reviews, Almost everyone has this same issue. I'm on my 3rd replacement from the manufacturer and all have had the same issue. Now the warranty period has expired (1 year) and they will no longer replace them. STAY AWAY FROM THESE HEADPHONES!! It doesn't matter how careful you are with them, they will fail.",

    "description": "Size:No Bluetooth capability| Color:Black\"Stylish, Well-Built With Excellent Fit And Finish\" As you probably already guessed, 'NC' stands for 'noise cancelling.' But it could also stand for 'no contest,' because when it comes to pure, undisturbed sound, the AKG K495 NC headphones deliver high-quality performance and active noise control that are second to none. \"The AKG K495 NCs are stylish, well-built headphones with excellent fit and finish,\" reports CNET.com in a February 13, 2012 review. \"They sound good, offer effective noise cancellation, and are rechargeable via USB. They also fold flat and come with a nice carrying case and can play without the noise cancellation engaged.\" Durable and easy to charge through a USB connection, these top-of-the-line headphones create a nearly perfect audio world; you get all of the sound that you want, but without the sound that you don't want. Although a charged battery is needed if you're using the noise canceling circuitry, don't worry if walk out of the house with your AKGs and you forgot to recharge. You can still use the K495 NC in 'passive mode' without the noise canceling circuitry, and they'll still sound superb.",
