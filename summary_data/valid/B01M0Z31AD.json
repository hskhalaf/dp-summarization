I have a horrible case of bruxism (sleep grinding) and bought this to help me because most products OTC are so thick they trigger my gag reflex. Because of the slim size and unique material of this mouthguard, it has been helping me finally get a night of sleep. I have chewed it up a bit, but it still works. I cut the excess off the corners and stuck it to the pressure points on my mouthguard to reinforce it. You guys should really consider making a product for bruxism. This is different than most other things. Thanks!",

That\u2019s definitely helpful. Things I recommend would be to use near boiling water, especially if remoulding. Have bright lighting, it\u2019s difficult to line up the guard bite pad without it. Or, better yet, go to your dentist! They\u2019ll do it right the first time! Lol",

This mold was slightly better, but still too tight. The material they use shrinks as it cools. For me, this was just too uncomfortable.

The only way I was anle to fit it somewhat comfortable was to trim the edges with kitchen scissors so that the edges wouldn't make such a sharp crease. I literally filed out the edges so that it won't cut the inside of my mouth. Finally, when I did wear it while doing grappling. I got accidentally kneed on the mouth \"luckily\" I was wearing the Sisu mouthguard. The edges of the moutb guard cut through the inside of my mouth. I don't like it. One star.",

My husband and I both do jiujitsu and he has a custom fit mouthguard from our dentist.

My 12yo son plays hockey and was intolerant of the typical plastic/gel mouthguard, as they were too bulky, obstructed his breathing and made it darn near impossible to drink water with the mouthguard in. With his SISU, I can understand him when he talks and I don\u2019t have to fight with him to get him to wear it. Unlike other kids on his team that chew on theirs half in/half out of their mouths, my son feels comfortable enough to keep his in his mouth the whole game.",

Ideal for soccer, hockey, roller derby, lacrosse, basketball, and other contact team sports, SISU mouthguards feature a wide bite pad, rounded edges for comfort, and easy mold-ability to ensure a perfect fit. All SISU guards can be quickly and easily molded (and re-molded) at home with hot water. At only 1.6mm thick, or 50 percent thinner than conventional mouthguards, players wearing the super slim Aero can talk, breathe and hydrate with the guard in-place. Scientifically engineered with Diffusix technology, the non-compressible, perforated guard material distributes forces over a larger area to reduce risk of dental injury during competition. Guard is compatible with braces, but a dental professional should be consulted for fitting (Sizes Medium and Large are recommended for all ages wearing braces). Available in three sizes: Small fits the mouths of children ages 7-10, or athletes up to 5 feet tall; Medium fits average mouths, or athletes between 5 feet and 6 feet tall; Large fits larger mouths, or athletes over 6 feet tall. SISU mouth guards are backed by a $35,000, one-year limited dental warranty. Guard is free of BPA, PVC, phthalates, and latex. Made in the USA.",
