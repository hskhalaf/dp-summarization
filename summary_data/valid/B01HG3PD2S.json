Instructions were pretty straight forward, took maybe an hour to get tire and chain on, set correct seat length and handle bars correctly aligned. Took it out for a short but quick ride (about 5 miles) and no issues, shocks absorbed potholes, curbs, etc. gears shift well and plenty of coasting on flat roads/sidewalks.",

The bike is easy to put together comes with tools. It is a little on heavy side , but not bad for entry level seems well built. I have had on one trail so far its great. would buy again.",
