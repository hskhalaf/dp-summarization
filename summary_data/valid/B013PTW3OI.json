My wife suggested I try these, and they work! I don't put them into my gloves, I put them into the whole bag and try to move them around once or twice before I skate again. The amount of stench they remove is really impressive. The company's customer service is also outstanding. Highly recommended!",

They are easy to use. When the boys take off their gloves they put the stixs in right away - also helps to make sure a glove isn't left behind. We had something already for their cleats, but when that wears out we will definitely be purchasing a set for them as well. Love that they have replaceable inserts, they are non-toxic and do not smell. We don't use artificial fragrances in our house so these are perfect for us!",
