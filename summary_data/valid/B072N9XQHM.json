If there was some \"tabs/tangs\" on the part that inserts into the outlet to provide some resistance to removing them, that would at least make it harder for them to remove. As it stands these are useless because they are so easily removed by a toddler.",

I watched him attack a outlet for 2 minutes and he didn't even come remotely close to being able to pull them out of the socket. My second concern was the quality of the plugs, if they were cheap the prongs could easily snap off in my outlet upon removal. However, these seem to be made pretty well, and after continuously removing one it never even cracked. Definitely going to order some more for the rest of my house, and worth spending the few extra $$ over the super cheap ones on amazon.",

In some cases, where there is no threat of rain or snow reaching the wiring much, I omit the tape. These are sturdy, durable and extend plenty over the outlet areas. Very good purchase.",

This product too easily slides in and can be pulled out easily...almost falls out. This is a hazard and I would not recommend for anyone wishing to protect their children. UPDATE: JOOL Reached out and their Customer Service Department took care of the problem. Excellent response! I upgraded my review from 1 Star to 4 Stars as a result",
