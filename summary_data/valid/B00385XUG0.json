This should be part of the shop listing since these are such common devices.",

Then I have DISH network, Amazon, Roku and more and this remote won't come close to efficiently running any of them. Great idea but a total waste of money.",

      "text": "Nobody does universal remotes like Sony. I had some doubts after reading negative reviews, but got it anyway because my AV receiver is Sony, and I'm very glad I did. I had no problem programming my 7 devices, and most functions I need work right out of the box, especially on the Motorola DVR cable box. I was surprised to see how little I had to manually program using the learning function, which works just as well as it did on my old Sony RM-VL900. The only drawback is - the last device selected in a system control sequence is not remembered, reverting back to the pre-sequence selection, but I can live with that. Highly recommended.",

It seems cumbersome at first but you learn the buttons fairly quickly with everyday use. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to eliminate using multiple remotes.",

Now I can control my cable box and TV, and automatically control the sound bar for audio. It's very nice, and worth the price difference in remotes.

It never failed to perform. Aside from that it's an attractive piece of engineering, feels good in the hand and is light and comfortable. The keys are back-lit as well, which helps. It's a Sony, after all, and worth the slightly higher price than some others in the market.",

Great remote for the buck. But it is not nearly as easy to program as is the earlier remotes. More buttons and more steps to assign each. Took twice as long to set up. But once it is set up (recommend using the learning function to do it) then it is a pretty slick remote which rivals those costing 3 times as much. Just dont lose the original remotes and keep the instructions handy. (which are pretty easy to read)",
