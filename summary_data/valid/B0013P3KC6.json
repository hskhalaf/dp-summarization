Also, after others mentioned, I noticed that it really doesn't dissolve in my coffee, but stays in a pile at the bottom and it isn't as sweet. I'll stick to the Xyla brand, which is made from birch, made in Finland, is sweeter and does not have as much of a laxative effect as this brand. :(",

She has a much easier time using 1 simple TV remote control than the confusion of an xfinity remote with 2 power buttons, separate volume and power/ channel controls, etc. Comes with nice long coax cable and all connections to fit any TV you may have. We're getting another to replace the attic antenna for our own TV. Excellent quality.",

I had to grind it in my coffee grinder to get it pulverized which of course never does the greatest job in getting things to a powder. So its great for xylitol granules.

I started off slowly as I do have a sensitivity to this product, but have now switched completely to use in my tea and homemade chocolates without an issue. The taste is much more pleasing than stevias, which can be very bitter, this stuff you can practically eat out of the bag.",
