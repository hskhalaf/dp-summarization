      "text": "I bought this even though several reviewers said material is flimsy and screws/nuts system didn't fit part of the time. I was desperate for carrier this size for my senior cat. All of the above was true, so after taking her in it twice, I went to Home Depot, bought a package of 4 Everbilt metal wing nuts size #10-24 and a package of 5 Everbilt machine screws round head combo #10-24 x 1-1/2 inch. Zinc plated. Just finished taking originals out and replacing with these which fit perfectly and can be tightened down. Less than $3.50 fix. Dawn",

Had I purchased this for a dog or cat, I would have absolutely had to return it. The only reason I'm not returning it is because I purchased it for my guinea pigs visits to the veterinarian and I won't have time to return it and order another one before their next appointment. I read the reviews before I purchased it so maybe I just got a defective one. It also had sticky stuff all over the outside but it cleaned easily enough.",

I am very pleased with these carriers, the only reason I gave them a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because mine came with moths. I now have a moderate moth infestation that is not very pleasant. I would suggest unpacking your carriers outside to prevent this problem. Otherwise, the carriers are great!",
