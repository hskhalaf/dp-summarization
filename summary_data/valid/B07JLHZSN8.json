Moreover, its grippy outsole and lightness score well with those who have used it during a trip.On the other hand, the boot\u2019s toe box is a cause of concern for some for being too restrictive. Overall, the Columbia Crestwood Mid Waterproof may be an excellent pair to take outdoors because of its set of strengths, as long as users get past its narrow construction.",

The are EXTREMELY comfortable and required very little (none really) break in time. I wore them around the house for about 8 hours to make sure they fit well and were comfortable and they barely fatigued my feet at all. These are well worth the money and a lot more comfortable than the Merrel\u2019s I\u2019ve tried which have a much higher arch and less cushion. If I can catch them on sale again I will definitely get a second pair. Highly recommended.",

After reading the reviews, I purchased this product one size larger, in wide, than I do for all other footwear thinking that it would be fine. When I first tried them on, they were very snug with a rather thin sock but I assumed it would stretch as time has went by. That has not happened and my toes are pinched. I don't think that you can go wrong with price or quality of this product but the sizing is something to consider. I'd suggest, at minimum, to go up 1.5 sizes larger than you usually purchase.",
