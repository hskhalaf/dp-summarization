Disappointed by this, I tried contacted Blitzu through their site. No response. Sent them a Facebook message. No response.

They are easier to get on than they look and despite the thickness (which by itself is a really good support feature). However most of all, they do not cut my circulation off below the knees or pinch my skin!!! Huge plus there! They are also great for working out at the gym and after swimming aerobics. Just ordered two more pair (and the color choices are a treat). Thanks So Much!!!",

If I really stretch them, I can get them to the proper knee height, but I'm concerned that they might not stay there. If you have had trouble with compression socks being too long - bunching behind your knees - these will be perfect for you.",
