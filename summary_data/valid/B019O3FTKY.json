Stunning color. Reminds me of the pastel colors of the classic cars from the 50s. Very retro. Quality is good too. Looks high quality. The size is perfect as well. Not too big or small. It is ceramic though, so if it falls or isn\u2019t handled properly it will break. But that\u2019s common sense.",

The only reason I docked a star is because of the seals. One of the seals was not properly attached but I was able to tear it off and replace it correctly.
