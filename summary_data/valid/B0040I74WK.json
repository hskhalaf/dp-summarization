They felt like they lost their child and I know how that feels. Their are no words to provide the comfort they need but I wanted to give them something to help them eventually remember all the good things and for the pain to lessen. Everyone who is suffering loss, needs friends and family to acknowledge their pain. I added the name Zoe on the item and it sits on their mantel. It was the perfect gift and not out of the ballpark costs. Thanks",

It also has a hook on the back for those who would like to hang it on a wall near a furbaby's picture. We couldn't be happier with this purchase. UPDATE: 10/18 Four years later and still holding up nicely. We DID have to darken the pawprint and writing with dark paint as there was some fading. Otherwise, perfect.",

I'm not sure what's it's made of, perhaps a heavy plaster, but it's sturdy and large enough for a good display. I'm giving this to a friend who lost her dog this year. I know it will touch her as much as it touched me. Comes in a sturdy box with styrofoam to protect it :)",
