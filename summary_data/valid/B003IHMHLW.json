Came with all mounting hardware, which the description probably said, and I assumed, but the winch I also bought with it didn't come with any hardware so I was worried. Installed easy on 16' Continental trailer. Helps me move a 14' Panga around easily and attach a hitch solo now. Will update the review if it seems to corrode quicker than acceptable.",

This tongue jack was easy to install, included the hardware, (yes, some local stores were selling it w/out hardware - had to buy it for more $$!) and it does the job for me. Easy to roll around in the grass and on blacktop, wheel locks in place when up and down, and I can adjust the height with ease. Read many reviews before I ordered it and decided there were more pro reviews than con ones. Add mine to the pro list!",

I have a stock chevy silverado truck, and I had to place this jack way back on the tongue of the trailer in order to raise it just above the ball hitch. In uneven ground, I may have to lift it slightly by hand due to the height difference. However, still a good buy for my snowmobile trailer and cheap!",
