      "text": "I've looked all over for affordable kitchen towels that are both absorbent and durable. This is exactly what I've been looking for! I use them primarily for hand towels and occasionally for drying dishes or cleaning up a spill. They absorb so much they barely feel wet even after washing and drying my hands several times in a short amount of time. They are also larger than I envisioned, which I love. They don't fall off the stove handle where I drape them or get soaked as quickly as a result. I've also had no fraying, holes, or broken hems from washing. I recommend these towels to everyone.",

I use a little Oxy Clean for stubborn stains, but they held up well. I recently repainted and changed my color scheme so I wanted new colors. I was happy that they came in the colors I wanted. The oversized aspect makes them easy to use for many purposes. The older orange towels will stay in the lining closet for other household uses than the kitchen.",

They do not leave much lint when used to dry dishes. My favorite feature of these towels is their extra-large size, even after they shrink in the wash. Be aware that they do shrink because they are made from cotton. They are medium-thick, which is perfect for most if my kitchen needs (drying dishes, using as a hot mitt, etc.)",

I haven\u2019t had them long but I hope they will last.",
