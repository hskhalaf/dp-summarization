I love Apple design but their stupid focus on making laptops thin at the cost of usability is, well, wearing thin. The sheer number of dongles one needs makes it an ugly situation thanks to Apple. However these devices from Charjen Pro are beautifully designed to complement the MacBook Pro and let me plug many of the daily use things in through one USB C port. I\u2019m told the current model hub is somewhat improved over the first version I bought. The company\u2019s people are customer service focused. I\u2019ve ordered the new one and will update the review based on how it works out.",

      "text": "All of the ports function as advertised and port selection is excellent. Appearance is great and outgoing USB-C connecting wire is heavy-duty. No problems with ports thus far. My only wish is that it also included an RJ-45 port for wired network connection. However, in order to add such a port, the footprint would have to be larger and the device half-again as thick as it is, at least, where the RJ-45 port was located.",
