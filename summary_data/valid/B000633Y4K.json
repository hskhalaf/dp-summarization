He likes his Kong toys for play, but he's an enthusiastic chewer so we needed something to satisfy that urge (besides socks, pillows. etc.!). I ordered this and he loves it. He immediately hunkered down and started working on it. We've had it for weeks now and he has hardly made a dent in the bone. He chews it every day. Very satisfied and will definitely re-order this product.",

When we looked down, a large, SHARP chip had come out and the bone had split a little way down from there. Had she ingested this chip, there\u2019s no telling what it would have done to her insides. Upon looking at the bone further, it is split just down from the chip and now unusable. Be very careful if you use these!",

I do not consider him to be a major chewer. you need to keep an eye on the bone, and check for splinters. perhaps other dogs are ok with this bone, but it's not for my little guy.",

      "text": "Dog loves this bone. He got most of the filling out by himself and what he couldn't reach, I picked out for him since it was getting mega gross. He still plays with the bone, too. It's a sturdy bone, which I am most happy about. He cannot break it and has only managed to deal a small amount of damage to it. Also, you can fill the bone with peanut butter, except not me because my dog hates peanut butter. At less than $10 I think it's a great value for destructo doggies like my 1 year old Lab mix.",

I had them packaged for return shipping within five minutes of receiving the package.

We've gone through about 6 so far, I've never seen them splinter or crack despite heavy chewing. Our pup will even just lick/chew on them when they aren't full of treats.",
