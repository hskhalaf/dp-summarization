I've attached a picture. Nevertheless, I can get in and out of the bathroom and use the toilet comfortably, so I'm happy. The toilet is easy to use, and best of all, I only have a gray tank to empty.

I was worried about back draft on my mobile application. Additionally I had to buy a mushroom vent that didn't come with the kit. For the price I paid everything should have been included. It does work though, and my poop doesn't stink. Clean it with a little vinegar and you're good to go.",

I also sealed the hole in the floor flange with a 4\" plastic plug from Lowes, and sealed it with some caulk. Space was bit tight in our installation, but we're satisfied with the end result. It's nice that the fan cord unplugs so that we can disconnect when not in active use.",

      "text": "Used in a converted cargo trailer (\"Full detailed review on YouTube, search \"Texas Tramper\"). Works GREAT!! However, I'm in South Texas heat and humidity so gnats are a BIG problem IF fan in unit is not running! Must ALWAYS keep fan in unit running. Absolutely no odor. Because it isn't used daily, I dump urine bottle at the end of every weekend. Purchased a spare bottle so as to take one home to dump and clean while the other is installed for use. Definitely a learning curve - for women too - in getting good at hitting the front two holes. for suggestions, watch my YouTube video. Feel free to ask any questions.",

    "description": "The Nature's Head Composting Toilet is the latest design, the best value, and the most reliable choice for portable, self contained, urine separating dry toilets -- on the water, on the land, or on the road.\" \"This toilet or head, (the marine term for toilet) was designed by two long time sailors who sought to create a more user friendly version than anything else on the market. While we designed our product to withstand the harsh marine environment, it can be used anywhere you need a toilet, especially anywhere that plumbing or electricity is difficult or non-existent -- on RVs or campers, in vacation cabins, workshops, barns, yurts, even trucks. Most importantly, this toilet doesn't have the foul odors associated with all other holding tank systems. The low volume air circulation fan built into the head provides the added benefit of recycling the air in your bathroom which helps make your whole environment smell better. Because it was originally designed for marine use, its rugged design and materials (all stainless hardware) it has been proven to be extremely durable no matter what your environment.",
