Unfortunately, when you turn down the volume it makes a loud clicking sound and can wake baby.",

We had an issue with the battery not charging at first, but I requested a return and received the replacement before I even had time to send the faulty one back. But the best part is it's durability- 10 days ago I misplaced it, but yesterday I went for a walk and found it on the sidewalk, I must have left it on the roof of the car. It's been lying in the rain for more than a week and still works perfectly! I'm amazed! Highly recommend this to any parent who's baby struggles to sleep.",

It\u2019s also cool that you can hook it up to Bluetooth and play other sounds or music. It has a pretty great battery life and I\u2019ve had no problems with its functionality so far.

Pro: small, blue tooth, hooks onto most things, soft if baby bumps it, works while plugged in, battery lasts for a few days use naps and through the night. The different setting and timer are great! The sounds are decent as well, we primarily used the rain noise. Con: when the battery starts to die it changes sounds every 5 seconds vs turning off waking everyone up (its pretty creepy in a deep sleep), short lifespan.. after 2 1/2 months use it randomly started rotating sounds, other than blue tooth its unusable for us.. which the rain sound was our primary use.",

Also, the thing to adjust the noise is really loud, wakes the baby up, which parents know is really an inconvenience. These two things are the biggest issue with this toy, I believe it can be fixed.

      "text": "We run this all night long since our baby sleeps in the adjacent room. We don't want to wake her up since we go to bed later and wake up earlier than she does. If that's you too, then I wouldn't recommend this product. The battery only lasts for about one night and two naps before it needs a recharge. I cannot use this consecutive nights or it dies. Also, none of the sounds are a true white noise. The second sound comes close enough for us, but most of the sounds are more along the lines of nature sounds.",
