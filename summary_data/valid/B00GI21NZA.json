You just brush it on and call it good. Highly recommend.",

The new brush is horrible and has completely ruined Anastasia's signature Eyebrow Gel. I do not recommend this product, it went from Hero to Zero!",

I frequently applied the gel to \"peach fuzz\" above my eyebrows, and it seems like there's always too much product on the brush.

Be sure to replace it in a timely fashion, however. After a few months of use, the bristles start to fall apart and the formula turns white and thick (probably from bacteria). I can't very well remove a star for this, as the same thing happens to any mascara-type product. Love this.",

However the color is vibrant (espresso) and goes on very even and smooth. It also gives the eyebrows a slightly glossy appearance, which I really like. Will definitely be buying again!",
