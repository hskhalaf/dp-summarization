With a ported rear speaker design the amount of bass is amazing when this titan is placed against a wall or in a corner. Highs are clear and the mid range is solid and not muddy. Battery life is insanely long and the speaker phone feature is a nice bonus. I've compared this to the model UE replaced this with and that speaker got returned the next day. Grab one of these while you still can. They don't make 'em like this anymore.",

That said, this speaker was relatively easy to set up, but only seems to be able to pair with 1 device. If I am able to pair it with a second device, then it no longer works with the first one. Seems to be very sturdy and well built. Easy to operate, and sound is adequate. It's an OK device for the price if you get it on sale as I did.",

I returned the Mobile Boombox (the previous model) for lack of volume, though I loved the clear, balanced sound; this updated model has more than enough volume for my purposes, and that trademark clarion UE sound.",

After hearing so much great reviews about it I decided to buy two of those for the Double Up function which is nice, but unfortunately the bass on those speakers don't sound that full. I used to have a JBL Charge that I sold in order to buy those, and the JBL have a better bass. Pos: Double Up function that allows two UE BOOMs to pair, they are small but with a good volume (not perfect, but good). Cons: Not full sound, they lack on bass. Some might find disturbing, but they don't come with charger. They charge through USB, but they come with an USB cable.",

The build quality feels very sturdy on this device, I like the use of micro USB for charging and the available app is a nice touch. I perceive the predecessor had a bit more bass where this speaker has more mids. Additionally, I miss the buttons to be able to skip a track directly on the device. You don't realize how valuable that feature is until it's gone.",

There are quite a few small Bluetooth speakers on the market, but after doing some research and reading Amazon reviews we chose to go with the UE mini boom over the JawBone. The music quality is awesome, much better than listening to music off our phone. It's obviously not as great as listening to music on our surround sound stereo, but that is/was expected when I purchased this! The size of this speaker is the best part! It's nice and compact, making it perfect to travel with! I definitely would recommend the UE mini boom, the price it also considerably less than the comparable JawBone!",
