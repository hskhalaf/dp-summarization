      "text": "I owned this camera for less than a year and used it alongside my three Canon DSLRs ( 5D, 7D, 10D). The camera failed and I sent it to Sony for repair but they concluded it was not repairable due to \"corrosion\". None of the Canon's have had a problem so I know the camera wasn't exposed to any harsh or unusually corrosive environments. This was a great and handy camera until it failed but from my experience I would be suspicious of the build quality and environmental protection of these cameras compared to more established brands like Canon. Warranty is only six months so as far as Sony are concerned this is not their problem.",

In the kayak especially, I can't be fussing around with tripod or monopod, I need to shoot as soon as I see a shot. The Sony RX10 IV gives me that capability, and excellent photographs.",

      "text": "Love this camera. Easily the best camera of any type in its price range. The focus is so fast, it feels instant. The 24-600mm zoom is so long it feels like it never quits, and the image stabilization keeps up with the long zoom. The focus limiter (infinity - 3m) is very useful. I love the small batteries. They are the same ones my Sony a6000 uses. Third party batteries are cheap. Buy them with a double charger. Look for \"B01HFOJUCW\". Criticisms: It weighs as much as my DSLR, but what do you expect with this huge zoom? I wish the 24mm wide angle was wider. The 4K video isn't well stabilized, shoot 1080p video instead.",

If you increase the ISO beyond 800... it could be lighter but very very grainy. So, I will try it at night with long exposure and I'll let you know.",
