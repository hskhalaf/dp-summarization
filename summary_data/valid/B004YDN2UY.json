The installation was simple (though awkward enough that a second pair of hands really helps), the instructions were clear, and the end product looks great. Our dog was crate-trained for almost two years before we converted to this crate, so we have no issues with him chewing or fighting the crate. We removed the plexiglass on the front door (though I think it's a great detail to include as optional). We leave the door open while we're home, and our dog often retreats to it on his own. I'm more content with this purchase than any other I've made in a long time.",

I'm using it as a den for her, not a crate, so I pried off the door, not an easy task but I'm quite happy with the results. The bed in there is from The Dogs Balls.)",

The sides of the crate are attached to the top and bottom with bolts and screws but they are not secured to the front and back panels at all. They simply slide into loose grooves on the front and back crate panels. This causes the crate to be a little wobbly, not enough for it to be a problem but enough that it is noticeable.",

It is so perfectly crafted and INCREDIBLY easy to set up. It is hard to find this kind of craftsmanship today! And, the Espresso color is lovely . . . we love everything about this crate for our Chocolate English Labrador! So well made! Also, this product was so well packaged that it was pretty much impossible to damage in shipping. I wish all companies packaged their products this way! Thank you Crown Pet Products!",
