It's a big inconvenience to have to wipe up the sink after every use. I know it seems like it wouldn't make a mess, but even when you rinse, your entire mouth is black and all the particles come out into the sink and needs to be washed away. If you don't do it immediately, it cakes on. It's gross. It also doesn't bubble. My toothbrush times 30 seconds per quadrant, after one, you're without bubbles and it feels dirty. I am going to have to toss this item in the trash.",

      "text": "This toothpaste is probably one if the best toothpastes I've tried so far. I've been ordering multiple charcoal based pastes since last year when I found out their benefits. This one, by far is a winner. It whitened my teeth on the first brush, noticeably. One thing to keep in mind is that this product is messy in terms of keeping your sink from looking like a horror movie scene, nevertheless I believe it looks cool. Very minimal taste if any and definitely deserves to be tried out if you're into the whole charcoal toothpaste craze.",

Charcoal is extremely messy and you have to clean your sink after every single time you brush your teeth. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but it splatters everywhere and I will find little tiny black dots on everything.",

      "text": "Was glad to find and have purchased it, and slightly doubtful this would do anything. But after using this toothpaste for few days the teeth became noticeably whiter. After 10 days, even more. Also noticed charcoal toothpaste leaves mouth cleaner and more pleasant feeling than other paste, even fluoride free. This probably applies to most charcoal tooth paste or tooth powders.",

I had to take one star off for the packaging, the tube is short and stout which makes it very difficult to get the last of the toothpaste out of the tube. Unfortunately because of the packaging, I will not be purchasing this again.",
