The knee or really under leg adjust part is ok and you have to adjust via a turn screw type lever below the chair. It can either lean back or lock from doing so with a large pin. Second Boss chair I have bought and they make a really good chair. Best part is NO fricking allen wrench to assemble and then get loose later as they all do.",

The wheel now is completely unattached, the arm broke when the chair fell over and threw me into the wall, and now the chair is unable to be used.

They wouldn't do anything but the manufacturer read my review shortly after, contacted me and sent me a replacement seat.

The seat also wobbles and the casters and other parts squeak. I believe the density and quality of the seat foam padding is not suitable and that is the problem.

I can remove the old gas lift mechanism with a screw driver and then put on the new gas lift and base! EXCELLENT customer service from the manufacturer!",

This Executive Leather Chair is a fake because of the leather cracking. After 18 months the armrest leather started cracking. This is not leather, is cheap plastic or vinyl material. The arm rests are cracking and deteriorating specially in the area were I rest my right elbow when I'm using my computer and the mouse. This was the price I paid for it: Boss Black LeatherPlus Executive Chair Sold by: Amazon.com LLC $155.99 Condition: New",

      "text": "The chair was great for the first few months, so much so I bought another one for my husband. But the cover fabric started to disintegrate not long after and it now constantly leaves little pieces of black plastics all over the floor. The threads are now showing and it's really uncomfortable and ugly. The base of the chair also makes really loud squeaky noise whenever I move (loud enough that people on the phone can hear it). Overall very poor value for the price.",

Tilts back more than the stated 20%. To get the tilt, make sure the height adjustment lever is pulled out. Would definitely recommend. Note - as stated, review is based on chair at time of purchase, not after longer term use",

That chair gave me noticable back pain from sitting for hours. I have to say after sitting down on this new boss leather chair I feel so relieved. It has LUMBAR support!! It feels so nice and it improves your posture because it forces u to sit in a up-right position rather than slouching your back. The installation was a breeze. Simply pull the top piece of the chair downward and it will snap into the lock behind the seating piece. Then place it on the wheel piece and you are set!",

Liberal use of WD40 inside the top of the base takes care of that for a long while. - There's only lean-on or lean-off, no locking the chair at specific angles. I wish it had this ability! - Not worth it at the list price of $360 in my opinion. Pick it up when it's on sale. I got mine for ~$160 and I'm a happy and comfortable camper.",

In fact, you don't need any screws or anything to assemble the chair; all you need is to put the pieces together. This is, of course, a plus for anyone not wanting to go through the whole LEGO/IKEA experience. But this causes the box to be rather big. Also, the chair is rather heavy, so you may need two persons to carry it.",
