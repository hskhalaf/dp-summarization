Just don't attach it to the tray until the baby's fingers are large enough not to fit in that gap.",

      "text": "I was so excited to purchase this and as an overall product it was a) easy to assemble and b) keeps my 5 month old content. HOWEVER, the owl pop up toy on the playstation is extremely dangerous for babies. My daughter got her finger stuck in the top of it simply by having her hand on top of it when she pushed down on the little tree arm. Her finger could have been broken but was only jammed. It was terrifying and definitely not something I want any other parents to have to endure. I highly recommend removing this owl, it is a safety hazard and Skip Hop should be careful with this addition.",

She gets some independence to practice standing on her own and rotating to different toys and she squeals and blows bubbles and yells at the cloud as she tries to get it in her mouth, it\u2019s hilarious to watch.

I'd say from a health standpoint that mold is definitely a health hazard. Also, pop-up toy is also a safely hazard as it traps little fingers when they grab at the owl. Since these seats are primarily used when a parent is in the same room but trying to do something like cook or do dishes and is only partially keeping and eye on the baby I'd say this safety hazard is too big to be worth it.",

Not the easiest thing to move between rooms. Sure you can click it apart but who wants to do that every time ya need to move it. If ya have narrow doorways keep this in mind. Wished hed loved it. Unfortunately not a win for this mama, but every kid is different. Update- moving to 4 stars because hes starting to find some interest! Kids toys are coming a long ways keep it up!",

She would grab the tube inward, put it in her mouth and loose her hands. The tube will spring back and hurt her mouth. We had to eventually remove that piece. She does the same thing to the lamb, yet the lamb is bulkier and she needs her hands to keep it in place. With the tube, she easily let it go and that's where the potential danger arises.",

They are very sturdy and tuck under the table if you\u2019re trying to save some space when they aren\u2019t being used. So happy they come in packs of two! As they are plastic they are super easy to clean, keep in mind they are white chairs so you\u2019re going to see everything on them right away but again they are super easy to wipe down!",

We haven't tried out the table functionality yet, but it looks like that'll work out well when our child grows older.",

The toys are entertaining and interesting for my baby and the piano makes sound at the vibration of him moving. Easy to clean and wash. Decently light to move around. I cannot stress enough how worth my money this was.",

I also liked that it could be used as a standing activity center (when he grows into that) and also a table with chairs after that (again when he grows into that). The little guy really does love playing in this activity center. Its a nice place to be able to entertain him while I wash dishes or fold laundry. I would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of item.",

He started to show signs of wanting to sit up and I wanted something to put him in to encourage being 'upright' while also allowing him to play. Its also a great break from holding him all the time! This design is great because its compact for a small apartment. I also like the colors, mostly white so its not too busy and matches our modern aesthetic. He loves it and has now been using it for 3 months.",
