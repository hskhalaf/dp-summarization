For one, unlike drug store shampoos or even high end shampoos you would find at places like Target, this shampoo doesn\u2019t have the fake silicone coating over your hair to give you \u201csilky\u201d hair, it actually has healthy and real ingredients that make your hair better over time. Also, it smells great, the quantity will last you months, and it has helped my hair gain more volume. I don\u2019t like to wash my hair everyday, and this shampoo helps a lot to keep it fresh and clean without looking greasy or flat.",

So far Suave coconut in the gold bottle seems to be the best buy for my hair, it leaves it soft, full of volume, and best of all it washes out of my hair, leaving it soft, for my baby fine hair I would go with it.",
