A tiny bit of tread noise when I hit the brakes hard, but nothing to write home about. We'll see how they hold up. Update: I put two more on the back of the truck and would NOT recommend them for back tires. I'm getting a dangerous amount of oversteer without a load or trailer and will be taking those off again. They still seem to be fine as steer tires, just not drive tires.",
