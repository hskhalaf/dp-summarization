Needless to say, as feisty as she is, her balance and mobility are not quite what they were before the accident. This bench is awesome because it allows her to seat her self at the outside edge of her bathtub and then swing herself in where she can operate a hand shower wand to bath herself. It is both sturdy and stable. Now there is no need for her to stand in a bath tub that is taunting her to take a slip and fall.",

Can be adjusted for right or left. It is easy for someone to help her bathe also. For her, this is superior to stepping over the 5 inch edge of a walk-in shower to sit on a chair.",

One has to be careful when handling the metal tubing as the holes are a bit sharp. I ended up getting my palm sliced into because of the ragged sharp edges of the holes in the metal pieces. Looks fine after my son finished putting it together.",

The chair is sturdy, and sits perfectly over the edge of my tub, but it's lightweight enough to easily move out of the way when someone else needs the bath. She's able to sit down and slide over, which is perfect since she can't lift her legs over the edge of the tub anymore. The only issue we have is that there is some water getting on the floor, but that's really unavoidable when you need to have someone else in there helping.",

You simply sit on the outside edge and then you can transfer your legs over the side of the tub using the handle to help. Once you are in the bathtub, the back on the chair helps a lot too. The only drawbacks are how to fix the shower curtain around the chair so it doesn't leak everywhere. I have been told that I need to cut my shower curtain to help with this issue but I cannot bring myself to do that. Also, you MUST have a hand held shower head in order to clean yourself everywhere.",

Cut your shower curtain to go in the first slot of the chair. Otherwise you will flood the bathroom. I have two curtains, I cut the inside curtain. This works like a charm. Good Luck.",
