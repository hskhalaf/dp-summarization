Her friends have the 40 minute scooters and wish they had 80. It goes up to 10 mph; that doesn't seem like a lot, but on a scooter it is. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to put it together. This is mostly assembled when you get it and \"idiot-proof\"; all you have to do is insert that handlebar rod into the base and you're done! Took maybe 5 minutes to do that. Highly recommend! Great price!",

When going up a slope, the scooter stops working, and the throttle dies. When I contacted the warranty department, they informed me that the scooter only works on a flat surface. Evidently, this disclaimer is buried somewhere (page 7 of the instruction manual) and not anywhere in their marketing material. If you live anywhere with a few slopes, don't waste your money.",

The scooter seems durable but if using on asphalt, like in a subdivision, it's a let down in the fact that the handlebars loosen out of alignment and have to continually be adjusted. I have tightened as tight as I can and they still loosen up. Best suited for smooth concrete surfaces.",
