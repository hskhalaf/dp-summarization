Also, if you are attempting to do amateur lobotomies, please report yourself to the local authorities. You also do not need a drill bit of this quality. A cheaper drill bit will work just fine. These are extremely ineffective as chopsticks, too short and too sharp. When inserted into a small gauge shotgun shell (20+ gauge) and viewed with a very high speed video camera, they will in fact rotate in mid-air but fail to have any accuracy. Also, this is a terrible idea. Please don't do this.",

The bits come in a strong sturdy case as well, great for keeping them organized, and will last for many years to come. Great accompaniment for any homeowner who owns a drill. *my only complaint is less than a week after purchase I saw this same item for a few dollars less at my big-orange-box-store. If you go there frequently, you may save a few dollars purchasing from there instead.. this in no way impacts my review of the item, because the drill bits themselves are great!",

Only negative I can report about this DeWalt kit is that the plastic case is a bit fragile--one of the 2 locking tabs broke immediately, but it still locks closed. I like the efficiency of the storage case--not a lot of wasted space and packs small.",

The plastic box of the DeWalt drills is a nice extra, as it not only stores the drills, but also holds securely in place.",

Someone was really using their head when they made the shank slip proof as well. The case is great. I've had a deWalt case before, but the one before felt cheap in the way it held the bits. This one feels solid and the bits go in easy, even the ones behind the other bits on the left. I highly recommend this if you had a cheap bit set before that kept breaking with light force.",
