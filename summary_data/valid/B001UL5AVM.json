For those of us that remember these as comfy skate shoes from back in the day be warned the sole is tough and has a weird feel. I walk around 7 miles a day and am mostly on my feet at work, these are not doing it for me. I had a pair of these as a kid and they were the best shoes I had! Vans has definitely sacrificed quality over churning these out. However they do look good..",
