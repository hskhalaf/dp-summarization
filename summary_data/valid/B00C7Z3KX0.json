The roof frame poles are the thinnest pot metal type of stuff you can think of. Where the 2 poles connect the metal broke from maybe 5 mph winds within a half hour of putting it up. This is literally the worst product I've ever purchased thru Amazon . Not to mention the pole that broke cut my left thumb so I am typing with 2 index fingers right now. Please please please do not buy this. Go to Costco",

It was windy the first night and the material was loud in the wind. The next night I hung some light cloth from the poles and the sound was much quieter. My son borrowed it for his son's birthday party this weekend. I don't think I can leave it up permanently in the backyard, but I wish I could. I love the space it creates.",

      "text": "Purcahsed 2x 10x20' tents for a birthday party. They looked great, received a lot of complements from guests. I strongly recommend setting everything up maybe 2 days before your event since some of the items come damaged (poles, zippers, clips). Even though things were damaged, they were easily fixed and it didn't affect the performance of the tenets. Recommend buying some type of weights or good stakes for the legs as they are pretty light. Also add screws to the legs or use the included white duct tape, trust me on that. For the price it's a great bargain, makes everything I mentioned worth it.",

Instructions are very easy to follow and set-up can be accomplished in 30 minutes after going through the process for the first time. The tent held up well during a heavy rain storm. On our second use we got caught off guard with a bad storm with high winds. The tent sustained some wind damage. We contacted Quictent via email and explained the situation. They were quick to respond and easy to work with, providing replacement parts at no cost.",
