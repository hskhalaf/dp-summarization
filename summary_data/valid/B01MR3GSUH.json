It is not sparkly, but as the name says, a little glow. Also put it on the top of my hands when I want them to look especially nice. A little goes a long way. You should try it! I am 66 yrs old and apply these products with a light hand. My skin looks great. The loose powder I use is also by Charlotte Tilbury. Thank you.",
