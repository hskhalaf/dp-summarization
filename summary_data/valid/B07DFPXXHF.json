      "text": "Honest Kitchen Bone Broth Pour Overs are a good source of bone broth for dogs. I have used a couple of varieties for humans and for pets. This is superior compared to many pet formulations because of ingredients and also that it is human grade. I find it slightly funny that it looks and smells more appetizing than some formulations designed for humans. I recommend starting very slow because this is really rich and could cause stomach upset if your pet is not already used to bone broth. My pets really enjoy this and I like that it is giving them the extra nutrition needed. I am impressed with the formulation.",

      "text": "This is a great way to increase the pup-appeal of plain kibble. It's a soup-like consistency and not just a gravy-like topping with a good ingredient list that excludes grains and fillers. It comes in a shelf-stable soft container (much like some soups) that's easy to open and pour without any mess. The container states it has 2 servings, but I usually stretch it to 3-4 servings. It's not difficult to fold back the top to keep things fresh in the refrigerator. It is a bit pricey for an ancillary food item, but it's a big hit with the pups and a big hit with me regarding ease of serving and storage.",
