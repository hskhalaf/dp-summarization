Previous boots have started to fall apart but these are clearly very well made. Definitely worth splashing out a little more for a pair of these.

That said, I have found them most suitable and have already walked several tens of km in them without any damage. The comfort actually increases when they are warmed up after a frew km.

      "text": "I find these very suitable for dog-walking in wet and muddy conditions. They are very comfortable despite very little 'wearing in', and have kept my feet dry and warm despite very wet conditions; however, it's only fair to add that I've only worn them for a maximum of 1 hour at a time. My one criticism is that the tab on the heel is too small to be of much help in yanking the boots off at the end of a walk.",

The seem perfect, high quality, it's the second day I've been wearing them around the house to get used to them and up to now they've been incredibly comfortable from the box (remains to be seen how they do under hiking conditions). I normally wear 45-46 shoes, I got an 11 (45.5) and they are quite big, but with two pairs of socks they are perfect, so in the end this was the best size for me.",

Wore them straight away whilst walking our dog and they are very comfortable. This is the very first review I have completed on any product because I do not particularly trust some of the write-ups. However, there is a first time for everything. Buy and enjoy.",
