When installing, consider that the fan immediately begins turning when exposed to sunlight--as it should. So you may want to keep the panel covered while installing to avoid injury from the spinning fan and ensure the thermostat is gently tucked into the enclosure before sliding the unit into place to avoid breakage. My attic is significantly cooler and temperature dropped about four degrees inside my home. I'm pleased with its performance so far and will write a follow up in the coming months.",
