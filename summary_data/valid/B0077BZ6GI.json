The holder for the left strap was clearly sewn crooked which contributing to the crookedness. There is a tiny hole on the fabric. There is a stain on the back. I don't care if I'm being nitpicky. For $100 wtf is this??? I asked for a replacement, so we shall see!",

This is as big, if not a bit bigger (taller) than my old pack. It doesn\u2019t have as many inner pockets, which is a bit of a bummer, but I do like the well-padded laptop slot and the fact that the front pocket has a zipper under the buckles. I haven\u2019t seen how well it holds up in the rain yet, but I hear these bags are pretty rugged. I like it a lot so far.",

The only CONS I might say are just the magnetic clips are a bit strong and require, in my opinion, a short awkward movement to open the bag, but honestly, it's not that bad at all and the bag is a well known and fashionable brand so it still a plus.",

      "text": "I appreciate the 'Minimalist' vibe this bag has, given the very small amount of pockets it has inside and out. It could really have used a couple extra pouches to store items in in the main compartment, but this is a good bag. It is my go to bag. It can hold many things. MANY things. Or it can old a notebook, pencil, and laptop. Very versatile. For small around the city trips no need to fill it up, but when I travel its the perfect carry on. If my travel is short it even better, because its the only thing I would need to take with me.",
