While I like this product and am glad to have it, I find it overpriced for what it is. If you're handy with a sewing machine you can make this for a few bucks and it will be just as good.",

You can't see the baby while you try to latch bacause you need to hold the baby so you can't hold the cover as well. I usually have my husband hold it up while I latch so I can see. That or more arms would be great :-)",

When using it as a nursing cover, I usually end up just draping it across my breast instead of completely covering my little one. The fabric is soft and breathable, and the scarf is wide enough to provide great coverage.",
