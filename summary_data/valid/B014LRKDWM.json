I ordered the 12-inch case because the dimensions in the listing said: 'EXTERIOR 12 x 8.7 x 0.8 inch and INTERIOR 11.5 x 8 x 0.7 inch'. NOT TRUE!!! My 11.5 x 8\" notebook did not fit by about .5\". The ACTUAL INTERIOR MEASUREMENTS ARE (and I measured them): 11 x 7.5\". If this listing had actually been accurate, then it would have fit. Now unfortunately I have to return it. Hope they fix their listing!",

      "text": "After buying the new 12\" MacBook with retina display, this was the first neoprene sleeve I could find that was specifically made for that new laptop. Not even the Apple Store had a sleeve to fit their new laptop. I was a bit skeptical upon finding the Runetz on Amazon as the price seemed ridiculously low. Imagine my surprise when it turned out be of better quality than any of the numerous neoprene sleeves I have bought for my other laptops over the years. Moreover, shipping was amazingly fast. I can highly recommend the Runetz for the new MacBook.",

Everything I wanted in a reasonable price too. The only thing that would make it better is if it had handles or a carry strap to carry it, but that's minor and I'm sure I could have found that in something else if I kept looking but this hit nearly all requirements so I went with it and am glad I did.",

The product also still smells like bad chemicals weeks after it arrived. I do not enjoy that aspect of it. This sleeve fits my MacBook Air 13\" well.",
