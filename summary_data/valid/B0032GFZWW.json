The sound alone makes me want to switch back to my old filter that was silent but didn't clean that great.",

I\u2019ve bought filters that lasted a lot less time. I liked it enough to order a replacement (and I think the price has gone down significantly since my first purchase).",

My little goldfishes are loving it, highly recommend this filter!",

And I also like the motor that is right by the tubes, so it can auto prime with no water in the filter box. Comes with a pre filter for intake as well",

It's nice that you can change the flow settings because it can get really powerful or very soft, Bettas prefer a soft current. Keeps the tank pretty clean on it's own, replacement filters a decently priced, and it's quiet. I can hear a small sound/vibration but not bad at all. Kind of soothing background noise once you get used to it.",

It has a setting for how high or low power on the filter which is great and it also comes with a cover for the filter so your little guppies won't get sucked up. Overall, this is great and I recommend it for anyone, even novices like me :)",
