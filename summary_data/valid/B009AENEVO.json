Color very good to amazing. Others have stated there is color loss at angles to viewing, I see none until about 90 degrees off center. No one should be viewing at that angle. Best monitors I have ever had. I do computer service/repairs, the only better I have seen is Apple and they are not 300.00. A definite BUY.",

It helps set the monitor to the back of the table to stay far enough from your eyes. Logitech HD webcam fits nicely on the top edge of the monitor, and both together produce great video for conferencing, skype, etc. This fits very well:  Logitech C615 Autofocus Portable Webcam.",

No monitor should go black and return to adjust to an hd video or not adjusting to a HD video. The monitor should be capable functioning on any quality video without going into black screen and returning back to its norm. This is the only issue I have and it become really annoying at times.",
