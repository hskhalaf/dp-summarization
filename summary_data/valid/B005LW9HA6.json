      "text": "Well made single-speed beach cruiser - arrived in perfect condition, easy to put together, excellent finish. I'm 5'11\" 225 pounds and this is a comfortable cruiser and a wonderful flat olive green color. I bought it from Amazon for under $200 delivered to my home and couldn't be happier. When I assembled it, I also mounted a 49cc 4-cycle engine kit from bikeberry.com and I LOVE commuting around 16 miles a day between my home and studio. LOTS of attention from drivers on the road who generally shoot me a thumbs up and want to know where the HECK did I get this super-cool motor bike! Love it!",

I got the matching fenders, and will probably get the toddler seat to go with it so i can take my 3 year old bike rides with me.",

The seat comes loose very easily, and no matter how tight you screw in the bolt, it will come loose in a matter of days if not sooner. The seat itself is unimpressive and hard. The bike looks european and has a retro aesthetic, but it is absolutely not worth the hassle. I never feel safe riding it, and always worry that one small bump going down a hill will be enough to break something else, as it feels fragile overall.",

Rides smooth, everything went together in about 90 minutes, 60 of which included the removal of those hideous stickers and glue (worst part of assembly was getting glue off!).

I used a mountain bike before and was hunched over the whole time. I really enjoy riding more upright to enjoy the atmosphere and take in scenery.

My bike, the front wheel axil was not tight against the bearings with at least an 1/8 inch of horizontal slop. Both were SO unacceptable from wobble that I had to take the front wheels to a bike shop for adjustments. $$$ later, I'm happy with them now. As I said, good bike - but buyer beware.",

I ordered the bike on a Wednesday night at about 11pm, and the bike was delivered, for standard shipping charges, on the Friday afternoon. OK - I'm only 80 miles from them, but that's still great service. The assembly instructions were clear and easy to follow with a few tools, and I was ready to go under an hour, and I was going slow.

No big deal for the front one but the back one would have required removing the rear wheel in order to have clearance to install the screw. To avoid this I got \"creative\" and used a smaller screw and nut from the opposite side. This was a hassle to do but was much easier than removing the rear tire would have been.. Still it is a great bike and I am enjoying riding it daily.",

      "text": "Minimum height for the 26\" crusier is 5'4\" but you better have some long legs if you are that height. The box says your crotch should be above the top bar of frame about 1-3 inches. The inseam of your pants better be at least 32-34 or higher. But in addition to that the frame seems short (front to back). Other brands you get a feeling of riding a Harley but the Firmstrong is different. I am not sure why. Smaller frame? I spent some time adjusting the seat and handle bar but still not quite right. Maybe it will grow on me. Kinda disappointed at the moment but will update if my feeling changes after some time riding it.",
