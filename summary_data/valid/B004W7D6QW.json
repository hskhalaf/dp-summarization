I have not tested read-write speeds via benchmarking tools such as AS SSD Benchmark, but am satisfied with performance gains over my 2010 WD Caviar Black HDD's performance. I also have an OCZ 240 gb SSD installed in my laptop and to date have had no substantial issues with OCZ performance in my devices. Highly Recommended!",
