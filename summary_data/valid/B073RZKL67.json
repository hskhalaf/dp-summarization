I was used to the Snap-on (CTS761) gun that is over $400 for a 2 battery kit. The Bosch unit is much better deal for the money. UPDATE: Picked it up to use it after owning/using it infrequently for 3 months and it was making a grinding noise turning with no power at all. I suspect the clutch mechanism is stripped or loose inside. Sent it in for repair with an authorized service center. I may have to try another brand :-((",

The charger works pretty fast and the battery seems to last a long time I have yet to actually drain the battery all the way. I put it in a charger before that.",

While it has all the great features and ease of handling everyone raves about, it is nearly useless for drilling. Screwdriver and drill speed-bits are inserted into the hex chuck as before, but they are loose. Too loose. A standard drill bit that is 2.5\" long will flop around at the point by nearly 1/8\". This makes starting holes slow and messy, and or me, it really lessens the convenience of the tool.",

I also really like the included case which has room for a few extra tools. I would recommend it to anyone without hesitation. I had no bits or drills, so I added thewhich has a great variety.

Try getting a regular dewalt screw gun in a draw for child proofing its a nightmare plus the old school hold the end of it to set the bit is annoying and will rip up your hand if not done correctly...this simply pull up and drop bit and done...the size allows me to get into a lot more areas and do more. I highly recommend this product and the price is great too,",

Unfortunate waste of my time and it too bad as it looks like very high quality tool bits. Plus Amazon is on the hook for six bucks return postage that isn't good for us shareholders!

      "text": "This Bosch PS21-2A 12-Volt Max Lithium-Ion 2-Speed Pocket Driver Kit is one of the best! I bought this driver to assist in the field where there are many screws on the units that need repair. Some of the units are in tight spaces, but with the Bosch Pocket Driver, limited space is not a major problem anymore. Also, it saves my wrists as compared to using a screwdriver. The reason for the four stars is that I have not used other bits with it, but I'm not worried about the Bosch Pocket Driver getting the job done! Have not had to charge the battery since it arrived and it goes everywhere! Love It!",
