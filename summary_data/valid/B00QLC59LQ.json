I was able to store pads, my pump, burp cloths, creams, wipes, diapers, etc very easily. It took me a few nights of rearranging things to get it all to fit nicely, and of course with the amount of items I had, I had to restock it daily. It's soft and flexible, while also maintaining high durability.",

      "text": "Using as a diaper caddy to carry around the house. Makes changing diapers super convenient. Only reason it isn\u2019t 5 stars is because the separating insert is held by buttons that can come unhooked pretty easily so the separator isn\u2019t held in place super well. Haven\u2019t had to wash, but I imagine it might lose its shape a bit if gone through the machines.",
