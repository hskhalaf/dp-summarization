A wall mounted crusher is capable of crushing larger cans, where this is not, but a wall mounted crusher is stationary, no option to move. My work place has had this type of crusher 10 years with no issues This helped with my decision to purchase. Very durable.",

      "text": "I enjoy beer. What I don't enjoy is that the cans tend to pile up a bit after time. Now, I have a trash can for trash and another trash can for dead beer cans that easily compacts them. This isn't about recycling or climate change or anything like that -- this is about my man-cave. I'm building a home recording studio, and beer and wine flow quite freely during sessions, which leaves a big mess. This compactor makes the clean-up so much easier.",

This is one closed system, 2 parts; the lid and bin. Bin is very sturdy. Place pop can on side, pull handle down, and the crushed can slides into bin. This was so worth it! Takes a second to get the perfect technique but so easy to use!",

      "text": "I was a little skeptical when we first received this trash can crusher. The can crusher on the lid is made of plastic and not the heavy duty metal can crusher. However, it works great with just a little bit of practice (maybe 5 cans). You push the handle down to crush the can and as you fold the handle back, there is another piece of the handle that pushes the crushed can into the opening in the lid. It works great.",
