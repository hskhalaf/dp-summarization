They smell so much, an over powering, super soapy smell mixed with cheap perfume. I put one bar on my sink and every time I got within 3 feet of it I could smell it. I had to double bag them and put them outside. Now my hair smells like it, I might have to take a bath to get rid of it. Also I saw a few questions about whether they come in a box or not. Mine came in a ziplock baggie.",

Highly recommend for gift or for bathroom display.",
