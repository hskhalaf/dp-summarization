But from previous reviews from others I decided to buy a one size larger. I ordered size Large. I used it just once and can sey I am happy that I ordered size Large because if you need a bit hike or to make bigger step and lift your legs higher the inseam is right on the edge. I think in Medium size it would be inpossible to make a higher step for me.",

I was a little disappointed they didn't come with a patch kit for the price. They fit me pretty well but are a little tight in the inseam. The draw string at the top for your chest also doesn't hold when tightend. Overall not a bad pair for the money but not the best",
