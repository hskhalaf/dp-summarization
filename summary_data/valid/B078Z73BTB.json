On the third cast the handle fell off, I lost part #1 and #2 in the jetties. Very disappointed at this point. Luckily I brought two other rod and reels with me. I\u2019m really hoping to be able to buy parts #1 and #2 to salvage this reel. I\u2019ve had no luck contacting anyone about replacement parts. Without these parts the real is useless.
