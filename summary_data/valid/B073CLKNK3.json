You have to open the case and pull the bag down repeatedly (until it's full, so maybe 1-3 times) to give it more slack so that it doesn't hold the flaps open. I don't know if it's some kind of user error, but since our baby is 18 mos old and we've been using the Genie this whole time, I'm thinking it's the liners.",

I do appreciate how there is a good amount of bag in each tube that lasts awhile, just wish the quality was better.",

The only thing I can think of against it is that it claims you can fit x-amount of dirty diapers in there and I do NOT agree with whatever the astronomical number is. I'd say you can fit 1/3 of the number they claim. But no big deal, just a bit of false advertisement on their part. Oh well!

Note, this only happens when you open the Diaper Genie. After it is closed the smell starts to go away. These bags do not mask the smell as well as the name brand. If you don't mind the stinky smell lingering for a few extra moments then these might be worth your money. I have ordered these several times but to be honest, am going to try Arm & Hammer instead.",

This really does compare to diaper genie's brand. Before I've tried \"Mama Bear\" and was far less superior than this brand. In comparison with mama bear - This brand blocks the smell and the plastic is a lot thicker. It's also easy to install. I will purchase it again",

Not worth the money, and definitely not a convenient solution to diaper stinkage, although I will say you cannot smell the diapers outside of the pail. So at least one thing worked.",
