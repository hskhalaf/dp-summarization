I put both on a kill-o-watt and this one draws 1 amp less. My ARC-14S does need to be taken apart and cleaned so that could explain why it doesn't cool as well. This one is a little noisier, but not too bad. One thing I really dont like are all the led's on the front. I wish there was an option to turn them off. I have to tape a piece of cardboard over them to sleep.",

Not only does it keep that area cool but on 100+ degree days, it keeps the entire trailer cooler than just the main AC. She is extremely happy with it. We mounted the hose bracket on a piece of plywood cut out to match her RV's unique window shape. That is held in place on the window with clips from the hardware store. Don't waste your time with single hose units. These portables with dual hoses are the way to go.",

I'm here to tell you that is absolutely the GOSPEL truth. This Whytner is incredibly effective. Like every AC, it's loud and has recently developed a vibration. Last night I discovered that strategically placing a couple heavy objects inside of the top vent (in this case a couple pinballs on the plastic grate) muffled my most annoying rattle.",

This unit has been a life saver for us, keeps us cool and comfortable even when the temps are soaring. We bought a portable one about 10 years ago for $900 from PC Richards (one hose). Still works but we have to empty the water after a while. The technology is definitely better now (2 hoses) no water emptying. Only con was that it came with a little dent on the side, but that didn't affect the performance. This is a really cool AC. I highly recommend it.",

(Just the indicator light). They should have put the controls under a plastic door and used slightly dimmer indicator lights. Despite this, I would recommend this unit.

Now I'm waiting for the third replacement from Amazon to get here (second one got lost in route. Third one is different brand). :(",

We tried plugging it into several sockets in the house and got nothing. I was going to try replacing it but I felt wary then. What if the replacement unit also had problems? I opted to just return it. Fortunately Amazon's return process was very efficient, so we packed it up and sent it back via UPS, and they processed my refund very quickly. So... one star for the product, but five stars for Amazon's return process, which was excellent.",

Within a few weeks or months, the LED panel on the front stopped working, so it doesn't display the temperature, but that doesn't really affect the functionality. The problem with single hose air conditioners is they create negative pressure in the space, which means it has to replace the air from elsewhere - AKA from outside. Dual hose designs don't have that problem.",

For two summers, it basically ran nonstop for months and never faltered once only needing an occasional water draining. I would definitely buy this again.",
