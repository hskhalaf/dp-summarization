I have a fast transition tempo and this is forcing me to slow it down. I've found that to be a good thing. (Driver swing speed 101-106 mph.) My hands can break free a bit though at transition. It's not light, so if you transition too fast it is a lot of weight transfer on your hands.",

If this were made with a flexibility just a bit more than a, say, regular shaft, a person couldn't create more accurate muscle memory and tempo for use on the course. (If you want to buy mine and can figure out how to contact me through Amazon, I'll let you have it for $29.95 and shipping. I've only swung it twice.)",

    "description": "The SKLZ Gold Flex Trainer is the ideal tool to perfect your swing so you can get the score you want, every time you step onto the course. Use it when or warming up before a game and get a low-impact stretch for easier mobility. With a weighted head made of durable polyurethane, and a flexible fiberglass shaft, you\u2019ll build muscle and power with every swing. Work the fundamental core golf muscles, and tone your obliques as you gain muscle memory. Let your perfect swing become more of a habit, and less of a practice. Simply swing this training aid while learning lag and elimination of early release. Available in either 40\u201d or 48\" in length with a 2.5 lb. head, this flexible weighted trainer encourages a flatter swing plane and forces the downswing to be initiated by the lower body, helping to reduce slices. The 48\u201d is recommended for individuals 5\u20196\u201d or taller, or those who are stronger and more advanced in their golf game. The 40\u201d length is ideal for those who are under 5\u20196\u201d or who are at a beginner or intermediate level.

The sleeve works by ingraining the feel of the correct swing path into your muscle memory, helping you hit longer, straighter shots and boosting your flexibility. Even better, the Power Sleeve slips on and off easily, so you won't scratch your shafts when applying it.
