Got a bunch of videos of us trying to figure out how to use it though! Will return for a better product.",

My complaint is, finicky buttons and switches and totally disappointed with the software on my Mac. Keep getting a message to attach the camera, even though it's attached and the icon shows up on home screen but then vanishes with message saying it was disconnected improperly. I will say it worked once, the first time I attached it but has been a failure since.",

The water proof feature and the fact that I do not have to purchase another water proof box was a plus. The number of mounting attachments whether you use them or not add versatility and useable options. Good instructional booklet provided. Camera was easy to setup had minor picture freeze while formatting card on TV. But after pushing the reset button everything worked excellent. I would recommend this product and will update to five stars once I put the camera through its paces.",
