I don't understand the complaints in the negative reviews. Maybe this Weber brush is designed specifically for Weber grills.",

As obvious as it sounds to me now, most BBQ sets come with plastic grill brushes. These might work fine if you only brush a cold grill but we all know how effective that is. This brush lasted me three years and the only reason I bought a new one yesterday is because the old brush was so full of grease. These things are so cheap it was worth it for me to throw the old one away and replace it for $8.",

But even so, it still performed just as well as my old long-handled conventional grill brush, with a lot less effort. Definitely a quality grill brush.",

      "text": "Better than I expected! I don't think I will go back to the flat head grill brushes after using this. The bristles are held in the head of this better just because of how its made. It does a better job of cleaning off the remnants from the last grilling session that a flat headed brush does. I have a small grill, so the shorter handle is just fine with me. If you have a large grill, you may want the longer handled version however to avoid cooking your arm too much when scraping. You always want to scrap you grill when its hot, so let the grill get up to temperature, then scrape it down!",

The bristles are strong enough to get off tough residue from the grill as well. My only beef is that it is a bit short (although the 12 inches are fully disclosed in the description) and therefore it's a bit harder to get leverage while using it. But all in all I am happy with the purchase for the price and would likely buy it again if need be",
