I won't put my Stratocaster in the case, but I did put my much cheaper Tele \"style\" guitar in it. It works. For the price point, not bad. It is better than a plain old guitar sleeve. It has back carrying straps on it, that I would not dare to use. It also has a cool red embroided Fender logo on it. One thing it does not have, that would be nice, is a hanger strap on top.",
