Well, not so -- sitting on the bed, turning on the bed, makes a lot of noise; it's difficult to pinpoint the source, but I believe the noise occurs where the material of the bed meets the frame. Anyhow, if there are light sleepers in the room where this bed is being used, it will indeed wake them up. Otherwise, the bed appears to be sturdy, well made.",
