      "text": "College student here. I love this thing. It makes such good coffee and doesn't leave residual coffee grounds in the bottom like my French Press. Perfect for long-haul study days. I leave the filter covering the spout and the coffee stays warm for several hours, but you can just pop it on the stove if you need to warm it up. Super easy to clean, just toss out the filter with the grounds and rinse and it's ready for tomorrow. I should've bought this sooner!",

The boric oxide makes the glass resistant to extreme temperatures, and also improves its resistance to chemical corrosion.",
