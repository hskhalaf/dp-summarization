      "text": "Didn't work cause the computer wasn't shut down properly. My computer wouldn't boot, the usb booted on its own and ran as expected but it wouldn't delete the virus' due to the fact that it needed to be shutdown properly. The computer won't boot in its own, so that's impossible. Thought i would let everyone know about the shutdown problem since they didn't. I'll give 3 stars cause it works, just not in my situation",

I had no problems using it but did call customer service for something else. I did see where people had some trouble getting through. When I called it did give me a recording with no option to leave a message. within 30 minutes they called me back. Was impressed because I did not leave a message or phone number. Question answered. It was very easy to use and on two computers it removed stuff and third one it said no issues.",

      "text": "This is the second Fix-Me-Stick that I have purchased. The first one being lost somewhere in the house after being used on just about every computer we own. It worked well enough and was so simple to use, this was my first thought when our main computer started acting up. I was ready to fork out the money for a second one, when the first could not be located. For anyone that is not computer smart and wants to run a first rate defense again viruses, malware and slowing computers. I would say buy this product TODAY!.",
