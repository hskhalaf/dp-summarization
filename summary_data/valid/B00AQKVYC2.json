It was past the time of return so I've just lived with it, but for this price it should not warp.",

They have simple instructions on the tag to season it up, but you could also toss in other veggies/peels; it\u2019s a process to do, but worth it. The only hassle was getting that manufacturers shipping micro thin plastic coating off of the pan; I followed the instructions on the tag for removal, but it was still a pain.",
