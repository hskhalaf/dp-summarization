Supplements can help too such a lipsomal CoQ10 and liposomal Vitamin C.",

The Periowash tastes great, very fresh, and you can just feel it doing all kinds of good things for your mouth as it gets swished around. I'd highly recommend this to anyone trying to steer clear of alcohol based mouthwash.",
