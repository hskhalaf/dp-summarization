      "text": "I have owned 4 different griddles since adulthood. This one is big enough to fit an entire package of bacon. It offers a flatter design than some I've owned which both solve a problem and create one simultaneously. You are able to cook eggs without them going down the drainage hole, but also you have to occasionally pour off bacon grease if it doesn't completely drain. The surface is non-stick copper and allows for a smooth cooking process. My one and only suggestion is to cook food at a lower temperature, as the sweet spot is about 275 for this model compared to 300-350 for others.",

The manufacturer says not to use oil sprays on it because they will damage the nonstick surface. So we use vegetable oil but it's beads up like water on a freshly waxed car. Although you don't need oil to make things not stick - oil does help things to cook nicely. For example French toast doesn't cook very well on this. I like it but I don't think I would buy it again.",
