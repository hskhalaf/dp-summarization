What I got was a cheaply made lamp of which the base was made of some type of lightweight material covered by what looked like a thin version of electrical tape that was coming apart at the corners. BRIGHTECH backs their product a 100% (AS STATED), commited to make sure you loved you purchase (AS STATED) and if not satisfied, wants to make things right (AS STATED)...well in looking into more of the customer reviews...you didn\u2019t do what you STATED. I WILL NOT be purchasing anything from BRIGHTECH in the future.",

(see pics for example) If you're looking for nice desk lamps, look elsewhere. I would usually give a company the benefit of my doubts but since I ordered 2 and had the same problem with each, it's clear that their quality control is garbage.",

The lamp is 5 inches wide and a tad over 14 inches tall. The power cord is about 3 feet long but I didn't measure that. This is my second Brightech lamp and I'm already looking at additional Brightech lamps for other rooms. They are just awesome.",

It's really well made, has a handy USB port, and comes with a very nice lightbulb, too. The packaging protected the lamp shade and bulb, and the lamp took about a minute to easily assemble. Although small and compact, this provides a nice shot of light - not too bright, not too dim. This looks much more expensive than the price. I really liked the pull cord rather than those fussy on-the-plug on-off switches. I highly recommend this lamp (get a pair - you'll use them somewhere!).",

      "text": "Beautiful & comes with its own bulb! I\u2019m using a multi-colored faceted lightbulb for a softer glow and the colors can be seen through the shade. Looks amazing. Two minor notes: The base is a slightly uneven so it rocks a little a bit and when the shade is tightened all the way, it\u2019s not square with the base. HOWEVER, both are not deal breakers. Just a minor readjustment here and 1/2 turn there, and it\u2019s exactly what I was hoping for.",

They are adorable, put out the perfect light, and the USB ports are so perfect and convenient. No fighting to plug chargers in hehind the furniture anymore or fighting over adapter blocks (because the kids are constantly losing theirs). Highly recommend.",
