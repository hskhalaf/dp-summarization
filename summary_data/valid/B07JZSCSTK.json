      "text": "Excellent computer! I have a garmin edge 500 and 800. Never made the upgrade to 520 or 820 because while they made improvements, the new screens were garbage. The screen on the elemnt is crisp and clear in all conditions. The best part may be the incredibly easy set up with the app. Also, it pairs flawlessly and easily with all devices and integrates with third party apps. One of the most annoying things with my garmin was how regularly it would drop the signal from my power meter. Garmins are everywhere, but this just may be a better choice overall!",

So far the turn by turn feature is awesome with the Take Me To feature is a life saver. I change the metrics I want to see on the fly and depending on my training needs. I can also pace myself better when Im trying to get a personal best. Not too happy with the original mount. I opted for a K Edge Wahoo combo so I can mount a GoPro and a light.",

I can also create maps and queue sheets with the Ride with GPS application and quickly transfer them to the Wahoo computer. Battery also lasts for multiple multi hour rides between charges.

So this model works as a stand-alone bike computer, (unless using the directional led notification), to which I only need to use my phone when I want to sync after a ride. I like the custom menus and the zoom feature if I only need to see a specific set of items on a page. And it holds a charge for multiple rides.",

Replaced with a Garmin 520+ which I had to return due to issues with no % grade reading on steep climbs (which I encounter every ride). Decided to give Wahoo a shot and I'm so glad I did. The display is MUCH easier to view. The interface via smartphone is great (compared to navigating all the menus on Garmins). Battery life is excellent. And I was able to use my existing Garmin heart rate strap, cadence and speed sensors. I know riders have different functional priorities for their bike computers based on riding goals, etc. but for me this is a great fit.",

I bought the full sized unit for olde eyes to see the stats. the same unit, smaller, is called Bolt, also tested and works just as well if you want smaller footprint and the same stats. I do recommend it. Garmin 1030 is far better, but twice the price. Sigma Rox 12 also far better, but Sigma pulled out of US market.",

The screen is easily readable in sunlight and you can adjust the text size while riding. Note that you need to set up the device using a smartphone (bluetooth) but the phone is not required when riding. One downside is that the calorie counter requires a sensor setup (not included) so my calories are always zero. The other downside is the mounting bracket is poorly designed; I can't mount the GPS on the bike stem like the Garmin can so I had to mount it between my aero bars.",

I am hoping I have NOT made a mistake dealing with Wahoo in the long run.",
