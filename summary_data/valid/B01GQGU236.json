The bottom of the shoes were identical in size and shape to the old, beloved Dynamics. After a very short time, I had to pause my workout to change shoes because my big toes went numb.",

Those black pairs split where the toe reinforcement met the mesh shoe top on one shoe in each of those two pairs. Frustrating.
