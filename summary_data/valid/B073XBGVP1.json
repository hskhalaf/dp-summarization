I normally get 3-4 months wear out of other brands (Nike, Timberland, Columbia) and these are holding up just fine. And, they are very comfortable and less expensive. Traction is also great. The right shoe has just developed a stitch breaking at the big toe but a little glue will easily fix it. Will be buying these again when I wear them out. Good value for my needs.",

FYI for orthotics users: This is the first sneaker or shoe that I can recall purchasing that insoles are attached with glue, so they are not easily removed. I needed to forcefully pull the insole out of the sneaker and was left with a substantial lump of glue and insole remnants in the heel area. I removed most of the glue material with a heat gun and flat blade screw driver. It was a messy endeavor, but it did the trick.",
