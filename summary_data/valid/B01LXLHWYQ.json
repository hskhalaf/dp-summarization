I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked on 2 feet of snow on my roof that had been up there for several months. It takes a lot of muscle to pull the snow down but once you're started it works well. My only complaint is the handle sections a machined poorly so putting them together and taking them apart is difficult. A dab of grease helped. I would sand the tapered sections before installing the spring clips. I would purchase this product again.",

Mine did and I made a better solution out of rubber grip mat and duct tape. 2 use a heavier gauge aluminum or even steel on the cross braces. When removing heavy wet snow they can have a tendency to deform. If you aren\u2019t removing 14+ inches of snow that has also been rained on this is a suitable product. If you are, it works....but it has its caveats.",

I gave it one star for on time delivery BUT, It is a complete Waste of time (30 min to put together and I am quite handy) and definitely waste of money. Avoid.",

It is very light weight, which is important, as when you use all the extensions the weight seems like it is 10X . I actually couldn't maneuver it with all of them. I'm a delicate woman!!! So I guess the \"light weight\" is a tradeoff for the \"flimsy\". I do think the side supports should have been better though.",

Just not deserving of the title Extreme Max. And as others said, the wheels are pretty cheap and don\u2019t roll. But even if they drag, on most snow-covered roofs, they are light enough they won\u2019t do damage. Just think of this as a decent, very light (weight), and light duty roof rake.",
