Expect to be able to drip 4 - 6 large hanging drops from a fingertip. My blood is thick and flows slowly, so I had a harder time - this time. They want you to let the test collection paper dry for 1/2 hour. Mine took 3 hours. I'm guessing this $45.00 test saved me over $200.00 at the doctors office. The results were clear. They educate you as to exactly where you stand. Composite, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, etc. Everything. Very happy with this test kit.",

I have heard nothing from Solana. I requested another test kit instead of a refund, no response. I am frustrated d/t their lack of response. The premise of this test kit was so promising, we all need to take charge of our own healthcare. I am saddened that this did not work. If I receive another kit and the test produces a valid report, I will updaate my review.",
