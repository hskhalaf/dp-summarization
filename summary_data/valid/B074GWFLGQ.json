Tip always break and have plenty of extras on hand so you can play interrupted. You'll want to with all those games! Get the boys to come over instead of going out! Save money. Have fun! Kudos!",

We tested it out on a few games of cricket and I'm very pleased with the quality or this unit. All the darts stick well and are well balanced. The board registered every hit as it should, but some electronic dart boards lack in this department. We're super stoked to have this new addition to our game room and it's already been a ton of fun. I wish we had picked it up sooner.",

My husband bought a separate pack of darts but they were way too heavy and did not stick on well, something to keep in mind. I do wish it had an option to lower the volume but over all it is great and great for the price. Great selection of games",

So here we are with no game to play and didn't even last the full 3 months. Would be nice if Amazon or WIN-MAX had a better return policy than this or even a replacement one would be better than nothing.",
