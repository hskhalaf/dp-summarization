And it boots up fast, so you don't have to wait for it so long to take notes when your class start. So far she likes it. Size is just right, light weight, and form is like a MacBook. I think the 64G is way better then a 32G laptop, because of the OS, and programs. I told her let me know when the memory fills up, I'll buy an SD card. You can just put your files in the SD card anyways.",

Having said all that, I did like the form factor and while I found the plastic edges a little too sharp, the feel wasn't all that bad and the keyboard was above average. I could not recommend this laptop even for my kids to use, though it is cheap enough that if they dropped it it wouldn't break the bank to replace.",
