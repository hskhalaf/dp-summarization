I wouldn't say it was a great laptop if you are mainly using it for watching movies or editing photos but its good for a cheaper laptop.",

It started freezing, so added a memory card and essentially only used it for web browsing, emails, and working online on Google Dosc, etc. Now, almost two years in it's still operational and the speed has improved when you don't store anything on it but the battery has died so only works when plugged in. It's fine if you literally want to do the few above functions.",
