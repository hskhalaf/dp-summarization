They WERE the most comfortable pair of flip flops I owned. These were harder plastic, the size 9 was almost a full size smaller than my other Reefs and the fabric strap that goes between your toes was rough. Had to send them back, the were that uncomfortable. Don't know if Reef has a different manufacturer but I'm giving up and have gone to a different brand. Miss those old Reefs!",

I bought a more expensive flip flop from another company at the same time. I much prefer the way these feel. I like a little thinner sole but these aren't too thick by any means.

      "text": "i really dont like the cheaper sandels that offer no arch support and chafe. you pay a little more for these but its worth every penny. i can walk around the park and do errands for the day in these without getting sore feet before there is proper reinforcement through the arch, and the entire sandel. you dont feel those pesky pepples on the sidewalk come through before there is enough padding. very comfortable, and would highly reccomend. i'll likely buy them again when i wear through this pair.",
