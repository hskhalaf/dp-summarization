I mean, it was pretty and nice, but I wanted something extraordinary. I took a chance on this......I am beyond thrilled. It's beautiful, feminine, a tad bit gothic, it's perfection. I cannot stop staring at it. It was super easy to put together, as almost all of it is assembled for you. I could go on and on about how great it is, but I have a bedroom to finish decorating. Buy this! Or dont, because if you don't, I'll be the only cool chick with badass bedroom lighting.",

Drives me nuts, however, for the price point, it will do. It's not too bad once it's up, and unless you are looking directly up at it, most people probably wouldn't even notice it. I've attached a photo that highlights the double swag to one hole in red, and the blue circle shows the single swag to one hole. Hope this helps.",

It was ridiculously easy to hang; it even came with hooks, but I bought a prettier ornate white one that Amazon suggested and went up in minutes. I had a tiny bit of trouble getting the cups over the light posts and called the number on the instructions and heard back from the owner of the company within minutes. I got incredible service and communication and a beautiful light at a really good price.",

Pictures don't explain how beautiful this chandelier has become the center piece in my home! (Exactly like advertised pic) Package arrived on-time, packaging was extremely protective of the delicate product and compact. My electrician installed the chandelier in about 35 mins. I used 25W bulbs that was recommended from the sales person at the hardware store and I have plenty of glamorous lighting. I would definitely refer a friend or family member. All pro's no cons wish I had space to install another!",

I am stuck with it now but my suggestion is to not even bother buying this spend a little more money and get something nicer.",

It's gotta be pretty because the lady folks are already telling us its pretty. And some guys are saying its pretty darn cool (that's guy talk for 'pretty.'",

The box the shipment arrived in was completely undamaged, but the inside box that the chandelier was packaged in, was crushed on one end. Obviously crushed in before it was packaged in the shipping container. I am anxious to see it after it is received as a gift and put together. Looking forward to it being beautiful!!!",

Would be perfect over a bedside table or in a closet or dressing room. The \"crystals\" are bright and clear and not at all cheap looking. Quality built! Comes packaged in a flat box and all you do is extend the arms, screw in the hanging hook and plug it in! Could not have been easier.",
