If you have a wide foot ,I do not recommend these shoes. They are very very narrow. I have narrow feet and they fit me good, but I even had to losen the laces up a lot to make them fit. Update: my feet have started to really hurt in these. If you walk a lot, I don't recommend. The middle of my feet hurt so bad after I take a long walk",

Lightweight, good food support and arch support and comfortable if your in your feet for 8-12 straight hours like I am for my job. Would recommend and would by again.",
