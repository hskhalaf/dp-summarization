This one literally slides on the whole bar about 6 inches. No screws needed PERIOD! It\u2019s super balanced and held on tight. I love it. Yes it can be fast but you get used to that cuz to be honest the sharper image one was to slow and I\u2019m using the same batteries. So once again 5 stars!!!!!! Oh and it absolutely works great on a wood rod. I\u2019ll twke a photo. Works amazingly.",

I pass my ties or go back a lot which makes the buttons a bit more fruatrating. 1/2 speed would be nice. Belts stored where suggested cause ties to catch as they go by.

Took me only a few minutes to install it. What I like the most about the unit is that (1) it has a light so you can clearly see the ties and (2) it's FAST!

When you install this, be sure to give yourself enough room on the sides, as the ties fly out a bit and can tangle with clothes that hang to the sides.

      "text": "This tie rack functions as it should to hold a whole lot of ties. That said, it only has one point in the middle that holds it in place on the closet rod. Therefore, it's somewhat unstable and hangs out of balance. Because the front is weighted down with the four C batteries, it keels towards the front. Before I installed the batteries, the back was heavier and it leaned towards the back. It really should have two pressure points instead of just one, so it would stay parallel to the floor.",

Having to be suited up everyday I have an abundance of ties so the overall product and usefulness is great. That being said, I have an issue with using the hooks. Due to the batteries being in the front, there is an uneven weight distribution so the rack leans forward which doesn\u2019t allow it to be even and toes stay on in the back. Fix this and you have a 5/5....ateast for me",

The belt hooks on the inside are nice, but when it is filled with ties, it is not easy to get to a belt in the center. Still love this item.

The light is large enough and bright enough to see in my very dark closet. It's almost completely silent as it moves with ease. It takes up very little room to store 50 ties!!
