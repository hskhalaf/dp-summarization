Perhaps washing them before wearing them would be best this way they are softer feeling. Also they did stain my nails and white sheets. So washing them before wearing would be a good idea to help prevent this from happening. The fit of these pajamas is loose. For better sizing info, I'm 5'5\" 145 and I got size large. I usually get a medium but this particular style runs small based on their size chart. Large fit perfect and not too loose.",

The only complaint I have is that if you sweat any during the night it will line the inside of the PJ, so they are not \"breathable.\" I believe that that is to be expected with satin. The product is not defective it is just something to think about when you choose satin. I like the teal color really well. And you get a matching eye mask with these something that is missing in the description, I believe so that was a nice little extra!",

Normally, I don't like to wear the bottoms of pajamas to bed because they twist around and are annoying, but because these are satin, they just move with you making them comfy and easy to sleep with. I bought them to have a nice top to wear to bed and to have a nice looking set to wear around the house, but to be able to actually sleep comfortably in both the pants and top is a bonus. The size fits as expected - I bought a large, I'm 5' 8\" tall and about 155 lbs - measurements of me: 36, 30, 40 and the large fits perfectly.",
