This car seat is different in the sense that it is not designed to fit the height and weight requirements that it claims there is no way. My daughter is only 25.5 inches tall and her head is basically to the top of the car seat shell already. Weight wise she is 18 pounds and is 14 months old and doesn\u2019t sit comfortably in it at all as she is all slumpy looking in the seat. Don\u2019t let the cute mickey/Minnie design fool you and get your moneys worth and go with a better car seat, as there is not a lot of cushioning for accident protection either.",

There's very little leg room when rear facing and we have about 2 years to go until front facing. The bottom buckle sort of presses into her thighs because it's set further back in the seat than most models but it doesn't leave a mark and she doesn't complain. 2. Bottom buckle/red button can be very hard to release at first but you get used to it. Otherwise love the cup holders, head cusion is awesome bonus, love how easy it is to install, easy to clean and very easy to adjust straps!",

It's cute and serving its purpose but if your child is tall for their age you may not want this because it does not allow for extra leg room. The straps do not glide easy so you have to double and triple check that the 5 point harness is actually snug on your child.",

This is a the only seat I have ever put my hands on that made no sense and felt 'dangerous'. I am terribly disappointed and frustrated.",
