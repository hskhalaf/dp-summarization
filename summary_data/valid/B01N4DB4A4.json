      "text": "Great high quality oils. Great prices. My only gripe is \"throwaway\" oils such as Eucalyptus are often added to multi packs of essentials, which keeps the cost down. But it is hard to incorporate things like Eucalyptus into anything but a nice bath or foot soak. LOL. This is not to criticize the quality of the oils at all. Very good stuff. And ive recently run out (I make hair and skin products) - so I WILL be buying this kit again. Cheapest way to get some \"essential\" essentials such as Lavender and Peppermint. Bottles will last you! Ive been into essentials for 10 years. I had not heard of these guys before, but believe me the quality is fantastic.",

Rosemary and Lavender are my favorites so far. Hope this review is useful because there are a lot of brands available to choose from, happy shopping!",
