There's no message inside, so a handwritten note (or a BIG signature) is needed. We send out only a handful of cards these days, so it's nice to not have a bunch of leftovers in one design that linger in the stationery drawer. The designs are middle-of-the-road contemporary, and the paper quality is good.",
