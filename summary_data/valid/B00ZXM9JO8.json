He has not gotten any blisters wearing them but he\u2019s obsessed with wearing socks so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s been helping with that. I like how easily they can be cleaned and they dry quite quickly. I would\u2019ve given it 5 stars but the stitching on one of the lace openings became undone just a couple of weeks after we got the shoes.",

      "text": "My 3 year old son saw these on tv commercial and wanted them very badly. Our local Stride Rite was sold out so i came to Amazon and chose same day shipping! My son was ecstatic that he chose his color at breakfast and they were at our house by dinner! He loves showing everyone his \"water shoes\" he has worn them all week and no blisters etc. He has been at VBS getting them wet and the local splash park ...its a perfect shoe! No switching from water shoes to sandals to tennis shoes! I highly recommend these!!",

Also they ran a bit small, so that putting them on without socks proved impossible. But they seem comfortable and with no show socks they still look great. Again...wearing with no socks and subjecting to water seems like a disastrous recipe for blisters.",
