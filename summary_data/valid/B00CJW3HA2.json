The Toto works great and has very good bowl cleaning. The Kohler however does a poor job of bowl cleaning. The short, liquid flush is adequate but the main flush is disappointing. By the way both toilets are 1.6/gpf. Wish I had purchased two Toto's. The Kohler was also $50.00 more.",

So it wasn't cause we had unusually large #2's, it was the toilet! This thing takes everything we can dump into it.",

I will replace my other toilets in the house with this one. (Did I just write a review for a toilet? LMAO)",

I wish they would work like public toilets. With these...like most of the older ...i have to hold handle down until bowl empties in order to get complete flush",
