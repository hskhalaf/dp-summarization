The bad surface finish causes too much friction. I have to beat it with a hammer to get it to loosen the jaw.

There are no teeth on the jaw which is very good as it won't mar up anything it's (un) tightening. Coupler came off easily.",

The Olympia not only worked well for that application, but also for many other jobs that always seem to pop up around the house. This is a nice buget friendly tool. At four inches in length, it's small enough to fit easily in a pocket or purse. I highly recommend it.",

      "text": "I bought this to deal with tight bicycle bottom brackets. It worked great. Also works great on cassette / freewheel removers as the length of the wrench is about the same as the radius of the wheel. Net-net it makes easy work of stuff that a 10 or 12 inch wrench cannot do easily. It's fun to show people as well. It's big enough compared to a 10 or 12 inch wrench to be a bit surprising. After that they recognize that it would make an effective weapon.",
