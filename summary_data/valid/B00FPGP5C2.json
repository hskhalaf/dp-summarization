I can only blame the shipping company (ups) for pieces coming a little broken, its the only risk you have to take otherwise the shelf is almost perfect for the price.",

Unfortunately the build quality is absolutely horrendous, the instruction manual was awful to slog through due to none of the pieces being labeled with numbers or letters when there was pieces that are multiple different sizes. The hinges that came with it were about half a size too small and I was unable to attach the door because of this basically making the whole point of the display case useless for me. Pay the extra money to get something of better quality. Very dissatisfied",

I wouldn't mind Side or back glasses having scratches, but the door is in the front for people to see....I think they could definitely improve on packaging. The item arrived with minimal packaging. Just a piece of paper between all the glasses. I'm surprised that they arrived intact. So I guess, they must have used very good glasses, shatter-resistant.",

After that, very carefully lift it upright and slide the wooden frame underneath. If you don't do that, it's almost impossible to get the glass into plastic grooves standing upright.",

As these were glass shelves, I was a little leary of leaving glass shelves with loose supports under them. Worth a buy.",

Once assembled, you can't change it without taking it all apart. Forget that! We need to order a couple more, and will drill additional holes for the shelf supports prior to assembly!
