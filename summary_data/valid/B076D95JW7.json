      "text": "Pros - Looks great; fast; not too heavy; graphics are good enough to make your eyes hurt. Cons - Keyboard stops working at times and requires reboot; sound driver can overpower the speakers at times, and you need the extra volume because THE FAN IS SO FREAKING LOUD. Honestly, it's as loud as my Dyson fan on the '8' setting. Also, certain downloads will trigger 100% disk resource consumption; haven't been able to determine if it's due to Win10, the SSHD, or a combination of the two. Even with the two major issues, still a solid 4 stars",

Right out the box, the computer was extremely slow and freezing the boot time is greater than 1:30 seconds and after you enter your credentials is 3 to 4 minutes. Once I opened task manager the disk was running at a 100%!!! with no program running. I contacted ASUS and after disabling superfetch, notifications, search among other stuff the computer continues to have the same struggles is a shame with some many great specs on the paper this computer fails to perform as expected.",

CAD software is too much for it to handle 90% of the time. Issues with the backlighting, & asus support is horrible. It\u2019s steadily degraded over the years, with proper maintenance and care.
