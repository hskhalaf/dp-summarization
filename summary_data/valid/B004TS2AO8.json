With the bluetooth added, I can wirelessly connect from Samsung Note 5 as well as Ipad Air 2. Was a steal at $198.00.",

I've tried replacement cords and none work. Works fine on expensive D cell batteries but this is a poor solution for anyone who uses the box regularly.

It is SO DANG LOUD! Truly marvelous how loud this device can get. The treble is piercing and the bass in fierce. I've gotten so many noise complaints now. It's quite small, portable, it'll charge your iPod/iPhone, you can use input on 3 total devices, the remote is badass, and the radio is an awesome added feature! I highly recommend over ANY Bose or competition speakers!",

The display on this one also shows you the album and song while the iHome just says,\"IPOD\". The radio has an actual antenna which is nice although the iHome had decent reception regardless. The form factor on the iHome is a little more conventional and easier to tote around but not by a lot. Overall I really love this boom box and think its much better than the iHome.",

This means that if the remote comes up missing, the radio is going to be useless.

No complaints about the product at all-maybe except for the battery life. Manual says 30 hours, my first set only lasted about 10 hours. Not that big of a deal to me. The only downside is the price. Fortunately it was on sale when I purchased it and I had a $100 amazon gift card. I would've never bought it for the listed price it goes for.",

The new one will be kept in the house. My only real gripe concerns the AC adapter: Why didn't they just build it into the boombox instead of having it be a separate item to drag around every time the boombox is moved? Would have given 5 stars if not for that design weakness.",

It is big and heavy with the batteries in, however I found battery life to be excellent 6+ hours at high volumes. Enjoy!",

    "description": "The Altec Lansing MIX Digital Boombox Speaker System was developed for the \"DJ lifestyle\" -- for those people who know music and like to pick the playlist to liven their scene. Multiple people can jack in their iPhone, iPod or other music device, and the MIX lets you toggle between sources on-the-fly. The system is compatible with the iPhone 4 and features a 30-pin dock connector for the iPhone/iPod, in addition to two front-facing 3.5-millimeter jacks so everyone can enjoy their tunes.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Altec Lansing MIX Digital Boombox Speaker System was developed for the \"DJ lifestyle\" -- for those people who know music and like to pick the playlist to liven their scene. Multiple people can jack in their iPhone, iPod or other music device, and the MIX lets you toggle between sources on-the-fly. The system is compatible with the iPhone 4 and features a 30-pin dock connector for the iPhone/iPod, in addition to two front-facing 3.5-millimeter jacks so everyone can enjoy their tunes. The result? A party!\n\n\n\nMIX iMT810 Digital Boombox\nSpeaker System\nAt a Glance: * Retro \"Boombox\" styling with advanced digital performance\n   \n   \n * Inputs for iPhone/iPod, and two additional aux-in jacks\n   \n   \n * Brightly lit LCD display for track information\n   \n   \n * Big natural bass, enhanced with XdB technology\n   \n   \n * AC and battery powered\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal dock is compatible with both iPhone and iPod, and recharges while it plays your tunes. View larger.\nVibrant LED for adjusting EQ and displaying track information. View larger.Booming Stereo Sound\nOf course, the combo of \"DJ\" and \"party\" requires loud and booming sound, and the MIX will deliver. Loaded with a 5.25-inch side-firing subwoofer and 5.25-inch tuned passive radiator, the MIX pumps out big natural bass, further enhanced with XdB technology for extra heavy punch. The sound is complete with a pair of 3-inch full-range drivers, a pair of 1-inch silk dome tweeters in a horn-loaded configuration. Beyond looking cool, the front-facing horns are engineered to disperse the high frequencies -- which are otherwise highly directional -- for great sound throughout the entire room. Quite frankly, the MIX gets loud.The MIX also features a brightly lit LCD display that tells you the track, artist and album being played from your docked iPhone or iPod. Also, FM station data is displayed when the radio is playing.\n\n\n\n\nFierce bass to keep the party thumping. View larger.Tailored EQ\nThe MIX has various EQ options that allow the user to tailor or personalize the sound. The simplest and most familiar is an adjustment of separate bass and treble controls. For more technical tuning, a digital 7-band graphic equalizer allows custom cutting or boosting of specific frequencies. Or, there are four EQ presets where just a touch of a button will tune the EQ for specific music genres, either for rock, pop, hip-hop or simply flat.FM Radio Tuner\nFor entertainment beyond the iPhone and iPod, the MIX has an FM radio tuner with four station pre-sets.\n\nMoves with the Party\nTrue to its retro boombox roots, the MIX runs on AC or battery power. You'll always know how much battery life you have because the MIX will tell you on its display. You can expect up to 30 hours of play with eight \"D\" sized batteries. And, the MIX has nicely weight-balanced handles so you can take it on the road or around the house just as easily.\n\nThoughtfully Designed Remote Control\nBetween parties the remote control stows away in its own cubby so it can always be easily found. At party time, use the clip-on carabineer so the remote is always handy to command the jams. The remote allows you to toggle between all of your music sources, including the FM radio and lets you control the on/off power, volume minus, volume plus, track back, track forward, EQ, play/pause, and the four preset buttons. The four preset buttons are used for both the FM preset mode and the EQ preset mode.\n\nCompatible with iPhone and iPod\nThe MIX is compatible with a wide range of iPod players, including iPod touch (1G through 4G), iPod classic, iPod with video, iPod nano (1G through 6G ), and iPhone (1G through 4G).\n\nThe MIX is covered by a one-year limited warranty.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nMIX stereo speaker system, remote control, AC power adapter, two (2) 3.5-millimeter connection cables, Apple universal well inserts, and user's guide.\n\n\n\n\nAltec Lansing Speaker DocksOrbit MP3 LiteOctiv MiniOctiv DuoinMotion CompactinMotion ClassicMixUltra-portable sound for MP3 players or mobile phonesCompact speaker/charger/\nspeakerphoneDesigned for multiple iPhone and iPod playersPerfect speaker for hotel, beach, or backyardIdeal speaker to take around the houseThe ultimate party speakerKey Features * 360-degree sound field\n * On/Off button and battery life indicator\n\n * Fits in nearly any space\n * Wake up to music with free Alarm Rock app\n * Makes video calling easy\n\n * Dock, charge and play two players at once\n * Shuffle tunes from two players with free Music Mix app\n * Wake up to music with free Alarm Rock app\n * Fits neatly in tight spaces\n * Built-in USB port lets you charge a third device\n\n * Integrated cover protects music system during travel\n * Cover folds back into a stand\n * Ported drivers deliver deep bass\n\n * Built-in digital FM radio with At-A-Glance LCD\n * Rechargeable battery allows for portability\n * Kick-stand flips up into a handle\n * Class D amplification\n * Advanced audio Digital Signal Processing (DSP)\n\n * Specially engineered horn-loaded tweeters and mid-range drivers\n * XdB bass-enhanced side-firing subwoofer\n * Built-in digital FM radio with 4 station presets\n * 7-band graphic equalizer\n * Convenient grab handles\n\nSound Enhancement TechnologyAudio AlignmentAudio AlignmentAudio AlignmentAudio AlignmentAudio Alignment, Waves Maxx AudioAudio Alignment, Xtreme Dynamic BassOnboard ControlsPowerFully iPhone or iPod controlledPower, Source, VolumePower, VolumePower, Volume, Track back, Track forwardPower, Volume, Track back, Track forward, Source, EQPower Type3 AAA BatteriesAC OnlyAC OnlyAC, 4 AA Batteries AC, Li-Ion Rechargeable BatteryAC, 8 D Batteries Orbit MP3 LiteOctiv MiniOctiv DuoinMotion CompactinMotion ClassicMix Wireless Remote iPhone & iPod CompatibleAudio Inputs2-channel analog (stereo)Universal dock for iPhone & iPodTwo universal docks for iPhone & iPodUniversal dock for iPhone & iPod Universal dock for iPhone & iPodUniversal dock for iPhone & iPodSecondary Aux In Jack Shielded for Interference Speaker ConfigurationOne 1.5\" full-range driverOne 3\" full-range driverTwo 2\" full-range driversTwo 2\" full-range driversTwo 3\" full-range driversTwo 1\" tweeters and two 3\" mid-range drivers;\n5.25\" subwoofer and 5.25\" passive radiator",
