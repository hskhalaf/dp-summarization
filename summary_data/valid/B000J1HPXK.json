You can't hear any noise even when accessing large amount of data from or to it. Data is written and read very fast... faster then my buit-in 40GB laptop hd. I just had a problem with my laptop, which does not give enough power from one USB port. So I had to buy another USB cable with two inputs, since the hard drive comes with a single input cable. But this is my laptop problem, with my desktop I didn't have any power issue, using the cable originally sold with the HD.",

With 9-10 machines that I need to synchronize data between, some laptops some desktops, this is the right external HD and the price is certainly right, having broken below the $1/gig point that external drives seem to have been stuck at. It's not blazingly fast, but fast enough to work from. It's quite quiet and the design is exceptionally slick with the rubber cover over the usb port. My only complaint (and it's a pithy one) is that the usb cable shipped with the drive is no bigger than about 4 inches.",

This is a known issue, and yet WD has not decided to include a Y-adapter (included with many other brands of portable drives) so that you can use two usb ports to get enough power and bandwidth for correct operation. Plugged in my brand new drive this morning, and all it did was \"click..click..click..\"; no spinning, no nothing. Worthless. If you are a Powerbook owner, get a portable drive with FIREWIRE.",

Was hesitant to purchase in the beginning, due to other reviews, but I had no problem with any of the 120 gb WD externals, so I went ahead and purchased this 160 gb. No problems whatsoever and I use the longer cord from my older WD 120 gb externals.",

Not impressed so far. Returning it and will try again.",
