It smells amazing. It has a thick consistency and lathered up well too. Immediately after using it my face felt super smooth and clean. I woke up this morning with a well moisturized and smooth complexion. And this was just after one use! So far so good. Can't wait to see how this performs over time.",

It has not only cleared up my skin, it has dramatically brightened acne scars, visibly reduced pore size, improved it\u2019s texture, and leaves my skin feeling so soft and healthy. I struggled for years trying to achieve glass-like skin in the face of stress acne until I tried this. I\u2019ve tried several expensive, luxury face washes and this is by far my favorite. Thank you for formulating such an excellent product. This is a holy grail face wash and I couldn\u2019t be happier with it.",
