Light has many applications and could make an excellent emergency light, flashlight, camping light, or bike light (in strobe mode).",

So it doesn't really seem worth the extra money and extra weight. I think I will just pick up a solar charger instead for my phone and use that for music. I am sending it back for that reason. It does seem well built and the Bluetooth connected quickly and easily, so it's a great product for some, unfortunately just not me.",
