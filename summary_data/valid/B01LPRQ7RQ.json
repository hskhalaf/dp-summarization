Best product I bought for awhile. Liked this modern, fashionable; yet sturdy speaker so much that I bought the same speaker 2 more times so that I have 1 speaker in each of my main rooms I used. I bought the colors white and black. Again, great buy and the prize is wonderful for this speaker!!",

      "text": "The voice prompts I can't understand a word it's saying. The directions that come with the device are very hard to read they're so small. I ended up taking a picture of the directions using my phone and enlarging the instructions so I could read them. I attached the 2 pictures of the directions I took, in case anyone else has problems reading them. If you link this to echo dot you will lose the first part of the echo!s reply. As for playing music through it sounds great way better than I expected. Be careful how you hold the device when moving it. If you place your hands in the wrong place the device was shreak at you .",
