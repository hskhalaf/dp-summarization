Like, maybe not smashed to pieces like some of the others said, but a chunk was missing. So other buyers- feel free to take the gamble if you want! Mine still works, but that was annoying. And seller- maybe think of packaging them in smaller boxes with more cushion? Cuz this was just rattling around in like an 1A5 and a half-popped air-bubble thing.",
