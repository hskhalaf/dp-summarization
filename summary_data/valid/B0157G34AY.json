After owning this set for less than a day, I tried to microwave something at ROOM TEMPERATURE for 60 Seconds, and the container shattered into a million pieces all over the microwave! This is despite the product description that says that the containers are oven and microwave safe. I have owned other Pyrex containers and have microwaved them with no issues, but this one blew up catistrophicaly on the very first use. I enjoy the set, and the look of the product but I cannot stress this enough, IT LITERALLY EXPLODED IN MY MICROWAVE!",

With this, you know for sure the container won't warp. The set is easy to stack keeping the lids with the containers, so it stays neat in your cabinet. I've had these before and am so glad to have them again.",

No more permanently embedded residue as with plastic. The extra weight of the glass is not an issue. Have to be careful that the lid doesn't seal after removing from the microwave or the softened lid will deform under the vacuum created during cooling. Only problem is a couple of lids have cracked slightly though they are still useable at present. Hopefully Pyrex will continue to supply lids separately.",
