Overall, the chair is okay if you plan on sitting down for a 1-3 hours any longer than that it becomes very uncomfortable. Does not have any back support besides the pillow they send with it, but even the pillow feels uncomfortable. I would recommend to purchase a better chair that can keep you comfortable for hours.",
