One can easily crack and crush it just by squeezing one's hands. In order for it not to leak (and spray, in my case protein shake, everywhere) one needs to try to screw it tightly but screwing it too tightly will crack the cheap plastic. In order for this thing to get so many positive reviews, there must be a lot of shill reviews. It is a terrible design and cheaply made.

I primarily blend frozen fruit with some juice or milk, and it comes out mostly smooth, but there are frequently some small chunks that just won't blend. The biggest annoyance is that whenever blending frozen fruit, the gasket comes out from around the blade EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's quite the design flaw I'd say. The frozen fruit makes it cold and causes a suction which makes the gasket fall out, but it's not very easy to get back in its groove. I'd hope this is something they can fix in the future.",

Oh and no leaks. After I unscrew the unit off it is dry. Hope this helps.",

It\u2019s hard to describe, but it appears the seal surrounding the blades is leaking into the cap. The noise has gotten louder since this started happening. Again, I\u2019ve had this for a very long time. We got good use out of it. It was worth it, that\u2019s why I bought a new one.",

The rubber seal ring around the blade does come off sometimes so just be aware of that but it is not a deal breaker at all. The cup that comes with it is large enough to accommodate the big smoothies I make for breakfast.",
