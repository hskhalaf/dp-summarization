It took her a while to get used to it, as it is her first cam with internal memory, but she still manages to fill it up and the cards I got for it! Anyways, the software isn't always the most user friendly, but the camera certainly is! The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how short the usb is on the camera and the software, which I've had to explain to my mother multiple times. Other than that, the picture quality and sound quality are awesome!",

I also purchased a Dazzler by Pinnacle and the conversion from camera to video is flawless and the time/date remains intact.",
