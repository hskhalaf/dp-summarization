It curled my lashes really well and I will never go back to another brand.",

Will dig into the corners of your eyes. It would be tolerable if the edges of the curler were filed down smooth, instead of being a little sharp.

Feels just like the one that I purchased from target and returned. It\u2019s not better than a $3 lash curler. Feels so cheap and weak. I\u2019m not gonna use this. Wish I can get a refund.",
