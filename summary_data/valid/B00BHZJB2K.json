For around 70$ this thing should bemade of titanium, and maybe a better system for it to stay in the sheath. I had mine fall out multiple times when i was running around with it doing drills. both open and closed in the sheath.",

I\u2019ve heard the gripes about them rusting, but after a season on the line on a hotshot crew, they\u2019re holding up as well as could be imagined. They\u2019ve been used to cut a leather boot from a pt, they cut through zippers, nomex and anything else. One night cutting line, we ran into a steel wire fence. The ring cutters worked perfectly to cut the wire, and we were on our way. Again, if you\u2019re an EMS pro, they\u2019re a must have. Extremely versatile, durable and worth every penny. If you want to be the stick in the mud who thinks standard shears are better, your loss.",
