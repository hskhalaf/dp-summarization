WHY I LIKE IT: It's simple but effective. The clarifying formula gets skin squeaky clean and cuts oiliness, but doesn't leave you feeling stripped or tight\u2014a notable plus for a guy who doesn't stock his medicine cabinet with face moisturizer. The cooling effect is, just as the name suggests, quite bracing, making this the perfect peppy cleanser for morning use.",
