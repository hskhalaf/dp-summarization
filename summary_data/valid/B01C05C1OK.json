I really don't understand the complaints of backlight bleeding from the AMD sister of this the XV273K but I see no backlight bleed at all on this panel even at max nits. I have seen the price fluctuate and some sales on this monitor so if the current price of $1249 is a bit steep maybe a price drop will occur in the near future but I absolutely think this monitor is worth the price.

If you cant wait until big 4k monitors are mainstream go for it, otherwise Id recommend either waiting for lower prices or better technology (OLED) this is after all only 60hz. or at this point, going for a UHD TV until a better option arises.",
