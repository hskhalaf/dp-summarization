You have to pull the top part down on your eyes or on your lower nose for maxillary sinuses to heat up those areas. which does not seat right and doesn\u2019t feel good. I wish they had the heating elements placed right on all the front part. Its not like the microwave activated pads heats up all your face. Not worth to buy.",
