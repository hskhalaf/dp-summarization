Then a friend wrapped the top in 3M no-slip \"skateboard deck\" tape; that works amazing in not slipping, as otherwise the finish on this piece is friggin' WAY TOO slick when it's wet. Definitely add some no-slip grip tape to this. Also, it fit a bit loose into my 2\" hitch receiver, so I applied some felt tape to this step which doesn't allow it to make any noise anymore.",

Figured the sharp pointy piece of steel would encourage distracted drivers to keep eye on the gap. To that end it does the job pretty well.

It really wants to rotate in the socket, which for a step is kind of scary! It won't because of the pin, but this thing really moves around. I sort of fixed this by wrapping the part that goes into the receiver with electrical tape. It still moves, but less so. For the price of this, I would like to see more precision. Note this thing is loud when you go over bumps due to the excessive play in the fit. On the plus side, it is pretty nice looking",

For a SUV without a back bumper to stand on, this is a very important piece for vertically challenged folks when putting things on the roof. The coating is very good except for where the hitch pin goes. A little rust is already developing there, so lots of use of protectant spray to keep the pin from rusting into place.",

Hitch does have a little play when initially inserted into the receiver but as noted by other reviewers, a couple of wraps of electrical tape fixes that issue. Suggest 2 full wraps and use a sharp blade to cut out the hole for the pin.",
