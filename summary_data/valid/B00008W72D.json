I ordered these because they have their own container (a box) to hold them when not in use. When she noticed these at my house, her eyes got big and she said \"Wow!\" We got them out and have used them a few times now. She is learning quite a bit by building things with these blocks. They were packaged inside a box lined with Styrofoam for shipment. This protected their wooden box without being overkill on packaging.",

It also has a clear plastic top to keep things tidy when putting away when not in use.
