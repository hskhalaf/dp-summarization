To date, I have dismantled it 3 times to align the hands, so that they don't interlock with one another. It could be that ambient heat (or sun) contorts the hands (bending them inward), nevertheless I would have expected not to have these issues with a simple outdoor clock. Also, the face, and supporting timepiece is of disappointing quality.",

Even when I'm hanging things, I'll ask him if it looks straight, he will say yes, but when I get down and look at it, I'll find it is obviously askew.
