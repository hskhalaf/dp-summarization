We didn't open the bottle int ime to return it. Don't buy from this provider!!!",

For 17 years it has never left build-up and since I have very fine hair any build-up makes it unmanageable. After about two weeks of using this IRISOME formula, my hair looks dirty and stringy and oily as soon as it's dry. SO disappointing. I have no idea what I'll try next, but it sure won't be this product.",
