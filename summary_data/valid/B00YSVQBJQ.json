      "text": "This same company has a propane bottle caddy. However, the company charges over $70.00 for the caddy. I bought this for $26.00. The good it moves the 40Lb. bottle. the bad, the weak buckle occasionaly pops loosethe wheels will not engage the ground and the base that the bottle sits on just drags. this feature is present on the high dollar modle also. So there is no qualitative difference other than price. Since I am older and the 40 Lb. bottles are becoming harder to move this helps greatly. Due to the flimsy nature and the price difference, I rated this a 4 star.",

      "text": "I purchased two of these to cart water buckets around my barn. I was hoping to be able to leave the buckets on the dollys but the handle prohibits my horses from drinking if the bucket is left in the cart. The other issue for me is that I was trying to avoid lifting full buckets but if you pull these dollys over anything but very flat ground the water sloshes out. The concept is great and I'm sure they are perfect for some uses for some people but they did not meet my needs.",
