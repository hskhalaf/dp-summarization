Both of my eyes are now extremely sensitive and painful. I gave a two star review because the product matches the description, the packaging was flawless, and everything was included. My reaction to this product was so bad, I thought I was going to have to seek medical attention.",

Gone are the days when I have flaky skin! Great product! Again use the low setting. TIP: I use this about 3x a week and it improves my skin very much",

I thought my skin was already at its best (I take my facial skin routines seriously lol) but this was icing on the cake. I have only used this 3 times during this week and my skin is already so much smoother, cleaner and I want to say my skin tone even looks more even. People say the pad refills are expensive making this product not worth it. But you can get a pack of 24 for around $10 and get a few uses off each pad so it\u2019s really not that bad.",

I tried it on the lowest setting with little pressure and it really bothered my skin. I think it may have just been the formula in the pads, but I'm not too sure. Wish this had worked better for me as I've heard great things. I'd just be wary if your skin is delicate & sensitive.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nAllen St.John2.0 out of 5 stars Be careful..Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2018Size: KitStyle Name: Microdermabrasion SystemVerified Purchase Please be careful with this product. The scrubbing pads are made with a chemical called SLS. This is common chemical in floor cleaners and jet fuel. SLS is highly corrosive. It's added to beauty products to break down the skin for better absorption. Using this product, burned my face severely. My entire face was broken out in sunburn like blisters. Both of my eyes are now extremely sensitive and painful.\nI gave a two star review because the product matches the description, the packaging was flawless, and everything was included.\nMy reaction to this product was so bad, I thought I was going to have to seek medical attention.Read more 498 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Anados Defered5.0 out of 5 stars Use As Directed For Best Safe ResultsReviewed in the United States on April 29, 2019Size: 24 CountStyle Name: Microdermabrasion System Puff RefillsVerified Purchase I have been using this Neutrogena Microdermabraision System for years. I love it. But I also respect it. Here's why.\nI have skin which is oily around the T zone - forehead nose chin and around the mouth. Also sensitive. I did not just need to get my face clean. I wanted that deep clean feeling of tight healthy yes youthful skin complexion without the use of any harsh astringents. Also lessen a couple of wrinkles here and there.\nMy friend recommended this. I love using this, but found I had to be careful. Those little blue puffs may not seem dangerous. Anything misused can harm. It is absolutely necessary to NOT apply extra pressure when using this. It can abrade - scrape - your skin. It is MICRO skin abraision. I learned the hard way. Directions state clearly avoid the eyes - where the skin is thin. I use very warm water to fully open my pores after initially washing my face to prepare. After wetting the puff you will feel and can see the froth mixture form. The gentle vibration feels great. Just keep those eyes tightly closed so the foam does not get into your eyes. Make sure the foam covers your face. I also do my neck, front and back. That gentle vibration is sensual. Rinse it off thoroughly. My skin always feels great afterwards. That clean tingle. Never had any ill effects or allergic\nreactions with proper use.\nThe directions state use every three days. To not harm your skin. Again, don't apply pressure. Let it glide.\nWhen removing the puff be careful to not remove the pad on the attachment head. Sounds silly but I am a klutz sometimes.\nThis helps my skin and the way I feel about me. I feel I look better. That matters. All this and at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.Read more 195 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Leilani S.

I actually use it almost daily and I have for several years, my skin, which is dry skin, is about as close to perfect as could be expected of a woman in her early 50s,I am told, and I credit this system in part for that, my skin is soft , glowy and smooth. And by the way, this price is unbeatable, so I always buy my refills on Amazon now. This many pads costs a good six or so more dollars at Target, so I buy them through Amazon instead. I change out the buffing pad every two washes because there remains a good bit of Neutrogena product in the pad through two full uses; I mean, if you can't buy more refills right away or something,that is good to know. I have done that many times with no adverse effects from doing so. My skin has never broken out from doing that or anything, and the pads continue to work just as well through two washes if you find yourself using one twice. So yes, I wholeheartedly endorse this system and I intend to continue using it indefinitely.Read more 128 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Mama Tiki5.0 out of 5 stars Fading Dark SpotsReviewed in the United States on October 19, 2017Size: KitStyle Name: Microdermabrasion SystemVerified Purchase I have been using this for 5 months and the change in my skin has been more than I hoped for. I have large pores. I also had dark spots from pregnancies. I used the expensive bleach from my dermatologist but the price was too much for me to keep up . I also did not like using the chemicals. As soon as I stopped using it the spots came back. My sister recommend this product. I had brighter skin after the first use. As the months have gone on I have noticed reduced pore size and my dark spots are fading!!! I also noticed it has helped fade scars on my forehead. I started out by using it once a week and have now built up to the three times a week. It is worth every penny and compared to the bleach a very good deal.Read more 112 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse BG5.0 out of 5 stars Five StarsReviewed in the United States on February 8, 2018Size: KitStyle Name: Microdermabrasion SystemVerified Purchase Love it! Saw immediate results after first use!Read more 96 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse donna j Rau5.0 out of 5 stars My skin feels amazing!Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2018Size: KitStyle Name: Microdermabrasion SystemVerified Purchase A little background on myself: I'm a 28-yo female with chronically dry, sensitive skin. I've tried numerous combinations of exfoliators and moisturizers with little success over the years.\n\nThat said, this kit was a life-changer for me. The very first time I used it, my skin was softer than I've ever felt it before. No more roughness, no more flakes of skin. And although it makes my face a little red immediately after use, it doesn't actually hurt at all and the redness fades within a few hours, leaving my skin soft and smooth.\n\nI've gotten into a routine of using this once a week, and I don't feel like I need to use it more often than that. Keep in mind that I'm using microdermabrasion specifically to control dry skin, so those of you looking to use it to reduce wrinkles or acne scars and whatnot may find you need to use it more or less often.\n\nAll in all, I still can hardly believe that such an inexpensive, easy to use gadget has made such an impact on the health of my skin, but I've been using it for a few months now and I continue to be amazed by the results every time. I highly recommend giving this kit a try!Read more 48 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Crystal in Vermont5.0 out of 5 stars Makes your skin Glow!!Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2018Size: KitStyle Name: Microdermabrasion SystemVerified Purchase This kit it's totally worth it. After one use your skin glows. I bet with continued use you could scrub years away. But the only thing that is negative, for me, is the vibration makes me feel nauseous. Kinda like riding a bumpy ride. I have a motion issue after having children and now that I'm 36. But others may not have the same issue.Read more 38 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nTranslate all reviews to English Janett4.0 out of 5 stars Muy bueno tiene 2 usos!Reviewed in Mexico on June 29, 2019Size: KitStyle Name: Microdermabrasion SystemVerified Purchase Mi piel es mixta con tendencia a seca, compr\u00e9 este producto por que le\u00ed las rese\u00f1as y me pareci\u00f3 justo comprarlo. Llego, lo abr\u00ed, le coloqu\u00e9 la bater\u00eda, mire un tutorial en YouTube. Llevo 2 semanas us\u00e1ndolo mejoro el aspecto de mi piel, no significativamente. As\u00ed que decid\u00ed darle un segundo uso, no colocarle el pad ni la pieza que lo detiene. Me puse serum en la cara y con las vibraciones di un masaje bastante agradable a toda la cara. Tengo 24 a\u00f1os y arrugas prematuras en la comisuras de la boca, en 3 masajes logr\u00e9 ver la elasticidad de mi cara mejorada bastante. Sigo usando el aparato con y sin los pads. Les recomiendo hacer este segundo uso, sin duda el producto vale la pena pues con los pads trabajo las manchas y con las vibraciones del aparato y el serum la arrugas y elasticidad.Read more 19 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

The machine itself is of great quality and is nice and easy to use, although I feel the pads are slightly expensive considering you use them up quite quickly. I replenished it a few times but it became more expensive than to use quality face creams so gave it away as a gift in the end. Still, if I used it longer I may have seen if it works or not, I do think its good value for money.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
