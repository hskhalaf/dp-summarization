I've read that it can take several years for bats to migrate to a new home, and it's best to have the box in full sun for at least 8 hours, with 20' of clearance so the bats can fall out of it, and it's best to have several houses near each other. We are still waiting for our bats to arrive; however, we hung this up in June and in the NOrtheast, bats migrate around March. We hope next spring they will find a home in our yard.",
