Check it againg 1 1/2 hr later my BP was 117/81. Not effect even felt like it made me sleepy. For something to be priced as high and said to be world's strongest coffee I was very disappointed!",

It is my opinion that it is no more caffeinated than regular coffee; this is merely clever branding by Deathwish Coffee.

I have not repurchased the coffee and have turned toward local roasters.

I really wanted to like this coffee after I had bought some as a gift for someone else without trying it. I got some for myself afterwards and honestly it made me feel pretty awful about giving it as a gift. I would actually suggest getting something else, this was extremely disappointing.",

When made according to the serving instructions on the bag, the brew is STRONG, flavorful (not bitter like you'd expect), and very caffeinated! It was everything I expected and then some!! One cup of coffee accomplished the caffeine fix of two or three other cups of coffee! The price tag was rather hefty considering you go through a lot more grounds per serving than most other coffees and I believe it's a smaller bag to begin with. Aside from that, I still give it 5 stars! Well worth the try if you're interested in coffee that actually works when you've become immune to the caffeine in your regular boring coffee.",
