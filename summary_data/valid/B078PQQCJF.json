      "text": "I really like this can opener which has opened every can I've tried it on, including those rectangular Spam cans. I had another similar opener which touted the fact that the lid had no sharp edges. It left the rolled edge of the can attached to the lid, but the CAN had remaining sharp edges! This one actually splits the rolled edge somehow so that neither the lid nor the can have those sharp edges. And it's easy to use - just position it on top of the can, push the button and it winds around the can and separates the lid. And no worries that the can is too tall to fit the counter-top electric opener.",

      "text": "This \"New and Improved\" failed to open 35 ounce tomato cans. The opener revolved around the can three times without piercing the can. Performance on smaller cans is poor. It took three revolutions to open smaller cans. The opener is annoyingly noisy and it can't be manually stopped after it opens a smaller can after one revolution. We have been using an older Tornado opener (CE1213) for about five years. It opens all size cans, is not noisy, and its performance is superior to the \"new and improved\"model. I can not recommend this product.",

It starts, but then immediately jumps off track and stops. Or it goes around but misses some of the can to cut and has to go around again. It is a pain to use.",
