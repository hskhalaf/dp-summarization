Sometimes I notice that it will even happen even when I'm not wearing the whitestrips. This did not happen at all before I started whitening. This does not always happen p, but when it does I usually wait a couple days before starting again.",

Update: They do work great but they did make my gums hurt after using them 3-4 days in a row. Solution: skip a day or two, then continue. I really like the \"glue\" they put on these since they don't slide around on your teeth.",

My only complaint (and it's a very small one) is that when it's time to remove the strips, you really have to PULL them off.
