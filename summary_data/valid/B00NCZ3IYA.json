It fit me the best and gave the best support of all the ones I tried. It is very comfortable and will try to get other colors.",

I'm sure since they are made for us more well endowed girls that eventually the shoulder straps will stretch out and since they are not adjustable they'll have to be replaced quicker than a normal bra, but for the price I'm not complaining.

But the fabric is thin which I'm guessing would make it breathable. This bra will not hide your protruding nipples if you get cold and it's slightly see through. This bra lightly holds your boobs in which I mean it gives them absolutely no shape except flat against you. I wouldn't dare run with bra but I definitely would clean house in it.",
