When we contacted Power-innovation, they immediately shipped out a replacement and return label. I'm super pleased with their prompt and courteous service! As for the hoverboard itself, it's a beefy powerful board! It makes \"normal\" hoverboards look like toys in comparison! It can go offload (assuming you're great at balance) and has plenty of power to spare! The whole family loves it, and are now constantly asking to \"borrow\" it from my 12-yr-old who is only off it when it's charging!",
