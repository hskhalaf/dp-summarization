If you are a PS4 or an Xbox One user I would recommend getting a USB extension cord. This is optional because the only reason to get the extension is to get the LED to work.",

Use it primarily as a telephone headset with my home wireless phone system and a 2.5 mm adapter. This headset sounds different but is louder than the expensive one. Also works well plugged-in to a computer, my Xbox. and my cell phone. I especially like the no-grab cord. If you want to use this headset with a home phone system with a 2.5 mm jack on the handset this adapter works:  And don't forget to adjust any equalizer (treble/bass) setting on the phone handset to provide the best sound for your ears.",

Also, my friends hear a lot of static from my headset, and even the audio through the headset sounds muffled. The mic isn't very strong either. And the weight of the cord is pulling at the jack which I'm worried is going to damage the port over time. Overall, I'm disappointed with this headset, and I'm surprised at its high rating.",

The set up was super easy, all I had to do was plug it in. The sound quality is great. I hear my friends and music very clearly now. The mic works great as well. The first thing my friends said to me was that they were hearing me louder and clearer before. It also picks up less background noise than the headset that comes with the system. I am very happy with the headset for the price.",

When (wired) connected to Xbox One controller, both sound and mic cut out intermittently. We've tried this on multiple consoles and new controllers, and can't determine a rhyme or reason for it. Sad, because when it works it's great. But when it cuts out in the middle of a first-person shooter, good luck living very long without ears or mouth! Time to look elsewhere for a dependable headset.",

The only downside is that you have to plug in the USB in order for the lights to work so if your not using a computer chances are you won't be able to have the lights on unless you externally plug them in.",

I also wish the light worked by charging the headset because the USB only works on the PC unless he buys an adapter and it's kind of just hanging there when he's gaming. Compared to his other two headsets the microphone seems to be way better. All in all I'd buy again, pretty decent headset.",

Fast forward, my oldest son requested headphones like his little brother has for Christmas...so, I decide to test this headset out myself to see what all the fuss is about and the headphones are comfortable, sound is amazing, there's an option to contol and mute the volume, and they seem durable. My other son wanted a headset for his phone, so I tried them out on my android and it was amazing, so he's getting these for Christmas, too.",

It is fine after a certain time the cloth on the wiring starting to come off so I had to cut it off but other than that I love these headset is lightweight and doesnt hurt my ears every time I wear it.",

However after a few months of use the sound quality hasn\u2019t gotten horrific. Static and cutting in and out. There is no way to even listen to just the home screen music without wanting to cut your ears off. Spend a little more money, get a better quality headset for longevity.",

Hopefully the first one was just defective and the replacement continues to work. The headset was nice, while it lasted. Ordered it October 2018 and its already broken. It would hesitate to even consider my usage moderate, so if you're looking for a headset to use daily this wouldn't be good for that. The price point is attractive but unless you're ok with replacing it every 6 months I recommend investing in a somewhat better made headset.",
