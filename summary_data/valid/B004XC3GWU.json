      "text": "I bought this Dolica tripod after seeing and reading several online recommendations. It works well enough for the price, but I was surprised how lightweight it is constructed. The tripod legs are very thin in the bottom section. With legs fully extended, it seems a little flimsy to me. The ball head does adjust and tighten securely enough for my DSLR. I almost returned the tripod because it is so lightweight. I think it will work best as a tripod for a phone or point and shoot camera. It wasn't worth the price of returning it to Amazon to me, so I'll just use in applications where the legs don't have to be fully extended and/or with lighter cameras.",

It cannot securely support a DSLR and any type of long lens. It's more suited to point and shoot type cameras. Beyond that, the overall quality is very low. The metal parts are thin and the plastic is cheap. The support hook bends very easy and all the adjustments feel like they would break easily. It's too big to put it in the lightweight and compact travel tripod category, so it becomes basically useless.",

Secondly the head mount to the tripod for me came loose...very loose at the base where it connects to the tripod. Enough that with a 2 second timer it doesn't always settle in time.

If you over tighten the three allen head screws that attach the base to the head it won't move. Warps the plate I suspect, bad design. Legs a little flimsy, round would be better but bulkier. The carry case is too small and not built to last. If you don't use a tripod much it's fine. If I had it to do over, I'd move up to the hundred dollars+ range.",

There seem to be some issues with the head keeping the camera in a fixed position as it will tend to \"drift\" or move away from the position you originally set. I've seen reviews saying that the section of the legs near the bottom of the tripod are a little thin making it a little unstable which I'd have to agree with. For the most part the legs make it stable when fully extended however it might not as well in windy conditions. I would still recommend it for the amateur photographer who doesn't want to spend a ton of money on a tripod",

The flip lock legs are great and the ball head is fantastic. Great purchase and it would recommend this tripod to anyone looking to step up their game from the super cheapies!",

Since there is not a cross bar between the legs you can adjust for some really crazy ground structure. The center bar is a great feature also. There is a hook on it where you can hang your bag or other weighty object for stability in a breeze. The center bar also reverses for close overhead shots. Beginner or Pro This is a great Tripod",

Click again to get whatever increased angle you want from any leg. Friction locks work well and quickly, you don't need to lock them fully when you put it away. This saves a little bit of effort (you'll see). I haven't tried the monopod function yet, but that was a consideration in this purchase.",

The roller ball is bit difficult to adjust sometimes, but that's probably my usage issue as I get it right after few tries. Have not tried it with bigger lenses yet, but seems they should not cause a problem. Good have the metal grip concealed and used very easily, gives a versatility to the surface it can be used on.

In addition the fact that the center column is removeable and the lower portion converts to a mount for the ball head alone for lower angle shooting is great. The veratility enabled with the multi-adustable leg angles allows for the highest and the lowest settings. The carrying case is a bonus as well. Overall a great buy, but not a strong tripod for windy, unstable conditions. One must trade some stability for such a good price. Delivery was outstanding.",

Trust me, once you have it you'll find more and more reasons to use it. This tripod turned out to be just the right balance between price and features. I love that it can be setup at different heights and angles. Also, the ball head is great. If you plan on shooting stills, a ball head is the way to go. It's very easy to use and packs up fairly small. Definitely recommend.",

It has the 'feel' of a professional-quality tripod, like a $500 Manfroto, or some such: lightweight, stable, a high quality build, and very versatile. The ball-head tightens up firmly, and will lay the camera perfectly horizontal if desired. It just feels solid and well-built, and seems to be an extremely good tripod for the price.",

    "description": "Size:60 inch| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Dolica GX600B200 is ideal for indoor and outdoor photography, thanks to the modest 3.5lbs you can take it anywhere making it perfect to all events, such as sports activities, camping, family gatherings and much more. It can hold up to 15lbs giving you the flexibility for all types of cameras and camcorders. The legs are 4-sided round tubes with extra firm legs snap locks give it extra weight capacity. The Ball Head has numeric degree markings suitable for horizontal panoramic shots. Includes carrying bag and a tool kit!\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGX600B200 Alluminum Alloy Tripod and Ball Head Combo \n\nThe all new Dolica GX600 aluminum alloy tripod and B200 ball head is a complete support system for your camera (point-and-shoot, SLR with lens, and DSLR with lens). It is designed to be lightweight, portable, and stable for any and every occasion.\n\nThe Tripod is composed of Anodized Aluminum Alloy (AAA) and Plastic Polymer Composite (PPC). The combination of both materials maximizes the petite size and reinforced stability it provides to make every photo-shoot perfect.\n\nWe also provide the comfort of using NBR foam grips for extreme weather conditions. The comfort grips are nice because you can have a tight grip and know that the tripod will NOT slip from your hands. In extreme weather conditions in a climate of below 30 degrees any metal will be unbearably cold and in an environment that has a temperature of above 90 degrees will heat any metal making it uneasy to maneuver your tripod and that is why we offer the standard of NBR foam grips to this special tripod.\n\nThe sleek ball head includes a quick release plate with a 3/8 inch mount for cameras. It attaches to the ball head with a safety lock to prevent the camera from slipping off and falling while loosening your quick release plate. While you have you camera attached to the quick release plate and ball head, you can pan 360 degree and tilt up to 90 degree. You can also attach a lens (i.e. 200mm f/4) mount to the quick release plate and have the comfort of stabilizing with confidence.\n\nThe upgraded GX600 tripod has its professional function and additional upgraded features. The three major features are: four level positioning, interchangeable spike/rubber feet, and a dual purpose mount. Uneven surface can be a big issue for many photographers and that is why we engineered our tripod with four levels for high to low level shots. You have the freedom to position each individual leg from a standard position to adjusting each leg at four-different levels. To decrease the chance of slippage, use rubber feet for soft surface, and spike rubber feet for rugged terrain. You can remove the hook from the dual purpose counter weight hook mount from the bottom of the center column, remove the center column, insert the counter weight hook mount on the top of the tripod (attach the camera), adjust each individual leg to ground level, and you\u2019re ready to shoot extremely low macro-shots. \n\nThe GX600B200 is completely, reliable, portable, and ready to use for your next photo-shoot! \n\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n\nTripod and Ball Head Technical Details\n * Maximum height column\u2191: 60 inches\n * Maximum height column\u2193: 51\n * Minimum height column\u2191 : 29.5 inches\n * Minimum height column\u2193 : 21.5 inches\n * Closed height: 23 inches\n * Net weight: 2.5 lbs\n * Max weight: 15 lbs\n * Leg sections: 4\n * Material: Lightweight aluminum alloy\n * Color: Black\n\n\nBall Head Technical Details\n * Base thread: 3/8 inch\n * Quick release thread: 1/4 inch\n * Panoramic angle: Horizontal 360\u00b0\n * Material: lightweight aluminum alloy\n * Color: Black\n\n\nCounter Weight Hook Mount Technical Details\n * Attach hook to use as counter weight to stabilize your tripod\n * Twist hook counter clock-wise to remove from center column,emove hook, remove from center column, remove center column,\n * Material: lightweight aluminum alloy\n * Color: Black\n\n\nPremium features\n * Rapid stability center column (non-rotating)\n * Reversible locking center column\n\n\nDurable flip leg locks\n *  Non slip rubber feet with retractable spike\n *  Closed cell comfort grips\n *  Integrated tripod bubble level\n *  3-position leg angle adjustment locks (for macro lens)\n *  Counter weight hook\n\n\nIncluses a tripod carry case\n\nWarranty\n5 years",
