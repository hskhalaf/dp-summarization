The other two steps are to use a benzoil peroxide 10% wash, leaving it on the skin for up to five minutes (that part is key), a topical prescription antibiotic gel, and finishing with this spray. Also exfoliating at least once a week. This one is far cheaper than the one my dermatologist sells and I think the extra ingredients help the healing process.",

So I purchased this salicylic acid spray (salicylic acid is well-known as a skin smoother), used it once a day and within a week the bumps had begun to disappear. Within two weeks they were gone. I highly recommend this spray to treat any rough skin and those annoying hard bumps (which are called keratosis pillars). In some people, these bumps also appear on the back of the arms.",

I've found that natural products with clove, tea tree extract, and vinegar bases have helped a lot more, are better for me, and smell nice. Also, because of where I need to spray this product it would be helpful for it to come equipped with the ability to spray it upside down.",
