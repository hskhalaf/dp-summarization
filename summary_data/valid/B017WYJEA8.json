They definitely need to be doubled for long naps or over nights but work for daytime (2-3 hours). I use them for my one year old and three year old. I had a few concerns in the beginning, but once the insert was fully prepped they worked very well. The customer service is by far the best I have recieved by a cloth diaper company. I hope to try their pocket diapers in the future.",

You do have to wash a good amount of times as with any other inserts to get maximum absorbency, have had these for a good amount a time and they hold up very well with our heavy wetter.",

With the disposables she starts to get a little rash and redness, but it goes away within just a couple cloth diapers! In my opinion this is the best option on the market for diaper inserts considering they are so affordable and functional.",
