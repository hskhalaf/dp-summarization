It will also save you a lot because you will be replacing your UVB bulbs when their output really drops, instead of having to replace them once every few months. With this device, for example, I have found that my 20W Zilla brand UVB10 bulb was as good as new after a year and a half of daily use, whereas a Chinese MH bulb, with which I had high hopes, produced zero UVB.",

The Solar meter Model 6. 5 UV Index Meter provides instantaneous UV index measurement, and is also used for UV index comparison, monitoring reptile lamp intensity and aging, monitoring UV lamp intensity and aging, and UV index tracking over time. To operate your Solar meter, aim the sensor window located on the top panel of the meter directly at a UV source. Press and hold the push-button switch on the face of the meter and read the results in UV Index on the LCD screen. For best results take note of the distance the reading was taken from the UV source in order to ensure repeatable results. A 9V battery is included, along with a rugged carrying case and Calibration Certificate.",
