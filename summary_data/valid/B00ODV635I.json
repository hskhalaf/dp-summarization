      "text": "Bought these to use at the gym and they work great for the money. I only paid $26 on Amazon for them so great bang for the buck head phones. They are pretty light weight and stay on my ears when I run. I like that most pieces come off and can be washed also. The sound quality isn't bad for a cheap set either. They sound much better then over priced beats that is for sure. Only minor complaint is they aren't red they are more of a salmon color. Over all they work great for the gym.",
