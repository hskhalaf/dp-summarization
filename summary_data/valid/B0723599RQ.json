Either of the 3 top modems by said companies are good--but the Motorola unit slightly edges the others out with a better equipment chipset inside.

Since most cable ISPs over-provision service I can hit 1.2Gbps down and 40Mbps up. This only works when the speed test uses multiple connections. This is the nature of link aggregation; single transfers will still max out at 940-1000Mbps. Great DOCSIS 3.1 modem that should serve me well until DOCSIS 4.0 becomes a thing.",

All of my other electronics are still working just fine after the last thunderstorm, except this one. Which is arguably the most important one as I depend in the Internet for work at this time. Over $220 later ($70 service call and $150 For a different modem) I have Internet again. It is an expensive lesson indeed. I should have just kept my Docsis 3.0 modem.",

Like it totally explained all my problems. I usually go with Broadcom chipsets in my routers/modems. Wish I had. So far this has been awesome. I'm not even on 1gb (just 400mb) and it still connects as 3.1 and 3.0. So afr so good. No latency/dropped packet issues yet.",
