I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s so heavy that I can\u2019t lift it, it\u2019s more like the basket itself weighs more than the toys I want to keep in them. But I am keeping them just in case I can use them somewhere else\u2014and if I find the perfect things to store, I\u2019ll update my review. I\u2019m giving 2 stars just because it wasn\u2019t something I didn\u2019t expect\u2014but if you\u2019re looking for something sturdy and thick, this is great one.",
