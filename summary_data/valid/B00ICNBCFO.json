Having had quality rug pads (thicker and denser) through several decades, I would rate this one a D at best. It has the loft of thin human hair and adds next to no cushioning.

My one suggestion to the company is to make it clear about which side goes up or down, because the pad's sides are obviously different.

Definitely not a 1/2\u201d thick felt like the cover pic makes it seem. BUT it was the best price I found that was thicker than 1/4\u201d so I\u2019m happy with it. Adds just enough to be comfortable. We have heavy furniture on it so we don\u2019t have problems with slipping. If you don\u2019t have heavy furniture you will need some sort of rug grippers to help with that. It\u2019s listed as a 7\u2019 x 10\u2019 but it\u2019s actually an 8\u2019x10\u2019",
