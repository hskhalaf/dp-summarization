I did not use any of the extender poles/stems as I wanted it closer to the ceiling over the kitchen bar counter. Love that this fixture is so adaptable. I used the Edison bulbs and it really compliments the style. This is a high quality, great looking fixture at a fabulous price. So much so, that I just bought another one and will use it over the dining table but with the extender poles for a longer drop. One tip I would recommend is to use glass cleaner on the globes, inside and out, prior to installing the bulbs.",

It looks a little old fashioned the way it comes, I took out the bulbs and removed the glass fixtures and used \"squirrel cage bulbs\" and I think it looks better, but to each their own.

The rod comes in about 6-8 inch lengths- so there is a lot of variety in the height you can choose to install them at. Very affordable! Like other customers noted- there is a white sticker with specs on bulb size on the underside- you can leave it- it isn't that noticeable- because how many people look directly at a light, or you can remove- with little \"goo gone\" type cleaner.",
