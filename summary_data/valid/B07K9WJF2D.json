      "verdict": "The Reebok Zig Pulse 3 is a road running shoe designed for neutral runners. \u00a0The shoe was mostly developed for active walking and low-mileage runs. \u00a0The Zig Pulse 3 has an innovative ZigTech outsole that enhances cushioning for a better comfortable ride. \u00a0It also has a two-tone mesh upper that is responsible for making the shoes well ventilated and breathable. Most runners like these features of Reebok Zig Pulse 3 but then again, some few purchasers were put off by the shoe\u2019s durability. \u00a0Despite the naysayers, the Reebok Zig Pulse 3 still holds its own when it comes to its positive reviews, and most users still choose it because of the comfort it provides whether used at the gym or out on the track.",

They are very comfortable, but I don't like the mesh fabric that the housing is composed of. After a couple of weeks some of the rubber pieces on the bottom of the sole started coming off and I had to apply some super glue in order to reapply them. Zigs is still my favorite running shoe, but the next time I will get the ones that are more durable, I have an old pair that I have had since 2012 and they are still in pretty good condition, and still can be used.",
