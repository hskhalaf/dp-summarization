Care for the heel drop though, look into this as these can hurt your calf and heel unless you use a transition shoe. Good quality, good grip, good fit. Only moan I have is that the gaiter is there to stop debris entering the shoe which it does a good job of. Sadly the designer did not have the top stitched to the shoe outer so it gathers in there like a ring of mud and grit to rub against you. They redesigned this tor the version 2 of this shoe which I will soon be purchasing.",

Just don't run on-road with these - The huge lugs stick to dirt like Spiderman to a wall, but on tarmac it feels like you're running in football boots.",

    "description": "Asics GEL-FUJIRUNNEGADE 2 PLASMAGUARD Running Shoes The mud run shoe that stays spotless. Take on fast and furious mud runs in the Gel-FujiRunnegade. Hurdle obstacles and break through thick sludge with a lightweight design and big lugs on the outsole. The ASICS FujiRunnegade 2 is built for the most difficult terrain. The upper is constructed from a durable closed mesh and an anti-gravel tongue to keep dirt and debris out of your shoe. Protection is enhanced with the addition of Asics' innovative upper coating - PlasmaGuard - which will keep your shoes protected from rain and mud, without sacrificing breathability and flexibility. The midsole is constructed out of Solyte, a lighter weight midsole compound than Asics' standard EVA and SpEVA. It also features enhanced cushioning and durability to keep your feet protected for longer. Whilst a rearfoot GEL cushioning system helps to dissipate shock on ground contact and also encourage a smoother transition from heel strike to midstance. The Gel-FujiRunnegade features Asics' most aggressive and rugged outsole built specifically for the harshest of conditions and the toughest of terrains. The trail specific outsole features deep lugs to grip loose rock and mud, whilst the shape and direction of these lugs provide uphill and downhill traction on all types of offroad terrain.",
