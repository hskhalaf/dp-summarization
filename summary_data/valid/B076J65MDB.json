My daughter teaches my son to learn the animal names through these animal sounds. Fun to watch the kiddos. Initially my son was a little scared to touch but then he liked it very much and this mat keeps him engaged. He touches and kicks the keys and enjoys the sounds. Easily foldable and can be wiped off easily if something is spilled on it.The volume control button is an advantage as you can adjust accordingly. Good product.",

My older one, who is 5 and 48 lb. can stand on it without broken it. I am totally shocked by quality, and will definitely recommend this to a friend.",
