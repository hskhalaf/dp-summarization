It has a similar upper to the best-seller Puma Fenty Creeper, but with a distinguishable elevated cleated rubber platform sole.It ticks off the boxes in terms of comfort, style, and perfect fit, as attested by most purchasers. It is, however, a bit pricey than the usual fashion sneakers and also bulky and heavy for some purchasers.",

        "A few buyers were delighted that this shoe is easy to walk in despite its elevated platform",
        "One reviewer commented that the padded collar and tongue updated the feel and wear of this shoe",
        "Some purchasers took note and liked the cleated rubber sole of this shoe as the elevated platform makes them look taller than usual"

      "cons": [
        "The Puma Fenty Suede Cleated Creeper is an expensive sneaker",
        "The majority of the reviewers claimed that this shoe is bulky and a bit heavy, but surprisingly not too heavy as they expected it to be",
        "Some reviewers had difficulties wearing this shoe as it somehow weighs down the foot"
