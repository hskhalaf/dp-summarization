Also it seems to be very strong and has handled cake mix along with cookie dough with no issue. I can see why this product was rated highly on consumer reports, which is why I looked it up for purchase here to begin with. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!!",

Durable, great settings, everything I need in a hand mixer. And did I say it's adorable? :)",
