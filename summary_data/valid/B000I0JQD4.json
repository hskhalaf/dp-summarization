I really have no complaints, it is very easy to set up, very sturdy, the felt top works great with playing cards of all types, it's large enough to comfortably fit just about any of my tabletop games and I think I would feel good about sitting up to six people around it. There is room for 8, but it'd be a bit cramped I think. Definitely a great buy in my opinion. (fyi mine did not have the foul odor others had mentioned)",

The problem is, that where the board folds in half, the felt does not go all the way to the ends, and on the blackjack side, the felt doesn't go all the way around the chip holders, making it look unfinished and cheap. Tried to return, but they don't pay return shipping, so it would cost the same thing to do that and risk another shoddy one than try a different product.",

I was setting up a card night when I started setting everything up and saw this. One of the holders broke and the board is bent anyways.

This one came with a cracked corner. The internal board is made of cheap pressed wood that will crack very easily. Shipping packaging was minimal so it cracked in transit. Unfortunately the Chinese have undercut all competitors and driven them out of business. Now they provide substandard products. So, Either fork out big $$$ for a well made poker table or buy garbage from China. Probably loaded with toxic materials.",

    "title": "Trademark Deluxe Poker and Blackjack Table Top with Case",
    "description": "This table top is very convenient and is solid and durable. One side is a 8 player position poker table complete with individual trays for poker chips and a drink holder. These trays are removable and fit into the other side of the table which is a black jack table on the opposite side. The blackjack table has the standard Las Vegas style markings on the high quality green felt. This table top has a really nice feel to it. The best thing about this table top is its convenience. It is very easy to travel with as it fits into the trunk of a car. Its not very heavy for travel but it is solid enough for durable use. Folding the table in half reduces the size to 2 feet by 4 feet for easy storage in a closet or under a bed. The table is made from 1/2 inch wood and covered with a professional style green felt. It is a 48 by 48 inch table top which fits very nicely onto a card table or any kitchen table and instantly tranforms it into a poker or blackjack table. New Features Include: Free Black Nylon Carrying Bag with Heavy Duty 2 Way Zipper & Double Strap Handle! New Trays now have 2 spring loaded pins for a secure fit into the table!",
