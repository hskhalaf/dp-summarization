I hate changing blades constantly, and tend to use the same blade for everything. I've had this blade on the saw for several weeks and just held up well against my intermittent use. I would say that it is a better quality than its Craftsman equivalent.",

I was concerned as to whether it would work as I'm using it on a lower-end Craftsman band saw with no ability to slow down the blade for cutting metal, but this worked flawlessly. I did put some oil on the metal I was cutting just to be safe. I also used it on some hardwood where I needed a cleaner cut, and it worked very well. I highly recommend this blade and the seller.",
