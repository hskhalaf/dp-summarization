The only downside - battery life. My initial use was on a trip to Sweden, and I ran the battery down before the first full day of picture-taking. So, while I'd recommend the camera, I'd also say to buy a second battery to swap during a long day of sightseeing and picture taking!",

      "text": "The 10X zoom is the big selling point for me. The camera takes great pictures but there is one design flaw. Where you would naturally hold the camera in your hand, your left finger will always block the pop up flash. When the flash is needed you will need to hold the camera in an unusual way. The 720p video mode sounds nice but make no mistake, this is not a substitute for a real dedicated video camera. The zoom is very restricted in video mode and there is much shake. Video images are fair but not great unless it is just holding still on one subject. Other than that it is a nice digital.",

Although I have not had a chance to use it much yet, the level of manual control when desired is impressive in a camera at this price point. When all you want to do is make some snapshots, the automatic controls make largely intellegent choices. With its high resolution sensor, I have made some cropped 13X19 prints and found no obvious noise or pixelation. I like that there are a large number of accessories available from manufacturers other than Nikon. This can offer great savings on high quality products that supplement the capabilities of this camera.",

While out West on vacation, I tried to turn on the camera to find nothing happening. It was frustrating and the problem became speradic where at times it would turn on by pushing the button and then other times, it wouldn't. Having two batteries, I tried both batteries to find that it occurred with each battery. I finally had to return the camera to Nikon Inc for repairs with an estimate cost of $97.00. I am waiting for the camera to be returned.",

I'd been having trouble with the poor quality of the telephoto shots from the Canon that I had been using for a number of years, which is why I finally bought a new one. The Nikon didn't have any of the blur or out of focus on telephoto pictures that the Canon has, so I'm a very happy camper. The only quibble would be with the positioning of the pop up flash. I knew about that feature but bought the camera anyway and I guess I'll just have to get used to positioning my hand differently.",

Downfall all though, is that it does not have the view finder, when real sunny, your not able to see what your taking a picture of, but the more you use it, the more you get use to it, and know what will be in the picture, ive managed to get over it already though!!",

The 3 inch LCD screen is exceptional. 10x zoom brings in far away subjects and the Macro is mind blowing. It will focus on things 1cm (0.4 inches) from the end of the lens. WOW! This is a great little camera that packs a lot of great features.",

I had to wait quite awhile before I could get the card so I was unable to take pictures when I thought I would. The internal memory would not save enough pictures for my purpose.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S8000 14.2 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red)",
    "description": "Color:RedFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Nikon's super slim, clearly brilliant Coolpix S8000 combines 14.2 effective megapixels with an incredible 10x optical Zoom-Nikkor ED glass lens for stunning prints as large as 20x30 inches. The camera features an incredible, bright 3.0-inch High Resolution VGA (921-k dot) LCD for composing and sharing pictures and HD (720p) movies with stereo sound. The Coolpix S8000, with Nikon's EXPEED image processing concept and 4-way VR Image Stabilization System, takes incredible pictures, incredibly easy. The Coolpix S8000 has Nikon's New Smart Portrait System which; automatically detects your subjects face, takes a picture when they smile, can soften the skin tone, and warns you if they blinked. \n\nThe world's thinnest 10x zoom camera that offers more creativity and freedom in photography \n\n\n\nThe ultra-slim Coolpix S8000 is equipped with a precision wide-angle 10x zoom, Nikkor ED glass lens, 14.2 megapixel resolution, and a variety of advanced shooting functions including the Creative Slider. Its slim, attractive design enables photographers to creatively capture every moment in style. \n\nThe Coolpix S8000 is the world thinnest* 10x zoom camera, offering a focal range of wide through super-telephoto to fully capture special moments from near or far. It also comes equipped with high-speed performance and a 14.2 megapixel image sensor to deliver exceptional image quality and consistently sharp results. \n* Among compact cameras equipped with an optical zoom lens capable of zooming in at 10x or more as of December 29, 2009 (according to research conducted by Nikon Corporation). \n\nNikon Coolpix S8000 Feature Highlights \n\nEXPEED digital imaging technology \nNikon's smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon's comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography. \n\n3-inch, 921k-dot TFT LCD featuring Nikon's Clear Color Display \nThe high-quality 3-inch Clear Color Display for the Coolpix S8000 features an ultra wide-viewing angle, anti-reflection coating, and screen brightness adjustment. The vibrant 3.0-inch 920k-dot VGA display offers four times the clarity and detail of standard cameras for amazing image reproduction. In addition, the monitor's structure greatly reduces reflection and improves visibility outdoors for a more vivid, clearer image preview and playback. \n\n\n\n\nHigh-Definition movie recording \nEntertain audiences with movies that capture the impact of the scene with HD. The Coolpix S8000 can shoot up to 1.5 hours* of HD movies (720p) with sound at 30fps. HDMI output is also available for easy in camera playback on your TV or computer.\n*Recording stops automatically after 29 minutes. This figure is based on in-house testing standards and stated for recording at 25\u00b0C with a fully charged EN-EL5 battery. Actual results may vary greatly depending on factors that include differences in ambient temperature, and the amount of zoom and autofocus operations used. \n\n\n\nFour advanced image stabilization features ensure sharper results \nVR image stabilization in action. The Coolpix S8000's high ISO 1600 capability allows shooting at faster shutter speeds, yielding great results even when shooting in low light or when capturing fast-moving subjects. Motion Detection assists in achieving sharper results by automatically controlling the shutter speed and ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. New advanced flash control enables natural and beautiful flash photos even when subjects are backlit or when shooting telephoto by enhancing ISO sensitivity, rather than opting for slower shutter speeds. \n\n\n\nNikon's Smart Portrait System with Skin Softening \nAs part of Nikon's Smart Portrait System, a series of advanced functions help produce consistently great portraits. The Skin Softening function ensures smooth skin tone on the face of subjects by leveraging built-in face-detection technology. Automatically detecting as many as 12 faces in the shot, Face-priority AF helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smile Timer helps to faithfully record precious moments by automatically releasing the shutter when the subject smiles. Blink Warning alerts the photographer when it suspects that a subject has blinked, while the Blink Proof function shoots five sequential frames, then saves the one in which the subject's eyes are wide open. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory. \n\n\n\nCreative Slider \nThe Coolpix S8000 is equipped with the Creative Slider, a fun new way to apply a rich variety of effects when shooting in Auto Mode. Adjust brightness, saturation and color tone using the Rotary Multi Selector. Adjustments can be previewed in real-time on the Coolpix S8000's 3-inch LCD monitor. \n\nNikon Coolpix S8000 Other Features  * Macro shooting from as close as 1 cm (0.4 in.) \n * High-speed performance \n * 16 scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings \n * Scene Auto Selector \n * Subject Tracking \n * Quick Retouch \n * D-Lighting \n * Auto Sort function \n * Approx. 32 MB of internal memory \n * USB charging via Charging AC Adapter EH-68P/EH-68P (AR) or PC \n * HDMI connectivity \n\nWhat's in the Box  * EN-EL12 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery \n * EH-68P AC Adapter/Charger \n * UC-E6 USB Cable \n * EG-CP14 Audio Video Cable \n * AN-CP19 Strap \n * Coolpix Software Suite CD-ROM",
