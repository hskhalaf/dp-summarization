You stand the rocket on a hard surface, then pump air into the rocket. Eventually the built-up pressure pushes the stopper out and the rocket blasts off. The harder you push the stopper in, the higher the rocket goes. By really forcing the stopper in, we were able to fly to well over 100 feet. This is the best water rocket I've ever owned.",

I think the instructions say they will go up to 120 feet - the harder you push in the plug the higher they go. I know we had them up over 300 feet and when the wind picked up, they were sailing into the tall trees - we had to keep moving the launching pad. Great fun for the kids!",

That probably gives the greatest height, but a smaller diameter nozzle would be more entertaining, watching the thing climb on a column of water.

The harder you push the plug in the bottle the more pressure you get in there to make it launch higher! Definitely a fun toy for the kids.",

He had no issues pumping up the bike pump (which is not included) himself. He played with this rocket for a long time. As a side note, he decided to bring the rocket inside, was smart enough not to put water in it and yes it still flew, hitting the ceiling, thankfully nothing and no one got hurt!",

Without it you can't launch. It is smaller than a normal bike tube or car valve stem. Granted they say you need one but if you never used one before you might think a regular pump could be used. The inclusion of a 50 cent part would save a lot of headaches having to run out and buy one.",

The only problem was that as it hit the ground, even though it was not a hard surface, one of the tail fins broke off.. I replaced it with the spare and continued sending it up. Super glue will glue the fin back together if you use a paper clip as reinforcement. There needs to be a source to order replacement fins.",

If mine doesnt come down will buy another. Needs a compressed air source such as a bicycle pump. Tip - push the stopper in firmly and use about 50/50 air to water mix to get some really impreasive height.",
