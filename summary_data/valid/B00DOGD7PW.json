Adjusting the over-the-ear wires was a difficult task. Then, once you finally have them in the magic spot and you are close to workout nirvana, they shift and come out. I would never buy these again as they are just not worth the hassle or money.",

However, the first pair I received had a technical issue with it, I returned them for another pair, and the second had the same exact error. They sent me a third pair and those finally worked, and I really enjoy them. Customer service was excellent, I just wish it didn't take three tries.",

The fit took some time but now its great and I love all the options they gave including cord length...just wish the sound was better. I am still debating, because well I need a pair of head phones...but I am pretty sure these are going back.",

So I get my new ones thinking everything would be good now, wrong! a day after the right earbud lost audio again! My advise looking for something else. Not worth it.",

There is only a single button; so - no volume control. Also, it doesn't seem to be able to access Siri - all it does if I push and fiddle with it long enough is pause the music. Yeah, that's something, but not what I expected. FWIW, sound is okay - I'll use these on indoor equipment where I can just access controls on my phone. Back to the search for the ideal earphone.",
