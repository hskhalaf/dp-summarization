      "text": "I want to like these Keen Austin mid shoes. The leather is nice, they look good and are light in weight. First I bought size 11, my normal sneaker size, but they were big so returned them and got 10.5 which fit perfectly on my wider than D feet. Stand there barefoot on the floor, do your toes rise an inch off the floor? No, they touch the ground! When you walk, they bend. So, why would Keen (or any other company) design shoe soles that the toe of the shoe curves up off the ground one inch? Did someone think this would just look cool? My feet are sore just from wearing these around the house for 20 minutes.",

I would return but my wife threw out the box.",
