Everyone who is concerned about their water quality should install these. Water comes out as clean as my Mavea filter used to provide. Customer service from this company is exceptional as well. We bought one for cold water and one for hot water. Not sure how long the hot water one will last but it's worth a try.",

The taste is perfect and their is no chlorine smell or taste. I use glass bottles to store the water and to drink from. After filling them I look at them in the light to see if there is any sediment, etc. So far crystal clear. I would recommend this filter to everyone.",

    "description": "The CuZn UC-200 Under Counter Water Filter works beneath any home or office sink to filter up to 50,000 gallons of cold water on demand. Replace the UC-200 every 50,000 gallons or 5 years, whichever comes first. In addition to Micro Sediment Membranes, the UC-200 utilizes a patented combination of KDF-55 Filtration Media and Virgin Acid Washed Catalytic Coconut Shell Carbon Filtration Media that have been tested to NSF standard 42 and 61. The UC-200 will reduce a wide variety of organic and inorganic contaminants including but not limited to: chlorine, water soluble cation heavy metals (lead, mercury, chromium VI, cadmium, etc.), herbicides, pesticides, sediment, algae, molds, bad taste, odors and other undesirable contaminants that may effect the quality of your water supply. The UC-200 DOES NOT REDUCE TDS, a TDS or PPM meter is NOT effective for this type of filter. Use DPD#1 Chlorine Test Strips & replace when chlorine breakthrough is detected. Want TDS Removal? Search ASIN#B019N7VG1W to view CuZn's RO System. The UC-200 purifies the water selectively, allowing beneficial mineral content to remain, this includes Hardness Minerals (calcium & magnesium). Since minerals are allowed to remain in the filtered water produced by The UC-200, it is NOT the right choice for folks with excessively hard water issues caused by extremely high mineral content. Unlike carbon only filters, bacteria can\u2019t grow inside the bacteriostatic CuZn UC-200 Water Filtration System. The UC-200 requires virtually no maintenance and installs in about 5 minutes, hooking up to the cold water supply. When you turn on the cold water of your sink, it will all be CuZn pure.
