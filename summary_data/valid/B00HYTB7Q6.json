I do recommend a sleep mat/pad on cooler nights because even the slightest breeze will end up cooling you down, even in a sleeping bag. The plus side of this is that it's a great way to stay cool during the day when its warm out. Edit Update 9 June 16: I still have this hammock and it is still going strong. Probably one of the best outdoor investments I've made. It's my go-to item when sleeping outdoors.",

The only thing that keeps me from being fully excited about this hammock is that Amazon messed up my order. Not big time, but big enough that I noticed it right away. Online, the hammock that I bought was khaki on the inside with blue lining the outside. After I ripped open the package, I realized the hammock that I had received was blue on the inside and khaki on the outside. Although this hammock is amazing, I am not happy that the colors were switched.",

Not that there is anything wrong with this set up, it just becomes a lot to lug around, set up, and tear down. For leisure and just hanging out, this doesn't get much better. Edit: While I have only used it a few times, I'm noticing there are small tears forming. Not enough to cause damage to the hammock, but enough to have me concerned on the quality.",

At first you feel like the thing will break if a heavy person sits in it, but it will definitely hold (400 lb limit). The material is thin and very flexible so you don't have to worry. It's a great product that in the Summer I hang it outside, and in the winter I hang it in my basement between two columns. Best seat in the house... Only downside is that you pretty much need to buy the straps separately because the original hammock hooks are too short for much. Other than that, I love my ENO!",

I know people talk about them being too pricy, but coming from someone who was in a cheap hammock over concrete when it broke, my tailbone and I don't mind spending the extra money. It has been to countless festivals and camping trips and has never done me wrong. I put my sleeping bag in it and sleep in it all night and am comfortable. And, we even had 4 of us in it at one time watching a concert. Would recommend to anyone needing a hammock (and really amazon is the place to buy them.. I did a lot of research and this is the best deal).",

For being compressed to the size of a small cantaloupe, the hammock is deceptively large when completely sprawled out (9 feet, 10inch long) leaving plenty of room for you or another. I would like the see the hammock come with hanging straps included (only comes with two plastic carabiners to hang) but they sell nice straps separately, of course. I would recommend purchasing two climbing grade metal carabiners to replace their plastic ones- just to be safe. Overall, fantastic product and I will continue buy these.",

      "text": "I finally got a chance to use this with some slaptraps. I must say, very functional and comfortable. I little spendy but the brand is good. I don't think two people would be very comfortable unless they wanted to be very close, but I slept in this with a giant sleeping back and was super comfortable all night. Easy to deploy and easy to pack up. Fits in a sack sewn into itself, packs into the size of a large grapefruit after use. Happy with purchase, stitching looks like it will last for years. I am 200 lbs and had no worries.",

I can be lazy putting things back in containers etc... This is so easy I have no reason not too.....",

ENO makes these with great quality and they really last. I've had mine for over 5 years and used it camping a bunch. The last camping trip we took, I just left the tent at home and brought these with a few tarps in case it rained. You can set one of these up in about 2-5 minutes and they are very comfortable. I highly recommend these and the ENO brand seems to be the best quality and best choice of colors",
