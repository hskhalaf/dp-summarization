Everything in the description was spot on. The cap had plenty of room for her hair, yet had a perfect seal to prevent too much water penetration! As you can see in the picture her style was still awesome after an hour swim class. Highly recommend to all swimmers with locs and braid. Will definitely be ordering more!",

She could have possibly used a small cap however Im still glad that I got the medium so that we can keep this for a while. The cap is just the right thickness and although it does fit closely to the head its not too tight to hurt her. Great cap for those girls with breads and things!!!!",
