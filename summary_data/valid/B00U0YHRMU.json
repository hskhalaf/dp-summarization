Most LED lightbulbs that i have purchased only shoot light up, which is nice for a fixture that only goes one way, but for a lamp, you really need it to shoot down. This one does that nicely and it's bright enough for a lamp. Plus it's not a daylight bulb which is also really nice for a lamp. I like daylight LED bulbs for elsewhere in the house, but in the living room, like the soft white. Great bulb.",

We've also seen very short lifespans on Cree area floods. Since other LED bulbs seem to do just fine in our house, it doesn't appear to be our switches or the quality of the line power. Very disappointing, given they were one of the leading-edge manufacturers.",

I don't think it's possible to try to clean out the bugs and spider webs once they got inside through the ventilation openings. Will see how long the bulbs last like that.",
