Not only is it affordable, but it also is great looking, especially when worn as casual shoes. Although there are reports that it is narrow-fitting, many still regard its overall comfort impressive.\u00a0The Adidas Raleigh 9tis Mid features a mid-top profile, a mix of leather and suede on the upper for support, and vulcanized sole.",

These shoes offer almost no cushioning or arch support but however I'm always the guy who chooses fashion over comfort, these shoes look freaking great both in jeans or shorts. These navy color ones goes especially well with dark wash slim jeans. As for the cushioning, I would recommend against playing sports in these as you might developed knee and hip problems from no cushioning. The shoes feel like old school tennis shoes with a thick flat rubber bottom, this problem can be solved however, by buying separate insoles.",
