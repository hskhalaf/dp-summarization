Even though I was using a mainstream fertilizer, it would simply not go that low. The lowest setting gave me right at 4 lb/1000 ft**2 so I was forced to do the yard in one pass and got a few streaks because of it. So it was workable but not optimal.",

In reality, though, Scotts drop spreaders of today are not the quality of the metal ones i used as a youngster. They wear out, and change their effective application rate over time. I decided to get this broadcast spreader and after using it twice, I discovered that pass control is quite easy to figure out, and fertilizing my 1/3-acre property can be done in half the time. It also seems that the mechanism of the broadcast spreader would not 'change with wear over time', although that still needs to be determined.",

Easier to push with a full hopper on a 1/3 acre rough St Augustine yard in Spring TX, I credit the bigger foam filled rubber wheels, taller handle and better broadcast mechanism. I like the setting dial and positive response of the control levers. I wish the wheels were a little taller like the Earthway 2150 but I wasn\u2019t willing to pay double the Elite price.",

The plastic wheels are hollow which can catch some of what you are dispersing and cause some unevenness and mess, but not terrible. When they wear down I plan to replace with better quality rubber wheels. The instructions for the Scotts feed I used were to space the dispersal by about 6 ft, the result was very streaky lines of green grass. I'd say with the dispersal range of this spreader, more condensed paths are needed. I went back over the less green spots and will see how it turns out.",

Also, if you release and hold down the lever fairly often, and little door that goes up and down when you squeeze the lever can get stuck so you need to keep an eye on it.
