      "text": "My rice cooks so awesome in just 25 min. I don't have to worry it overcooks because it turns off automatically when its ready and switches to keeping rice warm. I cooked my best Brussel sprouts yesterday using the steaming feature. It's awesome! I also successfully cooked green lentils, quinoa, buckwheat and millet. With beans I had to refill my pot with water twice to have it cooked right. It cooked for ~1 hour but tasted delicious. I will pre-soak the beans next time. It worked out well for the lentils too. This device is easy to clean and to store. It's completely silent and 100% reliable. Very pleased!",

This cooker failed after the second use when the spring holding the inner pot plate broke. When I looked at Aroma rice cooker reviews at any price point the reviews all pointed to hit and miss quality control and terrible customer service. I can only agree. I bought the Amazon recommended Hamilton Beach 6 cup cooker and am very pleased. It was a bit more expensive but the reviews for similar priced Aroma cookers were not encouraging - so at least I didn't waste more money buying another Aroma product.",

I have only cooked rice in it 3 times and even though I followed cleaning instructions and only used rice spoon that came with it the coating is already coming off.
