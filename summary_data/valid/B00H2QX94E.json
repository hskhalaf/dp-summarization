I\u2019ve seen one that looks similar but was less expensive. The tiles are lighter in weight and slightly smaller, enough so that the rack holds 20 instead of the required 19. The dice in the less expensive set are also lighter weight. Overall, I\u2019d recommend spending a few extra dollars and get the set you\u2019ll be proud to use for years to come.",

The top side with the shipping stickers was sealed, but the other side had no sealing tape on it at all. The box flaps were just inter-folded , loosely closing the box. That is all.",

I wrote the company, and they responded right away and sent me a replacement. WONDERFUL CO. It also comes not only with the covered boxes to keep the tiles in, it also has matching zippered bags! I find that much easier and takes less time. Beautiful Carry bag and covers for the racks. I recommend this set and the honest company.",
