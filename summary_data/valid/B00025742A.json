A plus of it being so compact is that it looks great while taking up around 2x4 inches of space:) really recommend this product instead of spending insane amounts of cash on something that does essentially the same thing.",

I have a vintage HH Scott stereo amplifier and wanted to add music streaming to it via a simple Bluetooth receiver. When I connect that up, I found the receiver's output to be to low in voltage. By inserting the Pyle preamp between the receiver and the Scott amplifier, the resulting signal input to the amplifier was up to line level and the music played through this Bluetooth connection is clear and full fidelity. The Pyle preamp is a great little product at a very reasonable price.",

The sound quality is ok for the price point. A volume knob (or small POT) would have been nice, but not necessary. An on/off switch also would have been nice, but it's easy enough to unplug.",

Check to see if your amp or receiver has a switched A/C outlet on the back. If so, you can use it to turn off the preamp when it's not being used.

I tried going straight from the magnetic cartridge, but the amplifier is needed. However, the frequency spectrum is NOT full range. Some of the sound is distorted. Would I buy this, knowing what I know now. The answer is an definite \"NO\".",

At this point, I leave the power cable unplugged when not using the record player. Will need to do some research to solve the humming noise.",

The PP999 is perfect for bringing your studio equipment's phono-level output to a more suitable and manageable line-level output. It'll take your audio signal, amplify its strength and prepare it for further processing by your receiver or amplifier. Preamps technically provide voltage gain to your desired equipment and are key to assisting the signal source. The ultra-low noise audio conditioning circuitry allows the preamp to boost audio to levels that are more manageable for various types of audio equipment. You'll find it easier to adjust the recording level volumes of different sources and instruments alike. You should position your preamp close to the source to reduce unwanted noise and interference. Preamps can sometimes come built into the stereo equipment, but if that's not the case, the PP999 is an easy install, wise choice and great addition to any musician or producer. Take your sounds and audio production skills to the next level with the PP999 Preamplifier.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n& PP444 PP555 PP999 PHE300 PHE400 Turntable / Phono Pre-Amplifiers Noise / Hum Eliminators Jacks RCA & 1/4'' RCA & 1/4'' RCA 1/4'' TRS 1/4'' TRS & XLR 12V DC Adaptor \u2714 \u2714 \u2714",
