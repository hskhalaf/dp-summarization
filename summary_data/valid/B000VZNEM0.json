The saw will not mount square to the workpiece plane with all 4 mounting holes. I had to leave the front right bolt empty. There was just enough room to put a clamp on the base at that point. It's a good stand, just make sure your mounting base is pretty much square.",

One for a 12 inch Craftsman saw (big jobs) and another for a 10 inch Makita (detail work). Don't be fooled by cheaper stands that look similar. This one is much, MUCH better.

The assembly instructions are clear enough if you have just a little self-assembly experience and a few wrenches. Takes another 45 minutes.

Smart, durable and simple to use, professionals never need to worry about how to setup or carry their miter saw ever again. The T4B features the same Bosch-patented Gravity-Rise system as the industry's award winning TS2000 Gravity-Rise Table Saw Stand. Unlike other miter saw stands, the Bosch Gravity-Rise system is practically effortless and allows for rapid set-up and breakdown in seconds. With a simple turn of the release lever and the user's guidance, the weight and balance smoothly raises the heavy-gauge steel and aluminum constructed stand and saw into working position. Set the leveling-Feet for uneven terrain and professionals are ready to get to work. Turn the same release lever again and the entire stand folds into a push cart design, complete with 8-Inch pneumatic wheels, perfect for transporting the saw over rough terrain from one location to the next. The T4B utilizes an aluminum support rail and special Universal Rapid-Release Tool Mounts designed to attach to the base of all Bosch and most competitors' miter saws. These mounts allow any user to quickly attach or detach the saw to the stand. And rubber-Feet prevent scratches when placing the tool on a cabinet top or bench. The same support rails expand for 18-Feet total material support, the highest among fully portable units. For users cutting long pieces of molding or flooring, this kind of support is priceless. Adjustable repetitive stops and table supports also allow the stand to adapt to varying applications and saws.\n\nSee more",
