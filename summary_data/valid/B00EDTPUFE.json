      "text": "I'm tired of buying garbage. I have reached a point in my life where I refuse to buy throwaway products which is mostly what Walmart stocks on their shelves. I did a little research as my wife's 3rd pastry blender had broken and came across this one. The handle is truly a rubber handle which makes it easy to hold. The steel is all continuous and all intersections have been welded not stamped (stamped = garbage). It arrived well packaged and I'm happy so far. I will update if anything develops but thus far as a professional woodworker who appreciates quality I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to someone.",

This one sounded fantastic, but alas, it works about as well as my old standard pastry blender. I prefer to make pastry by hand, and not use the food processor (too many parts to clean). This one promised that the dough would not stick (but it did) and that it would be easier to use than a traditional pastry blender (but it wasn't). I'm sorry to leave such a negative review, but this pie blender is really no different than any other one.",

Just love how sharp the cutting blades are and goes through butter or shortening so fast. Love the ergonomic handle and makes so much sense with the way it works and feels in your hands. A great item and would recommend. So happy with my purchase.",

The wire ones are useless. The sheet metal ones are better, but one still needs to soften the butter at least a bit, or they will bend. And, the handle screws will back out. Seem to have solved all these issues for myself with this purchase. Current rating is a cautiously optimistic 4-stars. It has been rock solid so far. Will upgrade to 5-stars if it continues to pan out after further use.",

If this were curved on the bottom somewhat more like a traditional pastry cutter, it would be perfect.",

It really is next to impossible to efficiently cut anything into your flour or whatever, always leaving large gaps where your shortening is left uncut. Additionally, the triangular blades do nothing to keep the shortening from clogging up the blades and actually makes the cutting more difficult due to the added resistance created by the thicker blades. On the upside, it is very well made and probably will last a frustrating lifetime.",

This is the last one I will need to purchase because it's made to last. Much more comfortable to hold and use and my hand doesn't cramp. Cut through frozen butter with very little effort. Very happy with this purchase.",
