It is well worth the money paid for it. Leaves lots of body in the hair as well. I haven't had to use the flat iron since I bought this. I have shoulder length hair. Very curly, fine and thick I can style with this brush and it doesn't pull hair out or break it off. Highly recommend this product. Thank you.",

I just blow dry with my inexpensive $20 hair dryer and have fantastic results. Not sure why some reviews says the brush hurts or isn't easy to clean, as that has not been my experience. Would definitely recommend!",

I have looked high and low for that goody brush, could not find it anywhere! Although it's much more expensive but worth every penny. I'm glad I found it!
