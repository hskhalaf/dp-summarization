To conclude, the Merrell Moab 2 Mid GTX is a pair of day hiking boots that can perform remarkably on the trail, but maybe not for long.",

I've bought many pairs of Merrell shoes (always with Goretex lining) over the years and only had one 'not so good experience' but that may have been due to the supplier who I no longer deal with. I wear one pair of thickish, quality walking socks so a half size up from my 'normal' shoe size works for me. I do prefer my shoes made on a British shoe last. Sadly these days that's not an easy find. Anyway, these are a great mid high walking shoe. Due to worn out knees I no longer go rock walking up high so these will do just fine",

The vibram sole looks and feels tough and gives a good grip. So happy with these my first merrell moab mid boots I went and bought a 2 nd pair as a spare just in case they stop making this model.
