Also, you cannot make your own mounting holes 16\u201d apart due to the spacing of the usable pegs. Works as advertised. Reasonably priced.",

Make sure you measure the distance between the screw holes on the back and mark/level your holes based on that measurement - you won't get it level using the sticks. Also, the black will rub off a little on light walls if it makes contact during install so be mindful of that. We'll see how long it holds up!",

Outside, the actual hooky thing is cheap flimsy plastic. Overall, I'll still keep it and use it until I get around to shopping for new decor again. It does look nice until you get up close to it and see that it looks like a kid's plastic toy. See attached photos.",

The \"standard\" building code is that studs are 16\" apart (on center) and while this item is wide enough to have the hooks 16\" apart -- they put them closer together.

Should probably consider getting better quality screws. If you pre-drill though, it won't be an issue. Even bad quality screws will be fine if you pre-drill a hole which is why I overlooked this and decided on a 5 star review.",

I finally got it to work.",
