My hair looks gorgeous, but 2 months away and I now have CYSTIC ACNE. I thought it was the extra wedding stress. Never in my life have I had skin problems...I went online to write a great review of the gummies and then read some of the other reviews on Amazon. It makes complete sense now, I will be discontinuing taking these gummies. The skin problems are not worth it.",

Store bought biotin has never caused so many breakouts and I take more mcg a day with those in my opinion these gummies work the same as the biotin I buy at Wal-Mart except I don't break out as much with the Wal-Mart ones.",

I\u2019m getting all of the same vitamins for 1/4 of the cost. I do think Sugar Bear is good, but only if you aren\u2019t already getting the associated vitamins elsewhere!",

Definitely had to wash it down with something else. I took two every day for a month as instructed, but to no avail. If hair loss is prevalent in your family history, then these probably will not be much of a help to you.",
