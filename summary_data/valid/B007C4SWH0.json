He\u2019s a special needs child who is nonverbal but he brings me the balm and points to his lips and nose when he is uncomfortable. Thanks so much to Smith\u2019s for a life changing product.",

It's not too greasy, doesn't have any scent that I can detect, and although it is a rose color it doesn't actually add color to your lips so the men in my house use it also. I never have chapped or dry lips! I keep one next to my bed and one in the bathroom. I really love it and will continue to order it.",

I tried the rosy Vaseline...it smells and tastes like perfume and is thick and sticky with application.",

Or more accurately, reapply a different lip balm that I know works. The pink tint doesn't really show up on my lips, but some other reviews here say that it does lightly show on other people.",

I live in Las Vegas, NV and one can only imagine what happened to the balm when the package was left under the sun in the middle of June. The balm melted causing a vacuum-like suction to the lid so it\u2019s impossible to open and it was seeping out of the tin can even with the seal. Once it\u2019s open, it\u2019s not as minty unlike if it wasn\u2019t melted. Probably best to buy in the colder months.",
