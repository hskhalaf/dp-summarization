Good touch screen that does unfortunately suffer from glare issues (I'm not criticising this product as I haven't yet used a touch screen that doesn't have this problem). Reasonable weight and portability with good sized easy to use keyboard. Rotating screen may be useful for some (but not me as I'm not using it for films etc.) I you're looking for a Chromebook and want one of this size, I think you can't really go far wrong with this.",

The 'online' environment is great - a bit of a release compared to being so used to software installed on your machine (the constant need for updates and anti-virus checking etc). Would not hesitate to recommend to anybody. In you've not heard of Lenovo, they took over from IBM - whom I'm sure you'll have heard of. A big company who've produced a decent Chromebook.",
