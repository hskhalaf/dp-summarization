The palm swell in the middle is very comfortable and leaves enough room behind for two handed blows. Of course, you will need to sand the varnish off of the handle and the blade. I used 320 grit sand paper and then applied a protective coating of. The edge will need to be sharpened. I wish it could have been ordered with a sheath.",

I made a sheath for it and a drop holster so I have somewhere to put it while I carry firewood. It cost me 24 bucks. Can't beat that. Even compared to my council tool velvicut boys axe and Hudson Bay axe @ over $135 a piece it still holds its own. Yes! You have to sharpen it yourself ! Get over it. Good job Vaughn!",

Of course, people appear afraid because of the axe function of the tool. However, it is the most well-balanced hammer I've ever had. It is heavy enough to pound nails, and yet feels light enough with the right amount of balance. I love this hammer and thankful that it is still being produced. I will use this hammer as my primary hammer for framing.",

The Bad: there's basically no balance to this tool. The strike with the blade is very offset and sinks decently but doesn't have enough oomph to cut through and is tough to extract. The Worst: while the handle is American hickory, the grain orientation shows no attention to detail in selection at all. After just 2.5 months of light use, the grains are already split apart. Take Away: Get the steel handle Vaughan, they're more than worth it.",
