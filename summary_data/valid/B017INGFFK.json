Flip hub on the bike for single speed or fixie. I've had this bike for six months and still haven't blown a tire with regular 10-15 mile days. The only suggestion I would have would be to add a front brake. The rear brake has caused me to slide out several times in close-calls (I bike regularly in the Portland metro area). Otherwise, I LOVE this bike and recommend it regularly to friends. Good quality and a great deal. Prepare to get tons of compliments!",

Other than that no problems, I'm on my second set of brake pads, I've wrapped the bars in bar tape because the grips aren't to comfortable for long rides. Weighs about 24-25lbs.

Luckily my left foot stayed on the left foot pedal and I fell back to sit on the saddle during the crank failure. Since I've replaced the crankset, I have had no issues with the other components holding up with this particular bike (March 2019). However, this is a safety issue that you will want to consider and it makes you wonder if other bikes have other component issues.",

It took a fair amount of effort to open the channel enough to allow the front tire to fit, but I managed. I do have some concerns about structural integrity on the front forks after stretching it back open, but until I end up face first on the road with a broken front fork- beats the return process.

The pedals should be replaced because they do not spin smoothly (probably busking and not bearings, or cheap, cheap rough bearings). For the price, it is expected to replace some things. I didn't like the rear brake pads, so I used a softer compound from another bike. It looks like a bike costing 3 times as much!",

I could barely stand on my tippy toes when standing directly over the bike frame, which would be super uncomfortable for hard stops or falls.

Now equipped with bullhorn handlebars, every ride on this fixed-gear/single-speed bike is about to be the most comfortable ride of your life. The subtle forward drop of these handlebars allows you to ride in a variety of positions. Cycle how you want to cycle with this timeless beauty. Like its predecessors, this bike comes with a protek crank, sun run freewheel, KMC chain, Pro Max brakes, and wanda tires. It's optimized for city riding with 43mm stars super deep V rims, wanda tires, and a lightweight but durable hand built tig-welded steel frame. No Critical Cycles fixie would be complete without a flip-flop hub, obviously. The rear wheel has a flip-flop hub, which allows you to effortlessly and quickly transform your own bike into a fixed-gear or a single-speed with a freewheel. The bottom bracket is sealed to keep out moisture and dirt, extending the life of your bike. Life really is about the pursuit of happiness.",
