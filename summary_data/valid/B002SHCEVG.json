I really hate the cat litter box smells (even the perfume smells of the litters). Now- I don't smell ANYTHING. This odor eliminator is just that- it eliminates odors- gone- you smell nothing! FANTASTIC, WOW, I wish I had bought one years ago!! Sound= yes, I hear it quietly blowing but it is very quiet. Certainly not a deal breaker. I'd say, whisper quiet.",

At this time I would recommend this for small areas/rooms (closets, bathrooms, cabinets) and it\u2019s most likely a better choice to get an air purifier that can handle large areas/rooms.

In a perfectly silent room you can definitely hear them. They're not bad. Certainly quieter than the tower style air purifiers I've used. Even without their added scent pods, these will destroy all airborne odors, at least in my experience. I like the scent pods they come with too though. They're a very subtle, clean scent so I might start reordering those.",

I don't have any specific complaints about the product. It moves a lot of air thru the filters and although not silent it isn't overly noisy either.
