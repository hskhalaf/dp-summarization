Most importantly, the DxO One gives me a high quality camera. It's way better than my Iphone camera, and gives me the quality of my big DSLR camera. So, now I can leave my bulky camera at home, travel lighter, and still achieve the high quality images I'm used to.",

The times I did use my old camera it would be on vacation and I would always have it in my carry-on because I was scared of it getting stolen from my suitcase. The DxO fits right into my purse!",

Tried several different cables and charging blocks (I own a professional video production company so we have many cables on hand). Nothing worked. Avoid this purchase.

As it used the phones flash, which is on the opposite side of the lightning input, the flash is HORRIBLE - only got 1/2 the upper photo with flash - & not worth with using with this. Social sharing is ok. If you\u2019re looking to save money and/or first using a photo editing software with your photos, you probably could go without this feature.",

I will be traveling out of the country this year and was planning on using this camera exclusively but now I will need to take a backup. Until the battery life is improved I cannot recommend this camera.",
