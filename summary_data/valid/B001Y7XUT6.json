I am a nurse and wanted a small knife I can use to open blister packs of medicine. The blade in this is not strong and sharp like my Swiss Army knife blades. It is more like a letter opener, which, to be fair, is how they sometimes advertise it. I thought the light could be used to examine eyes, but it is not as bright as my penlight. The magnifier is of decent quality for one its size. The little pen is handy when you can't find a pen.",

So in general it is not bad but at the end of the day I would prefer standard knife.",

Just don't forget about it if you are going to the airport...I've heard stories of people having to hand it over because they accidentally forgot about it... It seems like a very sturdy product, and the light and magnify glass are very handy to have.",
