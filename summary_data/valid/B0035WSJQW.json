However, sadly, the glass of this carafe is literally paper thin, and I'm not exaggerating. Last week it broke with just the slightest of tapping against a fork, yes a fork! I'm debating about replacing it with this exact carafe again, because I'm sure the manufacturer (which surprised me as being from CHINA), has not changed the design of this paper thin carafe. For $50.00, if should hold up a lot longer than 6 months!",

It essentially decanted it twice and we were able to still show the bottle of wine for our guests to read the label. You cannot go wrong with this decanter!",

The decanter inverted and after refilling the bottle 3/4, the decanter flew off and crashed to the counter, shattering glass everywhere. I went back to the instructions to see if we had done something incorrectly. Nope. Very disappointed in this product, especially since I purposely bought this brand and ignored the price tag.",
