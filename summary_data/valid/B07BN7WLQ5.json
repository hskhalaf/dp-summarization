      "text": "Fireproof lipo battery bags or \"safes\" have been around for maybe 8 or 10 years now. Lipos will catch fire on occasion (although as technology improves, and battery users learn to deal with lipos without abusing them) those fires occur less often. This is one of the first \"big\" LiPo safe bags. That may, or may not be a good thing. When you put all your eggs into one basket as it were, you have the possibility that a fire in one lipo battery might damage your whole stock of LiPos. I have several smaller LiPo safe bags, and I spread the risk around. But I also have enough LiPo batteries that I need the capacitiy of this large bag.",
