The ankle support is great for new skaters as you can\u2019t roll your ankle with the firm support. And the fur lining is nice and keeps the foot warm. But all in all the reason my daughter will ALWAYS only wear Riedels is because she has a wide foot with no arch! Jacksons will never fit her no matter where she is in her competitive skating career. So grateful to struck out on such a good quality well-made skate on my first try.",
