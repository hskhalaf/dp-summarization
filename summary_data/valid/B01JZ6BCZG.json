      "text": "I bought this product to use as a visual model for speech therapy. I learned about it from another speech therapist, however they were unhappy with their model because it made a loud noise when you opened and closed the mouth. This issue must have been improved on newer models because the one I just received does not do that! Also the tongue easily unscrews so that you can move it to model correct tongue placement for targeted sounds. I\u2019m so happy with this model and it is half the price of models marketed to speech therapists :)",

The tongue moves a little bit, but it is screwed into the bottom, so it doesn't have full range of motion. The white part also gets dirty and scuffed pretty easily.",
