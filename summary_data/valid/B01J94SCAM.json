So now my son is obsessed with this motorcycle game that came preloaded. A new layout would fix the problem I think. The screen also goes black sometimes when watching downloaded Netflix videos. The only way to fix it is to force shut off the tablet and turn it back on.",

      "text": "Dear fellow parents: This tablet rocks. I read the reviews prior to ordering this, and everyone is correct. it's fantastic. My kids (3 and 4) love it! I love it because it's locked up like Ft. Knox! They can only play what is age appropriate and we can even set a timer and it shuts off when time is up! It's safe and durable. It's already been hit in frustration, thrown as a weapon, and stepped on by the 60 lb dog. Even if any of those things had killed it it comes with a no questions asked warranty!!!!! Honestly, you'd be silly not to get this tablet.",

You can't enable location-based services in FreeTime so any apps that require that won't work. My son can't use his new Kindle to run the LEGO Boost app, for instance.

I spoke to a customer service representative and he didn\u2019t even know what he was doing! I was on hold for a really long time. I thought I could just get a replacement but no; they need to find out who the manufacturer is and more about the warranty. Don\u2019t let the 2 year warranty trick you into buying this device, it was a huge problem just trying to get some type of info. Doesn\u2019t help that the customer service rep didn\u2019t know much English.",

Dora the explorer didn't even have apps in Spanish. I am currently trying to teach my daughter Spanish and have great apps on my phone but would have loved is the tablet could have been used for that..",

      "text": "Wanted something with good parental controls but enough for my child to use. This is the best of both worlds. My son was a little disappointed he couldn't do YouTube on this, BUT I can add specific YouTube videos to his profile. So he just cants search and freely watch YouTube. I have to approve each individual video, but that's what I like about it. Tons of games, books, apps, videos and if is perfect! Also has the adult profile version so when he grows out of the kid version, I'll just make him an adult profile on the tablet!",
