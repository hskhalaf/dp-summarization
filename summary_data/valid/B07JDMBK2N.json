The subwoofer is bassy and the surround sound works amazing (particularly cool with horror movies). I wish the screen on the remote had a backlight-it\u2019s really hard to see. Also having a small screen on the actual soundbar would be nice. The lights are impossible to interpret without the manual.",

Probably isn\u2019t audiophile quality sound, and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be for the price, but it is very enjoyable, and the Dolby Atmos adds a little bit of height in sound in front of you.",
