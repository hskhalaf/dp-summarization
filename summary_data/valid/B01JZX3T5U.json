The title states \"true pet\" so I was expecting the mini motorized brush and it doesn't come with that attachment. But if you read the entire description then you will see that it doesn't. Lesson learned for me. ALSO, it didn't come with filters. I almost damaged mine. Had to buy filters separately. After those add-ons, I pretty much paid for a new vacuum.",
