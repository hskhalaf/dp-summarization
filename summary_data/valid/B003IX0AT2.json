Now, September 9 2017, I found that fire pit grid is already cracked in many places and few bars fell out. It also looks like that the protection (cage) metal screen is also begins to burn out, and the metal mesh on the top of the chimney is already crumpled. In general, this is very low quality product made of improper materials.",

This does not do a good job capturing smoke and moving it up the chimney - it is essentially just a fire pit with mesh around the sides of it.

Follow excellent instructions and don't tighten screws until all the holes line up. Hand tighten screws. The last hole on the upper chimney would not line up. Drilled a new hole. Easily done. Throws out the heat. BIG! Great look and impressive. Box is heavy, don't carry alone.",

We needed the extra outdoor space and figured this would make for a more welcoming atmosphere to entice our guests outdoors in the cold. It worked and was wonderful. Just be careful how close wood gets to the sides. Even though it is enclosed a breeze can blow the flames outside a good distance.",
