Installs in seconds, no damage to doorway. \n\nWe just changed our name to Gym1 after 5 years to better express the fitness and active play benefits of the Indoor Playground. \n\nThis Gym1 Deluxe Indoor Playground set includes the patented core doorway unit plus swing, ladder, rope, trapeze, and rings. Just swap out attachments into our plug and play silent carabiners in seconds. Now your kids can have fun and exercise in the convenience of your own home. Not only a great item to keep your kids active inside but a great babysitting tool so you can get your projects done while they create life long healthy habits. Great for autistic kids and kids with disabilities, recommended by occupational therapists and healthcare specialists\n\nWe've reinvented the cantilevered pullup bar with our patented vise-grips and motional stabilizers to allow your kids to safely swing, climb, and play all day indoors. We use doubly thick steel and first generation quality plastic to make the indoor playground experience a daily time of active play and exercise away from the screen. The padded vise-grips fit right onto your doorway and the force of motion is distributed throughout your framing and walls and not on your trim. Rope is used to minimize sounds to an indoor level; you will only hear the sounds of your playing happy kids not a squeaking metal chain. \n\nSafety Tested and Certified to ASTM standards\nGym1 provides top notch safety for your loved ones. The Gym1 has been tested and certified according to the ASTM International Standards for home playground equipment.",
