He is autistic, and has sensory issues with clothing. He has had no issues with this onesie. In the several months since I bought it, he has worn it practically every night. It has held up fantastically to a few washings a week and is very well-constructed. He loves the monkeys because his favorite thing is animals. Thank you for selling such a great product!",

The xxl is just tall enough to be comfy but it's no where near \"super baggy\". By the way the xl did fit my size other than the height but again it's not baggy like they claim.",

I also wish it was better made for the price. I'm just being honest.",
