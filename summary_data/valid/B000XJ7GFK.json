And of course, the right price. Honestly, for this price this watch is well worth every penny! I\u2019ve seen some folks say the gold tarnished or scratches on the bottom so I\u2019ll have to update if so. Honestly I have tons of friends with MK watches and I haven\u2019t seen that be the case for any of them...so we\u2019ll see! Overall, this is a great buy and I\u2019m super happy to start rocking it solo and with some bracelets:)",
