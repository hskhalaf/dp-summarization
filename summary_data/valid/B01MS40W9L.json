You get two pieces of the whole setup: a case for the upper section (the screen) and another one for the bottom part. It is also easy to put on. The only one minor issue I have is the non-vibrant picture and color quality on the printed image which seems to be a departure from the advertised ones. Overall this is a good buy for minimalist MacBook Pro users",

This cover is meant to protect from scratches and spills; probably won't do much protecting if laptop gets dropped.

No lights or anything because newer MacBook does not have light on the lid! But why is mine is being cut out rather than 100% covered with white??? I am not quite happy with the way the graphics looked like. The Apple cut out took over nearly all white colors in the center making whole thing more muted than what it is shown for other perhaps smaller laptop size. Seller could have stated that no lights. I'll look for different design elsewhere since the galaxy is boring....",

Kind of bummed the \"paint/color\" of the top design doesn't curl down, leaving a white border across the edge all around. I'll probably dye it so the color matches.

Watch out for that if you are a stickler for fingerprints (natural body oils stick on like crazy)... I'm bummed that I can't return this.

      "text": "After owning this for a little over 4 months I need to buy one again. The hooks are all broken so now there is nothing to hold it in place on the Mac. One of my first troubles came when I bought a multi port adapter and it wouldn\u2019t work because the case prevented it from fitting into the usb-c ports. It comes with two usb, hdmi, rj45 ports on one side and the other side has two usb-c that fits into the macs ports but with the case it won\u2019t fit. Keep that in mind when buying any case. This is a very nice case but with very bad quality material.",

When resting your arms on the Mac your arms will start hurting because the latches are rough and will cause a dent in your forearm. And if you want to take off the bottom to change the case it is very difficult. I almost broke it. I wish this case had a more rubber feel because when you life up the Mac it is slippery. I have almost dropped my Mac a couple times. If you are the type of person who likes design over quality this case is for you.",

UPDATE: It has been just under a year, and my MacBook Pro crashed, and when I took it in for service they needed the case off. The case had previously been cracking periodically around the edges and coming off in pieces, but it was doing a good job protecting it. However, when I had to take it completely off for the service tech it was almost impossible to get off and just crumbled into pieces. So, I will be looking for another case for my MacBook Pro.

This minor tweak would do a lot to keep the Macbook it's on protected completely.",
