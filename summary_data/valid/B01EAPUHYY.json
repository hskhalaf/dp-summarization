The 3D functionality works great with the generic glasses i found on Amazon and the remote is great since my projector is mmounted to the roof of a book case. My picture size is around 6ft by 10ft and is the closest thing to a theatre i can get. A great purchase for those not wanting to go full 4k, which i think it not worth the difference since that tech is just in its infancy.",

Now the cons... the digital zoom doesn't save so if you mount it somewhere that requires use of the digital zoom you'll have to do that every time you power it back on.
