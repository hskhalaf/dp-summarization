I have been using this CPU in my personal desktop computer for six months, and it has been working great and stepping up to all the challenges that my not-too-overwhelming workload has been able to throw at it. I'd highly recommend it for anyone on a budget; there certainly are more powerful CPUs that can do a lot more, but at this price you can't beat this one! Thank you.",

The other machine is built for more graphic gaming and the cpu rarely ramps up to full load under heavy gaming.
