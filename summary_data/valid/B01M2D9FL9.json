However, it opens like a charm, is beautifully constructed, closes equally easily and best of all, the canopy is designed such that it almost folds itself back up into its original shape--NO OTHER UMBRELLA EVEN COMES CLOSE! The only ding is that it is not quite as large a diameter as promised (could be the ordering process)--but not small enough to cause me to get out a measuring tape. Oh, and the cover is equally well designed and slips (not crams itself) over the umbrella. Where have these been all our lives!?!",

Only negative is that it's only really suited to one (small) person, so if your planning on traveling with family, buy at least three. Great stuff, look forward to my next rainy adventure.",

It did invert a couple of times during strong gusts of wind, but it flipped back easily and with no damage to the umbrella. I've had other push-button open/close umbrellas, but this one's push-button function is a lot smoother. I would definitely purchase this umbrella again, not only for myself but for my family and friends.",

I find this umbrella blows out (reverses) in high winds way less than others.

But if you've managed to keep a couple umbrellas until they're falling apart, however long or short that may be, you might want to consider paying a little extra for better quality. It's a compact design, but not quite purse size. It easily fits into the side pocket on my laptop back. The cloth material feel softer than most umbrellas, possibly from a tighter weave, or just nicer material. And the metal bits are thicker a more sturdy than a regular umbrella.",

Two people might have to walk in very close proximity, but the curved design also makes walking next to another person with a separate umbrella work really well. The material is soft, not that slick feeling material that is used for most umbrellas. It stands up to wind well, and opens and closes very quickly.

This umbrella is small enough to easily fit in my bag, yet large enough, and sturdy enough, to keep me dry during a howling Chicago cloudburst. The sturdiness is worth mentioning again. This umbrella held up in a whipping wind, keeping its shape and not turning inside-out. I like the auto retracting feature as well. I'd not experienced this before.",

The interior is striking, with a black center shaft and nine black ribs that look a lot classier than the usual silver-toned ones. An additional feature I really like is the heft of the handle, and that it isn't circular, but instead slightly oval, which makes it fit the hand really comfortably. Although I've only owned it for a few weeks and haven't gotten to test it in a real downpour, I'd say it's the nicest umbrella I've probably ever owned.",

The build seems sturdy, it dries quickly, and it's got a satisfying whoosh when it opens. As others have noted, it's a little heavy and tough to close, but that's no big deal for a hulking strongman such as myself. I have a good feeling about this one.",
