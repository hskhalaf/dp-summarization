      "text": "I own 4 whiteface rats and a WF reissue. Been using them since 83 as a full time musician. I only use rat pedals for soloing. I always wanted more headroom and perhaps more bass or \"filter\" as they call it. This solves the problem, as it will run from 9-18 volts. I use a 12 v supply on it, and do not need the \"fat\" switch as the headroom allows for lower frequencies. Natural compression, socketed IC (installed a well used LM308N), and LED (what the WF has been missing). This will be a classic. Its taller than the WF rat, so you may miss the switch on stage a couple of times before you get used to it.",

There's basically mud or scratchy fizzy fuzz that sounds like it wants to be death metal but it just sounds horrible. It was super durable though. I could beat someone to death with this brick of a pedal and I guarantee you it'd still work like it's brand new... But that doesn't mean it's worth using.

I am a recreational player that leans toward older style pedals that are pretty much outdated and irrelevant to modern day pedals. This pedal works great on it's own or can get along with multiple others on your board. Take a chance & go for it!",

Dial down the Distortion knob, dial Filter up to 2 o'clock and you get Jeff Beck and John Scofield tones from it. Turn Distortion up to 4 o'clock for thick early Sabbath, and as you dial back on Filter, the tone gets sharper for 80's rock tones. It has been fun seeing how many signatures tones it can produce. Sounds great with my Fender and Marshall amps, using SC or HB pickups. My trusty Monte Allums-modded Blues Driver sounds awful next to this. If you're looking for a versatile dirt box that sounds great and is affordable, you can't go wrong with this one.",
