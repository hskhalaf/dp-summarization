      "text": "I tried 2 other highly-regarded fish oil supplements in the past and never noticed the benefits that I've been experiencing since consuming the Dr. Tobias brand. I have had more mental clarity and a \"balanced\" outlook on life which i didn't have with either of the previous 2 brands. In addition, the dosage of those brands was the same as this product, and I was taking 2 of those capsules per day. With Dr. Tobias, I only take 1 capsule per day and it has made a positive difference in my overall well-being. I highly recommend this brand of fish oil!",
