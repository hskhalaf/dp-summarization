The bottom line is that this set of \"tools\" is high on gimmicks, low on value, and a waste of system resources.",

Like the core 2002 base, it maintained its traditional AntiVirus, Utilities, CleanSweep, and Ghost components. Overall, it remains a good software, but surely not a-must-have upgrade, especially if you are happy with an earlier version that is not more than three years old. However, for new intending users and those with versions older than three years, grab it if you can. The price is not out of reach.",
