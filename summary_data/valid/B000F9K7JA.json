The instructions say to blow up the tube and then use your finger to hold the air in until you can close the valve, but since it only takes 3-4 breaths to blow up the tube, any air that escapes makes a big impact! When floating on it, you can see the air bubbles escaping under water.",

It is on the bottom of the float so no big deal but no 5 star rating due to these two issues. Float is comfortable and easily handles adult swimmers.",

When you lie on it, it keeps your body buoyant while you are immersed in about an inch or two of water. It is like floating on a cloud. I can't believe I paid the same amount for some crappy bouncy house raft that started leaking in two places after 2 or 3 trips to the pool. If you want to relax in a pool, get one of these - STAT!",
