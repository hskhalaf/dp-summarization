I thought the spikes on this might be too rough but I was willing to give it a try, but it is perfect. This product really does work awesome and doesn't cut me like my own nails. It is nice to have two sides, I mostly use the shorter spikes but the longer spikes are great as well. It is smaller than I though, but so far that has been great because I took it on travel with me. When you pull it out all the way it is strong. Really like this product and recommend it.",

The handle is so lightweight, it's difficult to get enough pressure. Still, it's not bad. The handle retracts, which is nice. I haven't had it for very long, but it's not so light weight as to break easily. Still, if I pulled it out to full extension, it wouldn't take much to bend it in half.

Until now, she loves the catus, although she has limited mobility with her arms the catus allows her to reach everywhere and the extra large scratching nubs (not sure what they're really called) bring relief. I will definitely buy a new one if its ever needed.",
