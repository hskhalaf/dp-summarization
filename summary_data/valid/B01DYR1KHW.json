      "text": "I\u2019d give this a 3 Star. The product looks great, the lift top mechanism works fantastic even with a bunch of weight on it. However the bottom and shelf of the unit as it attaches to either side/legs is junk. Once you put it down somewhere don\u2019t move it! Usually when using cam locks one side screws into a hole and the otherside goes into the cam then gets tight when the cam is turned. In this case the screw assembly just slides in and out of the hole. It\u2019s completely lose. So if you try and move the table the sides will separate from bottom. I don\u2019t see this lasting longer than 6mo to a year.",

To fix this, you need additional metal brackets (4G) for each of the bottom legs (see the video). It needs a minimum of 2 people to assemble without breaking the parts.

It not easy to assemble for a girl, but for a man maybe lol. The table has good qualities and it isn\u2019t cheap fragile material. If you are delicate or take care of your stuff this should last you some time lol. It is awesome for eating while watching tv and doing late night studying. Just buy the dam thing picture are a thousand words, and not going to type it lol.",

For the price I thought it would feel cheap and college dormy, but that is not the case at all.

My son dropped a piece of it when I was putting it together and that caused the screw to go clean through and chipped the oak looking top layer. We were able to glue it back on, but this is pretty typical of sauder furniture. It you want amazing quality you should definitely invest in a solid wood table.",

Benefits: There are a lot of steps/time consuming but assembly is easy to follow. The table feels really solid and looks nice. The opening feature feels sturdy and the transition into the open position moves smoothly. The only downside I noticed: The surface top surface scratches relatively easily. It has been used lightly (no kids in the home) and has a couple marks that won\u2019t go away. I think a touch up pen may fix this (?)",

In terms of look, it looks great and the rustic-wood look is awesome. I did have a wood crack on the top piece when I got it, but Sauder immediately sent a new top once I called. Definitely recommend.",

Quality is great on this for the price and we just ordered the matching TV stand with the fireplace conversion kit to go in the center. Would definitely recommend!",
