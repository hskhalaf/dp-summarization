The word intuitive has been thrown around a lot but the controls on these are actually intuitive. Now I never have to carry my phone at the gym, I just set music playing and i can easily skip or pause from the headset while im wearing it. Easily. They're comfortable, more breathable than any other pair ive seen, the sound quality is excellent, the colors are great, they fold, they are tight enough to stay on while i move, but not too tight.",

Sound quality is good, the touch controls work well (although during overhead movements if my arm bumps them they activate the controls and I have to bump them again). Only complaint is that the fabric is not that comfortable and actually feels kind of scratchy. Sound quality is good for the price and the battery life goes forever. Took a sec to get synced up to my Samsung Galaxy 7 but after that haven't had a problem.",

On the downside, the swipe interface is a little wonky, sometime when I try to increase volume, I'll inadvertently skip ahead a track. Also, the charging port is super finicky. It only works with a few of the cables I have, and even then it's a struggle to get it to connect.",
