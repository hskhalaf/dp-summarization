I got these shoes in 9.5M and they are perfect. The insoles are very comfortable (I am on my feet much of the day). The leather is surprisingly soft and comfortable from the beginning. I almost want to order a 2nd pair to hold on to in case Red Wing ever stops making these. I've given up on the crappy $80-$100 made in \"insert developing country\" fake leather with glued on sole shoes. These shoes breath so much better than most of my shoes because they are full grain natural leather.",

      "text": "I listened to all the reviews and sized down one size from my typical shoe size of 9.5 however, they were way too small especially in the toe box. I have other Red Wings boots including the Heritage Moc Toe size 9 and Heritage Iron Rangers in 9.5 which is my typical shoe and boot size. From reading the reviews, it seemed like a no-brainer to opt for a smaller shoe but they were at least a size too big and I had to return. I think you should go get these particular shoes sized at a physical location as they don't feel the same as any other Red Wings I've owned.",

The shoe is very well made and comfortable. You have the protection of a boot while still having comfort. Just remember that when they tell you they run big, they do.

I suggest trying it in the store and then buying on amazon as the Red Wing store is selling it at original price of 200 usd +",
