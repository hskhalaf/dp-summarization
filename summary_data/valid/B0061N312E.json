When I searched for a replacement Soleus this model comes up instead. I figured how much different could it be? A lot it turns out. This one smells when its on, the front center piece gets very hot and could burn you, your kids, or your pets. It doesn't reflect nearly as much heat as the Soleus did and is much cheaper made.",

The other detriment is that it has two levels of heat, but no thermostatic adjustment so that it can control itself based on temperature. This is a cheap item, I would not buy another.",

If you are wondering if it will turn itself off if accidentally tipped over (maybe by a pet or child), the answer is yes. It has a pressure switch on the base that causes it to automatically turn off if the unit is not sitting upright.",

Oh high heat, THE FULL COILS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GLOW, they have even placed a sticker on the unit to this effect. Please read explanations elsewhere for the reason - but ignore the reviews complaining about not all coils lighting up when on \"high\". Unit is virtually silent and quite effective.
