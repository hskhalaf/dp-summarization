My granddaughter loves them and to make it easy for her I put them all on an ironing board (no cover of course) and have it adjusted for her height where she can stand or sit in her little chair to play. Perfect for all these little magnetic pieces!",

We end up using a ziplock bag to tote around for vacation or to keep entertained out to dinner. Just picked up Sophia and Peppa from a friend so I\u2019m sure the kids will continue their love. Some peices are very small though so not good for Kids that continue to put things in their mouth. My 2.5 YO is hit or miss so we have to watch her with these closely. Would definitely recommend and buy again.",

I'm glad there's a company making toys that you can pass down through generations, like the things my mom and dad played with and passed down to me. I loved paper dolls growing up, but they always ended up tearing. These magnetic dress-up wooden dolls are a great alternative to traditional paper dolls. It's also nice that they sell Disney princesses and not generic characters too, because kids want to play with their favorite characters and these were a big hit with my Disney-loving nieces.",

The quality is what you would expect for the price, the items did not have sharp edges and did not break easily but then again kids lose interest fast. So please before you spend money on them make sure your kid will take care of them and enjoy them for years to come as I said earlier sturdy but has to be someone who will want to \"dress up\" the dolls. Neat idea :D",
