      "text": "I have found these little nuggets to be the BEST cleaner for toilet bowls. I had some staining in one of my newer toilets due to the extremely low flush volume. I tried cleanser, CLR, toilet bowl cleaners, hand scrubbing.... yet the stain persisted though diminished. I had these for my laundry (which are great for brightening clothes without harsher chemicals) so I tried one in the toilet bowl. Voila! Stains are gone. This is now my go-to for bowl cleaning in my house. I like that they are an alternative to bleach and better for the environment. And they work! You can use them to soak whites for a while to brighten them even more. Great product.",

I realize that this is an unusual reaction to something that's fragrance free and supposedly hypoallergenic but there's something in it that he's allergic to. We haven't had this problem with name-brand OxyClean, even the stuff with the fragrance. It's well past the time to return it so I'll end up finding someone to give it to.",
