      "text": "The light fixture is fine, it replaced the same one I already had but it broke when a sofa was delivered. Unfortunately the bracket was not included and it did not line up to the existing bracket. of course i did not know this when i scheduled an electrician to install the fixture. so my electrician somehow rigged it to stay on the wall but it is by no means secure. I'm sure it will fall off as soon as someone bumps it.",
