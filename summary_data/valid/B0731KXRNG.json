Great quality and appearance for the price, very sturdy despite foldable design. I also love that you get deeper storage with these because the bench runs all the way to the ground instead of a shallower storage with legs like some other ones I saw on amazon.

My dogs use it as a step to the bed and I use it to sit on while I put my shoes and socks on. As a plus, I now have more storage!",

Feels sturdy, but the panels are relatively thin around the sides so I question it... but there again I'm a pretty skeptical guy. It works perfectly for what we bought it for, and I even thought of getting a couple others of different colors to match the various bed sets we have because they're so easy to setup and take down. They really don't take up much room, if any really, when they're folded up.",

These have a divider in them so you can separate things. Lastly I was worried with as easy as they were to set up that they wouldnt make a good bench.... I was wrong. Both my daughter and i sat on it together and it held our weight and didnt wobble. Her and I combined weigh about 200lbs.",

The bench part of this is great because it is soft and serves as a great place to sit or put other toys and stuff animals on. I actually liked this so much that I ordered one in purple for my daughter's room and one in grey for my room. I'm hoping those will be just as great. I actually ended up selling three people on these the night I used mine and raved about it on social media. Seriously a great purchase in my eyes.",

When I first opened it and saw that it folds together I was skeptical about how sturdy it would be, but once put together it can take well over my 170Ibs. Plus storing things like blankets inside is just great and it matches my furniture very well and looks 4 times more expensive than it is. I\u2019ll be ordering a second one now , what a great buy!",
