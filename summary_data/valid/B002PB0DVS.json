We've camped in all kinds of weather and climate in the last 6 years with children using the tent and testing everything. This tent continues to hold up great, we have not had to make any repairs whatsoever. The zippers have gotten stuck a few times but easily came loose with no damages. We are getting a bigger tent because our family has grown but this tent has really proven itself. We just went camping in alpine Sierra Nevada mountains last week! Great little tent for a couple or small family.",

Four zippers and two doors for the entrance. It's ridiculous, I couldn't even get my full size mattress in/out barely. I've had Wenzel products last me almost 30 years but this one is garbage and is poorly designed. Waiting on my refund now!",

We spent just one night in the woods, but the tent was great. It even survived an afternoon storm with no leaking whatsoever. There was plenty of room for our family of four -- but our kids are just 1 and 4. I think with older kids you might want more room.

Looks like enough space for a couple twin air mattresses and maybe then even a little room. Good ventilation and has storage pockets which are great for sunglasses and cellphones.

It's a little over 10lb, which is pretty damn light for a tent this size, so if you split the weight among 4 campers, it makes for a decent 2.5lb/person.

    "title": "Wenzel Pine Ridge Tent - 5 Person",
    "description": "This lightweight (11. 51 lbs.) tent is designed for the sport of backpacking. Experience camping nirvana with the bestselling, highly versatile Pine Ridge 5-person tent that turns shelter into an outdoor suite.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSpacious and weather-resistant, the Wenzel Pine Ridge 10-by-8-foot dome tent sleeps four to five campers in its two rooms, making it ideal for small families or couples with lots of gear. The Pine Ridge is made of rugged, weather-repellent Weather Armor polyester with a polyurethane coating for reliability, helping it keep water out and warmth in. The sonic-sealed, polyethylene tub-style floor, meanwhile, is welded and not sewn, eliminating needle holes that might otherwise attract water seepage. And campers will love the variety of ventilation points--including two mesh doors, one mesh window, and a mesh roof--which combine to create a refreshing cross breeze on warm evenings. \n\n The Pine Ridge is also easy to set up, with shock-corded fiberglass poles and grommet pole attachments. And when it comes time to hit the sheets, you can either create one large sleeping room or roll down the divider curtain to create two separate rooms. The rooms can function as individual bedrooms for the campers or as a sleeping room and living area. Other details include a hooped fly at the front and rear for weather protection, two hanging pockets for storage, and a storage duffel. \n\n Specifications:\n\n * Base: 10 by 8 feet \n * Center height: 60 inches \n * Area: 80 square feet \n * Capacity: 4 to 5 people \n * Carrying weight: 11.9 pounds \n * Warranty: 10 years \n\n Amazon.com Tent Guide \nSelecting a Tent\nFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind: \n\n Expect the Worst\nIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all-purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in. If you're a backpacker, alpine climber, or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to buy something designed to handle more adversity. \n\n Three- and Four-Season Tents\nFor summer, early fall, and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three-season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are specifically designed for summer backpacking or other activities. Many premium tents will also feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain fly for enhanced waterproofing. \n\n For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four-season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive. \n\n Domes and Tunnels\nTents are broadly categorized into two types: freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and tents that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being lighter. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome. \n\n Size Matters\nAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters. \n\n Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.",
