The shoes are very comfortable,however the quality of the build and material is very disappointing, specially given the price. I have been on two walks (adjusting to the zerodrop) and one very short run, and notice extensive wear on the shoes' bottom. I have been a runner for over 30 years and I heave never seen wear on any of my shoes like this. Kind of makes u want to ask, did they even test their product for durability? while also question the rest of their product line",

      "text": "Free your feet. This is a great choice if you like and need substantial cushioning. I really enjoy these and they are the second pair I've bought. If you've considered trying this new style of footwear and want a cushioned sneaker, give these a go. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just remember, to give them a couple days of wearing around the house before you decide you don't like them, if you're trying Altras for the first time. It's a different sensation for your feet to actually be able to have your toes spread out and relax. Perfect shoes for wider feet also.",

That actually feels nice initially, but after a few hours my feet are screaming to escape. It does not bother me for running and hiking, but when I stop it's trouble, so the shoes are only usable when active for me, and I prefer shoes that are good for all round use.",
