I'm 58 with fine lines and wrinkles and this product has changed my skin texture to a smooth, soft surface. I would recommend to not use in the AM, but as a PM serum under your moisturizer. Give about 10-15 minutes before a moisturizer. You will wake up with renewed skin. The scent isn't the best, but I'm getting used to it.",

The first time I did it I didn't read the instructions and wound up with a face full of oil. :( You need to clean your face first, then use only a little, rub between your hands, and then press against the areas you are looking treat.
