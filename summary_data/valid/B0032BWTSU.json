It is incredibly deep, wellmade, doesn\u2019t show watermarks, cleans well, and shows well. I like to put the dirty dishes in one side and the cleaned dishes to be rinsed in the other. When I\u2019m processing food, I work in one side and food scraps (skins, peels etc) go in the other. The deep wells give me room to move! I paired it with a Kohler Simplice faucet and I have gotten rave compliments on my kitchen. Do not hesitate to get this sink.",

That is the one thing I hate about stainless steel is that they scratch easily. You will need to dry the sink if you dont want it to show spots, which I do if I have company coming. It came with the 2 stainless steel guards/racks that sit in the sink which I have used to set big pots to dry on. Love this sink.",

      "text": "We bought this sink in 2015, and it's the best sink we ever had. The bottom grates protect the finish from scratches, and the bowls are large enough to hold a 10-inch frying pan lying flat on the bottom. When we wash dishes the deep bowls allow using a large amount of water without splashing out. With normal care, the sink still glistens when we wipe it down after use. No scratches, no dents. The heavy steel construction and the sound-deadening pads eliminate the reverberations that many stainles steel sinks produce. If we buy another house, we're certainly going to equip it with this Krause sink. (I didn't install the sink myself, so I can't attest to ease of installation.)",

Packaging was phenomenal, you would have to run over it with a truck to dent it, and the accessories like the dry racks and the included basket strainers with removable strained made this a heck of a deal. The sounded deadening on the bottom is substantial as well, zero \"ting\" with this sink. It puts $500 teka sinks to shame. Will definitely order again.",

      "text": "I absolutely agree with the other comments associated with this sink - sturdy, great quality, great look. However, in my opinion, the best part of the sink is the super deep removable strainer that sits below the drain stopper. I can fill the sink up with water, do the dishes, etc. and when it comes time to drain the dish water I can simply yank the stopper out and not worry about little chunks of food slipping by the strainer. When it's time to clean the strainer, there's a little handle that makes pulling it out easy. It seems like a minor feature - but I wouldn't give it up at this point!",

The corrosion-resistant surface is further protected from rust and oxidation by a meticulous finishing process. Commercial-grade satin finish and gently rounded corners make maintenance as simple as wiping the surface with a damp cloth. Equally at home in a transitional and modern kitchen, this double bowl sink provides a lifetime of functionality. The 50/50 split basin adds flexibility for a variety of kitchen tasks.
