We went on a 1100mile each way motorcycle trip on the Road Glide. We stopped many places for fun, drove fast and caught rain. Overall we heard each other great even over 60, 70 mph. I withheld rain and wind. I have a 21-22 head circumference but needed an XL would have loved to be able to go even bigger. We contacted the seller to upgrade our size to XL and it was done with no problem so great customer service. DOT approved and great price.",

I would recommend getting the biggest one (xl) if you have a big head, the helmets are tight to break in on the forehead and seem to run half a size smaller than normal. The intercom function has good range (like 3-5 football fields in scattered line of sight , and gives progressively more static as you approach the range limit... plenty of warning you are getting too far away.",

The helmet fits, but I can feel pressure points on long rides. I would buy this helmet again given all the options.",
