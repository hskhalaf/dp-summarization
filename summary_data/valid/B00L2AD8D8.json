      "text": "I use these smoking pellets along with the A-maz'n 12\" smoker tube. I put about half a cup of pellets of my choice in the tube, place them on my propane grill gate and light them with a propane torch. Let burn 2-3 minutes and blow out the flame. Put the meat, fish, cheese or nuts of your choice on the top shelf of your grill and close the lid. The pellets will burn for 2-3 hours and they impart a wonderful smoky flavor to anything you wish. It's a quick and flavorful way to get that \"low and slow\" smoke flavor when you just have enough time to grill your meal in the normal fashion.",

SMH. I used these in my Char-broil big easy 3 in 1 and was very surprised at the amount of smoke these produced in comparison to your traditional wood chips. I've always had problems with keeping the embers lit at lower temperatures (Under 325\u00b0F) in the big easy but, these allowed me to maintain about 250\u00b0F with a lot of smoke. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's a little pricey.",

First wood chips either burn up quick or are hard to get going after soaking and the flavor from wood chips seems hit or miss. These burn steady once lit and the flavor is constant with all of them except the JD wasn't that impressive. All the rest were amazing and I will retry the JD again down the road as I still have a half bag. Moving forward I will only use wood pellets. I even ordered the smaller 4 bag deal for my Dad for Father's day as the 6 pack was going to take too long to get to him.",

These are small bags & each one does about one good smoke with a little left over (but not enough for another smoker session). So, don\u2019t expect a huge quantity but it is a fantastic way to try a variety of pellets.",

    "title": "BBQrs Delight Wood Smoking Pellets - Super Smoker Variety Value Pack - 1 Lb. Bag - Apple, Hickory, Mesquite, Cherry, Pecan and Jack Daniel's",
    "description": "Included in this BBQr's Delight wood smoker pellet super variety pack is the 6 most popular wood smoking pellets. These food-grade wood pellets are the fastest and easiest way to give your food smoke flavor on any gas, charcoal or electric outdoor cooker. \n\nApple pellets are made of 100% Apple wood. Apple is a sweet, fruity smoke and is the strongest of all the fruit woods. It's perfect for grilling beef, pork, ham, poultry, fish or wild game. \n\nHickory pellets are the most common and popular smoke wood pellet used in barbecuing. They are made out of 100% hickory wood and produce a stronger flavor that complements all meats.\n\nJack Daniel's pellets are made from the used mellowing charcoal from the Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee. This charcoal is soaked in whiskey for weeks before exchanging for a fresh batch of charcoal. The charcoal is mixed with oak wood and processed into wood pellets for BBQ smoking.\n\nCherry pellets are made with 100% Cherry wood. Cherry gives you a mild sweet fruity smoke that gives a rosy tint to lighter meats.\n\nMesquite pellets are made of 100% mesquite. This southwestern favorite produces a very distinctive smoke and stronger smoke flavor.\n\nPecan pellets are made of 100% Pecan wood. Pecan is very similar to hickory but milder and sweeter with a nut after-taste.\n\nOnly 1/3 of a cup of pellets is needed for most cooking events. When used as directed you have enough pellets for 60 cooking events.\n\nYou can use the wood flavored pellets individually or experiment and make your own \"special blend\" by combining different pellet flavors for whatever meat you want to enhance the flavor of. \n\nSince pellets have been processed from sawdust by pressure which generates heat, any contaminants present in the wood are eliminated.",
