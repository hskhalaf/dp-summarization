First, it gets clogged EVERY TIME I use it. See where the hose connects to the machine? See that sharp curve? Every time I vacuum something gets caught there. It does next to nothing on carpets and the attachment it comes with doesn't work well on hard floors. I had to buy something extra for that. It's a pain in the neck to empty and reattach. I'm getting angry just typing this review.",

I was skeptical about the retractable cord because I've had other products where the retractable cord binds and gets stuck causing you to try over and over again to get the cord to fully retract. Not so with this product...it successfully retracts every time. I only have one gripe with this particular model. Where the suction tube for the vacuum attaches to the base seems a bit flimsy. It's just a small plastic slot that it slides into. There is a bit of play so the suction tube doesn't feel firmly in place. When I'm pushing it around my house I worry that I'm going to break the mounting clip.",

I have 3 dogs, 2 of which are german shepherds, and this thing not only pulls up all their hair off the carpet, but pulls out a significant amount of dirt that I never knew was there. It's pretty compact and the wand collapses for storage and portability. My only complaint is that I fill the canister very quickly. I basically have to empty it after vacuuming every room, because overfilling the canister affects suction. I attribute this primarily to my dogs. It would probably be fine for someone with fewer or no pets. If I had it to over, I probably would've purchased the Dyson Big Ball.",
