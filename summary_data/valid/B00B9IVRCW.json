The following weekend I loaded up and headed out of town, I ran the jack a total of three times. When I got home and started to unhook the trailer I ran the jack. I could hear the gear box running but the leg wasn't moving. I had to use the manual crank to get it off. I have no idea what happened between leaving the camp spot and home. I'm going to return it for a replacement, I do like the features....",

I have only had this installed for a month and have not gone on any trips yet but will update this review after the summer if there are any issues. It was pretty easy to install. The hardest part was making sure the camper was blocked well enough to take the tongue load. After that - just 3 bolts to unbolt the manual crank jack and the reuse those bolts to bolt on this power jack. Remember to use the washer that comes with the kit so it grounds properly. I then just wired directly to the batter using the inline fuse.",

I keep the weather protection bag over the top all the time, hasn't deteriorated in the few years I've had it. I don't take it off for operation, just push the switch through the material.

I wished I would have got a different one seems cheap and I reached out to the company about light no response! I think I will return it. Easy to install little slow but it works definitely not overbuilt lol sometimes you get what you pay for!",

I wish the fuse were in-line didn't want to drill a hole to mount a fuse. No big deal. Pay attention to marking on fuse housing. Lead end to battery. Load end to jack. Mine came with a nice quality cover and has a level built in. Great value",

My only concern is that there is no on/off switch for the lift action, so I'm worried about when my 3 year old discovers that the switch does fancy things. There is a second switch that turns on a little white LED that could be very helpful when parking at night.",

The wiring however requires you to provide two connectors one to install the in-line fuse to the power line and another to connect the fuse wire to the battery post. The instructions for the fuse are vague. One fuse wire is marked \"line\"-this side is attached to the power source (battery). The other is marked \"load\". This is attached to the jacks power line. I wrapped all my connections with electrical tape and tucked them under my battery cover away from the terminals and secure. I am very pleased with the product just wish suppliers paid more attention to providing detailed instructions.",
