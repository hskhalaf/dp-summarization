I have included a picture of the big hunks of paper that I pulled out of the shredder when I had to take it apart after it kept jamming. I did not come close to putting 12 sheets of paper in it that it claims it could handle. I also used lubricating sheets which seem to make no difference. My last shredder lasted for years (not a Bonsaii) so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s me. I wish I had my $75 back. Not to mention the time I\u2019ve spent unjamming it.",

Later on its says: \"To protect the machine, we suggest the following use pattern: work 2 minutes then rest 30 minutes....\" I also note the instruction Manual has lines on the side of the print similar to a word document that is being edited.

My old shredder did not have this and it was hard, even with nails, to remove the engine to empty the bin. This model is smaller than my old, office supply store model. It is nice looking all around so that you can leave it by the side of your desk or fits underneath a cabinet without taking much space. As far as the noise level, it's loud but it is a shredder. I feel this a great value and would recommend this product.",

When I finished, yes it did finish, I flipped it over and saw all the paper stuck in the motor already. I felt, if it's already sounding struggling within the first few trying, I better find a different one. I returned it. Maybe Its how it is or maybe I got a bad one. Not sure.",

      "text": "I purchased this item to replace an old Fellowes shredder that did not have a removable drawer. I am very disappointed in this purchase. The light that indicates a paper jam is the same light for overheating. By the time that light goes off, the shredder is so jammed, it needs major time and effort to get it going again. I am talking 45-60 minutes to remove the jam. The frame of the machine is so fragile that one wheel broke off while moving it across a tile floor. I truly regret not spending the extra $$ to buy a comparable Fellowes machine. Live and learn.",

This one is shorter than the other, so it is less likely to \"teeter\". It's not as heavy as my previous two, which I like, and my favorite feature is the handle on top! There's nothing worse than having to lift a heavy lid to empty the bin with nothing to grip. I haven't tested the capability of credit card shredding but it handled my usual stuff just fine. Should anything change, I'll update this review.",

Slightly less noise than my previous one, but I'm not sure I would agree that it's quiet, per se. It is cross cutting & there will be shredding noise. I personally do not feel it is worth the high price, but the offer had a discount coupon & I had a gift card. I ended up paying much less. Oversll , it works well & hasn't jammed.",

      "title": "Great, quiet shredder!!",
      "text": "This shredder is one of the quietest shredders I have ever used. The shredder handles its 14 paper max with ease and I have not encountered any jams while using it, even when shredding 8-10 sheets of thick stock paper. The cross cut is not as fine as some other shredders I have used, but it is fine for my home use. And the best thing about the shredder is how quiet it is, you hear a slight whine from the motors, but the loudest thing while using this shredder is the sound of the blades cutting into the paper which is not loud at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone using this for any non commercial purposes",

The shredder met all of my requirements and it was easy to just keep shredding. It is important to follow the instructions regarding the shred time. Although I will say that the warning light did not come on in any time prior to the machine shutting down. Overall, it is a good shredder for handling regular everyday junk mail.",

It shreds much finer than my previous shredder and therefore even though smaller doesn't require any more frequent emptying of the basket. I think it's a great value for the money.",
