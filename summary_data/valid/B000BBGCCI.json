I am using it to transfer vinyl albums to my computer. On playback of the WAV files I produced I could not tell I wasn't playing directly from the vinyl. Great product, way better than the cheap USB converters and cheaper than audiophile components whose performance advantage is WAY beyond my ability to hear.",

Also, I noticed the unit is very sensitive to where it is placed in relation to other electronic devices, emitting a faint to loud hum if near any of several devices (including my receiver, a network switch, and a cable box. Apparent lack of shielding on the preamp or these devices, or perhaps both. Otherwise does a nice job, useful gain helped me dial in my turntable volume. Don't really notice much effect of the low-pass filter or just my aging ears. Bothersome brightness on the LED indicators. Overall excellent buy.",

      "text": "I wanted to get back into playing my old albums and needed a preamp to do so because the phono jack of my receiver was not working and could not be fixed. I choose this unit because it would not only serve my purpose but allow me to convert the albums and possibly some cassettes to my ipod. It meets my needs but because it was not clear in the write up that the external power source (other than your PC) was not included. I had to order one separately. I would recommend this unit....if you don't need the power source.",

It keeps the original sound of the record, and i guess that with a little practice you can even lose some of the background noise of LP's. It has a transformer (watch out - it's a 110V), but can use the USB connection as a power supply instead. Now you just need to have the time for converting your beloved records to CD's.",

The USB Phono Plus from ART is the ideal solution for transferring your highly prized vinyl collection to your computer or laptop, and also works great as an audio interface between analog and digital sources.

Optical TOSLINK input and output as well as an S/PDIF input make the USB Phono Plus an ideal analog / digital audio to USB interface as well. Housed in an all aluminum black anodized case, the USB Phono Plus can be powered by either external power supply or directly via USB port. To ensure maximum versatility, the USB Phono Plus is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 specification and uses USB adaptive mode for playback and USB asynchronous mode for record.
