So I bought this and FINALLY my sweet girl could breathe and eat and we could all sleep. I\u2019m seriously buying this for everyone\u2019s baby shower I go to. My baby doesn\u2019t even hate it !",

It provides enough suction to take out any mucus stuck behind throat and or lodged in tiny noses. I recently lost the last silicone tip that came in the original packaging and tried buying replacement ones on Amazon which they did not have. I emailed OCCObaby directly and I was promptly helped and sent replacement tips for free no questions asked. I fully recommend this product not only because it works great but because of its awesome customer service making this product last even longer.",

      "text": "It's always tough when your little one is sick, everyone suffers. This product isn't going to help anyone. Neither of the three tips reach deep enough into the sinuses to effectively remove snot and the suction is insufficient. Sure, the product is simple, you press a button and it begins sucking. Sure, it's easy to disassemble for cleaning purposes BUT you'll NEVER have to clean it because IT DOESN'T WORK. Forget about the battery powered nasal aspirator, what a complete waste. The only good thing about this purchase was that it came with the oral snot sucker, THAT works like a charm.",

The suction is the perfect balance - it actually removes mucous without hurting baby. My little girl is calm while I'm using this, even though she wasn't so calm with other brands.

The only downside to this is it does take some time to get use to be able to get everything out of your LO nose and it seems like the tip is a little big. It may be that it needs to be that wide to get everything out, but I feel like it is still too large in our LO nose. I wish there was a tip that was a little smaller, but overall it does the job once you get used to it.",
