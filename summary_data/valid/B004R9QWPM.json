The graphics are much better at a higher resolution setting, and the characters grow on you... Like a fungus. I bought a logitech wireless pc controller just for this game, and it was well worth it because trying to play this on your keyboard is pretty frustrating. I just got through finishing it all the way to the end, and now I started from the beginning so I can rescue more fuzzles. I told you it was addictive. I highly recommned it!",

Now I get to play it whenever I want on my PC. Please note that if you have Avast Antivirus, you'll need to disable it before you attempt to download this game; otherwise, the contents of the folder that the downloader, erm... downloads to your desktop will be deleted. My installation of Avast kept detecting munch.exe, a necessary executable file for the game to run, as malware. It's just a false positive; munch.exe is harmless. You can probably re-enable Avast once you finish installing the game, but it'll still detect munch.exe and move it to quarantine. If you can, report the file as a false positive when that little pop-up message shows up on the bottom right hand corner of your screen. You'll need information like the name of the file, its publisher, etc. If you want to just play the game, go to the quarantine list in Avast, find the file, right-click on it, select \"restore and add to exclusions\" and you're good to go.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse Afobos5.0 out of 5 stars Great Game!!Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2012Platform: PC DownloadVerified Purchase This is a really great game.
