We haven't been able to take him off his medication, but his digestive problems have greatly decreased with the Proviable. We sprinkle the capsules on his food. He was a little reluctant to eat at first, but that reluctance wore off quickly. Grateful for this product.",

I added Proviable DC to his grain-free food and within a week, the diarrhea was gone. This after close to a year of different treatments. I'll never be without Proviable again.",

None of the others met the taste test, as he has a super sensitive nose, and immediately backed away no matter how deeply the powders etc., were buried. This is the one that has NO added flavoring, which for us is an excellent thing! Thank you Proviable for realizing that some cats don't like strong smells and flavors.",

Our vet recommended the Proviable and I'm glad I can get it on Amazon a bit cheaper than at his office.",
