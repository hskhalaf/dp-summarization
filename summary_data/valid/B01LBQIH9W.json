      "verdict": "This decanter wins on volume and price. One of the only wine aerators we considered that holds more than one bottle, this thick glass Culinaire carafe has a 60.8 ounce capacity, allowing it to comfortably hold two 750 milliliter bottles of wine (or more) at a time, making it ideal for parties and gatherings where you want to aerate a larger amount. Attached glass handle makes for easy pouring.",
      "pros": [
        "Larger size is ideal for bigger bottles of wine or for entertaining",
        "Side handle can make pouring much easier",
        "Right-priced for a beginning aerator"

      "cons": [
        "No warranty information is listed at all, which is risky for a glass item you have shipped",

      "text": "This is visually a nice piece. It doesn't drip too much upon pouring, but you do have to be careful. I only owned this for 5 months, and probably used it about 5 times. After the last use, I noticed hairline cracks where the top of the handle attaches. Consequently, it is now unusable. I was extremely careful, always hand washing and drying. (It is very tedious trying to dry out the inside.) I'm extremely disappointed to have it fail after so few uses and therefore cannot recommend it.",

The crack started out small then it traveled up the neck and became so noticeable and large that we felt it was unsafe to use and threw it away. What a waste!",
