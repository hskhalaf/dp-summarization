They just keep pounding the cage and bend the metal to point where catch fails and they walk out the way they walked in. I am reporting to Amazon every review that says it is good for armadillos, something Havahart should be doing.",

It turns out thoes idiots did have a video. It's just the second half of another video that's starts out about a different model. So if you start the video you will think it's the wing one.

One bit of advice, do a few practice 'releases' before you actually set the trap to make sure your timer works and that you know exactly what to do. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who needs to capture armadillos, racoons, or opossums.",
