One wire wasn't connected properly, which they said happens sometimes during shipping. This machine IS compatible with Nespresso pods, and the espresso is great! I bought a milk frother to make cappuccinos since the machine does not come with one. It is really loud when making espresso, much louder than a keurig, but it works great!",

I noticed the penetration of the capsules is deeper and water runs faster, which would explain the weak consistency, and a consequent lack of pressure would explain the lack of crema.

Also, you cannot tailor your cup size, or re-set it to \"Factory Settings\" either. Also, it seems to make a weaker cup using the exact same pods as the other machine.",

You'll notice the stream slows considerable down because you have presoaked the ground in the capsule. The water pressure will push out more crema. Big difference. Reason to Press lungo (long coffee) instead of corto (short coffee) is because water pump is set to run for set seconds , and if you do the pre-soaking trick, less coffee stream will come out, so you need to run it longer to get the same amount of Coffey you would have gotten of you simply pressed the button.",

Our local coffee shop recently closed and we didn't like the espresso at any of the other shops, so we needed a simple alternative. This Mueller fit the bill exactly. We weren't looking for a lot of features. Just a simply quality machine that is easy to use. So far so good. Not really a gripe, but if I had to say anything it would be nice to have an adjustment for temperature control, but other than that I'm very happy with the purchase. Can't comment on durability at this point.",

Is it great for the budget, space, and ease of use conscious? Yes! I have this at my place of work to have as an afternoon pick me up. I have used a Keurig before purchasing this machine, and I wasn't a fan. The Keurig pods tasted stale and made a weak cup of coffee. I am a latte lover and knew I wanted to step up my afternoon coffee game. Glad I did! It's compact, extremely easy to use, and gives me consistent coffee. It was just what I was looking for at an amazing price.",
