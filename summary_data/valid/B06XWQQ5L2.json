Her toes were hitting the front of the shoe. These are SMALLER than a size down sneaker that she's currently wearing and much more narrow despite being the same type of shoe (Leepz). Not sure what's going on with their sizing as Stride Rite used to be consistent. Unfortunately, had to return.",

He wouldn't even be able to walk across wet grass without getting his socks wet. Sand at the park? Dirt on the baseball field? What a disaster. To the summer version I give one star.",
