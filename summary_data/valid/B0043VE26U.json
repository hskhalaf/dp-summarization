      "title": "Excellent Video Quality - Good Stills Quality",
      "text": "This camera is awesome.... Very easy to figure out with out reading the manual. Once you apply patches to this camera the video quality is just astounding. I also have a Nikon D600 and had several different Canon DSLR's. This camera blows the other cameras out of the water, the only area where the Nikon D600 is better is depth of field and dynamic range. I am referencing video quality not still imaging. I purchased 2 of these strictly for video and I am very happy with my purchase. The other benefit is that I can use all of my Nikon glass and almost any other lens imaginable with the the appropriate adapter. Excellent Video Quality - Highly Recommended",

One of the few things that bugs me though is the interface and the manual- it's meant for consumers. But there are plenty of forums that explain and discuss the best and most useful settings for the GH2. The other thing is that they did not include an AC adaptor- major major sin panasonic!!! We have to shell out for additional stuff that is standard for cams. But hey, the chip is amazing-",

      "text": "I'm giving this a five due to it's affordability and high performance. First off, I'm a newbie to the video DSLR arena - which made the GH2 a great entry level camera. Also the rule of thumb of get a good body and great lenses applies here - the micro 4/3's line up of lenses grows daily which makes the GH2 a perfect entry level approach to getting into prosumer grade videos. Setup is easy, controls are simple to use. Color, image sharpness (with a Summilux 25mm 1.4 lens) is great. I'd forget the kit lenses, just buy the body and save your dollars on glass. Love it!",

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Mirrorless Digital Camera with 3-Inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD [Body Only] (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Size:Body OnlyFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nPANASONIC LUMIX DMC-GH2KBODY COMPACT DIGITAL SINGLE LENS MIRRORLESS (DSLM) CAMERA BODY (NO LENS), 16MP LIVE MOS SENSOR, FULL HD MOVIE, TOUCH LCD, BLACK\n\nASTONISHING LIVE ACTION VIDEO RECORDING CAPABILITIES\nLight Speed AF quickly locks onto fast moving subjects for crisp still and video images (View Larger)The GH2 is perfect for shooting video, with a cinema-like 24Mbps bit rate, a dedicated Cinema Mode, which has been developed to compliment the LUMIX standard Film Mode, and the newly added Variable Movie Mode. This gives the camera considerable live action power. The DMC-GH2 DSLR camera can record high-resolution full-HD 1,920 x 1,080 videos in astonishing smooth 60i (NTSC) / 50i (PAL), doubling the sensor output from 24p / 25p to 60p / 50p. You can create movies with stunning image quality, expressive afterimage, superior gradation and variable frame rates for interesting effects. In addition, the DMC-GH2 features advanced Intelligent Resolution technology. Rather than uniformly enhanced sharpness, advanced Intelligent Resolution precisely optimizes signal processing to give the entire image outstandingly natural clarity and fine detail. As a result, images are naturally clear and crisp in videos as well as in photos.\n\n16.05-MEGAPIXEL LIVE MOS SENSOR\nThe 16.05-megapixel multi-aspect Live MOS sensor produces high image resolution and a high aperture ratio (View Larger)Panasonic has refined its digital imaging technology, improving image quality to a level that matches, and in some cases surpasses, that of traditional DSLR cameras. The newly developed 16.05-megapixel multi-aspect Live MOS sensor has been added to Panasonic's original pixel mix technology. The GH2 is able to achieve both high image resolution and a high aperture ratio thanks to its combination of a top of the line transistor and reduced wiring, which allows for high speed digital circuit performance with low noise. A maximum sensitivity setting of ISO 12800 allows shooting in extremely dark places. \n\nFOCUS SO FAST & SO PRECISE EVEN PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE PLEASED\nLight Speed AF quickly locks onto fast moving subjects for crisp still and video imagesWith Contrast AF (Auto Focus), the image sensor controls your focus giving you a greater range to create your vivid frame. The DMC-GH2K offers a state of the art level Light Speed AF of approx. 0.1 second which is achieved by reducing the detection time for focusing by doubling the drive speed from 60 frames per second to 120 frames per second. With AF Touch, setting and focusing the subject is incredibly easy and quick, never missing the spur-of-the-moment. Additionally, Light Speed AF quickly locks onto a subject, making it possible to capture even fast moving subjects like your son, the dirt bike rider. \n\nTOUCH CONTROL 3.0-INCH FREE-ANGLE LCD\nManage most of the GH2's setting and functions with a touch to the rotating LCD touch screen (View Larger)DMC-GH2 offers touch-control shooting right from the 3.0-inch Free-angle large, 460,000-dot LCD that rotates 180\u00b0 to the side and tilts 270\u00b0 up and down. The auto focus, shutter release and most of the camera's settings are immediately set to the subject with just a tab on the LCD screen making it possible for you to change settings in seconds so that you never miss a shot, even while recording video. Reviewing photos has never been easier, thanks to the GH2's touch control playback and playback zoom. Scroll through images, drag and zoom with a flick of your finger.\n\nIf you prefer the flexibility of manual settings, the DMC-GH2 gives you plenty of options with its touch-enabled manual control. You can tweak aperture, shutter speed, exposure levels, fine white balance, vertical and horizontal alignment easily simply by sliding your finger across the LCD display. Even if you don't have any experience with manual operation you'll be able to master various settings in no time at all. \n\nVENUS ENGINE PRODUCES CLEAR, CRISP PHOTO AND VIDEO IMAGES, REDUCES NOISE AND REGULATES EXPOSURE.\nVenus Engine produces clear, crisp photo and video images, reduces noise and regulates exposure. The GH2 DSLR camera incorporated a Venus Engine featuring exceptional signal processing for photo and video with 3 CPUs and approximately 1.8x processing performance compared to a standard 2 CPU System. High speed burst shooting and smooth video recording in full HD are supported. There is also an advanced noise reduction system that processes chromatic noise and luminance noise separately. Images are reproduced with superior clarity and detail, even when shooting at high ISO levels. The noise reduction process also prevents color mixing around the edges and in gradation areas, applying selective noise reduction to outlines for more naturally balanced photos without sacrificing resolution quality. \n\nIA MODE WITH INTELLIGENT D-RANGE CONTROL\niA Mode automatically sets image optimization functions while D-Range Control ensures optimal lighting. Panasonic has pioneered Intelligent Auto Mode automated processes for compact point-and-shoot cameras, and now applies that trusted technology to the interchangeable lens system G Series. The result is a camera that has all the power and creative control of a DSLR with the ease of use of a compact. Just point, aim and shoot, the most popular image optimization functions are activated, letting you take beautiful photos and videos effortlessly. If you think a digital SLR camera is just too complicated for everyday use, think again. \n\nUneven shadows and highlights can ruin a great picture. Intelligent D-range Control delivers more natural looking photos by optimizing exposure levels for different parts of each image to help preserve gradation and fine detail. There is a backlight compensation feature that is automatically activated when the camera senses a subject against a backlight. You don't have to worry about adjusting lighting conditions, Intelligent D-range Control handles these issues with ease so you can capture beautiful shots in low light, bright sunlight or nighttime, no matter where your subject is located. \n\nADVANCED INTELLIGENT RESOLUTION MAXIMIZES SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR STILL AND VIDEO IMAGES\nAdvanced Intelligent Resolution automatically detects and optimizes signal processes for: 1. outlines, 2. detailed texture areas, and 3. soft gradation areas. (View Larger)The GH2 has been equipped with an advanced Intelligent Resolution function that enables even greater signal processing power for exceptional photos and HD movies. Intelligent Resolution automatically identifies outlines, detailed textures and soft gradation in every image, to enhance uniform sharpness and apply precise pixel-by-pixel signal processing for the most effective resolution improvement. Whether you are shooting wildlife, landscapes or architectural structures, your images will be exquisitely detailed and clear, without the hassle of making time-consuming manual adjustments.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE SELECTOR\nScene Guide can help you select the best settings for your subjects from portraiture to night scenes. (View Larger)Even if you're a novice photographer or just new to the interchangeable lens system, you can take amazing photos and video with the GH2. When the camera is set to iA Mode, the Intelligent Scene Selector automatically chooses the best settings for ambient conditions. All of the most popular scene modes are included in the Intelligent Scene Selector, including; Portrait, Scenery, Sunset, Night Portrait, Night Scenery and Macro. In order to get the best possible results, the camera detects elements such as focus distance, the presence of human faces in the frame and the brightness levels.\n\nACCESSORIES FOR THE PANASONIC LUMIX DMC-GH2\nH-H020\nLUMIX G 20mm / F1.7 ASPH LensH-FS45150 \nLUMIX G VARIO 45-150mm H-FS45150 Lens For G Series CamerasH-HS12035\nLUMIX G X VARIO 12-35mm / F2.8 ASPH LensH-HS35100\nProfessional Grade X Series 35-100mm F2.8 Telephoto Zoom LensH-VS014140\nLUMIX G VARIO HD 14-140mm / F4.0-5.8 ASPH. / MEGA O.I.S.
