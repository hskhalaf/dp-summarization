I have nearly flat feet and these shoes really help a ton. My feet don't hurt in them. I use them for running (3-6 miles every other day) and training. (CrossFit/HIIT) . Be careful training because they do not offer a lot of side support. I would love to find similar UA shoes for training. But haven't had anything that comes close to these",
