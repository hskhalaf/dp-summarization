I did expect the wire of the product to be a little heavier but I guess it didn't need to be since it worked fine. If I get more belts, I would buy another. (This is so much better than the 'Belt hanger' that I had my belts on. It was awkward and took up a few inches of rod space in my closet. Not to mention it was a trick trying to get the belt I wanted off it without dropping all the others.) This product eliminates that problem.",

Its very sturdy and works exceptionally well for what it is designed for just keep in mind you will probably want more than one if you have a decent number of ties/belts to organize. easy to install, just two screws into the wall/door and your done.",
