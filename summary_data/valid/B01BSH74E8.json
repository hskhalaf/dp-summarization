It looked very small but it fits just right, maybe I'm used to looking at my kind size fitted sheets. Love the snug fit to prevent SID, no loose fabric at all. Very soft and comfortable, happy with the quality, the color looks exactly like the listing pictures. I picked Ecru which is a beige/cream color. Was debating between American Baby and TL Care, picked TL Care because it was cheaper as an add-on item and seems like the same quality. Gave it a try and love it. My baby loves it too.",

After I got it, I found the reviews for sheets were all over the place due to the size of the pads. I opted to get some mini crib sheets instead of ordering a bunch of bassinet sheets that were too small. These are bigger than you need, but they tuck under the mattress pads quite easily. For the price, I\u2019m fine using these as a workaround for the bassinet. They\u2019re soft as well. Good bargain for $5!",
