      "text": "The Arlo system is very convenient as far as installation is concerned. However, I am noticing that my camera doesn't always record when it should and when it does, it records in 15 second increments. Sometimes the recording doesn't begin until the subject is almost out of the frame. I worry that if someone were to steal packages from my porch, that the recording won't kick off in time. I hope that Arlo releases a software update soon. To Arlo, please release an update extending the record time or to record when all motion has stopped. I did enable the setting to record until motion has stopped - but it doesn't work how it should.",

The resolution is incredible and mobile app fairly easy to navigate.
