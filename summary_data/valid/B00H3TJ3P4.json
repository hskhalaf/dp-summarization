The sensitivity level is so high that just a cool fall morning will trip the sensor. I've gone through 3 of these in one residence, with the same results (false alarms). Interestingly, when the same 3 units are installed in another residence, there have been no false alarms at all. I'm not sure what the difference is except humidity levels and air conditioning/movement, but certainly no water leaks have caused them. They are great sensors unless you happen to have the magical conditions that will trip them, and I cannot figure out what those conditions are.",

It's been sitting on my dining room table for three days, and it's generated three to five false alarms per day. I contacted Aotec Support and was told this device reached its end of life sometime ago. It's been replaced by the Water Sensor 6. I'll be returning this to Amazon, and I won't be upgrading to the much more expensive current version. Very disappointed!",

      "text": "This is probably the most important sensor / smart device youll buy. If you're buying this to protect yourself from leaks or a flooded basement from an overflowing sump, this probably isn't the product to buy. I purchase mine 18months ago. Came down stairs this morning to find a flooded basement due to a failed sump pump. Something this device was suppose to warn me about. It still says its dry even after replacing the pump and spending hundreds on fan rental and rug cleaning. Don't BUY!",
