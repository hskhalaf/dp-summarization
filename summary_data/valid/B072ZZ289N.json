The kids had fun with this, but there was not enough sand in the kit to fill the bottle. We used a whole sand packet from another kit, and the bottle still was not completely full. When there's air in the top of the bottle and the bottle gets shaken, the sand will all mix and not have a design. There really should be 5 packets of sand in each kit to fully fill each bottle. Ultimately, it's just for fun, and was not that expensive, thus the three stars.",
