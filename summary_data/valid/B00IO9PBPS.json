I highly recommend this purchase. The time I've been able to spend elsewhere because I'm no longer doing the vacuuming is worth every penny I've spent on this!",

It also has problems on 1 rug we have with geometric patterns.

Disadvantage: it misses some spots due to the \"random\" patterns, and the fact that it decides an area is complete just a little too early. iRobot's documentation gives little insight into how it \"decides\" when a room (area) is \"done\", and it's a little too aggressive for my taste. It needs about another 50% of the time it chooses, in order to get things \"clean enough\", the majority of the time.",

      "text": "I was very skeptical about a robot that could clean my condo. I bought it as a toy, but I praise it as a useful tool. I set it to clean my 1100 square foot apartment at 10am every day. When I come home it is nestled back in it's dock and it is filled with dust bunnies and dirt. After 10 days my allergies have subsided, and my apartment is much cleaner. I hate cleaning. This device is a godsend. It is not perfect. It occasionally gets stuck under my sofa. But, I would never ever clean under my sofa, so the 2 times a week it gets stuck is worth the aggravation. Great product. Well done!",

It does have some flaws like if there is a door open and it pushes it to clean under and at times it locks itself in the bathroom for example, but I will take that over doing it myself.

After much research into which vacuum cleaner is best for pet hair, I'm 100% convinced that this roomba is the best. I have a husky at home that sheds 24/7, but when I come home now my floors are so clean. The only negative comment I have about the roomba is it's a bit noisy.",

In other words, the vast majority of the carpet is clean, but it has a less than professional appearance.

It occasionally will get stuck in a tight spot, especially if there is also a change in floor level (such as the edge of a rug), so I avoid letting it run while I am not available to keep an eye on it. It does sound an 'alarm' to alert the consumer of troubles and provides audible troubleshooting codes to help you identify the problem should one occur.",

Also needs a feature to have it move back & forth from the walls rather than in a criss cross, helter skelter manner. Meanwhile, I am very happy with the Roomba's cleaning quality. I have breathing problems which make it difficult to do heavy cleaning so the Roomba keeps my asthma much calmer.",
