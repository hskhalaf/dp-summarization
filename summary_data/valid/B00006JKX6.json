I want my wrists and elbows and tendons to last a long time. Stiletto hammers make that so much easier. It weighs about half of the heavy metal hammers I'd started using. Absolutely worth the extra cost, given how much physical therapy costs and being off work to heal tendonitis and related injuries. This size is just right for trim work, and I also have the 18 waffle face for framing. Do your future self a favor and invest in a couple of these hammers.",

If you carry a hammer daily you\u2019ll appreciate this many times over I promise. Initially i was worried about its ability to drive fasteners as well as my 16oz steel dewalt; Those worries vanished after the first nail I set. I felt the stiletto drove nails faster and easier than my previous hammer without question. This will probably be the only hammer I carry as a finish carpenter from here on out I\u2019m very happy. I cannot yet speak on its durability although I expect it to be solid and will update if otherwise.",

      "text": "This is a really nice hammer! I'd been wanting a light weight finish hammer for some time and I knew Stiletto has always been considered the premier hammer. When in my tool belt my old steel hammer hits me in the knee when in the front holder or bangs around when in the rear holder. This hammer works in either holder and you hardly know it's there. The only negative about this hammer is that it's made in China.",

      "text": "Great hammer for finish carpenters, No need for anything heavier, not driving 16d framing nails. Made minor modifications to the handle ( shaped it to be more ergonomic) restained and put a couple coats of lacquer. Don't really need the nail starter magnet and groove. But I don't see much of a draw back in having it there. All and all a good product to lighten you pouches.",
