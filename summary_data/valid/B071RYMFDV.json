I would imagine it would be harder to use for those with long thick hair. I don't like gear with logos on them, so its a plus that these have no designs on them. These sort of look like they were stitched at home, so I suggest not putting them in the washing machine. However, they do the job and they're cheap. would repurchase.",

I do not think that they will hold a lot of hair however I do have somewhat long hair. Also, they have a rather broad band of elastic compared to Speedo or other brands that I have worn. As a result, I find them more comfortable to put over my ears. Overall, a great value.",
