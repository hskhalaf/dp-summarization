Pros: Good looking design Decent build quality (metal, not plastic) Very thin and light for portability Cons: Frequent connection issues Poor battery life Keys sometimes require an uncomfortable amount of pressure to register Overall, I would not recommend this keyboard.

This helps conserve the battery, bit it would be nice to be enable to set whether or not you want it continuously on or not. Not a big deal at all, just a super minor complaint.

The replacement is working flawlessly. After consultation with them, I chose a stainless steel (HW086) version, which is slightly larger and more solid than some of its lightweight cousins; consequently for me it's easier to type on. Suffice it to say that the kind of customer attention shown by Arteck is exceedingly rare.",

To choose your keyboard layout just press fn-Q for IOS, fn-W for Android and fn-E for Windows. One small quibble. Like most portable Blutooth keyboards it's missing the insert key and a few of my old DOS and Windows programs need the key to run. That's something 99.9% of buyers won't even notice.",

      "text": "Great keyboard. This is the second BT Keyboard I've purchased to complement my iPad mini. The first, from a different manufacturer, was ok but too inconsistent in responding to what was typed. This one, however, does a phenomenal job. I'm frequently reticent when I see Amazon adds that list a noticeably high price crossed out and a much lower price offered. For this keyboard, I believe the original high price may be accurate as it captures the value of the product. That stated, buy this keyboard. The back light is fantastic, customer service is superlative (I had a question about the directions), and it's frankly saved me the cost of buying a Surface or something similar.",

It goes surprisingly long on a charge which I like a lot. I've used it on an amazon fire, a samsung j7 crown, and a samsung laptop. However, I've had difficulty in that when switching between multiple devices I've had to reinstall the keyboard. It's thin, has media control keys, special command keys which I've not learned yet, and I can even set it on my lap. So I think it was a value for what I paid for it and I think it'll last along time.",

After emailing back and forth a bit. they sent a replacement keyboard right away and kept checking in to make sure all was well. Even though the replacement was a slightly different model it worked like a charm. Typing this out on it right now. So even though I didn't quite get what I ordered I ended up with a nicer product and a great customer service experience. Five stars!",

Will update after a little usage... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, for the Keyboard I received, backlight is not working properly. It just turns on for few seconds after powering on keyboard and later turns off event after pressing the light bulb key. Also it does not change colors. Going to return it.Pairing was simple and straight forward and keys felt good even for a small keyboard.e",

      "text": "Due to online schooling I bought my kids this keyboard to go with their iPad. It\u2019s been great and really I\u2019m happy with the product so far. The only downfall I would say is that I\u2019m not sure ergonomically if this would be a very comfortable keyboard to type for hours but for spurts of time ex. iPad or tablet use Would be great. My kids really enjoy it and especially enjoyed the backlit keys on the keyboard. I\u2019m curious as to how long it will go before needing a charge. Again really happy with the product. Wish I could\u2019ve given us 4 1/2 stars.",

      "text": "At first, I was surprised at the size. Though after I started using it became easy to get used to the size. Easy to use and feeling of a much larger keyboard, in fact, I am typing with it now. Comes with a manual that should be at least skimmed so that the first row of keys make sense since they don't match the other wireless keyboards I have. Strange to use Bluetooth for something other than cell phone earpiece. Recharged when I noticed the backlit was fading. So far, I think this is great. I like the living room dark for better TV viewing and I like typing into my laptop without turning on lights. Absolutely, great!.\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udc80",

      "text": "I had previously purchased an Anker keyboard to use with iPad/ iPhone. It does after I spilled coffee on it. I bought this as a replacement because of the backlog keys. I love it. It works great, and lets you change colors, etc. My only negative comment is that it\u2019s so thin it warps. When I got it, it didn\u2019t lay flat. Also, it lacked and sort of rubber feet- so it was sliding around my desk. I\u2019ve since added some feet to it, and it\u2019s much better.",

It worked well and without any problems for a little over 1 year of school, but then suddenly stopped charging. I contacted Arteck and they promptly responded and sent me a new keyboard. Very professional and great service. Thank you! I love this keyboard and am glad I can continue to use it!",
