Reinstalled with the mounting bracket and it's ok now. Not as sturdy as I like. It does flex a little but it's not a big concern. Originally when it first arrived, one of the mount bracket was stuck to one of the ends of the bar. I had to use a hammer to get it out which marred up the bracket. Luckily it came with extra mounts. It does rotate even if I tighten down the two retaining screws super tight. Something to keep in mind. Overall, not too bad.",

This is b/c one end turns counter-clockwise, and the other end must turn CLOCKWISE. After you get both ends even, you can place it in the brackets, and then turn the middle, padded part of the bar away from you until it tightens. Don't overtighten. Then, to prevent the bar from spinning, use the Allen wrench included in the set to tighten the screws that sit on each end of the middle bar. Regan answered my questions very promptly and helped me figure out the issue. Thank you!",
