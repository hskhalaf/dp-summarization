I have to admit I almost thought the price was too good to be true and would not be a quality light. They do not look cheap, but quite modern and sheik. The cords are covered with a thick plastic making them look like a thick wire. Also, we purchased the designer bulbs that give a vintage appearance to the glass globe making them complete. I love these lights!!",

They match the nickel finish of our hardware pretty well. The only issue is keeping them clean. Pretty hard to keep them super clean and free of dust or issues. But a small price to pay for how nice they are.",

Would love different size options Would like matching or complimenting dining room or over sing options. Would like option of a metal rod as kinks from cord still present after several weeks- hoping in time it will be less noticeable. Packaged well. Believe arrived on time but sat here for long period due to construction delays. Would order again",
