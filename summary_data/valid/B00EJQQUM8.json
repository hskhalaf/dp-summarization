The plastic window over the brush popped off at some point but being only a cosmetic blemish, it soldiered on and did not disappoint. To top it all off, the extended handle and brush are detachable, making it easier to clean up those hard-to-reach beats. They really had me in mind when they designed this product. Will buy again.",

I gave my 2 dogs a hair cut, after sweeping their hair I used this vacuum for the left over hair, and it suctioned it all. It also has a spinning roll and you can turn it off / on according to the kind of floor you are cleaning. Over all, I think its good for small areas.",

There wasn't anything out of the ordinary on my rug that would have caused this. There was a small amount of flame. I turned it off and haven't plugged it back in since. It took me a while to use it so I missed my return window but I will not be using this vacuum again. I'm only giving it two stars because it was easy to assemble and did a good job cleaning my carpet until it caught on fire.",

      "text": "I've been using this vacuum daily since the day I got it and so far it does a pretty good job picking up small debris, dust, and hair all around the house. The brush roll definitely helps for light jobs on area rugs, and the dust cup is very easy to empty and clean. I wouldn't suggest using this on high pile or shaggy rugs unless you're cleaning a small mess in a specific area. Otherwise this is a great little vacuum for light jobs.",

I do not need or want to wrestle with a heavy machine to do my gorgeous knotted rugs or charming rag rugs -- so this is my favorite appliance. I have ordered another one for my 86-year-old mom, because she does not have the strength to shove her heavy, expensive vacuum across her carpet, and there is no adjustment on her machine to accommodate for plush carpeting.",

Plush carpets are a little harder to push it on, but it still works. I prefer my more expensive vacuum for heavy jobs, but this is nice for smaller quick pick-ups.
