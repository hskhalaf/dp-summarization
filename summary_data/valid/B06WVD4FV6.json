Needed improvements - Autel needs to get on the ball and upgrade available software to include recent models. No excuse to not have software available for common vehicles like Toyota Trucks.",

      "text": "Stepped up to the 802 from a basic OBDII engine code reader I've had for years. Owning a Mercedes C230, the basic engine code reader was just not enough. Triggered an SRS code while replacing wiper control switch and local auto parts stores did not have anything more than basic engine readers. Purchased this and it's been a great unit so far. Was able to clear SRS message and discover other codes. It gives more details about codes than a typical engine code scanner. Definitely worth the investment. Not a professional mechanic, but I do all work except engine/transmission on all our vehicles.",

Good luck and put in that hour or so upgrading software and you will be pleased.",

If another reviewer did not give great instructions on how to register and update, I would have returned it. Pros This tool will scan and read all VOLVO codes. All codes - brakes, body, drive train, engine, air bags. You have been warned.",
