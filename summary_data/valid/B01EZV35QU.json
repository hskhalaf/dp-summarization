Fireplace controls are low voltage and the Kasa switch only passes its 120v line voltage through so I used a 120v Honeywell pam relay to close the fireplace contacts. The pam relays are low cost, extremely reliable and have a high temp rating because they are listed fire alarm equipment, perfect for a fireplace.",

Sometimes the Echo will say that the \"TP-Link is not responding\" but then the light or switch does respond about 10 seconds later.

There is a small illuminated circle that appears when the switch is off to make it easy to find the switch in the dark. I use my switches with Alexa and with the Kasa app (which is excellent).

My sister who also helps Mom needed access to the switch to turn on for Moms showers and we discovered their is no sharing option in the Kasa app. On the setup side it essential the installation has a white neutral wire to connect to the switch otherwise it just blinks ay you and won\u2019t finish set up. I solved the control issue by adding the Kasa switch to Moms Alexa account so my sister can just say\u201dAlexa turn on Moms hot water circulator\u201d",

One minute they disappear, the next minute they are only reachable with the app (as opposed to voice),the next minute they work. All of our other devices we still had laying around work fine. (VeSync, Leviton). Our Sonos system works fine. Our elf cameras work fine. The only issue is KASA, with non-existent customer service. NEVER NEVER NEVER again!!!",

Ideally if you were building a house you would want to oversize the boxes that would use these (e.g. use 2 gangs out of a three gang box). Anyway, they do fit it just takes some care to do it (excess neutral and ground wires tend to be the issue).",

      "text": "This is definitely the best smart switch choice for most people. The product came well packed. Installation was straight forward, I did not use the wire nuts instead I used I-Sure push-in wire connectors. Using the push-in wire connectors, made for a much cleaner and compact installation. I used my android device to pair the switch wirelessly to my router, this operation went flawlessly. Once connected I was able to easily set the switch up in the Google home app and my Alexa app, (Yes I have both!!). The switch works flawlessly, is easy to program and looks great!! I will update this post with reliability in a few months.",

I will be purchasing a second TP-Link Wi-Fi Light Switch for our second home. Hopefully I will be able to see both switches on my phone based upon my VPN access to both local routers.

Clean look once they are installed and also fit standard faceplates if you don't want to (or can't) use the provided ones. They also feature a small, dim light on the front when they are powered off to make finding the switch in the dark very easy, if you want to use it manually.

In my application I have a 240V transformer splitting into 2x120V pairs. It works fine connected to those, even though neither is technically a neutral. As long as you feed it 120V, it will switch the hot side between \"hot\" and \"hot when switched on\", basically. I used it in my water heater controller.",
