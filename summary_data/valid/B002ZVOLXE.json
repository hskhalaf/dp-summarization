Very convenient & easy for 69 year old semi-disabled female (5'5\" tall 168 lbs) to operate. Just take great care to keep the extension cord out of mowing path, & away from tangling in your feet. Be vigilant about this & just mow away!...without the need to pull start & without the need for a man to get it going. Just push the button, pull up on the handle lever & off you go. No worries...in a jiffy, your lawn is easily mowed & beautiful again. :) jlp",

I did not like the gas one so i opted with the corded one and i made the right choice. It works great for me, i dont have to charge battery and it has wider blades and i like the way it cut the grass is like continuous cut unlike my old mower where other parts of the lawn are not cut propery or longer than the other parts. Highy recommended",

I have a 100ft 12g cable, which delivers smooth power but is too big for the strain relief on this mower, so I tie it on the crossbar and that works. Mower cut bag can grab a lot of grass, but that makes it heavy, so I dump the bag more often. Starts immediately, runs quiet, bags great. My little Brigs mower is better for real heavy cutting, but it is hard to get started and dies often around overhanging areas.",

I was a little hesitant in going electric because I questioned an electric mower's ability to get through the really tall grass that I tend to let get out of hand, but I can honestly say that this is the most powerful mower that I've ever used. I sometimes let my back yard get close to knee high and as I found out yesterday - my greenworks mower powered right through it. Sure, it slows down when you get to patches that high, but even the high end gas mower that I borrowed from my neighbor stalled out in grass this high.",
