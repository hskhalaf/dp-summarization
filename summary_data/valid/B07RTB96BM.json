There might have been a bit more arch support and thickness on the soles, but the heel support was good all around, especially since I pronate (my foot rolls out as I run and it wears shoes on the outside edge). Very good value, don't know how long they will last, but they are very nice for now.",

    "description": "Inov8 F-Lite 245 Training Shoes The latest edition to our cardio category, the F-LITE 245 offers the ultimate in versatility, from functional fitness to running. A cardio masterpiece, constructed from highly flexible materials, this agile shoe weighing only 245g is designed to move freely with the natural movement of the foot. Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the F-Lite 260 Knit Training Shoes as Grade 4. Breathable Knit Upper The breathable knit upper offers exceptional breathability and ventilation to keep your feet cool and dry. By actively and efficiently wicking away the build-up of excess sweat and moisture, the mesh enables you to maintain both focus and performance as you strive for the best results. Once the sweat and moisture have been wicked, it is then transported from the skin to leave you feeling cool, dry and comfortable - ready to tackle the weight room and high-intensity exercises. In addition, the mesh encourages cool air to circulate, creating a drier, healthier environment for your feet to thrive in. The upper is extremely lightweight, yet durable to provide su",
