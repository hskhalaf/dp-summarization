      "title": "Good light MTB saddle",
      "text": "I took this saddle on a 12 mile ride yesterday for the first time (450' elev climbed). My previous seat was really plush compared to this one. I wish it was just a liiiiittle more padded, but it's still a really solid saddle. My butt was slightly sore by the end of the ride, but I think I'll adjust in time. Plus, I'm sure these saddles have some sort of break-in period where they wear-in and soften eventually. All-in-all this was a great buy and a really comfortable seat. I like how much more maneuverable it is when I have to get back in a more agressive position for downhills.",

      "title": "Comfort without the excess",
      "text": "It supports the sits, it has just enough cushion where it's needed, and it isn't excessively padded all over everywhere else. Doesn't get in the way or chafe, and allows a wide range of positions, from butt all the way back relaxed to a very forward position on the nose. Easy to get out of for climbs as well, however little I might like doing so.",

      "text": "It is more firm than the commuter seat that came with my Fuji Feather, but less firm than the thin Specialized seats. At 5'7 with a 30' waist, the 133 width fits my seat bones perfectly and I don't feel sore at all after a half hour on the saddle. The profile of the seat also means my weightlifter legs aren't hitting or chaffing on the edge. All in all this seat will be with me for a long time, and I'll be ordering another when it gives out.",

I thought he was nuts but he does those 500 mile rides so he must know something. So I bought and it is great. Fixed a lot of my issues. Quality product",

Good seat, light and well designed with just the right amount of padding in the important spots. Only issue is that the rails are a tad short so I have the seat adjusted to all the way back. Could be a lil more room for adjustments, thats it. Good seat",
