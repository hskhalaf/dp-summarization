      "text": "This is the worst cornhole set I have ever used. The top of the game board is covered in a plastic lacquer that when you toss the bag, it slides off of it as if it were a slip n slide. The other terrible flaw in this set is that the game board surface has a huge springboard effect. When you toss a bag and use any loft in your shot, it bounces off of the board like a trampoline. It is nearly impossible to score points on this board unless you swish it through the center. I will say that it is constructed well and fold up easily, but that is the only positive to this set",

LEDs are a cool touch. The bad: it's completely unplayable. The surface of the boards are so springy that everything bounces off. The boards are so slick that if you happen to get something to land, it'll slide off the front the next time someone hits the board. Bags are too light as well and the zipper to the case fell off literally the first time I used it. Returning this ASAP. For the price, it's complete junk.",

Only issue I had, I was unable to unzip the carry case when it arrived as the zipper was completely stuck, then broke while using pliers to get it unstuck. I contacted GoSports, as their paperwork requested, emailed a copy of my invoice and promptly received a replacement carry case, at no charge.",

The bags bounce a lot if you play on pavement but if you put these in the grass not too bad and there is some nice slide action. If you are serious about corn hole I suppose these are not for you, but I love this for portability and easy setup - YMMV",

They are extremely sturdy and still look brand new (really they do!) as the day I got them four years ago. The travel bag isnt the most durable, but it has yet to rip on me. If you need a set of boards to travel with, or to set up a few times a summer, these are perfect. Don't hesitate to grab these bad boys.",

So I solved that by adding some strategically placed strips of anti-slip tape -- now the game play is more fun, as scoring is somewhat more frequent.",

It's nicely packaged in it's own carrying case, small enough to travel with and large enough to feel like a regulation wood set (it's one foot shorter, but that makes it easier to travel with). The bean bags don't slide off the platform, and land and stick the same way I expected them to as if this were a wood set. Both of the field day games I've purchased from GoSports have exceeded my expectation.",

We ended up picking up a score board/drink holder to go along with this. That was the only thing that we didn't get with this game set. The game is soild. Because it is metal it does play differntly than a home made board. However, we have had a ton of fun with it at our house and on the road. I would suggest picking this up. It is nice that it doesn't take up a ton of space when we have it stored away.",

Our last set fell apart after a year or so of use by our kids. I do agree with previous commenters regarding the bounce of the board though. I'm not an avid corn hole player. So when I saw the comments that the bags bounce a little too much when they hit, I thought \"corn hole snobs\". But there's definitely too much bounce and slide. It's better on a lawn than a sidewalk or pavement. Overall we are happy with the set.",

The flag design is fun and festive; the boards are well constructed. When you set them up on a hard surface, such as pavers or concrete, the boards do bounce a bit upon impact when the bean bags are tossed. This is not an issue on a lawn. We solved the problem by placing a dumbbell over the bracing bar to weight the board down a bit while in use. Very happy with this purchase.",

They may not bounce in you are playing in sand. But, if you like playing on wooden cornhole boards you will NOT like this set.",
