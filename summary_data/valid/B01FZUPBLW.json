I was recommended to try Asics, and they are by far the most comfortable trainers I've ever owned. Be warned: I usually wear 4, so I got a 4.5 and it fits perfectly. Asics are a bit smaller than usual. Also: these shoes are for overpronators. If you supinate they will hurt you. Find out what kind of shoe you need before you buy.",
