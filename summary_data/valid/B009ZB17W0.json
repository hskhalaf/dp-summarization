The ingredients say it's the same as Dramamine but my 3yo HATED the taste of the chewable dramamine and it was a battle every time. He still sometimes got sick and I never knew if it was because of when we gave it to him before driving (30 minutes vs 1 hour vs longer) or it just didn't work or whatever. He drinks this medicine happily. It doesn't make him drowsy, but we often time our long drives for a midday nap which helps for a lot of reasons.",

He gets nauseous just from putting them in his mouth, so I had to go with liquid. It works ok, not 100% of the time, but it does help a lot. If your child is over 5 you probably only have 10 doses in the bottle, so you end up paying $1.50 per each dose and you need to give it every 6 hours if on a road trip, but overall I am sure we'd all agree to pay that to save your child from getting carsick.",
