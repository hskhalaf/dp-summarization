With collapsible legs you can put the table away when not in use. I like the almond color table top because dirt is not easy to see as with a white top.

My son is 18 months old, and utilizes this table for activities like puzzles, coloring books, etc. We have a lifetime chair for the table, and he still has to grow quite a bit before his feet will touch the ground, but he likes that he can climb in and out of the chair and sit at the table on his own will. The table does have little bumps on the surface, so it's not great for coloring if there is nothing between a sheet of paper and the table.",
