First time wearing it at a walking trail at a park I got stopped and questioned by a deputy and had to open the pockets and prove the contents were weighted bags. Other than that the vest is great. May order the shoulder pads later but this model really isn't bad. It's definitely a workout marching with this beast!",

But, the rubbing doesn't happen when I do movements that involve jumping without the use of my arms. So, no big deal. Overall, this vest is comfortable and gets the job done. If your workouts need extra oomph, I recommend grabbing one of these.",

      "text": "It's hard to beat this vest for the price. The only thing that is a negative is the pinching feeling that is generated in the shoulder area when wearing it, but if you're only using it for a short time, it's really nothing. However, I couldn't imagine going for a run or a bike ride with this vest. Overall though, it's a great addition to my workout arsenal.",
