I can join online meetings using the USB connection and I can join phone conferences using my cell phone. I have a baby daughter that makes a lot of noise but as long as I have the door closed, no one can tell. -update The mic picks up your breathing which is annoying. Good mic but there are better choices out there. My daily driver is the plantronics voyager legend. Noise cancelling on the mic is better on the voyager.",

This was a big plus for getting this set and the first time we chalked it up to just bad luck or such and since my husband loved it for work we ordered it again only to have the same piece break again. We will look for another one and probably not a Jabra. Too expensive to have to be replacing it twice a year.",

I would only use this for business use, nothing more! The ear cups are reasonably comfortable for long periods of use but not all day in one sitting. The price is tad high but again its backed by a good manufacturer.",

And, for some reason, every time I touch the cord I can hear it through the headset. The sound quality of the headset is good, as is the microphone positioning and quality. If I hadn't thrown away some of the packaging I'd return it and get my money back. Don't buy this headset.",

Definitely straighten the red audio lead before you don the headset; it is heavy and well-constructed, but will curl if you don't straighten it beforehand (and a curled cable can be distracting).",

I do use it for singing as well, and when I get to a certain volume level it does overwhelm the mic. I'm sure sound guys out there would have a word for it, but on the recording you can hear a kind of distortion if I am singing too loud. It helps somewhat if I point the microphone at my chin, and even doing that the noise cancellation remains top notch. If they could fix the distortion at the higher volume would absolutely be 5 stars. Otherwise, a very good noise cancellation microphone.",

The only problem I have is that, at 3ft, the headphone cable is way too short. This is the part that connects the actual headphones to the controller. It has a proprietary connector (standard stereo plug, but with 2 flat sides), which helps prevent accidental disconnects. But since it's short, it gives very limited mobility while on calls, and due to the proprietary connector, it can't be extended. Otherwise, it's a very good set.",

There is no easy usb connector you must bring all the control in order to connect to USB port. The mute function just moving the microphone in to the up position is no really muting the sound it just reduce the mic volumen but still active.",
