Unfortunately, after each use, we\u2019ve experienced broken pieces of the glass cubes. Surprised, but not concerned. Now the product is apparently unavailable, which is very disappointing because at some stage we will need more to replace the broken pieces, which were removed and thrown away. Oh well, guess we won\u2019t remove them anymore.",
