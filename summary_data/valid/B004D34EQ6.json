It was not hit on anything- the bar simply could not handle light paddling. Thankfully we were close to the shore or we would have embodied the saying 'up a creek without a paddle' to the fullest! These felt cheap and poorly made but we decided to give them a shot....it was definitely a mistake.",

I bought this because I wanted a longer paddle for the open water, but after using it for the first time, it became my favorite. I have paddles that cost over $250 and I like this one better. It's sturdy enough to stand up to the rough treatment I demand and it's light enough that my arms don't get tired late in the day. It's also long and gives me more power and reach. It's not super rugged, but it's also not fragile. The best part is the price. I don't think you can get a better quality paddle for the price. I love it.",

The length of these paddles eliminated \"drips\" back in to my boats and they are very comfortable to use. I was surprised to realize that I prefer paddles without the padded handles; these aren't uncomfortable or anything, I just prefer the lack of padding like my shorter paddles.....I'll probably remove the padding on these handles, but, either way they work fine.",

We've put some major abuse on these paddles and have yet to break them. Great Product at an awesome price. Unless you're into extreme white water kayaking these are the best deal around.",

Splitting it into two pieces is very convenient, fits in my kayak no problem. Only drawback I've noticed after about 30 hours of total use is that the paddle takes on water. Somewhere inside of it is a space that allows water to gather, and it can't just be shaken out. It slowly drips out when placed with the heads facing up. Great first paddle!",

This, of course, makes every stroke less efficient, and requires more effort. When in fast-moving water and trying to avoid the rocks, this can be a challenge. I will be keeping this paddle as a back-up, but plan to purchase a new one with stiffer paddle surfaces to use as my primary.",

When other paddles are at least quadruple the price, I can deal with it. Even with slipping hand holds, I was able to use this paddle to propel my Prowler 13 the mile back to the dock ahead of my step fathers 10 ft boat with a 2.5 motor on the back of it. Out paddled a Motor! This thing is tough enough.",

Good idea except that some water will get into the paddle at the blade connection and it is a royal pain to get out. Yes aluminum is corrosion resistant compared to steel, but water sloshing around inside the paddle is irritating and if it is sea water will start to corrode aluminum too. I will likely pull the seals out once I figure out how so they can drain and replace them after I have sealed the blade to the tube better.",
