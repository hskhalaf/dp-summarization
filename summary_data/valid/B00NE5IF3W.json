The seller even set me detailed instructions on how to operate the lock system while I was waiting to receive the item. Would recommend this set of BBQ tools to anyone who BBQ's. I will buy this set again if they wear out,.... but I doubt they are going to. Alpha Grillers hit the nail on the head with these BBQ Tool set.",
