Even though a part that held one of the tines fell out almost immediately, we were able to secure the tine with some wire with no further problems. It works exactly as described and does the job well. We have heavy soil mixed with clay, but the tool still did the job. Heads-up though: it clogs and stops if the soil is wet or very moist.",

This worked fairly well but dirt often stuck between the tines and many times I had to stop, unplug and clear it. I'm not sure how they might fix that but it would definitely make it a 5 start product if they did.",
