High pressure inflators, leaf blowers etc. I finally got the airvalve adapter and hook up my compressor to it to get it firm. My neighbor has the rave and although he has to inflate his every couple of days as well, there is actually a good bounce on it compared to ours.",

Was able to deflate and put back in the box for storage fairly easily. Definitely a 2 person job though. Have it stored for the winter and will take it out again next year and update with how it weathered storage.",
