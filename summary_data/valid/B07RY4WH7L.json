After several hours-long calls with Dell technical support I was told the issue was with a damaged motherboard, so I had to return it. Curious to know if this issue has been a widespread problem with this model, I suggest looking into it before considering a purchase. Huge headache and disappointment.",

The audio has an issue with the headphones, it makes a crackling noise , the speakers are fine, the the headphone settings are just weird. i guess for the price, you get what you pay for. // Several months later the audio seemed to fix itself, there was a prompt asking what type of headphones to use, so thats good",

Any idea on how to fix this? I would love to keep it but as you will understand I can't keep if this issue can't be solved. Hope you can help, thank you.

Amazon gave me a full refund, but when PConline365 processed it they kept a restocking fee. Amazon reversed it. BEWARE if they say they register the SN for you.",
