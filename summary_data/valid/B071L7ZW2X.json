What\u2019s really awesome about this 65\u201d is it include Dolby, a sound system superior to most sound bars at the $200 price point, and uses Roku\u2019s OS. Samsung and a bunch of companies decided to write their own OS. Unfortunately their Linux ports all didn\u2019t work out. Every Samsung I owned died early and had horrible \u201csmart\u201d features. TCL took a good functioning OS and installed it on a sick piece of hardware. You need this TV",

I have also watched 1080p content from sources like Crunchyroll and Funimation on it and the up-scaling looks fantastic as well. So far it has been a great experience. Very easy to set up.",

Black levels are bad, you can actually see some light patterns in the tv during dark scenes. I changed 3 times the tv until the tv was acceptable. If you receive it and see problems with it, return it immediately instead of using TCL warranty (slow, takes time and not worthy). Positive side: decent audio, Dolby Vision (looks great on a dark room) and Roku tv, is the best part of the tv.",

      "text": "The TV would be satisfactory if it weren't for the fact that it sometimes pops, runs static, shows a green screen, then goes black. This problem was very pronounced when we bought it, so we reached out to the TCL customer service department, who advised us to buy a different HDMI cable. The problem has since become less frequent, and the TV is mostly useable, but repeated attempts to contact TCL have been met with silence, although we are still under warranty.",
