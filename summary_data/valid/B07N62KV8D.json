I needed a few more inches in height and easier wheel movement. A good friend who is handy at everything spent thirty dollars on 4- 4 inch industrial wheels, two 2x4s, black satin paint, and large screws to make this an ideal product for me. Now I can ice and elevate my leg properly and get some work done with less discomfort.",
