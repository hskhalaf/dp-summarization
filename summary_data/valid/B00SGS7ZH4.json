Why doesn't Asus pay for shipping to and from their repair facility? Isn't the warranty supposed to be totally cost free to the owner? At this rate I am out $60 and almost two months (out of 11 months) out of a computer. Next time I am going for a Lenovo or a Microsoft Surface or something. Their customer service is rather rude too.",

The speakers are pretty sad. Why would Bang & Olufson put their name on these speakers. I usually have to watch TV shows and movies with subtitles.

I have had a few occurrences where my screen will go black and a pop up will say that a driver crashed and has been recovered. I have not had an issue with that other than it is just a bit annoying. All in all I do enjoy this laptop a lot and would recommend it.",

I did a little research and found out that this was a problem several other owners experienced. I wanted to continue working with the Zenbook because I loved its sleek design but I decided to return it after it wouldn't stay powered on without a charger. If Asus could fix this serious glitch, I would be more than willing to purchase this laptop but I think that this experience has turned me off the Asus brand.",

I will say the speakers are not very loud and a little tinny, but I never expect anything from laptop speakers and use something else when I care about sound quality.",
