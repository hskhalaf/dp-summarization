Also, the quality of the paddles is great and if you're worried about getting a little splinter from the edges, then sand them or run them along the sand when you're playing on the beach.",

Totally unnecessary. They should be rubber balls as well.",

The ball is low resistance, which means it has a low \"bounce\" factor, and won't go too far when you hit it with the wood paddle. My husband and I had fun playing it, too. It is easy to pack on trips, and a fun new thing to do!",
