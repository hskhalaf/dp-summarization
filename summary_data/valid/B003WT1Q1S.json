Using an random orbital sander (ROS) for extended periods of time with these gloves and the constant vibration doesn't effect my hands the way it would either bare handed or with regular gloves. The only real downside to these gloves is that they are bulky and hard to close your grip for fine work, so you have to take the gloves off if you need to do that. Fortunately the glove are easy to put on and take off. Great for use with vibrating machinery, I highly recommend them.",

Many of other anti-vibration gloves have a relatively thin layer of padding that isn't as effective. The main drawback is the mesh back section of the gloves. When using an angle grinder on steel, the openings in the mesh allow sparks to get through and don't protect your skin very well. The mesh also begins to tear after awhile, which makes it even less protective.",

That's exactly what I was trying to avoid--overworking my hands! I am a female, however, and I'm sure the gloves were designed for a man. Even the smallest size is too large for me. Perhaps if used often enough, you might break the gloves in, and they'd be far more effective.",
