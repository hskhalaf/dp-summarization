The packaging was one of the best I've ever seen, I was kind of laughing but nice job. But the product is very nice, it's not heavy and easy to move around I purchased this for my motorhome and it's fantastic. If you get your battery-powered drill motor out it would probably only take 15 minutes to put together, but it took me 45 minutes with the tools they provided. I would recommend this product and I'm a real Amazon customer!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
