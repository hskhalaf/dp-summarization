It's thin and light while sturdy enough to travel from China to the U.S. East Coast in one piece :-) Giving it four stars because the mean is not within one SD of the 15 minutes claimed. (In a normal/Gaussian distribution of data, about two-thirds of the data values will fall within one standard deviation)",
