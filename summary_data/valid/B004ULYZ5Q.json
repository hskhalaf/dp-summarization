To the people complaining that their toothpaste comes out brown instead of white. That happened to me too, but it\u2019s normal. It\u2019s just everything that has settled, if you squeeze a little out it soon turns white. It hasn\u2019t gone bad, just separated a little. I mean look at your vanilla extract in your cupboard...it\u2019s brown. Obviously I could be wrong in some instances, but just try to squeeze out a small portion and see if it turns white. That\u2019s all it takes. My dog loves the taste and it doesn\u2019t smell awful like a lot of them!",

He gave us a sample of this brand but in the poultry flavor and I couldn't stand the smell, although the dog didn't mind the taste. So I ordered a full sized tube in the vanilla mint. It has a nice, pleasant, fresh smell. This brand is nice and thick so it stays on the brush better than other brands I have tried. My pup doesn't mind the flavor. I have only been using it for a short time so I don't know how well it will work for the prevention of tartar build up, long term.",

So for the safety of my dogs health I did not use them; I threw them away.",

After days of using the poultry-flavored toothpaste and holding our nose, I decided to just buy a different toothpaste. The vanilla flavor is really nice. Pleasing to the nose AND taste. He enjoys it as much as he did the previous toothpaste, and because the smell is so tolerable, we can get through daily brushing without gagging. His teeth also look beautiful!",
