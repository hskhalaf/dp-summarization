      "verdict": "Coming from the X series, the Adidas X 17.3 is a soccer cleat that is made for high-intensity and agile plays on firm grounds. With a Techfit compression upper that offers great comfort and an outsole that executes with impressive traction, it is no surprise why most players loved this shoe. This is also a reasonably priced soccer cleat.However, it is important to note that comfort was achieved after the break-in period for some of its users. Save for this, all is well for this good-looking shoe.",
