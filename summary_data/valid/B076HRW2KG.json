The stickiness was GREAT with a bit of water, rolled out and stayed perfectly ... but within 15 minutes of my yoga class of my first (and only) time using it - the cork on the mat started molting and peeling. By the end of class the mat was shedding and I had cork fragments all over me. Bummed - had really hoped this would work out.",

      "text": "Thick and firm so my knees love it even in contorted poses or sitting in full-lotus while boosted up, but also solid enough that your foot doesn't wobble on one-footed balance poses. The cork is fairly smooth but gets grippier as your pores open up in a warm class. In shavasana, it's nice to be laying on something that's all natural and yet comfortable. Pros: - Comfort: firm yet forgiving on joins - Balance: absorbs sweat and isn't squishy do dancing-shiva feels good - Look: It just looks cooler to have cork mat than some rubbery-behemoth Cons: - Weight/Size: Great for everyday yoga, not air-travel.",

Would be EXCELLENT for anyone who sweats a lot, but I lightly perspire at best, so it's an effort to hold on sometimes. But very comfortable and cushiony, while still stable, and just pleasant to use. LOVE that it has no nasty latex scent to it, and is as supportive/solid as a Lulu Lemon mat (without the smell).",

The cork provides such a nice balance of durability, strength and a bit of give for comfort. The cork is naturally non stick so I had no problem switching in and out of poses without slipping or sliding around. Thankfully no chemically gross new plastic smell eminating from the mat when I first rolled it out either! And I love the message at the top as a constant reminder of why I'm on the mat. Awesome job gurus!!",

I bought this mat for the anti-slip factor that I've heard praised. Well I slipped much more on this thing than on foam or rubber mats (Lululemon, Gaiam, Manduka). And I slipped to the point where it was dangerous. From half-moon to warrior 2, my back foot slid out. I was stunned how horrible this thing was and immediately initiated a refund. Also, just FYI, while posting this review, I was notified that there are an unusual number of suspicious reviews.",

So it's great for yoga as well as other fitness activities. It's a great size for yoga and will help prevent slipping. My mat has flaked off some cork, but that probably is how it goes. Highly recommended! I'm wearing Gurus flip-flops too!",

It did roll a bit in the beginning, but I just laid it flat with some heavy books on the ends for a few days and it has been fine since. I have never been disappointed by this brand. Both their yoga products and sandals have exceeded my expectations.",

I highly recommend having this mat within reach for any style of yoga you practice.",

    "feature_bullets": [
      "NATURAL AND SUSTAINABLE \u2013 Gurus\u2019 Sprout Natural Luxury Yoga Mat is 4mm thick and is made from high-quality lightweight cork top and TPE back. The supportive layer of cork keeps you free from toxic materials, so it\u2019s safe to use for daily practice. The cork also keeps your mat odor free without using cleaners.",
      "NON SLIP AND WATERPROOF \u2013 Cork naturally displaces moisture and gets grippier when wet, so you don\u2019t have the same slipping issue you have with other mats. Our Slip Resistant Yoga mat performs better when wet, so you may need to sprinkle some water on it when dry. Even during a sweat inducing practice, this mat works perfectly without a towel.",
      "IMPROVES YOGA PRACTICE \u2013 Our 72x25-inch premium yoga mat is perfect for on-the-go practitioners and travelers. We\u2019ve removed all the latex from the Sprout Yoga Mat to make it lighter, only about 2 lbs and more comfortable to travel with. Take it with you anywhere \u2013 Pilates practice, CrossFit, or to the park.",
      "GREAT FOR INDOOR AND OUTDOOR USE \u2013 The cork layer of the Gurus Sprout soft yoga mat does not absorb heat the way rubber and foam mats do, making this mat ideal for outdoor practice. It\u2019s also convenient since the mat rolls super tight for travel. The eco friendly, textured TPE back grips almost any surface so you can practice Bikram and general fitness exercises outside the studio.",
      "GURUS GIVES BACK \u2013 We have teamed up with Trees for The Future, a non profit that plants trees with rural communities in the developing world, to plant a tree for every Gurus product purchased. This ensures that every sturdy yoga mat, sandals, etc. made gives back to the natural resources that helped create it."
