Come to find out, the tire centers had way too much air in my tires and that is why my car was driving squirrely. I highly recommend this for people like myself.

Also, save gas by not driving to the gas station. > Emergency - Keep it in your car for whenever you need it. > Great and inexpensive gift like birthdays or father's day (I need another one). lol!",

This morning a pressure warning forced me to stop the car pretty much nowhere, this small inflator saved my day, a piece of metal was screwed in one tyre and left the pressure down to 24 PSI.

The main title claims Auto Shut Off and some parts of the description say turns off automatically. Several videos of the older model clearly demonstrate the pump automatically shutting off. Otherwise it works as expected. People complaining about air escaping the tire when connecting or disconnecting the pump may not understand that this is how a tire valve works.",

      "text": "Great pump, love that you can set a PSI and it will auto shut off at the right pressure. My only reason for not 5 stars is that one of the two large buttons comes off due to vibrations. However it fits right back on and has not affected the functionality of the button or else I would have returned it. Other than that one issue this thing is awesome.",

Well today I finally had time and I\u2019m so disappointed because it doesn\u2019t even work at all. It doesn\u2019t come on at all. This is a piece of junk! I will be returning it to Amazon for a refund!",

There are NO dislikes! Great price too! Don't look any further than this compressor. Buy it. Great deal!",

The only thing keeping me from a 5-star review is that I believe the power cord may be too short for long-body vehicles.
