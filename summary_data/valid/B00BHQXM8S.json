The SA-46 mini keyboard comes with a new sound source and 8-note polyphony. It includes 100 timbres and 50 rhythms. This is also revealed by the LC display: the SA-46 is a serious playmate. Another highlight is the simple change-over switch: on the SA-46 for switching between the piano and organ sound. The instrument has a cool retro design which combines bright green and black.",
