Ended up using it more than my chainsaw as most busted hanging limbs known as widow makers were just out of reach. It ran great alll day. Cuts really good. Only drawback is its a little heavy but I'm 62 and was able to use it over my head all day long for 2 days so not unbearable. That and you have to watch the bar oil as it uses alot of bar oil but all in all I highly recommend it.",

After all these issues were overcome it worked perfectly. It wasn't overly as heavy as some reviewers said and I'm 76 years old. Worked perfectly once I got it assembled properly. I also filled it with oil and haven't observed any oil leakage yet. So it cut right threw my palm tree branches or whatever they are called. Very happy with purchase.",

Adjusting pole length is a one finger, five second process. I would recommend this product to anyone.

This company puts out good products and the splitter is over-engineered (what you want when crushing the logs.)",
