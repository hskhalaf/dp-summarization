This bench has none of those traits. Its small, easy to move around and rock solid stable. I am 6'1, about 220lbs and have no problems benching in my cage with it. I put self adhesive felt furniture pads under it so its vutter smooth when I mive it. Plus, it was fairly low cost comoared to other benches. I would highly recommend it unless you're a beast and need more than the 800lb weight limit.",

No idea on longevity, but I'd guess that it will probably last. The spine of the bench is one piece with 4 bolts attaching each leg and attaching the cushion. There is no padding on the feet (as one can gather from the product specs). I put some felt pads on the bottom for the wood floors and it hasn't scuffed anything yet. It has a reported capacity of 600lb and seems like it could certainly handle it from my experience thus far.",
