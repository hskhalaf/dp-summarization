Only one issue, that of the birghtness of the screen in dark situations, pales in comparison to the speed, battery life and overall quality. I wanted a compact, high quality, functionally superior camera - the exilim is all that an more. I just love it.",

SD memory type fits the slot I have in my Toshiba Laptop, but I never had to take the SD memory-stick out because the docking station is a breeze to use. Super Fast Startup and battery life are the main plus. Do not buy a digital camara that uses AA or AAA batteries, is a waste of money. You dont have to worry about this with the Casio Exilim.",

I like the larger screen, it was easy to learn to use and the pictures come out great. My only complaint is that if its dark its hard to see the screen when taking the picture. You do have to use a docking station but if we travel we can both bring our cameras and just one docking station.Make sure you buy a Sandisk digital card for storage- 256 should be fine holds 80-100 pictures. Overall I am thrilled with the camera.",

In daylight the quality is OK at best, but under low light conditions it was terrible. I'm really down on Casio after this experience, but the reviews on the other models give me some hope. I am looking at the Pentax model now. The size and options are great on this, but that did not compensate for the dismal picture quality.",

Every family should own at least one! Things just keep getting better. A Best Buy here at Amazon, only regret they did not carry the camera in other colors, such as some other retailers did.",

The only downside I have found so far is that the instruction manual doesn't provide much information on the myriad of features - disapointing to have all the bells and whistles and not have the supporting information to go with them. All in all though, this camera is simply wonderful and has met all my performance expectations and needs.",

The camera is also light wieght and I was looking for a camera that I could fit in an evening bag. I look forward to taking this camera every with me.

I am now in battle with this terrible manufacturer to have my camera repaired under the twelve month warranty the camera was sold under.",
