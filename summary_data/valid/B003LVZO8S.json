Stability wise it perches well enough if you don't shake the monitor or pull the cord. I would mainly recommend this for 1 or 3 monitor setups as two monitor setups are typically angled inwards meaning the webcam will not be square on the user however I have two monitors and have found a way to use the cam happily.",

These cameras are great and provide high-quality video and audio and are perfectly compatible with Skype. I highly recommend this over the more expensive options. Unless you need more advanced features or are looking for 1080 resolution, go with this camera. Even if you spend twice as a much on a full HD camera, there is no guarantee that our computer, internet and the other variables will actually allow you to send full HD video to the other party anyhow. Don't waste money on the more expensive models--this one works perfectly fine.",

It secures pretty well to the top of your monitor (I used some double sided tape) and the angling seemed smooth, yet sturdy. Highly recommended!",

I previously had the Lifecam VX-3000 which required focusing for how far I was from the cam, and the mic couldn't hear me well so I had to use a stand-alone one up close.

Relatively small and low profile, has a lengthy cable, and video quality is great for the price (bought it for ~$25). Microphone is meh. Cons: Framerate for live video was only 14FPS, I haven't tried recording video but the live stream FPS was kind of lacking. Works well enough for Twitch though. Overall: 9/10 For the price you can't beat it. But if you NEED the higher framerate or higher resolution camera, I recommend upgrading. Works for almost any purpose though.
