I could take someone\u2019s eye out if I were to use this bad boy. For the price I expected an easy out the box self flying hovering drone not this one look elsewhere. In the video the girl just goes and gets the drone sets it up in seconds and takes a group picture, NOPE., all LIES . Also other reviewers on this item are suspect I would question their integrity. What you get with this drone is comperable to a 20$ drone. I have no idea how they go all those 5 stars",
