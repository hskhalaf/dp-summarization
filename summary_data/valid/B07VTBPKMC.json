The first time I used them, one of the buttons fell in, luckily I got insurance on them. After I went through sending them in for the warranty to be used to repair them, I was simply sent a gift card...? WOW. The worst part is I want another pair but I likely won't get a pair of skullcandy. It's been about 3 weeks that I should have been enjoying them, instead, I'm empty handed, SAD DAY!",

Also unlike the original crusher wireless when bass hits on these headphones vibrate like crazy which honestly is quite annoying where the originals did not do that. on the pros though, these are much more comfortable on the crown of your head where the original crusher wireless would make the crown of your head hurt. Do I think it's worth it comparatively from it's cheaper older model? Jury is still out.",

I am constantly adjusting the bass for every track, but when I have it up my head is thumping. Bass you can feel. Definitely worth the 299.99 I paid. Also, everyone keeps asking my about headphones.

      "title": "Great Headphones but they've been prone to malfunction",
      "text": "Needed some new headphones and decided to buy these. They are absolutely rad headphones, but after about a month and a half the Bass Slider stopped working and I began to notice a static/screeching noise when turning Noise cancelling on and off. Luckily Skullcandy gives you a 2 year warranty, i'm about to send mine back for a new set. When they work they are amazing headphones, but it is annoying that things have started malfunctioning after only a month.",

Maybe turn down bass for rock and metal cause the low frequencies often get lost, and its not the headphones for that, it's just how the song was mixed and mastered. But playing games on my laptop with them... is the best part xp these are very very good gaming headphones",

      "text": "So far they're working great. Been using skullcandy headphones for like 14 years and the sound quality is always great for the price. These are no exception but I still waiting to see if they break. Build quality seems pretty solid so I'm not super worried about that. The active noise cancelling isn't as good as what you'd get from sony but these are considerably cheaper than the sony equivalent so it's to be expected. I'd say these are well worth the money if you're after a solid high end pair of headphones in this price range.",

I work as a gardener and with the noise cancelling on these headphones really cut down the sound of my lawnmower, they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the sound quality is excellent.",
