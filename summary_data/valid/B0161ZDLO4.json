There were minor dents in the laptop casing but those didn't impact its actual use like an unstable screen that kept falling down. I returned it and ordered another in hopes of it being better. The second one looked like someone had played football with it or dropped it down a stairwell. I have no pictures, but the screen was partially shattered and there were huge dents in the exterior casing. The exterior also had large black scuff marks on it, but again, those didn't impact the actual use of the laptop, but a broken screen and dented disc drive did.",
