      "text": "I want to give this 3 stars, but that is in comparison to the Krugo Tire Rack labelled covers (purchased as long ago as 2009). I bought these because I couldnt readily find a wrap (long story) amd figured I was due for a new set anyway. I like that they had a label for which tire it comes from. However, the fabric seemed flimsier and it did not feel secure when moving the tire. I went digging to find my missing wrap. Same brand, minimal price difference, but it just doesnt feel the same. It is possible that all of the newer ones are made the same, please know I am comparing my older Tire Rack to this order.",
