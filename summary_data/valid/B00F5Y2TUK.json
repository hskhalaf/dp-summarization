If you are intending to hike light, and you combine this piece of gear with a good light weight tarp, then you can not beat this hammock for value.

It seems sturdy and strong enough for me to get in & out (205 lb.) 6ft. Netting seems just what I expected, Zipper is good, made of metal. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is it is double stitched and not triple. But still, the triple stitched Grand Trunk that I also own cost $70.00 compared to $43.00 for this one. But all in all, they are both pretty comparable to one another. And double stitched is better than single. I'm sure it will be just fine.",

The mosquito net worked great: there were mosquitos buzzing outside the hammock all night, but none ever made there way inside. Obviously, you need to have a tarp above you, but I would also recommend picking up a different pair of tree straps, at least as a backup. Also, if you're sleeping in it during cold conditions (\u226440\u00b0), then I would recommend getting an under quilt or something similar.",

As far as I can tell they were able to get me through the bottom of the hammock. I hate to leave a bad review on an otherwise good product but the reason I got this was to keep the mosquitoes out. The hammock is comfortable and easily held my 230 lbs. But lotta good that does when I'm itching like crazy!",
