      "text": "Our dogs our outside most of the day. We give them flea preventative but other bugs like to bother them. We have had these collars on for about a week and the overall itching has gone down quite a bit. This is a great product that doesn't use the harsh chemicals. Think of these as the same as putting bug spray on your dog. Yes, there is a smell associated with it, but it is similar to if you sprayed yourself with bug spray. The company is great to work with, they donate 7% of their profits to animal charities. Overall greatly recommend this product.",

Collars would probably work if the dogs were in town, on mowed grass, and didn't hang out with flea-infested wildlife.",
