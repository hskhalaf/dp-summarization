It actually does take away from the extended carry-on luggage size, so I ended up carrying my own backpack and this suitcase for a week-long trip, and I was able to fit everything I needed and even had room to spare - so I brought an extra pair of shoes, of course!",

It is separated into two zipped compartments so there was clear separation of toys. Every parent knows what I am talking about. The Spinner is excellent. It carried everything we needed for the boys for an 8 day trip. It is durable and the Falcon is awesome on the outside of it.",

It's a solid hard-size luggage piece with four wheels. Rolling it empty is good, but with items inside on airport carpet or tiles is very smooth and easy to turn. Soft-sided pack is a nice expansion option for when they're coming home from Grandpa's with extra gifts. Hypothetically speaking. The only objection I have is the price. Yikes.",

The listing pix actually cover it quite well so I won't duplicate. I can say that they're really sturdy and feel like good quality materials. This was a fun partnership idea and I think it worked out very well.

Make sure that your items don't get extra squished and jostled while going through the rigors of multiple plane transfers. The suitcase turns on a dime. I'm a little concerned with the external wheels--which means that they are at risk of being broken off, but that's the tradeoff for the extra maneuverability. the suitcase is super lightweight. And there's a zipper through the middle for expanding its depth.",

This bag can be a carry-on, but the super cool design will help identify the suitcase if they decide to check it. The case is sturdy and will withstand any rough handling at the airport. It\u2019s got good wheels and plenty of room inside. The backpack is an added plus. Highly recommended.",
