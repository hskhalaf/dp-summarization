I just used this chainsaw for the first time today. I started about an hour ago and have spent more time fixing the chain than cutting. I have not went more than 3 or 4 minutes without having to adjust the bar or completely remove it to tighten and reinstall the chain. Definitely WOULD NOT recommend this saw!",
