      "text": "An excellent camera. I tell people that this is my \"Phoneless Camera\"...many seem amazed to learn they make cameras without phones. Been very pleased at ease of use and wide range of tools available. I would like to see a better manual or on-line guide to location and use of settings. (Are you reading this GE?)Takes excellent pics, much easier and better than those cameras that have phones. Besides, what if the phone rings just as you about to snap that one-in-lifetime shot?",

    "description": "GE Power Series E1410SW Digital Camera features advanced Aptina A-Pix CMOS pixel technology for high performance 14MP, high speed continuous shot, image blending, improved Full-HD 1080p video and low light 3200 ISO sensitivity.

View larger\n\nULTRA SLIM BODY WITH POWERFUL ZOOM\nThe E1410 is equipped with 10x optical zoom and housed in one of the slimmest designs available. Slip this camera in your purse or pocket and you'll be ready for anything.\n\n28MM WIDE ANGLE LENS\nWith its wide angle lens, you can capture a wider scene and more of the action than with traditional camera lenses.\n\nFULL HD 1080P VIDEO AND HDMI OUTPUT\nCreate your own highlight reel as every action becomes easy to capture in Full HD 1080p video. Share your high resolution videos instantly with ultra-convenient HDMI connectivity.\n\nTHE CMOS ADVANTAGE\nWhen image is everything, CMOS technology delivers. With features like High-Speed Continuous Shooting, Full 1080p HD and improved High Dynamic Range+ (HDR+), you'll never miss an action shot again. Combine this cutting edge performance with wide-angle, long zoom capabilities and you'll be one sharp shooter.\n\nHIGH DYNAMIC RANGE\nHDR+ (High Dynamic Range+) Photos unite. Now you never have to lose the beauty of low-light images. An improved HDR+ feature blends three different exposures, combining the most detailed portions of each to create one perfect image.\n\nMULTI-EXPOSURE\nWith the ability to blend multiple images, you can finally see the whole picture. The Multi-Exposure feature captures the action in six successive shots then combines them into a single photo. Just one button and you're on your way.\n\nFACE AUTO-EXPOSURE\nGE's Face AE detects human faces and automatically adjusts camera settings for the best the exposure. When taking photos under dark shade or in backlit conditions, portrait shots still come out perfectly.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZATION\nThe optical image stabilization automatically adjusts for unintentional camera movements, giving you crisp, clear pictures every time.\n\nPANCAPTURE\nWith most cameras, \"panoramic\" means standing way back from your subject while it cuts off the top and bottom of the photo. With the Pancapture feature, a true single panoramic picture requires only one press of the shutter button and you panning the camera across the shot. The E1410SW automatically takes the remaining 2 shots, then seamlessly stitches them together.\n\nAUTO SCENE\nClose ups? Low lighting? With Auto Scene Detection, the camera surveys the lighting and environment and automatically sets the exposure for the sharpest, most vibrant pictures possible. You get to concentrate on capturing the moment while the camera does the heavy lifting.\n\nOBJECT TRACKING\nMoving targets are no problem with this cool feature.
