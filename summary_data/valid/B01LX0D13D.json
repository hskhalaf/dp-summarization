      "text": "I've only had the bike for a week, but i definitely made a good choice selecting this model. I went with the Medium and it's a perfect fit. I'm 5'8\" with a 30\" inseam and the top tube is about a 1/2\" underneath me while standing. Assembly was pretty easy. Didn't have to follow the instructions, but based on briefly reviewing them, they seemed straight forward. I took the bike out for a spin and and fine tuned the brakes to my liking. I do like the fact that you only need a 6mm allen to make most adjustments. I'd highly recommend buying this model.",

They just said take it to a bike shop and have it set up. Well you know this is not my first bike and I have done this with many bikes. Anyhow shame on Raleigh and I bought some special tool for hanger alignment and fixed the problem myself. Bike ride great now. Seat not very comfortable but my rump will toughen up.",

I had some metric allen wrenches, but no thin metric open-ended wrenches. Looked up the assembly instructions online. Installed handle-bars, seat and pedals ok. When I got to attaching the front wheel, something looked wrong. (I sure hope the instructions that are supposed to come with the bike are better than the online ones). At this point, I contacted a top-notch bike shop to complete assembly and left it with them. They said front fork was bent.",

However, the frame is a little thicker than what is pictured. I had to do a couple of adjustments to the deraileurs. Took about 45 minutes to put togather. The hardest part were the brakes. Dosent really have an instruction manual on how to put togather like other bikes i have botten here on amazon. It is heavier than i expected but then again its lighter than most bikes by a little bit. About 26 pounds. Ill update during the upcoming months..",
