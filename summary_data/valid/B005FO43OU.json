You can control every function of your TV, Cable Box, DVD, and Receiver/Sound System with this one remote! We tried several of the other Harmony products and they just did not compare! This one has lasted us almost 15 years so I did not mind the high price! I wish they would continue to make this model, it\u2019s hard to improve on perfection!",

A few months ago I acquired a new Sony AV Receiver and a new Sony Blu-Ray DVD player whose inputs and speed needed something meatier than the 550 model I'd been using for several years. So I shopped online and read other reviews of the Harmony One, and--based on all the positives--I ordered mine several weeks ago. It was very easy to program, and I love the features: A self-charging battery with its own \"dock,\" the touch-command screen, and the comfortable ergonomic fit in your hand when maneuvering through your entertainment choices. The amazon.com price was right, and delivery was fast and efficient.",

It will make things so much easier. My remote is controlling my LCD TV, Sony PS3 (needs an adapter for the PS3 to receive the signal), AV receiver, and wireless dimmer switch. My only complain about this remote is I wish you were able to control the size and location of the touch screen buttons. Other than that, it's a great remote!",

It's one omission is that it will not control PS3s which do not use infrared commands (? PS4s also). At the list price of $300 this universal remote control is not a great bargain, but used at half that, it's still the best integrated remote anyone has ever made.",

I makes them too easy to accidentally hit when trying to select from the list of applications.

However, I have already cracked the LCD touchscreen in this remote by dropping it onto our living room floor. This type of fall hasn't caused a problem for other electronics (phones, tablets), but it rendered the top half of the remote's touchscreen illegible.

      "text": "If you have several components in you home theater system, this unit is worth the money to be rid of fumbling with multiple remotes... I have six components: TV, Cable Box, Surround Receiver, Blu-ray Player, DVR, and an A/V Switcher...eliminated all six remote controls and now use just the Harmony One....Love it!! You do the programming on your computer, and then download it to the Harmony One. I had to go through several iterations before I got it right, but it really was easy to follow the prompts... I think a few iterations are normal because there is a short \"learning curve\", and a little \"trial and error\" involved... highly recommend it!",

      "text": "I have used a number of universal remotes, including the Harmony 880. This is a huge improvement over the 880 mainly because the button quality is so much better and the recharging contact is an exact fit now. As with all Harmonys, the set up is very easy and can be programmed by anyone. The step by step setup guides you through the whole process. Along the same lines as the button quality, the ergonomics are great on the remote. The only mark against the remote is the touchscreen. It gets fingerprints very easily and just makes the remote look a little cheap. But that is a very minor gripe but enough to prevent a perfect rating.",
