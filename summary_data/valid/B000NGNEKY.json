It's not overly sweet, not aggressively fizzy and decently refreshing.

It dehydrates me, and that amount of sugar is unhealthy for anyone. That being said, I bought it as a novelty item, and the per dollar price tag was well worth it. You can't touch quality energy drinks at $1.45 per can, definitely worth the buy!",
