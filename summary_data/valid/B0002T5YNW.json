Not very thought out when designing a tool for $100 and you can\u2019t even put in a simple blade. Who needs three different types of saws but no knife?? Really wish Victorinox comes up with a better design in the future cause after a design flaw like this I will only be going forward with Leatherman Products going forward with multitool products for camping and daily use.",

If they'd put a matte finish on this bad boy and added a pocket clip, my leathermans would be collecting dust. Hope this helps!",

Plus the whole look and feel of the Spirit oozes quality and strength. The odd shape of the razor-sharp main knife blade will take a little getting used to, but the reamer will do the job of poking a hole. Very happy with the Spirit, I've used it many times already. The lock-release function works flawlessly and is very easy to get used to.",

I use the scissors, knife, pliers, wire strippers and screwdrivers a lot, the file chisel and metal saw less often and I seldom use the wood saw but when I have it worked really well. I carry it around all the time. If you don't have seat belt cutters in your car you might want the serrated blade version (or for some other reason) but a regular drop point blade version also exists. It doesn't rust, the mechanisms are smooth and reliable, and the tools work well. Not heavy. Convenient if you carry it around all the time.",

I find the handle comfortable and the tools functional. I probably will never use some of the tools, but the ones I do use (screwdrivers, saw, file, scissors, can opener, pliers) work well. Complaints: -Scissors are very small. Big enough for string, but too small for serious cutting (fabric, etc). -Heavy (\"sturdy\" :P ) -The leather sheath cannot be mounted sideways.

    "description": "No tool belt should be without its very own Victorinox Swiss Army SwissTool. The SwissTool was designed for ease of use, but doesn't compromise on durability or functionality. Individual springs hold the tools in place so you can easily access each one individually from the outside of the handle.

From lightweight design to its outside opening implements, there's not much the SwissTool can't do.\n\nLike all Swiss Army Knives, the SwissTool has a lifetime warranty, stainless steel implements and Swiss-made quality and durability. \n\nIncludes 27 Functions:\n\n 1.  Needle Nose Pliers\n 2.  Screwdriver (2mm)\n 3.  Screwdriver (3mm)\n 4.  Wire Cutter (for wire up to 40 hrc)\n 5.  Bottle Opener\n 6.  Screwdriver (6mm)\n 7.  Strong Crate Opener\n 8.

Ten Individual Springs\n 27. Lock Release\n\nHistory and Heritage\nIn 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers\u2019 union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer\u2019s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as \u201cinoxydable\" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.\n\nToday, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. \n\nCare Tips for Swiss Army Knives\nThe various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.\n\nSharpening\nTo re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15\u00b0\u2013 20\u00b0. This will result in a cutting angle of 30\u00b0\u2013 40\u00b0. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.\n\nCleaning\nAfter you\u2019ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFrom the renowned company that created the Swiss Army knife a century ago comes the SwissTool Spirit folding multi-tool, a handy tool kit neatly contained within a folding body that measures just 4.13 inches long. The SwissTool Spirit is sheathed in a sleek stainless-steel body that stores comfortably in a leather belt pouch. More importantly, the SwissTool Spirit offers 27 functions, with such mini-tools as needle-nose pliers; 2mm, 3mm, and 6mm screwdrivers; a wire cutter; a bottle opener; a crate opener; a combi-edge blade; scissors; a metal file; a metal saw; a wood saw; a reamer; a Phillips screwdriver; a chisel/scraper; an isolation length cutter; a wire bender; a wire stripper; a wire scraper/round cutter; a can opener; a multipurpose hook; a coupling for a corkscrew; a hardwire cutter; 10 individual springs; and a lock release. \n\n As with all Victorinox items, the SwissTool Spirit is made to exacting standards, with dozens of steps going into its construction. Victorinox attends to every detail, from selecting the finest materials to performing the final inspection. In addition, each individual tool has been hardened in a different way to stand up to its designated use. The SwissTool Spirit--which comes with a lanyard hole and a leather pouch--weighs 5.75 ounces and carries a lifetime warranty. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe SwissTool Spirit packs 27 functions into its compact stainless-steel body.

Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and \"inox,\" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.",
