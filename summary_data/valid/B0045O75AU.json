Just know that you are not getting what you're paying for. I ended up buying separate accessories that actually hold up. Very disappointed but my son still enjoys playing with it. I will not buy from kidcraft anymore, I thought they were a reputable brand since the prices are always so high in toysrus but clearly I was wrong. The picture shows just SOME of the broken toys because others just ultimately got tossed into the trash. I am going to try and fix these ones.",

The child won't be able to enjoy it until assembly is complete. Also, some areas of paint on the wood pieces seem to flake off rather easily; particularly, the doors. It doesn't take much of a scratch from a fingernail to remove the paint. This was discovered accidentally. However, overall the product seems sturdy. Comes with great accessories for the rescue house, including a firetruck and police motorcycle. Good purchase overall.",

I do (kind of) wish the bell was a real bell, but maybe I'd regret that.",

He's a little boy who loves trucks, airplanes, etc, the louder the better. So the fire and police stations were perfect for him. It's well-made, has great little interior things to play with, and folds up in a tidy box for storage. He still loves it!",

There were lots of Mark's on both the wood and plastic parts and when taking the stickers off some of the plastic doors the paint came right off. This is the first product I bought from kidkraft and the quality of it definitely turned me off to the brand. If it didnt come last minute for my 5 year olds birthday I probably would have returned it and looked for something similar from a different brand.",
