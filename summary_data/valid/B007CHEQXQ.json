My cat was 21 when she died. She was on Science Diet K/D and I found this product after the vet said that the subcutaneous fluids were not working any more. She lived several more years after that-- without subcutaneous fluids. I sprinkled it on her food. I did not have to use it continuously.",

However, she had been diagnosed with kidney disease in August 2015, and Azodyl was one of the products I used to stabilize her creatinine levels, in fact they dropping from 3.2 to 2.6. Azodyl, along with diet like green triple dog food, omega 3's, b vitamins and cranberries helped keep her healthier and happier and live a little longer, but sadly not as long as I would've wanted. Great product, highly recommended. Thank you Vetoquinol for Azodyl, keep up the good work.",

Instructions say do not open capsule, feed 1 hour before main meal. My little guy eats when he is hungry. Meal times vary. So with all of that, after paying $70+, I will look for other options.
