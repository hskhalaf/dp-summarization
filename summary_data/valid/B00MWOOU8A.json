If you are not going to bolt it down or fix some way so it is immovable then buy the suction cups (they don't come with it) I can not hold it still while using on big potatoes so I ordered the suction cups. This thing makes serious French fries!!",

The small cutter will not work at all on sweet potatoes. The medium cutter will work as long as the sweet potato is cut in quarters the long way and then in half across it. Placing the quarters in the slicer with the small end towards the blades allows me to slice them. I'm OK with this, but I can't quite give it a five because of it. It does seem to be well-made and very sturdy. It would have been nice to have rubber feet included.",

So long as you rinse it right after use it's not too difficult to clean. It's large and cumbersome, though, to store and use. I'm not really willing to attach it to my wall, though.",
