      "text": "This is an excellent quality product, but I got the wrong size. The sleeves are tiny and the measurements are much smaller than listed (especially in the bust) and yet I have to say I'd have been very happy with it if it had fit. I don't think I'd wear it in a Michigan winter without a hoodie underneath, though. I meant to get an XL, but as I don't have the time or money to deal with the hassle of a refund/return, I'm going to have to eat the $60 and give it to a friend. Sucks, but I think she will like it. I'd happily try again, but I don't know if I want to lose another $60.",

My only complaints are that it gets tight when I bend my elbows and it has a somewhat odd shape on the sides of the breasts when it isnt zipped up. Like of like it curves out like a bra would to support breasts even when you're not wearing it. I think itll be warm in cool weather and it feels like pretty heavy and good quality.",

      "text": "Never have I gotten so many compliments on a jacket as I have with this one, just in the first couple days of wearing it!! Fits to form and keeps me warm. The fitting looks great on me and I have deemed this my main go to now. This is not really a biker feeling jacket, but just an everyday, workable one that is easy to slip on and off and is very workable as far as pairing it to outfits.",

If I wore low rise pants then maybe it would be too short. The only complaint I have is that it came with creases where it was folded and stuffed into a plastic bag, for easy shipping, I guess. This jacket makes me look like I have an hourglass figure. I love it!! The camel color is perfect, it is a little darker but it matches perfectly with a pair of boots I already had. For reference I am 5'4\" 185lbs. If your on the fence.... Get it, it's worth it!",
