I\u2019ll update later as to long-term durability, but I think it\u2019s going to last a good while. Oh, chairs aren\u2019t fairly comfy. I\u2019ve had better, but I\u2019ve had worse.",

These are comfortable, truly waterproof, and don't scratch our deck when we slide them around.

This does not fit with Amazon's image nor my prior experience with Amazon which has always been positive. I would recommend dropping this seller from Amazon. I still await outcome of this dispute. Additionally, I am in my 70' s, the items are heavy and not easy to return. Even the cardboard boxes were thin, flimsy and falling apart. The rattan was unraveling from two chair.s I din't even bother with opening the rest. I certainly can't recommend this product. This was a most time consuming, difficult and disappointing experience.",

It takes two people to assemble; the holes don't line up well with the pieces and several screws were stripped but we made it work. The wood on the chair arms should be rounded, leaning on the arm for any length of time isn't comfortable. The wood slats on the table should be sanded to help with cleaning and not worrying about little fingers getting splinters. It's been too hot and windy to use the set yet but we hope to real soon!",
