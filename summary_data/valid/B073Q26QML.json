This cleaver has excellent weight and balance. So far it has kept its sharpness. It has become my go to knife!",

Chopping chunks goes faster than slicing them. But if you do have to slice or cut something, no need to change knives. Blade is wide enough to assist in scooping/scraping cut chunks from cutting board into your other hand. Only thing I can't comment on is durability of edge as I have only used it once. Tore through 10 lbs. of meat in minutes. Will keep you posted about durability. So far though, a winner!",
