I have dropped it completely into water, and it was fine. It gets pretty loud for just running on batteries and being so compact. I bought some rechargeable AAs, so I don't go through so many. Normally, when I only use it in the shower, the rechargeable batteries last for 2 weeks or so. No complaints here, I love it! Worth every penny.",

The speakers are not really loud enough for my liking, especially for a float trip. I've only used this twice and have found the battery life to be very disappointing as well. Also, the box shows this floating in a pool but the instructions say 'Do Not Submerge'. While I never intend to SUBMERGE it, I am concerned about how well it will actually protect my iPod on a float trip, which was my original purpose for buying it.",

Downside is that you MUST have four AA batteries. There is no electric adaptor for this...but, duh! wouldn't want it to fall in the water plugged in. Excellent value.",

My husband got a kick out of turning the case over so the speakers were in the water and the going under and listening to the music underwater. We now have this great product for our pool.

The quality of the sound is perfect - no vibrations or scratchy noises from the speakers. The whole unit is really neat looking since it is all clear and you can see everything inside it.
