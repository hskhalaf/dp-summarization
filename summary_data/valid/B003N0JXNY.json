Unfortunately, we wont keep using it and we will go back to the lavender mint formula. This diaper formula, while it does clean well and gets even the tough stains out, has a strong smell that we don't care for. In addition, ever since we started using this diaper formula our daughter had been getting really bad rashes. She never got rashes with the other formula. We are going to save this for when we need stain removal and switch back.",

I soaked her laundry in hot water with the detergent, then did a regular wash on hot. The smell is completely gone! I am honestly shocked.

The soap works well on breastfed poop, transitional semi solid, and solid (still shake it out dirst). It cleans diapers and other laundry thoroughly. I ran into contradictory instructions between this soap and the diapers we use. The soap says to wash cold with soap and then run a hot cycle. The diapers say to use soap in the hot cycle, not the first wash. Settling on washing machine settings was a bigger deal than I thought. Every machine is different, so some brand/ model research is helpful.",

However, it seems to work best for me when I use an extra scoop and hang the diapers out in the sun to dry. On the occasions i\u2019ve needed to dry inside due to weather, I\u2019ve noticed there can still be a bit of an odor after washing. Still working on tweaking the washing routine and extra rinsing helps, but was a little disappointed i have to use more than recommended and still run into that issue sometimes.",

      "text": "I have been using this soap for my cloth diapers for 18 months. I do laundry 1-2x per week and I use 1-2 scoops each load depending on the size, not an he washer. NO RASHES, wonderful scent, only have to do an ammonia soak once every few months. I buy a bag every 2-3 months. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this soap for all your cloth diapering, and cloth feminine hygiene needs",
