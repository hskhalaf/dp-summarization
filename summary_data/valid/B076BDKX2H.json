The holder has a inbuilt battery so even the lights the electric out the sytem is still working. There is a small button at the top to activate. It has a timer in it so it stops it self. You may use it as brusing timer. It really great tool. I strongly recommend",

This device is great because it has a fan to dry the toothbrushes and UV light for germs. Not sure if UV actually works or not for germs. I bought it mostly for the drying feature and it keeps the brushes and toothpaste tidy in the bathroom while providing a door on the front to help protect the brushes for other germs in the bathroom. I would definitely buy this again in the future and maybe for gifts for family.",
