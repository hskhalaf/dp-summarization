The metal is thin, but that is to be expected at this price point. Also, the front intake fan screw holes are very tight and will require quite a bit of force as you fasten the fans. Just be sure to apply pressure on the backside of the fans so you don't bow the sides of the frame out. Also, SSDs would be my recommendation in this case. Hard drives will not get much airflow if mounted per the intended design. I would not have any objection to using this case with future builds.",

You don't have much room to work on, cable management is okay-ish, it does get really hot inside with the filters on the case. I can't recommend this for beginners. For people building their first PC go for an NZXT510 if you're looking for a mid-tower build, however, if you're really going for a micro-atx build go for the Cooler Master NR400.",

No heat issues at all using stock cpu cooler and one intake fan in front, two exit air fans in the roof. No cable routing issues, room for two 2.5\" drives on the right side next to the MB and room for one 3.5\" drive in the back. I like that it is less than 15\" deep.",

      "text": "The Cooler Master Master box case is great for a small compact mATX build. There is plenty of room in the case for a large graphics card. The RX 590 got easy in the case. The holes for installing more fans was a bit hard to find so read the manual. The case can fit 5 fan and has great airflow. The case has plenty of room for cable management on the back. I wish it had a power supply basement but it is a $50 mATX case. The side panel and front panel connector can be moved to so that is a nice bonus.",

I then upgraded to a ryzen 3800x and GTX 2080 super, and both of them reached their maximum temperatures in this case. I bought another, much larger case, and they ran way cooler. so don't buy this if you're getting very high-end parts",

Other than that the quality is decent but the plastic power button and IO area is pretty cheap. In 2020 not having an TRRS port is unbelievable. Please fix this Cooler Master.",
