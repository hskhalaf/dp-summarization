The Logitech Z323 with Subwoofer perform just as well or in most cases better than the $200 HK I bought 15 years ago. The cables from the Sub to the L&R speakers are longer than described, which worked out great for the location I have them in. These are great PC speakers, I was very surprised how well they sound for the money and size. Buy them, you won't be disappointed!",

It looked like it was straight outta 1991 or something! LOL Anyway, this Logitech setup sounds great, is plenty loud, looks modern, and we haven't noticed any annoying quirks, yet. I went with Logitech because I have several other products from them, including a Z906 500w RMS setup, which roars beautifully. I have come to trust the brand as high-quality products that outlast the competition 9 times outta 10! P.S. I was surprised at how rich and deep the bass gets for such a little subwoofer!",

I am sorry I ordered these speaker as it appears from other reviews that they are very prone to this problem during manufacture.

      "text": "I purchase these for occasionals music listening, and school lectures/ presentation audio. I would not go so far as to say that these speakers blow the door open with sound quality, bass, or volume, but for the price they are a quality upgrade from stock monitor/ computer speakers. Volume does have to be turned up to about 50% to hear much of anything clearly though, but has been consistent with that threshold. Only suggestion I would make is to put the bass control on next to the sound volume control rather so than on the Subwoofer, a bit inconvenient to go behind the desk to alter the level.",

      "text": "I've had these speakers for over 3 years, and they have delivered great sound for the price. But recently the left speaker started to short out, and I think the problem is in the volume knob. I suspect turning them on and off over the years has caused the problem, now I just disconnect the power cord and leave the knob turned on, but it still shorts out, so I'm looking for a new set. My advice is, don't turn off the volume knob, and these speakers may last a little longer.",

I personally use it for gaming and it makes the games sound way more realistic along with a bass that will vibrate the walls when turned up. If you live in an apartment, definitely turn the bass down.",

The bass, first of all, is amazing. The sub woofer is great and gives out overwhelming bass. I put it at half, because at full it blasts away through the bottom floor. If other reviews are saying the bass gave out, its because they used it chaotically. Use it gently and it will not disappoint you. Yes, it does have a weird cord for the other speaker, but who cares! It is such a masterpiece of a speaker that is affordable! I can't recommend highly enough. These works wonders.",
