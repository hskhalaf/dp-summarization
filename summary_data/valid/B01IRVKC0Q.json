So my plates never line up tight on the bar. The 35lbs plates are embarrassingly crooked. I\u2019m not looking for perfect weights, so I asked the manufacturer to only send me new 35\u2019s instead of a complete new set. I thought this would be extremely fair. They want me to send entire weight set back and for me to pay for the shipping. It wasn\u2019t like an accident happened, they know they shipped out a sub par product.",
