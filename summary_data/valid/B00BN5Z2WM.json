The old one receives 41 channels, so I put this in the exact same spot, connected the USB amp power line, and got NOTHING. That's right, not one single DTV channel! My TV is a 2019 Samsung 4K QLED 60, in case you're wondering. So, I reconnected the old flat antenna, made by 1 By One, scanned yet again, then I had the 41 DTV channels again. Caveat emptor.",

The television I am using is smallish, and I do not know how well it works with a large screen TV, but it works well in my application. I recommend it highly.",

But, just like rabbit ears, the signal can come and go, you have to find the right spot for the antenna, etc. Not sure it's really the fault of the antenna, it's just part of broadcast signals over the air.",

      "text": "This antenna was easy to install and is performing well. I live near Washington DC and about 35 miles south of Baltimore. The channel scan found all of the major channels from both areas. The reception is clear in good weather, with some slight pixelation on the Baltimore channels during rain. The antenna is on the second floor of the house. I first placed it in a window thinking the reception might be better, but when I closed the aluminum miniblinds (behind the antenna) the signal disappeared. I moved the antenna to the side of a clothes chest and reception was very good as described above. So for local channels, this seems an excellent alternative to cable.",

We were pleasantly surprised to receive 45 HD QUALITY channels within our 50 mile range! AWESOME!!! Much better than we even we ever had with cable! We then added a Roku (one time purchase cost of $70 or so) and then \"Sling TV\" ($20 per month) to allow us to receive CNN, HGTV, movies, listen to Pandora etc etc. PERFECT!! We now pay monthly charge of $70 instead of $140 for Internet and TV, a savings of $840/ year!!!",

The stated range is 50 miles and that is likely under the most ideal of conditions, however this is pulling in HD channels from about 32 miles away.
