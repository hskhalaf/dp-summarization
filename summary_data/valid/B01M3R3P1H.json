They are a little small but seem to fit him just fine and will likely last us through the season. The construction and materials are good at keeping the water away from his little feet and he loves the fireman pattern and red color. These were the most affordable boots that were of good quality and I will likely purchase another pair next year for him and one for my daughter.",

I would recommend these for a young child that will outgrow them quickly. They're a good price and they seem like they'll hold up for a season.",

All shoe brands run differently but I've noticed rain boots always run on the bigger side. We just bought him some converse in size 8 and he has a some room to grow. So I decided to order the size 7 in these rain boots since they don't lace up obviously. And they fit him perfectly! So I would recommend sizing down. His pair last year (not carters) I didn't size down and they would always fall off his feet while sitting in a shopping cart.",
