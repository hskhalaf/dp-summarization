This scanner says in its advertising that it is good for scanning ID cards, which most are plastic! We have had this less than a month and the documents have quit feeding thru. In the manual it states DO NOT scan plastic cards... so it is not good for scanning ID cards. so this is false advertising by amazon which will not let me return an over 200$ scanner they stated was good for scanning ID cards, this is crap for that purpose. do not buy if you need a scanner for plastic cards.",

Sounds like the rollers are on, but no movement of paper. Total waste of money. Just get the ix500 from the get-go. So disappointed in this purchase.",

The guide arms don't move smoothly, so it's hard to get them to fit around any particular piece of paper. The sheet feeder also jams a lot, and takes two or more sheets at once rather than one at a time a lot. It's really irritating, and makes scanning jobs take twice as long as they should.",

And it's helped me control the overwhelming paper clutter that comes flooding into my life. I can scan everything and get rid of the hard copies. Tips: (1) If you have different size pages, scan the largest sheet first. Otherwise it pauses and asks if you meant to scan different sizes. (2) Sometimes I have to hand-feed paper with different thicknesses (e.g., a stack of utility bills).",

      "text": "I wanted a small scanner to scan client documents. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why it jams. Same type of paper, different paper, fresh out of the printer, folded and straightened out again. Sometimes it registers a jam when there isn't one, and other times it will feed 2 pieces of paper in at once and not even skip a beat. I've found that some of the scans are skewed, and other times the software will automatically rotate a document upside down. Unreliable at best. Packing it up and sending it back.",
