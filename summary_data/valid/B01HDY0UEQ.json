    "description": "FIBE1RW09A000 Features: -Fibre-Metal's sophisticated SUPEREIGHT Impact Energy Control System raises protective performance to a new level. On impact, the smooth shell flexes, absorbing and dissipating some impact energy. The reduced impact energy is passed to the suspension system at eight scientifically determined points around the cap, thus dispersing the energy over a greater area of the head, reducing the risk of failure at any one point. During everyday wear, SUPERIGHT's low center of gravity, multiple adjustments, and choice of full sweatband, ratchet headband, or patented SWINGSTRAP provides the right fit and feel for maximum comfort. Most Fibre-Metal protective hats and cap are SEI certified. All come fully assembled. SUPEREIGHT protection plus an extra margin of protection from the sun's harmful rays. Full brim shades more of the face, neck and ears.. -ELECTRIC W/3-R RATCHET HEADBAND. -UNSPC CODE: 46181700. -Hardhats & Caps. Product Type: -Hard Hats.",
