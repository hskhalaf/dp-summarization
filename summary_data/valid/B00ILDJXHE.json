I was also disappointed with the packaging--the press sticker was so adhered and embedded into the fur I had to use a wet wash cloth to even remove it. The fur is also loose on the body. The quality was below par compared to the other Hasbro products. I would recommend the gray leopard version if you do not have an animal preference. The cost is less and the features are the same without the glitches.",

The panda seems sturdy & does some seriously sweet little things that will provide a good play opportunity for children to interact & care for. This isn't just another kitty cat or puppy dog robot, it's super sweet & sure to be a hit with your kids!",
