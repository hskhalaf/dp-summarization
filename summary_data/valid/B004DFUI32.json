Many of these water features sound like someone filling a bowl in the bathroom sink. This one sounds like the real thing, very soothing and peaceful. Had no trouble with the splashing others have mentioned. Use around five drops of algaecide every week to keep the water crystal clear. Would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a simple, good looking and sounding water feature that is a breezes to install.",

I remembered when I was in a small garden in Japan, the guide said that if you have water, rock and plants, you have a representation of the whole world. So with my fountain, my small place is transformed into a peaceful representation of the whole world! I call it my \"Secret Garden.\"",

We could have requested a warranty repair from the manufacturer, but we would have been required to pay the return shipping costs for this 50# object. Fortunately, the purchase of a tube of epoxy fixed the leak.",

Best cleaner believe it or not is white distilled vinegar. Have tried all of the \"algae cleaners\" over the years, nothing is better than distilled vinegar. Only need a cup once a week, no algae. I can't say enough good things about this fountain. One of my best amazon purchases ever.",

Sound is soothing and just loud enough to diffuse city noises a bit. Love the lights at night. Really pretty and natural looking as well. We just leveled the ground, laid down some gravel, put down a concrete stepping stone and set them on top. Would HIGHLY recommend these!",

She said the only thing missing was a water feature. So I bought this as a surprise. She loves it! It looks real nice and is soothing to listen to. Goes well with the flowers as you can see in the picture. It was very easy to assemble and was up and running in 5 minutes. Very nice product. I highly recommend it!",

This fountain pulls off a natural rocky look without the heft of actual rock. It also has a lovely flow that is nice to look at and listen to. The fountain is fairly loud (which is what I wanted to cover traffic noise) so keep that in mind if you are looking to put it in a small or indoor space. Absolutely love it and was able to get the box to the back porch and put it together on my own.",

This took care of the problem, and it has been constantly in use for 14 days without needing to add more water (but it is currently a cool time of the year). Very happy with the waterfall for the price, and hoping it will continue to function without any difficulties for a number of years.",
