The only drawback is the horns to leak at the control valve wish there's nothing you can do about that. The air leak is very small and is where the solenoid opens and closes. The air pump lines and tank do not leak and they are great workmanship. It is frustrating because the pump runs constantly to build the pressure that is being lost",

I was told to send it back which I would have to pay for. They would have the mechanics check it and if they found it faulty they would send me a new one. That would mean that I would have to pay my mechanic to remove and go with out a horn. There are no stars for this issue but I had to give it a 1 just to post this review",
