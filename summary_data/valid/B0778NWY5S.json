I have 2 deep freezers of bm & these are the ones I know don't leak. Who cares if it's not easy to pour into, at least once they are in it stays that way. Also easy to pour ourlt since the bags aren't flimsy.",

I like that there isn't all the extra bag above the seal so it's easy to pour milk in and out without making a mess.

I recommend milk bags with double zip to prevent waste. I used these for 3 months and I will not repurchase. These are good for the price point however if you produce more then 6oz per pump you will have to use two bags. I haven\u2019t had leak, tear, or spill problems so far. I just don\u2019t like I have to use two bags making them last less. Next time I\u2019ll buy mommy\u2019s precious since you can fit 8oz.",
