The iron is very good, but for my large hands it is easy to alter the temperature setting when lifting the iron. It does carry out its function well in use, and the long power cord is very good. I was surprised that it doesn't come with a filling jug, but it has a large opening for filling the water tank. If the temperature dial were a little tighter it would get 5 stars.",

Its dead easy to use, has an anti calc button... The one thing I really don't like is the design it's a bit bizzare it's the sort of iron Kim Kardashian would have.... If she ever ironed in her life.... Which make me hate ironing even more as I think of her every time I start to iron",

I have gone through probably half a dozen irons in the last 5 years, and they'd never last or were just plain rubbish. This iron is brilliant!! I literally have no negative comments I could make about it. I've had it a couple of months now and honestly it's the best iron I've had. Beating the 80-100\u00a3 ones I've gone through thinking I had to spend alot of money to get something decent!!",

I\u2019ve used the iron for two months now. It does occasionally leak water but it\u2019s not done that so much recently. It irons quite well. On its hottest setting you can clearly see the water in the tank going down. (I don\u2019t use that setting).",

Yes it is heavier than a steam generator but the weight of the iron means the ironing takes less time as the weight helps smooth out the wrinkles in the clothes.
