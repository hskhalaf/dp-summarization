The wood glasses are the same color wood as shown, and they at spring loaded on the sides so the ear pieces can bend outwards to accommodate all size heads. The watch looks really high end, quality. The leather band is thick and looks expensive. The packing is great and the cool wooden glasses case is just an awesome touch. This was worth it 100% I purchased as a gift, and several of us tried on the glasses, they look good on EVERYONE (male or female).",

Glasses don't fit my head. I wear a size 7 5/8 fitted hats if that helps. They stay on but I'm scared they'll break due to over exerting the hinges outward. On top of that they were a bit flimsy out the box. I've bought cheaper glasses that were stronger. It's not all bad though, the wood looks amazing, very smooth, and lightweight. Update: 09/02/18 So the glasses broke about 6 weeks ago. So that\u2019s about 1 month after arrival. Watch is still going strong and receives many compliments.",

    "description": "Are you ready for a watch that's just as unique as you? Our designers at Viable Harvest have created a new hybrid watch with a wood face and black stainless steel case. Our customers get the best of both worlds - the beauty of a wood watch and the durability of stainless steel. Not only does it look and feel great, but it's also 3ATM waterproof compliant! Whether you're indoors washing your hands or outdoors in a wet environment, the Viable Harvest watch is built to last!\n\nOur watch face is crafted with natural, eco-friendly walnut. At just under 2 inches, the faceplate is easy to see, clear and incredibly durable. With a striking black inlay and a second hand, you'll never struggle to see the time. The Japanese quartz movement will keep precise time day after day. Not only is it extremely accurate, it's super quiet and low maintenance. The battery lasts up to four years and is easily replaced. The strap is 100% genuine leather and is long enough to fit almost any wrist. It's soft (no chaffing here!), easily adjustable and reinforced with heavy-duty stitching.\n\nThe Viable Harvest watch is perfect as a gift and looks great on men AND women. Many of our customers have told us how unique this watch is - what a great conversation starter! Going casual? No problem! Dressing it up for the office? We've got the look for you! We've also included a custom designed gift box with a soft, black pillow for storage.\n\nAt Viable Harvest, we care about our customers. If you're not satisfied with our watch, let us know. We'll do everything we can to make it right. We've got a 100% money back guarantee to boot. So go ahead and order.
