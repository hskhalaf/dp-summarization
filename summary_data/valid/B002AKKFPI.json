However as many products have gone over the past few years cheaper parts and labor have come into play and my receiver now produces no sound whatsoever even though the unit shows a digital signal. Since it is no longer in warranty I will probably have to pay 50% of my purchase price to have it fixed. Hopefully Visa will make me whole with it's entended warranty protection. My Denon 3802 which I have owned since 2001 is bullet proof but it appears that this unit is not at the same level of quality.",

    "title": "Denon AVR1910 7.1-Channel Multi-Zone Home Theater Receiver with 1080p HDMI Connectivity (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "AVR 1910 is packed with technology and features making it the clear choice for value oriented consumers looking for exceptional performance. Each of its 7 amplifier channels produce 90 watts of power, delivering detail and dynamics to music and movie soundtracks. They can be configured for 7.1 channel surround sound, or drive a 5.1 channel system in the main room and power a pair of speakers in a second \u201czone\u201d. It\u2019s equipped with 1080p compatible HDMI 1.3a Repeating technology, delivering both audio and video to your HDTV with single HDMI cable. This HDMI connectivity supports the latest generation surround sound formats available on Blu ray disc, including Dolby TrueHD and DD+, dts HD and dts HR. Also included is Dolby Laboratories new Pro Logic IIz Matrix decoding featuring front height effects channels that expands front soundstage. The AVR1910 boast a number of Audyssey technologies. Advanced Audyssey MultEQ analyzes a speaker systems interaction with room acoustics, and then delivers custom tailored correction processing to optimize clarity and tonal balance throughout the listening space. Audyssey Dynamic Volume is an automatic volume leveling system that tracks audio dynamics to eliminate the irritating volume swings between TV shows and commercials. Audyssey Dynamic EQ is also on board to ensure rich bass and smooth tonal balance at low volume listening levels. In addition to enhanced HDMI 1.3a repeating (4 in, 1 out), the AVR1910 is the least expensive receiver in the Denon lineup to feature 1080p i/p conversion, analog to HDMI upscaling and HDMI to HDMI scaling. Video conversion is accomplished using a premium Anchor Bay Technologies 1030 chip set featuring 10 bit processing. The AVR1910 also features component video switching (2 in, 1 out), seven analog inputs, and multi zone (2)/multi source (2) capability. A front panel audio/video input allows quick and easy connection of camcorders and game systems.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\nTHE DENON AVR1910 7.1-CHANNEL MULTI-ZONE HOME THEATER RECEIVER WITH 1080P HDMI CONNECTIVITY - ENHANCES YOUR LEVEL OF ENTERTAINMENT ENJOYMENT\nThe AVR-1910 is a 7.1-channel A/V surround receiver that brings out the full performance of HD audio and HD video. It also has a high-performance video processor that reproduces the usual SD picture quality of DVD and other sources in the high 1080p resolution of HD video. The highly versatile AVR-1910 even supports Dolby Pro Logic IIz that reproduces surround sound with vertical dimensions in the front. \nIncludes four HDMI inputs and dual component inputs\n(View larger) Its other features include an easy-to-use remote control unit and numerous Denon technologies such as Direct Mechanical Ground Construction and Minimum Signal Paths that ensure total fidelity in HD audio and video playback and the best possible experience in surround A/V entertainment for you. \n\nSuperior Technology, Superior Sound\n\nCombining superlative performance and extensive signal processing capabilities, the AVR-1910 is packed with deluxe features that include the latest high resolution audio decoders, including Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. And, the AVR-1910 is one of the first to include Dolby Pro Logic IIz, which provides front height channel effects, for an incredibly expansive front soundstage. The video section features the latest Video Reference Series processor from Anchor Bay Technologies, providing analog-to-digital video deinterlacing and upconversion to HD, with both component and HDMI outputs, and features 1080p 24Hz/60Hz HDMI pass-through. \n\nWith four HDMI inputs and dual component inputs, the AVR-1910 is fully prepared for present and future HD sources. Top audio fidelity is assured with Audyssey MultEQ room acoustic measurement and correction system, which analyzes the speakers and the listening room and automatically corrects the response for the smoothest, most natural tonal balance. Audyssey Dynamic Volume and Dynamic EQ ensure rich tonal quality at any volume level, with no annoying volume jumps at commercial interruptions. \nOperate the on-screen display\nwith the remote control unit\n(View larger) \n\nRobust Power Source for Each Block\n\nTo produce a clear, stable power circuit that prevents unwanted noise from affecting the sound, the AVR-1910 has a dedicated CPU transformer that is separate from the audio and video circuitry. The AVR-1910 is endowed with a powerful rectifier circuit with 12,000 block capacitors and a bridge diode of 8A capacity, surpassing typical models in this price range, to supply stable current with negligible noise. \n\nHigh-Bit I/P Converter and Scaler Up to 1080p\n\nThe AVR-1910 uses a high-performance video up-scaler to convert SD (standard definition) video material to HD (high definition) quality. This means that 480i/480p (SD-quality) video signals of DVD programs and other material are converted to the high-quality 1080p signal of HD video and output to the HDMI port. The fuzziness in the details of SD video is removed to produce a clear picture. Now you can enjoy not only your DVDs but also your VCR tapes and games with much greater clarity and detail. \n\nAnalog to HDMI Up-Conversion\n\nAnalog video input signals (composite, S-Video component) are converted to digital video signals and transmitted to the HDMI output port. Digital video signals are sent to the HDMI output even when multiple HDMI devices such as a video camera or a game console are connected to the AVR-1910. One HDMI cable is all that is needed to connect the AVR-1910 to a TV or monitor. \nTop audio fidelity is assured with the Audyssey MultEQ\nroom acoustic measurement and correction system\n(View larger) \n\nDolby Pro Logic IIz Processing\n\nDolby Pro Logic IIz introduces a new dimension to home theater entertainment through the addition of a pair of front height channels. Compatible with stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 content, Dolby Pro Logic IIz provides enhanced spaciousness, depth and dimension to movies, concert video and video game playback while maintaining the full integrity of the source mix. (Dolby Pro Logic IIz playback require a separate 2-channel amplifier.) \n\nMinimum Signal Path for Clear Audio and Video Signal\n\nThe \"simple and straight\" design concept has been thoroughly implemented in the signal paths to contribute to immaculately clean audio and video playback. Signal paths are as short as possibly to keep signal degradation in the audio and the video circuitry to an absolute minimum. \n\nDirect Mechanical Ground Construction\n\nVibration-resistant construction has been reviewed to thoroughly suppress the adverse influence of vibration on sound quality. The power transformers, a source of vibration, have been securely mounted on the highly rigid bottom chassis. Direct mounting of cast-iron feet to the radiator in near proximity to each other serves to suppress mutual vibration with the power transformers and other sources of vibration. \n\nAudyssey Dynamic Volume for Real-Time Volume Adjustment\n\nAudyssey Dynamic Volume constantly monitors the sound sources and adjusts the volume to the optimum level for the particular source being heard without sacrificing dynamic range. The AVR-1910 is also equipped with Audyssey MultiEQ which measures the acoustic characteristics of the room to obtain the optimum acoustic effects, and Dynamic ED which reproduces the high and low range with the optimum acoustic effect during low volume levels. Dynamic Volume combines these two functions to achieve maximum performance. \n\n\n\n\nCHOOSE A DENON A/V RECEIVER THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU HOME THEATER SYSTEM\nDenon offers several models of A/V home theater receiver systems, from the entry-level AVR-1610 to the advanced AVR-4310CI model.
