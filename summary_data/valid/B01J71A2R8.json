My hair seems to be even drier and frizzier then ever before. I also noticed it gets tangled very easily and is very coarse to touch.

I comb my hair with a wide tooth comb while i leave conditioner on it, then rinse as I comb. NO MORE combing after that or you will disturb the curl pattern and have stringy lifeless curls!

Even after the first wash, my curls have more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry. I have less frizz and my head no longer smells like a salon, but like floral/mint/tea tree extract.

I'm going back to using Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Creme, which smells FABULOUS (to me), but admittedly isn't available on Amazon Prime. As for how this worked, it cleaned well without stripping. My hair dried all FRIZZY, but I can't very well blame that on the No Poo after just one use (frizz happens).",
