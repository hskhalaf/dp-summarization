New one came today with yet another rocket inside the Alpha III box. What the hell is going on here?",

The launch set is easy to assembly and disassemble making for ease of movement to and from a potential launch site. Many motor selections available for the Alpha III chassis allows for low altitude launches in less ideal wind conditions, or more punchy motors for more extreme altitudes to keep the younger rocketeers excited and interested.",

    "title": "Estes Alpha III Rocket Launch Set",
    "description": "Style:Single\n\nThe Estes Alpha III rocket launch set contains a launch controller, launch pad, and rocket kit packet with materials and instructions required to assemble the rocket. It is recommended for children 10 years and older with adult supervision up to age 12. The orange plastic nose cone, body tube, one-piece plastic tail fin unit, and self-stick decals allow assembly of the rocket without painting. Additional supplies required to launch the rocket include model rocket engine, starter, recovery wadding, and glue (sold separately). This rocket launch set provides the equipment required to launch (with required components) the Alpha III rocket repeatedly and is suitable for youth group activities such as with clubs and schools.\n\nSpecificationsSkill levelEasy to Assemble (E2X), simple gluing, no paintingAge recommendation10 years and up, adult supervision under 12Recommended engines1/2A6-2, A8-3 (First Flight), A8-5, B4-4, B6-4, B6-6, C6-5, C6-7Projected maximum altitude1,100' (335m)Rocket weight1.2 oz.

These kits are recommended for children 10 years and older, with adult supervision advised to age 12. Rocket kit assembly encompasses a range of skill levels\u2014from Easy-to-Assemble (E2X), requiring only simple gluing and less than an hour of time\u2014to Level 5, requiring multi-step assembly with measuring, cutting, gluing, and painting tasks. Reusable rocket kit components include a cone, a body tube, and a recovery parachute. A rocket engine, a starter, and recovery wadding are used once. Rocket engines come in a variety of sizes, time delays, and burn durations. A \"first-flight\" engine recommendation is generally made for each rocket kit. A launch pad has a stable base and a vertical rod that provide vertical stability during initial liftoff. A launch controller has a keyed ignition switch to prevent accidental ignition, and a cable provides a safe distance from the rocket during launch. Bulk packs of model rocket kits are available for clubs and schools, and allow groups of children to experience building and launching a rocket.\n\nEstes manufactures model rocket kits, launching equipment, and rocket engines. The company, founded in 1958, is headquartered in Penrose, CO.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n * Alpha III assembly kit\n * Astron II launch controller\n * Astron II launch pad\n * Supply/instruction packet\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nJoin the hundreds of thousands of people who got their start in model rockets with this classic. The Estes Alpha III was the very first rocket in the E2X series. E2X (Easy to Assemble) is a rocket series designed with beginners in mind. With all colored rocket parts and easily applied self-stick decals, you\u2019re ready for liftoff in minutes. The black body tube, bright orange nose cone and one piece fin unit build quickly into one flashy rocket. With nothing more needed than glue, you can be on the flying field in no time at all. Using standard Estes engines, the Alpha III soars to heights over 1,100' (335 m). Whether you\u2019re a first time rocketeer or a long time flyer, this 12.3\" (31.1 cm) Alpha III is a true classic that should be in everyones\u2019 collection. What more could you ask for than a high performance, high flying, classic rocket. Assembly takes one hour or less. An Estes controller and launch system are included. Requires 4 - AA 1.5V batteries for the launch controller - sold separately. Recommended for ages 10 and up with adult supervision for those under 12.",
