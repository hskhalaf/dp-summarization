The mechanism that brings the bread down and lifts it back up malfunctioned after toasting a bagel, so I had to fish the bagel out manually (power off, of course). Technical support at Breville had me turn the toaster upside down and shake it a couple of times, but that did no good. So they offered to replace it. There is nothing so special about this toaster that I felt I had to have another one just like it. So, back it went. Too bad, though, it looked quite nice on the counter.",

Customer service line had no good ideas. Regular setting - only two coils turn on, except at settings so high it would burn the toast to a crisp. Even then, extremely uneven. Bagel setting maybe? Nope, that just switched which two coils worked, opposite of the regular setting. So, a nice piece of heavy metal junk. Into the trash.",

      "text": "My wife says \"this is the best toaster ever\". The bread comes out perfectly toasted every time. And, she finds it very easy to set and use it. However, even more important, she has not burned herself once with it. With her previous toaster, it was very easy to accidentally touch a hot part of the toaster and get a burn. The design of this toaster is such that there is good insulation all around the outside where you would typically touch the toaster. Now, instead of getting a burn when she makes toast, I keep hearing her say \"this is the best toaster ever\"!",

It works like you'd expect and the \"a little more\" feature is just what you need to help get your toast perfect. It's only four stars because the price is a little crazy. It is after all just a toaster that probably cost $15 to make. But if you have a nice kitchen and/or make toast often this is a great toaster.",
