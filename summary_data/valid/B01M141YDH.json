If I sleep with it in all night my teeth are really sore in the morning, thru most of the day. Sleeping is very difficult because of the pressure, so I have to take Benadryl. At this point I've given up using it. I even tried boiling it and re-forming it. It helped a tiny bit but not near enough. I was sad wasting 70 bucks, now that they've upped the price another 20 bucks to 90...well...not worth it",

Didn't want to spend another $500 to get replacement so I ordered this, a little skeptical about the process & quality, but for the price decided to try it. Received my impression kit in mail, took imprint (totally easy), sent it back & received my trays a week later. Trays = good quality & firm ( Med firmness) although the fit wasn't perfect. I emailed them & they promptly sent new impression kit & will re-engineer the trays for me! Outstanding customer service!",
