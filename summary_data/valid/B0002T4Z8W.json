      "text": "The Marcato 0801 works 100% better than the Pampered Chef cookie press. I had no idea that a cookie press could work like this. I should of retired my Pampered Chef years ago. I used the PC Spritz recipe & it works perfect in the Marcato. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the barrel is smaller so not that much dough can be inserted. However, this product works so efficient that replacing the dough is easy. I would recommend the purchase of this product.",

By FAR this was the easiest press to use. I was done in no time. I tried different disks, and all were cute and even. It seems like a study construction, too. I would recommend this to a friend.",

I had no problem assembling it properly but once I get dough in it, the process quickly went downhill. Cookies will not release. I watched several online videos to try to troubleshoot. The main thing I notice is that the range of motion for operation of the lever is much greater in the videos than what I'm getting. My lever moves only minimally. I worked with this for about 90 minutes. This produced just 4 items that resembled a cookie. Very disappointed not to get better results. I had high hopes but will be returning this.",

    "title": "Marcato Atlas Biscuit Maker Press, Made in Italy, Includes 20 Cookie Disc Shapes, Classic Silver",
    "description": "Color:Classic SilverMarcato\u2019s Atlas Classic Biscuit Maker makes baking cookies easier and more fun. Simply select desired shape, fill with dough, and press the handle. Nothing tastes better than fresh-baked authentic homemade cookies! This easy-to-use Biscuit Maker, also called a Cookie Press, easily extrudes firm dough, like cookie dough, into many creative shapes. The Biscuit Maker includes 20 discs for traditional cookie shapes and complete instructions. Making that family sugar cookie recipe, or butter cookies, and other cookie press recipes has never been easier. No more rolling or cutting sticky, messy dough. It\u2019s easier and neater than using cookie cutters. Simply remove the top, insert the disc shape, and fill with dough. Each press of the handle advances the dough with a firm, gentle pressure for consistent looking cookies. Disassembles for easy cleaning. Made from anodised aluminum, steel, and ABS. Hand wash in warm, soapy water. Includes a 10-year manufacturer's warranty.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIn Europe they call cookies \"biscuits,\" and you can too if you want to lull yourself into thinking you're eating something healthier than sugar cookies. With this Italian biscuit maker, it's easy to get the same size and shape of cookie every time. Just put the dough in the cylinder, choose small or large cookies, attach one of the 20 die-plates, and press the lever; the precise amount of dough is automatically pumped out onto your cookie sheet. Your cookies will look store-bought perfect, but taste oh-so-much-better because you baked them yourself. The maker and die-plates should be hand washed, and they come with a three-year warranty. --Doree Armstrong",
