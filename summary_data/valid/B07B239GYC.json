      "text": "I first bought the Lifewit Cotton Canvas storage bags with the metal frame. I love it. Everyone else that bought the bags with metal frames must have loved them too. Because when I went buy more they were out of stock. They have been out of stock for about a year now. So I bought these. I do not love them. They are a duffel bag with a zipper. They do not have the metal frame. It makes moving them from one place to another miserable if you want your items inside to stay neatly folded. PLEASE BRING BACK THE SQUARE LIFEWIT COTTON CANVAS STORAGE BAGS WITH THE METAL FRAME!!! I will buy them and throw these away!",

      "text": "Totally impressed, just what I was looking for to store a winter weight and overstuffed California king sized comforter until needed again, even has some room to spare. Allows air circulation to help prohibit mold/mildew, very important for expensive fabrics like flax linen or hemp linen fabrics while protecting the contents from dust and bugs. Like most bags with zippers be careful how you carry them, especially if they have something heavy like a comforter or you could pull the zipper apart, the 3 sided zipper on this bag appears to be well sewn and durable. Just handle this bag with care and it should last a lifetime.",

I'm removing one star because while the zippers aren't flimsy, they don't feel super durable either. If you watch it and make sure to line up the zipper before using it, I'm sure they'll last a long time but if you don't... Also the description sort of hides that one of the bags is a big one but the other is a smaller bag. Still works great for me and good value, but they could be more up front about that.",

I only ended up using one they were so large so that's a plus, but this is definitely better for storing blankets or off-season clothing.",
