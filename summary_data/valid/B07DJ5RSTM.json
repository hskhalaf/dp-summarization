I decide to try a more expensive one for my patio, this camera has great picture as well, and the better thing I like is you can control this camera to 4 different direction by your cell phone! This is great! I love it, I will buy more camera of foscam if I need in the future , I can control these two cameras by using the same app! Would like to recommend to my friends .",

It's a single IR light - see photo - that produces a single beam of light right only in the center of the image (it's even worse at about 8-15 ft). The old version of this camera filled the entire visible frame with light clearly illuminating both of our cars. It's unbelievable that they would design and produce a product with such an oddball flaw. It's a total dealbreaker so despite the beautiful daytime picture and MUCH improved WiFi, it's being returned.",

Unfortunately this last one could not be recognized by the system and even after email assistance by Foscam, I had to return it. While my other cameras work well, they may have to be reinstalled after a power failure or an internet outage. It would be graet if someone at Foscam thought to install a backup battery in the cameras so they keep in memory all the settings after a power failure or an internet outage. It is a pain having to reset all the information on the cameras.",

I had no issues setting it up via ethernet connected directly to my router, but I could not set it up wirelessly, rendering it useless. Returning.",

Video is worst than 1 frame a second in appears (even though it says 15-30 frames a second in the server). Audio is clean - so it is something with its protocol support.

It does require a 2.4 GHz wireless network connection but if your router has band steering then it's a non-issue. If not, just spin up a guest network or other SSID to use for IoT devices and this cam will be online in no time. It has a very fair picture quality and offers enough controls to make it a bargain for the price.",

It IS apparently well built and if you are a Windows user this may be fine, but absolutely fails when trying to use otherwise.",

The update regularly fails and randomly resets the clock. I keep my cameras up to date with the latest firmware.",
