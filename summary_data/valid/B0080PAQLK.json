While installation wasn't trivial (I had to deal with an electrical short in house wiring & correcting the mounting of the ceiling electrical box) once it was all in, it looked great & performed perfectly. I changed the fluorescent bulbs for small diameter LED bulbs that fit the glass shades because I hate CFLs now, and that is the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.",

I just wish there was the tiniest bit more room for slightly larger bulbs, but after using it for about 8 months it gives off plenty of light (unlike anything smaller.)",

      "text": "Looks great, works well so far. Worst fan install of my life! I just installed cheap home depot fans in each kids bedroom last week, they took maybe 2 hours each. This one took 6! The housing do not fit together well, and the is barely enough room for wiring, so each piece it a fight. Wasted a good hour trying to install it as flush mount with the remote pack before I realized there isn't enough clearance by about 2mm. Had to use the down-rod which I had NOT planned on. The designers must never have installed on or they would make the few changes needed to make this a great fan.",

I wish the price didn't jump so much! Got the first 2 for 166 and 168, then I jumped when it went down to 139. So watch the price!",

I bought a replacement and found that the color is more yellow than the other three. I hear that this is common with bulbs but the effect was amplified with these types of bulbs.",

With its chrome finish, chrome with frosted glass light fixture, and five reversible high-gloss black and white blades, this fan offers sleek, modern style.\n\nIdeal for rooms up to 144 square feet (12 by 12 feet), this fan features a powerful 153-by-17-millimeter silicon steel motor with triple capacitor and is remote control adaptable. Three fan speeds (high/medium/low) and a reversible switch help keep you comfortable. In warm weather, you can run the fan counterclockwise to stay cooler. In cool weather, run it clockwise to recirculate warm air from the ceiling, eliminating cold spots and drafts. \n\nThe fan provides airflow of up to 4,733 cubic feet per minute (cfm). It is rated to operate at 63 watts at high speed (without the lights), which gives it an airflow efficiency rating of 75 cfm per watt. (As a comparison, 49- to 60-inch ceiling fans have airflow efficiencies ranging from approximately 51 to 176 cfm per watt at high speed.) \n\nThis Westinghouse ceiling fan is backed by a lifetime motor warranty and a two-year warranty on all other parts.
