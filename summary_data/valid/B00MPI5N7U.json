When I did a live chat with ASUS, they gave me one option, which was to send it in for service. 5-7 day turnaround time at best. That means having to buy another router to stay connected while the router that failed is out of commission. When I suggested they simply replace the item and I would send this one back to them, they refused. The idea that anyone in business can afford to have no connectivity for such a duration is laughable. Either way, I have to buy another router, so this time I am not buying ASUS.

Range and speed is AMAZING. Certainly handles the 20+ devices we have running on it. Range is great- it sits in our basement and I no longer have any problem getting coverage in a second-floor corner bedroom. It's a good router, just not as great for parental controls as I'd hoped. Might be user ignorance, but certainly it isn't a plug-n-play for parental controls",

There is almost a direct line of sight to the router via the doorway. If this is too far away for 5ghz, it makes it pretty useless to use with our home. I'm very disappointed and am thinking of reverting back to my older AC68 router. In my opinion it has been a waste of $240 so far.",

The strength of the signal and the throughput are excellent when the connections are alive. The periodic connection loses happen on both bands simultaneously.

Rebooting the router brings everything back to life for awhile however this is unacceptable for a product like this (regardless of price range).",

During the actual Tradeshow the unit pretty much became a paperweight due to all the interference in the hall (pretty standard) but I was having issues getting throughput when I was situated right next to the router.
