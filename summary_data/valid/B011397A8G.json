Would have rated higher if it wasn't for the loud crunching sound. (98 lb person rolled over and you could hear the movement within the spring)",

      "text": "What a terrible mattress. I have another king mattress that was also a \"bed-in-a-box\" and it was way better quality than this mess. I unrolled it and let it inflate for atleast 8 hours(instructions say only 2-3 hours needed) because after a few hours it still did not look inflated. My boyfriend and I gave it a whirl and were highly disappointed. We each tossed and turned all night and the bed felt just like an box spring. I would save yourself the money and try another type of \"bed-in-a-box\"",

When he lays completely straight - his legs hang off the end. So, I\u2019ll need to buy a different mattress, soon. But I\u2019ll likely skip the big box stores when I do and order another from this company.

He sleeps soundly on his mattress but I know just how flimsy this is and it will not last.",

I emailed customer service and they instructed me to return through Amazon, which is fine, but I just went with them because, well, triplets. So 2 stars because I was too lazy to return them, but seriously they are too small and thin to think anyone over 50 pounds would be comfortable.",

I would never buy this mattress for myself for daily use, I can imagine it would break down quickly and the springs would hurt...like expected from a spring mattress. The price was great and I would recommend this for a guest or child's bedroom (with a mattress pad or topper).",

For that it works perfectly. This is the cheapest full size mattress I could find. As a daily use primary mattress, this is a tough choice - literally and figuratively.",

As uncomfortable as this mattress is, I cannot beleive you are able to buy a mattress this cheap. This is the cheapest mattress out there, so temper your expectations and if you decided to go this route buy a comforter. 3 stars, not for comfort but that low low price.",
