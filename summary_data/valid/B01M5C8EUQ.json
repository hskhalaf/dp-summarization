The White ones i purchased for \u00a3130 are \u00a330 cheaper than everyone else selling black ones for \u00a3160.",

Ears dont get sweaty after prolonged use which is nice, cushion material feels really breathable. I love the extra sound control between games and chat... I can easily adjust it at the turn of the dial on my desktop when I am playing with friends. Nothing bad to say about these headphones. A million times better than Beats in my opinion !",

I\u2019ve still not worked it out and the manual is not correct. There are forums around this but I wouldn\u2019t let this put you off. They charge fine but I think you have to have them ON to charge them which is odd. Certainly the best wireless headset out there for this price range.",

Battery is very nice and the volume wheels on the back are very handy. Only minor concern is you might accidently rock these to max or to mute without realising. Finally, the mic. It is fine for online chats but not good enough for semi professional producers. I'd suggest an external mic for those that are uncertain about the mic. Overall, sensational headset, the app is easy to use and the volume mixer is actually a pleasant suprise. You can adjust everything to suit your tastes. Would recommend.",

You get 2 meters of cable to tangle yourself in and a handy dial to change voice/system sound levels on the fly.

One other issue is that while the headset is lightweight and comfy, as someone with small ears/head, it does slip about when I look down or turn my head. Had that issue before though, so not a huge problem.",

Not only it is a bit unwieldy (as in very easy to accidentally turn it no matter what you do), it also breaks really easily (in my case, 2 months). At this price, better buy something else.",

The one thing I think they could improve is the mic, I find it to be a bit worse than my previous headset (hyper x cloud 2),though I did improve the steel series mic via taking the foam piece off the hyper x and placing it on the mic of the steel series headset. Dispite this, I highly recommend this head set.",
