      "text": "I purchased this in a fit of blind rage from trying to use my previous peeler and didn't really read the description or any reviews. I gotta say, this is the best peeler I have ever used and arguably my favorite kitchen tool. I bought it as a peeler, but I use the Julienne side much more frequently. It really produces excellent results and I will be buying more of these as gifts in the coming year. When I bought this it did not come with the cleaning brush, which is kind of a bummer, but I am glad they offer that now because it could be very useful to clean between the little teeth without slashing open a finger.",

Love it. Another thing you can do is to basically shred and curl Parmesan cheese. Works great on that. I told my wife I am buying another to replace the 4 or 5 other lousy peelers in our motorhome. Buy one of these!",

Shreds potatoes into little strips for home fries or crispy toppings. It juliennes! So many functions in one small tool. I wash it with a nylon bristle brush and it cleans up well every time, with no gross food residue discovered later in crevices. I'm a fan of the built in hook, which helps in our small kitchen where we often store utensils hanging.",
