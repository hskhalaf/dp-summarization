      "text": "The graphics are beautiful but I'm disappointed in that it doesn't have a open world, you pretty much go from one area to another either by fast travel or by running, so you will pretty much be fighting at all times with little break in between. Also there is not enough customizing available like in Skyrim as an example. The killing is great and very realistic but can get a little monotonous at times. All in all it's a good game but wait for the price to drop. Also make sure your PC has the horsepower to handle it so you can get those beautiful graphics to show up.",

I spent almost 100 hours with a complete play-through (I'm a little obsessive with all the side-quests). The only negative is that there is very little incentive to play again.",
