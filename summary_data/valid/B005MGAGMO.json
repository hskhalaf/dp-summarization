In addition to looking beautiful as the candle slowly burns beneath the tea, illuminating the tea within the glass teapot like a lamp, the warmer keeps the tea very hot indeed. I think it could even get the water to steeping temperature, although I have only used it to keep hot tea hot. It would make an elegant addition to any tearoom or dining room.",
