They have that \"wide magical\" AKG sound signature that NO other company at this point offers for BT, were pretty comfortable, look nice, and were easy to use too. BT sounded great, but of course using the wired option meant slightly more clarity & volume. Note: These are over-ear headphones, NOT on-ear. Very highly recommended!!",

I read somewhere that you can bend the headband but I'll pass on that. There is no way to forward tracks on the headset. The volume has an obvious limit with my ipod. It's not to bad it's still not a deal breaker. If you guys want a superior sounding headphones that are BT these are it. Don't waste your money on Beats by dre.",

These sound great and look great (which are respectively most important), I just wish they had controls for changing tracks and activating digital assistants. The power off button is much easier to push than the pause/play button (resulting in accidentally turning it off). Doesn't get too loud, bass is a little warm, which most people prefer these days. Clear stereo highs. It has its own volume separate from the device you're synced with which is weird.",

The K545 is essentially the K845 without bluetooth. Also slightly louder. After trying on the wire free setup, I was sold. The sound is perfectly balanced.
