I even tried this on another person, with the same, terrible results. I read the instructions and followed them closely. This product is not worth the money.",

(Probably because the need usually arises in the dead of the night.) I can also set it up to give me much needed reminders about when to administer the next doses of medicine. This will does everything that I am really bad at doing. I'm thrilled! The app is easy to set up and easy to use, plus the ear temperature is easier to catch than swiping the forehead.",

One bonus point for the friendly industrial design and simple display, particularly compared to a lot of \"grey thermometers\" with ambitious buttons in the market.",
