They are extremely durable to the harsh conditions of the Hudson River, plus the color has not faded. My oldest fenders are around 4 or 5 years old and they still look like new. The saltwater hasn't hurt these fenders, nor has the constant slamming around (the river is choppy and these bumpers take a real beating). These fenders are die hard and take a beating. 4+ years in the sun and they still haven't faded.",

He said that the fender was of excellent quality and just the right size for his boat. Great protection against the docks where he keeps his boat. In fact, hubby is hinting that he would like another one. It does come in different colors, but he likes the traditional white. So glad I was able to purchase a quality product for my husband's favorite hobby.",
