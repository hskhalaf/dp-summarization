      "text": "This camera is excellent. It is the 3rd digital I've owned and I've enjoyed it very much. It's compact and full of features. You MUST, however, use super alkeline batteries because it eats the normal ones up fast. The batteries made for digital cameras do much better and are worth the price. The camera has a video feature that outshines any other camera I've seen on the market. I would highly recommend this product as a good value for little money you pay for it",

I have only replaced the batteries one time, so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for. small lightweight, many features. choice of 6 meg, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 meg photos at fingertips. What I really decided on this camera for was the MACRO capability as I take photos of very small coins, and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that. It preforms magnificantly. My previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle. I love the Samsung digimax S600.",

      "title": "The Battery Killer",
      "text": "I bought Samsung Digimax S600 6.0 MP, the battery consumption is tooooo much. To take about 50 pictures I had to change the Duracell batteries twice. With rechargable cells (ofcourse the energizer ones meant for digital camera) the max you can take is 20-25 pictures, So if you plan to use this Camera for any important occasion be prepared to carry atleast 3 sets of batteries. It is really frustrating when the battery goes off. The zoom is also not good, better to pay additional 50$ to get a sony or a canon with 4 MP and 5X optical zoom.",

      "text": "UPDATED: This camera is a royal pain. After using it for awhile, I wish I could change to 1 star. I believe there is a flaw in the battery power sensor; it will shut down due to low battery, but if you test the battery later it will show 80% charged. Another big issue: usually each time I use it, the camera will just shut off while i'm about to snap a picture (with the lens still extended). This isn't auto-shutoff, since it does it as i'm actively zooming and setting up the shot. I have to remove the batteries, wait a minute, put them back in and hold the power button down to get it to come back on.",

For example, I still don't know how to use the flash as a fill flash, or even if that is possible. Finally, the disk-loaded program that loads the photos to my computer has not yet worked.

    "description": "Color:BlackUse the Digimax S600 to produce detailed images for printing up to poster size. The high resolution S600 is equipped with a true-color filter 6 Megapixel CCD. The 2.4 inch LCD lets you take a wider, clearer image with the 3x optical, 5x digital zoom with special effect functions. When it is set to Auto Mode, the Digimax S600 automatically adjusts the shooting distance and focus from between 5cm to infinity, to get better pictures easier. The family-friendly mode dial, Night, Portrait and Children modes, makes it easier to get great shots of the family by giving in stand access to the appropriate mode for each individual situation. Children mode, with its open aperture and fast shutter speeds, lets you capture children in fast moving action shots. When using Portrait mode you get more pleasing people pictures with improved red eye reduction. Night mode automatically uses the slow synchronization function to help you get clearer and brighter pictures at night. The powerful video capability of the Digimax S600 delivers a quality close to a camcorder.
