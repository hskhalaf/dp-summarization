First, the knife slot springs closed at the top so you have to get your fingernail in to pry it open to get the knife in - annoying. Second, the base does not lock at a right angle so if you are not VERY careful, your cut will not be straight. Third, we bought this because we bought a bread maker. I am sure most bread machines are a standard size.. anyway, the loaf does not fit smoothly in the slot. You have to squish it a bit to get it in. So.. I gave 3 stars because the price was right.",

It's not that the bread knife is dull (the sharpest bread knife sold on Amazon) as attested when I cut my index finger with it and ended up in ER for stitches. It helps with the task of cutting bread machine loaves but I need to figure out how to keep it from sliding allover the counter when slicing bread that's why the 3 star rating.",
