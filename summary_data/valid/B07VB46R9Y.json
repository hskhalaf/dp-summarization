When speaking to someone on my mobile their voice was clear and they could hear me with no problems. Works perfectly while exercising, the earbuds stay in your ears very well. Also very important for me is the design, they look very smart and they do not stick out much. Very pleased with my purchase.",

      "text": "Excellent sound quality with clear yet full bass that gives them a little warmth overall, however vocals are still detailed and the treble is precise but never sharp. I was not expecting this level of sound quality, combined with stable Bluetooth connectivity and outstanding battery life for under \u00a3100. Very well built with a great case and tips, easy to pair and the 10hr battery life quoted is very realistic, only slightly lower when using a high quality codec like AptX. The case has a USB-C charging port and gives them an extra 6 charges! These are perfect for out and about use, daily commuting or exercise due to their IPX7 rating. Overall I am extremely happy with these.",

I wanted something similar but with IPX rating for water-resistance and USB-C charging. These earbuds are the ones I was recommended by many professional reviewers. All I'm going to say is that they punch above their weight, the pricing of these buds is very competitive against something like the Sennheiser Momentum earbuds. Volume can go really high and the battery life claims are high, but that will have to be tested as its based on SBC at 50% volume and not aptX or AAC. Solid first impressions on these buds so far, very impressed.",

Some people say that there is no bass but I suspect they haven\u2019t seated them properly into their ears. You have to get a good seal otherwise the bass disappears. When correctly seated there is plenty of bass. And very good isolation from ambient noise. Have tested these using What Hi-Fi\u2019s playlist to test headphones and was very impressed with the results. There is an app that goes with them but as yet, it doesn\u2019t work.

They were initially very easy to pair and bluetooth hasn't dropped out, instantly connecting when you take them out the case. I have had some connection issues and had to re-pair after a day or two of not using them, which may just be something to do with my devices. Still, not willing to give them anything less than 5* as it's such a fantastic, well-designed package, and I don't believe I can find anything better at this price point.",

I have a pair of over ear, noise cancelling Sony WH-H900N which I usually use at work however I've found myself just keeping the tevi's in which I never expected. Very happy with my purchase.",
