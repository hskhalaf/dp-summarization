Assembling it was SO much simpler than other goals, and we had it unboxed and assembled and in use in under 5 minutes. It also folds easily enough that my 12-year-old can do it, and the enclosed bag is perfect for porting it down to a friend's house when the game moves, and also keeps it from getting ruined in the elements like a larger goal would have. Durability appears to be on par for cost, but I'll update if we find any unforeseen issues.",
