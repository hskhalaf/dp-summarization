      "text": "Used this within a week of receiving! We are still trying to learn how to utilize it best but the design is perfect for slow and coal flavor infusing cooking. Extremely happy with this purchase. Additionally, I ended up ditching the bottom metal rack to hold coal above the pan (for ash collecting purpose). Having that rack made the coal too close to my food; I was afraid of burning my food. So i laid the burning coal directly on the metal bottom of the grill and it was fine. No burnt food and the metal bottom held out against the coal well.",

It needs to be about an inch deeper for it to fully work. Because it isn't deep enough, the food burns easily since it's too close to the charcoal. Also, you really can't grill that much food on it, barely enough for two people. The grill needs to be re-designed to adequately serve its purpose.",

I've used it for steaks, burgers, hotdogs, chicken, and vegetables so far. All have come out amazing so far. With the lid off, it creates a delicious dark brown sear on meat (use a full chimney of charcoal for searing). With the lid on, it is a piece of cake to go low and slow by closing the vents down. I can fit three large ribeye steaks on at the same time or about 8 quarter lb. burgers without being too cramped. Very easy to fully clean as well. Highly recommended!",

The handles do get quite warm.....not enough to burn your hand but it is very notable when you grab them for the first time. Only improvement would be for the handles to be made of another material instead of plastic that gets hot.",
