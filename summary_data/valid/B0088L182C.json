But the laptop arrived \u201ctempered\u201d and it looked like somebody either opened it up or damaged the bottom of the laptop... I was still gonna be okay with it at some point but the laptop didnt turn on and got stuck at the Vizio logo. I had to return it and lost time and effort during the process. They need to check and be sure before selling something online..especially when its used.!",

This alone is so bad it takes my review down from 5 to 2 stars. I'll update this review if anything changes",

As I understand these ssd hard drives fail often and suddenly. So do back up your computer. Not thrilled with Windows 8 which is not Vizio's fault. The ssd hard drive makes it very fast. I use an external 3.0 with a Seagate Momentus hard drive. This too is very fast. This is such an attractive computer and very light. The service from Vizio was excellent and fast, they also sent out a box prepaid for the return. Would definitely buy a Vizio again.",

Everything works great out of the box. Boots very quickly and is a pleasure to look at. MS Signature really helps because no need to install and pay for an additional antivirus. Love the purchase.",

Positives: -extremely lightweight, can be carried anywhere with ease -HD display, everthing looks quite nice -low profile keyboard, makes typing effortless -powerful ultrabook for being at lower end of line Negatives: -first and foremost; the trackpad, it sticks it lags and sometimes it freezes, not nearly as smooth as a Mac, kind of gritty mking it difficult to use fingers if even mildy moist (sweat) -no backlit keys, difficult to see what you are typing in the dark, even moreso because of the low profile keys All in all I am satisfied with this laptop, the negatives are minimal and one can deal.

The number one reason that I went with Vizio over HP, Dell, etc was because of the great, high quality screen that the Vizio has. That being said, after only having the PC for several months, I've noticed that a pixel towards the middle of the screen has gone out. Now I'm out side of Amazon's return window and I need to contact Vizio to replace the screen because one pixel has died. What a waste of my time and $!!!!",
