I\u2019m thankful I went back in to her room to feed her about 45 minutes after I laid her down because her leg was still through the bars of the crib but this time ABOVE the mesh bumper. Her body was contorted from trying to get out so that she was essentially sleeping with all of her weight on her neck. It was terrifying. I don\u2019t care how many times I have to get up for her leg getting through the bars again. Needless to say I took it down immediately with trembling hands. Do not buy this product. Your baby will outgrow this stage soon enough.",

When I was installing it, I was struck that the mesh was thicker and softer than I anticipated and the overlap between the two panels at each end created an even thicker area. So I Googled the product and found that the AAP recommends against all bumpers and liners, including mesh ones like this. The number of deaths is small, but serious injuries from catching a limb between slats is rarer still. There's no need for a product like this, so I will return it,even though it was quite well made.",

Truly worth the purchase, forgo the cutesy quilted things that come with some crib sets, this is by far the safer product and they don't care about cutesy, at this stage they can't see it anyway. :-)",

At 6 months old, though, our baby started getting her legs stuck through the slats, which made her quite unhappy and nap time pretty rough. Enter the Breathable Mesh Crib Liner. This crib liner is great! The back of our crib is solid, so I didn't need a liner on that part. I didn't know until I received it that it comes in two parts. I simply stored one part and used the other on the crib and it fits perfectly. Easy to install. Highly recommend!",
