They are big enough to be fun but also not too big that my son can't grasp them and pick them up at his age. But the product is not as described.

They are very cute and so far, none of them have gotten water inside. So i make sure to take them out of the bath as soon as we are done and set them somewhere to dry.",

I haven't tried them in the tub yet, but I think they will be a fun toy that doesn't have the mold issue that some bath toys do! I also spray my son's bath toys with vinegar after each bath! Vinegar helps to eliminate any potential mold and is a safe disinfectant!",
