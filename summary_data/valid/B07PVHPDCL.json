In total 10/10 I use the device every for music around the house or in the shower as its waterproof, its a bit chunky but honestly I dont have any problem the sound quality is just amazing i was not expecting to love something so much for 30 bucks i figured it was going to be cheep stuff but as mentioned its amazing",

The lights stay on but does not charge my phone. I even went out and bought two new iPhone cables. I called the company to ask for help. After 48 minutes on hold I finally was told the unit was in fact not working; after that he transferred me to someone who really did nothing to accommodate the situation. To be clear the speaker works just not the power bank charging unit. The customer service from the company was painful.",
