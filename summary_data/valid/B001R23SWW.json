It came with a live center and 2 tool rests. Being able to speed it up or slow down with just turning a knob is a big improvement for me. All of my 3/4 x 16tpi accessories went right on as expected. It's really, really quiet. I'm glad I bought it. I've already made most of my money back in sales. Not sure of doing items that might be high torque etc, but this is excellent for fine for small turning projects.",

My main issue with this lathe is the tailstock tightening knob. It's a horrible design and is very finicky. When the set screws were too loose, the knob would unscrew every time I tried to tighten my pen blank. If I did it too tight the screws would grind against the knob and strip it out. Maybe I just had a flawed product but I feel the design is horrible and I would not buy this product again.",

In theory, the hand wheel is turned to drive the live center into the workpiece. In actual use, a mallet is needed. The unit seems underpowered for 1/3 HP, requiring the slightest cutting force. I\u2019ll use this for very small turnings, after reworking the handscrew mechanism, but am restoring a full size Craftsman lathe. This was cheap, but turned out to be false economy.

Yes, you can buy an adapter or another Madrel (which I had to do) but the fact that they are recommended purchases, and that in the description of this product it does not tell you this information, is really poor in my opinion.

When forced tight it caused the mandrel saver to angle down marring the mandrel and internal damage to the mandrel saver as it siezed on the mandrel several times.I no longer try to really tighten the system more than hand pressure tight, so the product slows down. overall for my first lathe, It can do what I hoped for making pens.

I was surprised by the quality of construction and how well everything lined up. I bought it for small projects like pens or small bowls and it works great. If you stay within the limits of the machine it works fine but would be under powered for large projects where you need to remove large amounts of wood. I am very happy and would buy again.",

Including bolting a bar onto it to stop it. What a nightmare. Did not even get to craft a single piece on it. Piece of junk. Also the design of the tightening handle is useless if you are working with hard woods. You better have super strength to be able to turn that knob. There is nothing to grip. Don't waste your money. Buy a craftsman.",

      "text": "This is a well built machine with very few plastic parts. It's heavy for it's size and ideal for turning small pieces. The variable speed feature is very nice and has a good speed range. It is short on power and tends to stall rather easily at low speed but holds it's own when you get a good balance and can crank up the speed. It comes with a good manual and all the tools and attachments you need except a chuck.If your looking for a hobby lathe to turn small pieces I doubt you can find a better machine for the price. Free shipping was a real bonus too.",

It is small, but has more than enough power to handle the task. With speed changes by turning a knob rather than moving a belt around, the process goes much more smoothly also.To make it a \"dream machine\", change the Tapers from MT1 to MT2, simply because there are penmaking goodies for MT2. A great lathe for money.",

It is a nice lathe for the size, and the variable speed works well, but if your doing anything other than small turning like pens, then go bigger. I put cedar log, about 3.5 inches in diameter, on it, and it struggle a little until I got it into round. After that, it worked fine. I will be upgrading soon. However, I will keep it the shop for the smaller things. I also purchased a Nova G3 chuck, and it makes the lathe that much better.",
