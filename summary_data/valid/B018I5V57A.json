My son loves the way the shoes fit, they offer ample room for his wide feet which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. These shoes are very poorly made after less than two months of wear there are holes in the front. This is the second pair that this has happened to so it's not a fluke. This company needs to work on putting quality back into their products. So disappointed.",

And they are honestly washable. Just... a bit hard to find. For $40, you'd think shoes wouldn't look so bad after a few hours of wear.",
