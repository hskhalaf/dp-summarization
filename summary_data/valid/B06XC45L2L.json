Not bad if you are using pillows to lean back on or if you are using them between legs but to sleep on I always wake up with a sore neck in the morning.

You have to fluff them up and soon thereafter they almost resume their original flat shape. With a foam pillow thats really supportive to the head and neck, and arrives in the same shape they stay in all night says a lot. Avoid these pillows and thats easy now as they are listed as not available anymore! Hmmmm",
