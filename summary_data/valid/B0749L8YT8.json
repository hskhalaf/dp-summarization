I would recommend watching a few videos on YouTube on leveling and the proper height to hang your guitars to aesthetically add to your room before you slap it on the wall because once the hanger is mounted, it will be a chore to tear it out of the wall and rehang. So do it on a good day where you feel ambitious and focused.",
