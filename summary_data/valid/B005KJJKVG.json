They are much more comfortable (to me), than the QC 15s and the sound quality seems better as well. I know they don't technically \"noise cancel\" but they are quite well padded and with music at a low volume, they do a good job of cutting down on background (annoying coworker) noise, plus - there are no batteries to have to recharge. The microphone seems better than the QC15 one I had purchased, but I haven't done extensive testing with it yet.",

Build is okay. The padding is my favorite. Memory foam cushion and easy on the ears.",

They are very comfortable on the ear and the remote for the iPhone makes them even more comfortable to control your music. The possibility to remove the cable from the headphones is a great improvement from the previous version since it allows you to replace the cable in case it breaks. I've been using these headphones for about 9 months now and I'm very happy with them. I highly recommend this product to anybody looking for amazing sound quality and comfortable headphones.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nBOSE\u00ae OE2I AUDIO HEADPHONES - BLACK \n * Advanced acoustic design brings out the depth and clarity of your music\n * Inline remote for control of iPhone\u00ae/iPod\u00ae\n * Inline microphone for hands-free calling \n * Lighter, updated design features slim headband and memory foam ear cushions that reduce pressure points for hours of comfortable listening\n * Fold-flat, collapsible design allows easy storage in carrying case \n\nBose OE2i headphones combine lifelike audio with lightweight comfort. They deliver the Bose sound you expect, but they are even smaller and lighter than our original on-ear headphones. You'll hear the full range of your favorite music, from deep lows to clear highs. The sleeker, slimmer design looks great too. And OE2i headphones feature an inline microphone for iPhone calling and an inline remote that controls your Apple\u00ae product.\n\nBIG PERFORMANCE, SMALL SIZE\nOE2i headphones are lightweight and comfortable for hours of on-the-go calls and music listening. OE2i headphones feature an enhanced TriPort\u00ae acoustic headphone structure, so you can experience big audio performance from these small earcups. TriPort technology delivers even the deep, low notes with clarity, letting you enjoy the full range of your music, movies or games.\n\nThe compact design offers a smaller, lighter and slimmer profile than our original on-ear headphones. Memory foam ear cushions conform to the shape of your ears, and the contoured headband sits evenly, without pressure points, on your head. They're so comfortable, you may forget you have them on - until someone tells you how sleek they look.\n\nThe detachable cable connects directly to one earcup, so there's less tangling than conventional Y-cables. And the headphones fold flat for storage in the protective carrying case.\n\nIN TUNE AND IN TOUCH\nOE2i headphones are designed specifically for use with select Apple products. You can take calls on your iPhone and switch between calls and music with one-touch ease. The integrated inline remote, located on the back of the microphone, lets you control your iPod, iPhone and other Apple devices. Adjust volume, play/pause tracks, skip tracks forward/backward, fast forward/rewind and change playlists - all while enjoying your music with Bose sound.\n\nOE2i headphones, designed for use with select Apple\u00ae devices, let you switch between calls and music with one-touch ease.
