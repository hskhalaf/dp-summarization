Our hair is curly and maybe that is why it did not work for us. I thought it would moisturize our hair and leave it soft like previous reviewers had claimed but made it dull, lifeless and brittle looking. We will not be using this again.",

Also that scent was slightly different. My hair does feel a little softer with the one I purchased on amazon. But the one I got at Sephora I feel like it made my hair softer and my hair is less frizzy. Did anyone else received theirs with to seals?",
