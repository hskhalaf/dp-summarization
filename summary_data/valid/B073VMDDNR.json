Very sturdy and I believe easier to use then my larger hammer. My husband even used it with his big hands and said he liked it. I can\u2019t state enough how sturdy and well made this little hammer is. I will put it next to our Apple TV remote so you can see the actual size. Don\u2019t hesitate to purchase just because of its size.",

He\u2019s just jealous he doesn\u2019t have one. The only thing I might change about this hammer is to increase the surface area of the head.",
