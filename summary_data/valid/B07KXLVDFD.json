The first time i needed it to fix a tire on the road it froze on 0.00 and never pumped any air. Of course, it\u2019s two weeks after the return deadline. WARNING! Because of this item i canceled my prime and will not purchase anything from amazon unless i get my $$$ back",

The screen showing the information on the device was very small and not very bright, though the product was completely charged. Also difficult to read without a magnifying glass. 3. It was not easy to use because of the long time it took to put just 2 lbs. of pressure into a tire. Had to hold in in place for almost 5 minutes. At one point it actually started to remove air from the tire instead of increasing it. That, however, could have been the users fault. Overall, very disappointing, to say the least",

I used the cigarette lighter adapter as a power source and had all 4 of my tires filled back up to specs (I used another tire pressure gauge I had just to be sure) within 15 minutes.
