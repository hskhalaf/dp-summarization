Because of its slim design I forget I\u2019m even wearing it! I was worried about the sheath not being strong enough to hold the blade secure but it works great. While most of the sheath is plastic there are two metal pins that lock the blade tightly in place. They also cause it to make a really satisfying sound when you draw and sheath it. It\u2019s a EDC for me and now several of my friends I\u2019ve recommended it to. Would definitely buy again!",

So I thought about tek lock, so I bought a couple of them here as well thinking the holes would align, and I was wrong, but luckily the sheath has a space big enough to improvise. So its semi tek lok compatible, and I have a random strap so I can strap it to my ankle as well.",

      "text": "Gerber makes great knives, I've carried them for a long time. This knife is no exception; very sturdy and small so it's easy to carry. The only problem I have with it is the rubber grip on the handle. If you carry this knife on your belt, in the small of your back, every day; the rubber is bound to come off. After only a few days of carrying this knife the rubber was torn up and peeling off. I carry it without the rubber on the handle now and it still gets the job done.",

Only downside, which is kind of a big one, screws on the sheath came off within a few months. Also, the rubber gripping on the handle started peeling quickly. Wore the knife daily for work, but was not handling it enough for it to fall apart like that. If Gerber fixes that, it'd be a great product.",

After a week the rubber coated grip already ripping/wearing off from getting in and out of the car sitting down etc. Edge needed a lot of work on ye olde whetstone. Sheath a bit clunky to put on your belt but easy to get knife in and out. I like the way the knife feels I your hand. Wish there were better options out there.",

I bought several Bear Grylls addition knives and they came nice and sharp. Is it a big deal? Maybe not but how hard is it for them to put a nice edge on a knife?",

The modular sheath system can be worn horizontally on the belt or vertically on a belt like a traditional fixed blade knife.

The compact skeletal fixed blade is sized for a subtle presence, and can be worn without making a profile against your outer clothing. The rubber over-mold handle features a diamond texture, allowing for a superior grip in critical situations. Know your local laws before you decide how to carry. The Ghostrike Series Fixed Blade knife is proudly made in Portland, OR. Gerber limited lifetime warranty.",
