I used it with the native iPhone video app and with a different video recording app. I even tried using the cable meant for cameras (not phone) just in case. I could discern no difference in either the amplification/pickup quality of my voice nor reduction in ambient noise. If I listened really carefully maybe there was very slightly less echo? But certainly not enough to make it worth the money. I returned it and am back on the hunt.",

If they made an amplified version of this mic I would try it. The amplified Comica mic I got is all light weight plastic and seem flimsy. This mic has a metal body and seems pretty solid. Sound quality is not much different than the plastic mic though. Decent, not great. Usable though. So for not much $$ you can get a pretty big step up over the built in camera mic.",

Has a bit of white noise I thought, but if you have a gain control I bet you could get some crisp sound. I'm not disappointed because like I said, it was around $50 which IMO is a cheap mic so it's worth the purchase.",

Overall the included case, 2 windscreens, cold shoe shock mount, different cables for different devices such as your smartphone and the great sound, although a bit treble strong which can easily be fixed with editing, will amaze you at the price point although i did feel it was too close to the Rode price and could be dropped just a little more, I will say though the $50 is not unreasonable for the build quality of the mic as well.",

To me, they sound so close in quality that the Comica becomes the clear winner just based on the additional value as compared to the Rode. Disclosure: Comica did provide me with a free microphone.",

However, the shock mount doesn't seem to take out much of the handling noises so I would not recommend this mic for vlogging or any other type of shooting were the camera is moving. If you are just sticking it in one place stationary then it will serve you well! I informed the company of this issue and they are going to work to fix it which is awesome on their end for listening to the consumer.",

The case it came in was excellent and at a glance appeared to be a great deal! From an audio perspective, it didn't quite cut it. Indoor room noise was very loud and it took a lot of post-production effort to make the audio usable. Sadly, this microphone will be returned and replaced with a professional mic.",
