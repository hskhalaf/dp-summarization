They're comfortable, albeit a little bit long. I'm 5'5\" and they probably need 2-3\" hemmed off. The full panel band is comfortable and seems like it will be durable throughout the pregnancy. MY ONLY COMPLAINT= When I bought these 3 weeks ago, they were $9.80 per pair (I bought 2), but today (3/14/18) they are $50. The jump to $50 per pair is absurd. They're a great pair of jeans, but there's no way I would pay $50 for them.",

I was pleasantly surprised when I tried these on and they fit like a glove, I ordered a M. I'm currently 19 weeks and these are pretty much the only jeans I wear because the regular ones are just too tight and uncomfortable. The only tiny thing I would change is the hem which is a bit too short for me, but not so short that will look weird so I decided to keep them. Definitely cheaper than some of the other maternity brands out there.",

Otherwise, the material is comfortable, adequate elasticity to not cause discomfort when sitting down. I've worn them religiously for a week, the belly band maintained good support after continuous use, and no sagging noted yet around the knees and thighs. No significant color bleeding noted when washed inside out. They make me feel like a normal woman again!",
