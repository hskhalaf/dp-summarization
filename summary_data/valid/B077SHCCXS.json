      "text": "I love it! I assembled a lot of furniture. Never have I had seen a company with such commitment to offer a good experience and an excellent daybed. Every item is carefully secured and wrapped. Every step of the way is clearly explained and marked with number stickers. They even used aluminum stickers that won\u2019t break or leave a glue residue. I assembled the bed alone in 15 minutes. I use it every night, thanks to a snoring husband. It\u2019s very comfortable and for certain high quality. It doesn\u2019t feel flimsy at all. I chose specifically that one because of the support legs in the middle, ensuring a better support. I highly recommend it!",

I got this for my small sized room to alleviate space and floor room. I'm always at my gf's place so I'm rarely using it but it's very comfortable. You may need to buy those stoppers for the legs to keep it from shifting on the floor though. ( I should buy them soon) it's not that big of a deal though but some people are really bothered by a slight shift. You could wait on it.",
