Lots of burpees, kettlebell stuff, bear crawls, etc. Well, I chose the color so I probably shouldn't complain, but this is not a good color (neony blue). There's a reason it was cheaper. This is my 2nd purchase of this model shoe. Like the last time, they stain easily. My work outs sometimes go through fields so I don't know if it's some plant material or just sweat, but both pairs become quickly stained.",

The shoes have a ton of grip and fit very close at the ankle, which is where I assume the increased stability comes from. I have yet to try running in them, though I did notice that the shoes tore open the skin on my Achilles while walking one day\u2014my socks were slightly too short to cover the part where my ankle met the shoe. Once wearing socks tall enough, these shoes should do fine for anyone who needs a set of cross trainers that can support both casual powerlifting and short/medium distance runs.",
