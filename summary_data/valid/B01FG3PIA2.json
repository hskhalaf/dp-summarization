They don't seal well and oftentimes when you unscrew the cap the the valve core comes loose as well, blowing all of the remaining pressure out. Something as easy as removing the protective cap or using a schrader adapter shouldn't do this every time you try to top up the air in your tube. I tried three of the five tubes and they all did this. I have every reason to believe the other two will as well. Save yourself from extreme frustration and stay away.",

While using them in the past I have gone months without a puncture or flat. However when I recently put new Gatorskin tires on, I also purchased these inner tubes. Two weeks later, all five are in the trash due to flats/holes. There were no punctures, just one flat after another due to holes in the inner tubes. I went to a local bike shop and switched to a different brand which had a thicker tube. The flats stopped. Still happy with their tires... but a bit puzzled as to what happened with these tubes.",

Also, I run 28's on my road bike (Continental Gatorskin) but I use these which are rated for 20-25. I have found that it is fine to put a \"smaller\" tube in a bigger tire as the tube just expands a bit - the other way around is not a good way to go, though, because the tube can be pinched.",

EDIT: Just want to ammend this, I did some research and I guess it's pretty standard for the removable cores to be a little loose from the manufacturer, and there is a little tool called a valve core remover that can help tighten it up (sounds like pliers or a small crescent wrench can work okay too). Wanted to add this for anyone else that is having the same issue. Bumping my review up to 3 stars (still had some tubes puncture seemingly too quickly).",

Word to the wise - these tubes don't come with any powder on them, so either get something on hand to help with your install or be very careful to avoid pinching the tubes during install.",

    "description": "Color:Original VersionPack of 5 Continental Race 28 700x20-25 S42 Presta Valve 42mm Bicycle Tubes & 2 Continental Tire Lever. The Continental quality road inner tube is a must have cycling essential for 700c bike wheels.\n\nThis new ContiTube hose program makes it even easier to find the optimum hose for your needs. The very clear and user-friendly hose system was perfectly adapted in size, design, valve type and length to the respective tire sizes and applications.\n\nShorter valve inner tubes are ideal for wheels with rim depths of 24mm or 30mm but are not ideal for wheels with rim depths of 40mm or above (as the shorter valve would not extend out of the rim valve hole).\n\nPresta valve tubes are most commonly used for road wheels (700c) and on a few MTB wheels as the valves are thin, whereas Schrader valves are more commanly found on MTB wheels as valve is larger and won't fit through 700c rim valve holes.",
