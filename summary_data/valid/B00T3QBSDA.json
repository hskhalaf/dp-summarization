It takes an extremely practiced hand to throw something with such poor weight characteristics accurately and with enough power to do damage. To confound the issue further, these tomahawks tend to snap at the neck when thrown with proper force. I've broken two of my three in half through normal, infrequent use. I have probably thrown them four to six hundred times in the six or so months I've owned them.",
