Bottom line, you have to remove the bottom grill to access the coils, which are easily cleaned with a vacuum and a long thin coil brush. Anyway, I was suprised at the negative reviews. I have been very pleased with my Blaze Outdoor Refrigerator. I have had zero problems with it. It sits on my back porch operating year around. Still keeps our beverages cold!",

Now we are in need of finding a replacement fridge that will fit the space that was custom build for this item and would never purchase this one again. Not worth the money... our advice find something else for a much lower price point. If it only lasts a year you will have saved the difference in price with this unit to buy a replacement. VERY DISAPPOINTED!",
