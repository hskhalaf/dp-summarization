A shame as this design flaw ruins an otherwise decent pair of headphones.",

Simply wearing the headphones will run the risk of these small plastic clips snapping, and they can't be repaired or replaced. Without those clips, the headband will dig into the top of your head and be rendered unwearable without severe discomfort. Luckily for me, Amazon dealt with the issue and offered a refund with very little hassle. Shame really because the headphones are pretty fantastic otherwise, but design flaws from poor build quality is absolutely inexcusable at this price.",

Battery is VERY poor even with frequent charging - worse still when the battery is low, the headset is determined to annoy the rest of your audio experience by playing a continuous annoying beeping sound. This could better be managed with the use of the accompanying software to display the warning or a less intrusive led flash. Build quality is below average for the price point, they will not tolerate much movement before they feel they are about to snap. Paint finish will not stand up to normal wear. These are good to accompany other razor products but are 100% overpriced for the quality.",

Read reviews where they are breaking because of being made from plastic. A lot of headsets are made from plastic. Just look after them. I use these everyday for Gaming, Music and TV. Wireless range reaches throughout most rooms and part of the garden.",
