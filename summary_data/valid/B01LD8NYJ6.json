We did not want the webbed version because I did not want an ankle getting twisted nor did they look very comfy. We are so glad we settled on this one. It is TOP NOTCH quality, the stitching and the fabric are strong. The ropes are perfect as well, not that cheesy material that flakes in the sun. Love love love this swing.",

Until now, it has been able to withstand me and the kids swinging on it. I\u2019m not a heavy person. 140lb. So when it said it could withstand way more weight than mine and my kids combined, I was at a loss when it tore. The year is almost 12in long and it happened spontaneously when we were swinging. My kids never take toys or sharp things on the swing. I\u2019m going to contact the company to see if I can get a replacement, but we\u2019ll see!",

It was easy to assemble, probably 20 minutes or so from start to finish. It was even easier to hang but we did use an old swing set frame. The swing is adjustable for height but as of the moment it works best for our needs at a higher height. Overall, very pleased with our purchase and would recommend.",

Super simple set up, the instructions say to check every nut and bolt every time before use, and that is actually good advice! The bolts get loose often enough that it's a good idea, but I'm not religious about it. It's awesome! Thanks! Also it came way sooner than expected. :)",

It's fun for really little kids who don't like to go high, for our 2 year old who just can't get high enough, and for me and my son or multiple kids to ride on together. We put it low to the ground so my 2 year old can climb in by himself and he likes to sit in it and eat snacks or stand in it and swing gently. All the kids in the neighborhood come use it in our front yard. Highly recommended!",

The adjustable height straps are helpful, so you can more easily adjust how high you want it off the ground.",
