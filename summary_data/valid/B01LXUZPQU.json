With manual lip sync on my Yamaha receiver, I've been able to make the problem tolerable (again,as another reviewer mentioned), but it varies from source to source, so is never totally \"right.\" Like the others, I wish Roku would come up with a fix. I really like the unit, but this problem is a major flaw in an otherwise nice device.",

I bought this as an upgrade from an Apple TV 3 and my wife and I are 50/50 on whether we want to keep it, because of the usability issues. The Apple TV has some annoying limitations (like no Amazon video) but the UI is years ahead.",
