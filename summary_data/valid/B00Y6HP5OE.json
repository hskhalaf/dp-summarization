      "text": "This is pretty cute: a petite sugar bowl that sits unobtrusively on the counter among dry goods and utensil canisters, coffee maker and grinder. It's not airtight but it holds just over a cup, so if you use about a teaspoon a day you'll have to re-fill only about once a month. The spoon is a round half-bowl shape that will hold a 1/2 teaspoon measure, but it requires you to work a little to scoop that much- so it's good if you're trying to limit sugar intake without eliminating it altogether.",
