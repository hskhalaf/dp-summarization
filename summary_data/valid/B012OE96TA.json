In the photos I've included, the passenger side light is the 'before' and the driver side light is the 'after'. They both looked the same before I started, and after I finished, were both clear as a bell. Also, use a corded drill with variable speed if you can. This allows more control over speed and helps with keeping light, even pressure. All you need for this kit is the power drill, spray bottle of water and some rags. I used painter's tape beneath the auto-painter's tape for an extra layer of protection.",

Next time I'll go double or triple wide with the masking tape. Also - I splattered the rubbing compound all over the shop. Don't be a slob like me. Overall an excellent product.",

I skipped the 500 grit step (not wanting to give myself more work than I already had) and started using the 800 grit discs. The result? This kit fixed the yellowing and the fogging and made them pretty clear again. The not so good part: Despite the product description above, there was no polishing compound and no polishing disc in the box. Just two clearcoat packs for use after the final sanding. I'm not unhappy with the results, but I believe the final product would have been better with that final polishing, and I wonder why it wasn't there.",

I also recommend opening the hood so you dont have to tape there and either laying some towels over the engine bay or wiping up splatter before it dries. I keep my engine bay very clean, so I had a bit of extra work cleaning up splatter afterwards.",

The areas around these protrusions did not get as clear as the rest of the headlight, it was hard to get that area with the drill.

Then when you're done with their synthetic wax, put alcohol and wipe the headlight housing and spray it 2x clear coat, the one that sticks to plastic, buy em at Home Depot or Lowes, it will last longer.",

      "text": "I used this product for the first time after trying others that just contain a compund and buffing wheel which yielded minimal and temporary results. The sandpaper and combined compound and protectant offer an excellent professional finish when all is said and done. There was only enough sandpaper for one pair of headlights but a good bit of compound left. Just keep that in mind in case you're planning to do multiple vehicles with this kit. Now my lenses look new and I have much brighter headlights during night driving. Very pleased overall with this 3M product",
