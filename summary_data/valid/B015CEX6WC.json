Doesn't have a very long charge (about 90 minutes?) and I do wish the charging station was wireless so it would be a little less of an effort to use. I use mine daily while studying and I can hear it throughout the entire house. Great design and I can't wait to see how its improved even better in the future!",

    "description": "We questioned ourselves as to how do you make an amazing existing levitating Bluetooth speaker even better? How can you refine the best and deliver an even more jaw-dropping experience when you once believed that this was the best that could ever be made? Surprisingly, we a found answer to it, and a wonderful one at that \u2013 presenting to you the ICE Orb Harmony.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nThe Levitating Pod The levitating pod of the Orb Harmony comes with a delicately crafted soft cushion padding, which gets illuminated every time the levitating pod is switched on. This time round, it has a warm-golden glow, complimenting the overall colour of the product. The warm and soft golden glow is also adjustable, making the product a perfect companion \u2013 be it for bed side lighting, meditation and yoga sessions or hours of music playback.\n\nImproved Dynamic Stabilization The Orb Harmony while in levitation is more stable, thanks to thousands of man-hours of conceptualization and determined hardware experiment. When picked up and moved from one place to another while in levitation, the levitating Pod tilts on its axis and balances itself dynamically. This makes the levitation more flawless and smoother, making the overall product a wonderful Bluetooth speaker to own and flaunt. Not only is making the pod levitate more easier, but keeping it levitating while you move around your desk, shifting and moving things around it, is much more simpler and hassle-free.\n\n\nRe-designed Pod Pod-shaped levitating speaker crafted from soft padding material and champagne gold finish base with speaker vents. Glows with a warm golden light, with controllable intensity/brightness.\n\n\nMusic, Meditation & More Warm golden glowing Pod along with the capability of playing even the softest of music to the finest tune possible, Orb Harmony can be used for daily music needs or for Meditation and Yoga sessions.\n\n\n360\u00b0 Sound with Bluetooth With a levitating pod-shaped speaker, a 360\u00b0 sound experience along with Bluetooth connectivity makes the Orb Harmony a complete portable Bluetooth Speaker. \n\n\n\nMusic, Meditation & More The Orb Harmony is perfect for those calm moments of meditation or yoga, which helps you rediscover yourself and your inner potential. In your fast-paced lifestyle, the soothing and warm glow of the Orb Harmony along with its soft sound clarity aims to help you concentrate better and find the calm you had always longed for.\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nWelcome to Change\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nWhen working on a product which the world simply calls a Bluetooth Speaker, the last thing we wanted to make was a clunky electronic product which would only compliment a laptop or a table top. The product which we wanted our customers to have was a product worth flaunting - something that would make everything around it look even more beautiful and gorgeous. Hours of re-designing and daring to start again from scratch helped achieve something even better to what earlier was believed to be the best.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nFrom a redesigned levitating pod, to a lighter color matched magnetic base, everything in the Orb Harmony has been meticulously looked into and worked upon to the minutest of details. The color of illumination has been given a calm and worm golden hue to make this product more of a lifestyle product, rather than a one way music player. Overall, the Orb Harmony is till date our best definition of a complete product - brilliant & beautiful.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nIt would undoubtedly be the challenge of making an amazing product even better. Instead of just giving it a few make-overs and customizations, we made sure a new product indeed felt new and refreshing when unboxed. We started from scratch with a view of refining the Orb and fine-tuning the already present technology to deliver a richer music experience to our users and gladly came up with something which was even better than what we had initially planned for \u2013 making the Orb Harmony way more than just a Levitating Bluetooth Speaker.",
