Because it's stainless steel, very little adheres to the scooper, unlike a plastic one. 4. Because of the handle's configuration, it's very easy to hold. There aren't any negatives I can think of, and I'm very happy with this scooper. Therefore, I highly recommend it.",

The curve on this makes it hard to go down to the bottom of the litter box since the curve causes it to naturally turn upwards as you push it down.

All the slots are a perfect size for scooping clumps and tootsie rolls...litter sifts through, clumps and tootsie rolls remain. I like that it is slightly heavier than the plastic ones, for easier digging, but still very light. Never thought I would be excited about a pooper scooper...but here I am!",

It's completely solid all the way through the handle (except the last inch, which is hollow & flexible, but who cares). I'm a big guy, and this thing is so beefy I'm not sure I could break it even if I made a concerted effort to do so. The price couldn't be better, I'm actually surprised how solid it is at that price, I'd expect it to be more. Only downside is I doubt I'll ever have a reason to give this company any future business, this thing will probably last forever.",

It's such a different feeling compared to plastic; the metal is so sturdy, unlike plastic where you're afraid it'll snap in half and throw cat feces on you. It can pick up three times the amount of a plastic scooper; this can be washed and disinfected easily; there's nothing I hate about this product. It makes scooping litter so satisfying.",

I got the metal one and it is amazing. It breaks up spots that are too big to get at once and picks them up with no issue. It is able to scrape the junk off the bottom super easy with out chipping at it forever. It is one complete metal tool with rubber coating on the handle so it should hold up for years. Super happy with the purchase",

      "text": "This is a good product that likely deserves more than three stars, but imho the inability to select a specific handle color (i.e., \"colors may vary\") is a significant enough limitation to reduce the rating. Yes, it's \"just\" a cat litter scoop. And yes, I purchased it knowing I might receive a handle color I don't particularly care for. And yes, if I'm that displeased with it, I can return it to Amazon for a refund. And yes, if I'd received the blue handle color, I'd give it more stars. My primary point - and suggestion - is that customers be offered their choice of handle color. Is that really too much to ask?",

      "text": "Wow this is a big litter scoop. You need this if you have big cat business to attend to, otherwise it might be too much scoop. I have a couple of big boys Blue and Hootie. They do the biggest pees. Being able to get their enormous pee clumps out in one piece is so much easier with this scoop. There is no way that a mere plastic scoop could do the job. I am very happy with this scoop. It is very well made and sturdy. I have no problem sifting out unused cat litter.",

      "text": "Best cat litter scoop I ever bought. All these years trying to remove the clumps stuck to the side and swearing doing it and all I had to do was buy this. It picks up the waste easily. It makes the job...I wouldn't go as far as saying fun but I am not reluctant to do it anymore. The scoop is sturdy (I'd even go as far as to say that it is more sturdy than some gardening small shovels). It's easy to keep clean. Nothing really sticks to it and if it does, I just knock it on the side and it goes away. I would definitely recommend.",

    "description": "The DuraScoop is a real tool for the one job you as a cat lover probably hate doing. It's cast, end-to-end in one piece, from high-grade rust-resistant ADC-12 aluminum. Then it's hand polished and the ergonomic handle is fitted with a soft non-slip, phthalate-free plastic coating. It's big but lightweight and incredibly durable. It lets you dig out the big clumps, scrape the bottoms and sides of the pan while reducing time, effort and strain on your wrist. The solid enclosed sides are designed to minimize scatter of soiled litter during sifting. And it won't bend or break or flick icky cat doo out of the box or in your face. Assorted colors are mint green, watermelon pink and sky blue.",
