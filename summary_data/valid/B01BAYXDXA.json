Don't think you are just going to program it to run at night everyday and let it go. You have to keep an eye on it so it doesn't get stuck, and try to block rooms off to get it to clean an entire room. By that point, you could have just vacuumed or swept yourself faster. The one thing it does well is get under furniture that is hard to move.",

Plus, we can run it while watching TV or talking without it being a huge distraction. We also have a real Roomba that is quicker (moves faster around the house) and better at vacuuming (stronger brush), but cannot run it while we are home because of the extreme noise it creates. This is a great, lower cost, well made machine! Would not hesitate to buy a 4th one!",

      "text": "This thing is pretty awesome. It does well with floor dirt pick up and wet cleaning. The only beef I have with it is that it doesn't have the gps so it doesn't know where it's been. At times it will go in the same place over and over again and will miss other spots on the floor. I find I have to let it run for a couple of hours to get a good chuck of the floor clean. But def saves me time from having to constantly sweep my floor and mop. I love it.",

I run this vacuum a couple times a week and notice a huge difference than just sweeping or vacuuming alone. It does sometime get stuck on small rugs or under my sofa but otherwise it is excellent at climbing on top of difference surface areas. I would highly recommend this product. It does an great job moping as well, very easy to clean and transition to sweep mode.",

It gets stuck in the oddest of situations - room dividers are its worst enemy, banister etc. Lack of virtual walls is a big constraint which I did not realize before I bought this. It has almost never found its way back on its own to its charging station, so I'm not even sure it has any intelligence in tracking what it has cleaned or hasn't. Reminds me of the screen scrapers with the ball just bouncing around from wall to wall. I would not recommend this product.",
