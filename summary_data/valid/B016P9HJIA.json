If you want to actually listen to your music the way it\u2019s meant to be heard, do yourself a favor and go this route rather than an all-in-one, kitschy cute player with built in speakers. These are so far superior, and you can really hear the dimensions and crackles and pops and the warmth that makes vinyl special. Literally the only downside to these is that the cords that attach them to the turntable itself are a bit short and that makes placing them a bit limiting. Other than that, these are a great investment.",

I read reviews of this one, and decided to try them. I replaced the speaker wire with 12g wire, and that made a noticeable difference. I also used clear rubber cones as feet to get them off the deck, and that added bass extension and improved the stage. I like these so far. I am waiting on my rca connector upgrade as well to connect my CD player, and the rca to mini cable as well.",

I have to have treble turned all the way up to get these to sound reasonably crisp to my ears. Bass sounds good. Can be turned way down for night time listening, and when turned up it sounds very well balanced with the rest of the speaker.

No fear bass is here. Can be a bit muddy unless you turn down the bass. For the money these are nice speakers. Can`t think of any corners cut on quality. Want audiophile speakers? Get out the wallet and buy up to the $300 range at a minimum. I`d buy these again. Great sound for the size.",
