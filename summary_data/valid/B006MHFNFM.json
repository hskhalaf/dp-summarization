No worries there, as the top edge has the same high contrast stitching. Looks to be well made- no loose threads or obvious stitching flaws. Like a lot of products marketed to those of us who will choose to brave the elements, this is a little more expensive than it seems like it should be. But I am confident it will keep the icicles from forming beneath my nose!",
