She originally wanted different, waterproof boots, but, as a former paratrooper with global service, I stubbornly insisted that she get this boot instead. She works outdoors in Florida at an animal sanctuary and now wears them every day. She loved them in Peru and had no complaints; from wet tropical forest, to rocky steppes, to high altitude climbing.",

      "text": "These are by far the most comfortable hiking boots I have ever owned...I\"m on my second pair! If you have foot \"issues\", these are the perfect boot by Merrell. Obviously, Merrell makes many other models, but I've found THIS MODEL is the best for Plantar Fasciitis, arch support, heel pain, and general foot support. These are the one and only shoe that I can wear for HOURS without my feet hurting. I've gone many miles without foot issues, and they have EXCELLENT breathability. I was recommended these initially by a random stranger in REI. Thank God I listened....so now I'm paying it forward because these are truly the best boots!",

I do use a specialized arch support and will likely need to put them into these boots, but that is normal for me. I also love the purple addition to the boots that adds a bit of a feminine touch.",

Yes, they are my daily \"go to\" shoes. The only regret I have is that I am no longer strong enough to test these wonderful boots out on a hike with my husband.",
