      "text": "I bought this to dry brush once a week and it works great for that. I dry brush while a bath with 2 cups of epson salt and 1 cup of baking soda is filling. (A few drops of lavender EO is in my baths too) Using the bath and the dry brush is a great way to detox once a week. Make sure you drink a lot of water (full 8-16 oz) afterwards and stay hydrated the next day. This process will flush a lot of toxins right out of you. Baths with these things in then should be done in the evening as you\u2019ll definitely be ready for a good sleep afterwards. Enjoy!",

I did knock a star off because, like others here, I wish they would have secured a cloth handle to the brush so when you aren't using the long handle (which in my case is 90% of the time), you could just slip your hand between the cloth handle and brush and do your thing. Minor complaint though and I would still recommend this product, which is very good, especially given the price.",

Well, after receiving this brush, I LOVE dry brushing, and even love this brush! I have only used it twice, but already noticeably softer skin!!! The brush is firm enough for me, (I have very UNsensitive skin) but doesn't leave any scratches at all. The redness from brushing goes away in about 15 min. I was worried about not getting a firm enough brush, but this one is perfect! My other concern was the removable head, but it stays on great, no problems with it falling off. I highly recommend this, and will buy another!!",

Not a big deal, it was designed to come off. Just put it back on. You could use gorilla glue to keep it on if it annoys you. The handle comes off so you can use it in the palm of your hand.",

It would be nice to have a cotton strap on the back of the head like my old one had as it makes it easier to hold onto when using the head alone. Still, I am very satisfied with this purchase!",

I went on a trip for a week and didn't bring it with me and I missed my morning brushing as it invigorates me in the morning. I gave it 4 stars because the brush would fall off the handle when I hung it up (the handle and brush come apart). So my husband drilled a hole where the handle and brush are together and inserted a peg to keep it from falling apart. Now it works great and I can still take the peg out if I don't want to use the handle with the brush.",
