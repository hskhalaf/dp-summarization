I obtained the following information by emailing directly with the manufacturer: \"Our replacement filters for this product will be available on Amazon at the end of this June. The VEVA 8000 has the lowest filter replacement cost of any True HEPA air purifier. A replacement set that includes 1 HEPA Filter and 4 Carbon Prefilters will cost around $19. They will be sold in a super value pack that will contain a total of two sets (2 HEPAs and 8 Carbon filters). I hope my answer helps!\"",

I opened the cover after 3-half-day use and found my dog's white hair was on the carbon Pre filter! I believe this purifier really filter out the particles in the air. I am glad that I brought two.

Noise level was OK. I am skeptical of the claimed 325 sq. ft. coverage but have no way of telling if that is true. Dust level is low at my house right now so it is hard to tell. I hope it is true. I have measured the power consumption and found that the 3 speeds use 21/29/40 watts of power. Noise levels were 45/52/60 db measured 12 inches from the unit. Setup was easy, and the video at their website helps.",

I just can't provide you with a exact date when. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\" So the purifier is useless for now.",

But I had to turn it, twice, because the unit on low rattled and made a very unpleasant noise on its lowest setting. If it would have been constant noise, I might have kept it. But both units had oscillating rattle noises on the setting. Not good enough for a $100 investment. Other than this one issue, everything else was incredible looking... But it was a showstopper for me.",

The company really care about their customer. They resolved the issue, and as a result of their kindness and care, I bought another air purifier from them. The product itself, it is not excellent, but price/quality is very good. You can hear it at the lowest setting. Thank you Vanessa for your great service.",
