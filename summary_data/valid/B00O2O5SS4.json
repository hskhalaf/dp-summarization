The image on the left is the original figurine I wanted to scan, the image on the right is the final combined scan (3 scans) converted to a mesh. Can't get better than this, in my opinion. Todd",

The 5% is because I need to smooth the surface by other software but not much work and it is expected. I thought the quality scanned out was bad at first but scan over 5 times and after mesh build up, the thing scanned come out with surprise, I can see it on screen in 3D. After surface smooth by software, 3D printed, the copy almost same as the original. Great! Advise, I use a lightbox without light and a black backdrop to keep the background constant. No bright environment needed, instead, keep little dark better.",

The scans take a VERY long time to complete and after trying for a week of scanning multiple small child's toy objects, I was still not able to get a single STL mesh that was viable for printing. Calibration is hit or miss, though it will tell you it's calibrated most every time, the quality of output varies hugely. It's just a toy like I said, not for any kind of serious 3d scanning at all.",

The youtube video is very misleading that you can perform almost anything from the minimum to maximum size......forget about jewelry ,even with us powder coating the object it is a very rough image at best and non usable .the invented evedentallly has the perfect excuse that these can be performed . easily. Also there is a no return policy that you should read before buying it ,as I wanted to return it the next day. I will not recommended this machine to anyone.it is a toy at best .the inventor is misleading.",
