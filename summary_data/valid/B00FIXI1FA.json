It holds a good amount of times and spoons pretty freely as well. My only complaint is that it doesn't display all my ties as visually appealing as some of the others, like the circle rack. When it gets moved from origin point; it gets set at a 45 degree angle versus a 90 degree which would keep the ties from hitting each other. It would probably remove more wrinkles that way and still be more appealing to the eyes",

Holds a lot of ties securely 4. Especially love the tilt function which allows you to nicely display your ties; also love the rotate function 5. Lightweight and sturdy construction 6. Excellent value for your money CONS 1. None I've owned more expensive and \"fancier\" tie racks with automatic rotation. They take up more room and provide no additional utility. This tie rack is simply and hands down 10x better! I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who is anti-clutter and wants something useful with a clean look.",

The reason I went 4 stars instead of 5 is that after a couple uses, it becomes progressively harder to keep the two racks upright. They don't \"click\" in as well as they do at first, and end up resting in the \"x\" position instead of locking in upright to minimize the space they take up. It hasn't bothered me enough to merit a lower score though, I'd probably do 4.5/5 if possible.",

I had been using a different, metal hanger with multiple racks in the hanger for holding ties; but this one functions a lot better with the swivel body and racks that can move from a storage position to a more-like display position for quickly identifying and choosing a tie. Will definitely be getting another when I fill up all the arms on this first one.",

The tie holder rotes making it easier to grab your tie or even position the tie holder to take up less space in closet. The cost was a good price which is a plus.",

I had tie individual tie hangars before which were too tight on the ties and left marks. This system is gentle on your ties.",
