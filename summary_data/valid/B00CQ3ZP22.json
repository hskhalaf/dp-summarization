Small footprint with big sound. I don't know what the full battery life is, as I only had it playing for 5 hours, in which it performed flawlessly. I cannot imagine a time when I would use it for longer than 5 hours, so I have no idea as to the actual battery life. The only caveat I would level against them - for the price it should have had a protective travelling case included.",

      "text": "I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for xmas and we both love it. We've tried other speakers but the sound quality isn't nearly as good. We travel a lot and it is so small and easy to throw in my purse for use at friend's places and in hotel rooms while on the road. It is very quick and easy to pair with my phone and the sound is clear. Volume can go quite high without distortion. With a sleek design and cover that protects it when not in use I would highly recommend this speaker.",

After a quick test, the battery was death but while charging, it connected to my OnePlus 5T instantly and both Pearl Jam as the Binaural Beats I tested on it surprised me. This little speaker was packing. For my presentation I used it outdoors in a group of six listening to a poem of Adam Roa and everyone was surprised of the sound.",

This is indeed much better that the one I had. I used it recently to place Christmas music from my iPad throughout my office. It should fantastic! I got several compliments on its sound and questions as to where to get one and the cost. I wish I could have told them it was inexpensive but it's really not in my book, but I also believe that quality cost more. I do believe that even though it may not be inexpensive it is certainly worth every penny.",

It has been quite interesting and a great enhancement to my office, since every business conversation that I have had in my office since December, when I purchased it, has revolved around it. Transit by Soen is Practical, wireless, modern design, light weight, and a great presentation as a gift. Everything since the moment that you get the box just tells you that this company that invented TRANSIT it's detailed oriented, The battery last four hours usually, sometimes longer, has a great clear sound, compatible with Samsung and Iphones, Tablets, etc. Highly recommend it.",
