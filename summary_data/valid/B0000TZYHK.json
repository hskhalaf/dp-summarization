Average time to cut the 4\" brick was less than 3 minutes each, and the holes were smooth and clean. You'll have to stop before penetrating the back of the brick and break the core to go all the way through,though.",

The weight of the bit tends to pull it down as you drill. The bit is long also so it will go all the way through the depth of most brick walls. I haven't used the bit for long so I can't comment on how long it will last.",
