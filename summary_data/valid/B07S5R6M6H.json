      "verdict": "The newest addition to the Adidas Originals, the Supercourt represents the fifty-year lineage of classic tennis sneakers of the Three Stripes. Its upper comprises of vintage plush leather, which takes on the shades of tennis whites, and a perforated 3-Stripes run along the sidewalls.\u00a0Moreover, the understated overlays and panels, along with the surprisingly thick, sculpted rubber sole construction, bring about a fresh, sophisticated look. The Supercourt is perhaps the best reimagined Adidas silhouette at present.",

Turns out it was just a kid who would find anything too big. My toes touch the end of my shoe now thanks to him but thankfully it is a soft leather so I can live with it. These shoes are true to size, get your regular size.",
