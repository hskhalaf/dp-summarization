My issue is that all of the scents have a very menthol-like smell to them. Even the orange scent. The only oil that doesn't have as strong as a menthol smell is the frankincense but it's still kind of there. For me this doesn't work because it's hard to layer the scents as you just end up with menthol on top of menthol.",

We wanted you to use this for relaxation and the absence of lavender defeats the purpose of this sample set. Because this product is not as advertised and therefore we felt misled, we are giving the product one star.",

I find myself falling asleep much faster these days just by having this in my bedroom. I highly recommend this product.",

It puts the scent in the air, and it falls on items in your house, on the floor, on you, on your cats, and if they lick anything at all it could harm them or it can irritate their skin.",

The scent they are supposed to produce is non-existent, and if it had one, after a few minutes it was gone. I used in a diffuser, and there was no scent what so ever, and I ended up using more oil than recommended, because I wanted to smell it, maybe even just a tiny hint, but again...nothing.
