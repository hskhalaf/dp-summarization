After I arm it it will emit around five 'chirps' a few minutes after it's armed. Then will do it again a few minutes later even when there is no wind or anything touching it. The sensitivity is sporadic. Sometimes it will just take a slight touch to set it off and other times you really have to knock it for it to go off. Honestly, I'm not really sure if I can recommend this alarm. It's too temperamental.",

It's just right. It gives off a warning chirp if you touch the bike, and well it gives off a full alarm if you interfere with the bike again, subsequent to the warning chirp.

The loudness wise of this alarm will definitely let you know if anyone messes with your bike from a really good distance away. Which I feel is important incase you're in a store or at home. It's under 20 bucks,it's generally simple to install and I feel like I should of paid 80 dollars for it. All around I definitely recommend this product it's to good to pass up.",

The wiring colors did not match exactly, but I took a chance, unplugged the jumper connector and plugged the alarm connector in. Every function worked fine.",
