The assembly took about 2 hours, with the chairs taking up the most time. While assembling, one of the chair legs split due to the threaded metal insert separating the wood along the grain while tightening. I'm hoping to get one leg replaced without buying an additional set of chairs.",

I thought my mom would need help assembling it but she did it on her own and says it was easy. The quality is solid and the coloring is darker than my screen showed but it is a good thing. There's also no smell which I like. Some varnish smell toxic and awful and take time to air out but this was fine. If you're in the edge, get it! Great price for what you get.",

Table did not even look at directions. No damage to carton when delivered. All pieces, and screws were there. Quality materials used. Chairs tuck under without sticking out. Roomy seating for 4 without leaf. Looks like it will seat 6 comfortably when extended. Fits in dining area just like I pictured it. Would highly recommend. Looked for quite a while before deciding on this set. Price is exceptional. Yes husband likes it to! Again very happy with purchase.",
