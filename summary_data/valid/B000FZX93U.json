Now I'm on the trip and when I first decide to use the thermos, the metal part of the cap came off as if it had never been glued (see pictures). I'm absolutely disappointed. I'm still going to use it as I still have another 2 months or so left on my trip before I return, so I have no option. But it's really disappointing. Not what you would expect from a product that boasts LIFETIME WARRANTY.",

Not one drop of water came out. I'm impressed. I found this as a deal of the day, and paid less than $20 shipped for it. They could justify charging triple that for a product this effective.

Keeps drinks warm for at LEAST 8 hours (IF there is any coffee left it is still warm) ONLY annoyint part is how long the thermos is because my bottle brush doesn't easily reach, but that is honestly the only fault I can find.",

I didn't pay for a dented thermo and I would be in trouble if this was a last minute gift for someone else. Taking that aside, it does the job, it keeps water hot enough for about 6-7 hours (forget about the claimed 24 hours) Kind of sturdy but not like in the old times.",
