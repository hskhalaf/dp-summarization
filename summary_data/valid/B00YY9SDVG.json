      "text": "Unfortunately Honda's quality control/assurance program failed to detect that this very expensive generator I received was broken out of the box. After I received it, unpacked it, installed the battery, and put oil and fuel in, it wouldn't start with the electric starter. We managed to get it to work with the pull start, but the electric start was broken. After several phone calls, I was told to take it to an authorized Honda repair dealer. I did that. That was over 3 weeks ago and they can't fix it! They don't know what the problem is. Unbelievable. So, I spend $4K and I have a big paperweight. Not a good situation for me or for Honda.",

Even when running the air conditioner, fridge and hot water heater it never ran above the lower idle setting. I am impressed that it ran all this for almost 10 hours on 5 gallons of fuel and it is super quiet. This generator is well worth the money and I have no regrets. I also purchased a 35 gallon fuel tank and a long run kit so I don't need to refuel all weekend long.",

    "description": "Whether you're looking to add an extra refrigerator at home, a larger saw on your construction site, or want to have a larger TV at your tailgate party, the Honda EU7000iAT1 Super Quiet Electric Powered Generator. The EU7000iAT1 is powered by an exceptionally quiet, smooth, fuel-efficient, 7000-watt motor in a small, lightweight package. Smart electronic fuel injection technology increases fuel efficiency, eliminates the engine choke, and reduces fuel associated carburetor problems. The Eco-Throttle System runs 6-18 hours on a single tank, so overnight power is no problem for this generator. Your neighbors will also love your portable generator that operates at 52 - 58 decibels, which is less noise than a normal conversation. Honda's automatic mechanical decompressor system also significantly reduces the amount of force needed to start the engine for easy starting, every time. The \u201cFuel Off\u201d position allows the engine to continue to run until the majority of the fuel in the carburetor is consumed and the engine shuts off. This helps prevent stale fuel issues and is useful when storing the generator. From camping trips to race tracks, this 7,000 Watt Honda Portable Inverter Electric Generator will provide you power wherever you go.",
