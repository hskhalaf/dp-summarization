Open the first cover to blow up the pillow through the one way valve or press the button once to let out small amounts of air to adjust firmness. Press it again to retain re-engage the one way valve. Open the second cover to let all the air out quickly for packing it away. The materials are soft like felt(ish). Ok maybe not felt, but it does not feel like slippery plastic under your head that you constantly have to fight with like a balloon. Packs up tiny. It's easier to fold and roll than stuff. Impressive product.",

I purchased it to use while backpacking, but it's so handy that I've started using it at home too - I fill it not quite all the way, and put it behind my head when reading in bed at night, and it's much more comfortable than having my head against the headboard! I really like the mechanism for blowing it up, with the button that you depress to open/close the valve. My only complaint, and it's not really a complaint so I'm not taking off a star, is that the bag is just a little bit too small - I really have to shove to get the pillow back into it.",

Also, it has buttons in the opening you can toggle to hold air in when you\u2019re inflating it and toggle it back when you\u2019re deflating. I did not know this and thought at first that I broke it during my first use.",

That said, it WAS ultralight and super easy to inflate and compacted easily.

The material is soft to the touch (side sleeper), and is pretty quiet when brushed up against. My only issue was with the valve leaking after a year of use, which may have been because of overinflating the pillow, putting too much pressure on the valve. Definitely give this thoughtfully designed pillow a try, and enjoy the fun colors :)",
