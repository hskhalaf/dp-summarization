      "text": "\"Your health is your wealth\". 100% worth the investment. I actually have had all three versions of the Theragun at some point and this one is prob the best. The small size makes it so easy to use and hit hard spots. It is very powerful for how small it is. The V2 is def a bit more powerful and I would recommend that for more serious use. The mini is perfect for on the go use, personal use and I would highly recommend it. The small design def makes it easier to hit harder spots. LOVE IT",

The arches on my feet never felt more relaxed after 8 hours of being on my feet. The charger is very compact too, a great companion to a travel sized massager. If anybody is looking for something like this, I recommend this product to anyone who's in need of a good therapeutic relaxation and can't get to a massage therapist during these times. I have seen many other products that are much louder and do not quite get the job done. This is definitely for everyone !!",

This really helps me improve my range of motion personally and run with less pain. After running, it is the perfect post exercise tool for massaging my feet, calves, quads, and hamstrings etc. Additionally, it is great on the lower back/neck after a long work day. The best part is the size of this - it fits easily into any day pack, bag, or luggage, and is very easy to transport. Highly recommend this product for anyone with soreness, or who exercises often!",

It\u2019s also compact but doesn\u2019t lose any power in what it does. I can carry it with me wherever I go after a long day of exercising and have it ready to go. With that said, I think the MINI might be the better option for those that were interested in the other models because it is much smaller and you throw it in your bag whenever you go out and it won\u2019t be as much of a hassle.",

In the morning, there was a mark on the chair where the Theragun had turned on and rubbed the fabric, leaving a 6\" mark. No idea how long it was on but battery was still charged. Returned for an exchange and hoping this one doesn't have that problem. If not, it would be a 5+ star review.",

Strong enough you don't want to use it against bone but highly effective for muscles. I'll probably buy more to gifts to the folks and for the extended families. Seems high quality, long battery life, charges quickly. Kind of heavy due to the battery, so best used oriented up/down to let gravity help. All in all, I'm impressed with its effectiveness and I highly recommend (particularly if you have no experience with massage tools).",
