Often, I have to manually check the status of the garage door, after I receive a \"Garage Door Open\" email hours or days after the actual event. GoGoGate needs to implement a message queuing service for their email notifications to users to guarantee delivery in the original order as the events really occur. Update 1/1/2019- GoGoGate has evidently made changes to their email notification system and it now works effectively. The messages are delivered in a timely fashion, and in the correct order. Way to go GoGoGate!",

      "text": "According to the Bitdefender security scan I ran on this product, it is vulnerable to both a memory overload issue and to a device lock-out vulnerability. I alerted the product group through their tech support over a year ago to the memory overload issue. As of the current version of firmware, it hasn't been corrected. Product works great, I just don't want to give someone a backdoor into my network, or, get locked out of my garage. The firmware was current as of this scan.",

My only complaint is that the installation instructions could be better. I did not hoot the gogogate to the wall switches, but instead to the opener itself. This was not clear, but it worked.",

Also great if you have someone (e.g. dog sitter) and you forgot to leave a key. Works from your cell so you can let them in (or kids who forgot their keys).",

Highly recommended! A+",
