The wearing out had nothing to do with the tines and everything to do with the caliche we tilled and the amount of time we spent tilling through it! A thin elderly person can run this easily and it tills a narrow enough line to fit in a flower bed. We recommend the electric because you never have to us oil or have the mess of gasoline around. It has 3 speeds and is VERY quiet.",

Having this lightweight electric tiller is fantastic. It doesn't have quite the power of our bigger gas one. It bounces a bit when it first gets started on compacted soil, but with just a little patience it gets just as deep and does an incredible job. And it's soooo light weight. much easier on the back and easier to get in place in small spaces. So glad we switched to this unit. Highly recommend if you're getting up in age like we are too.",

Bought this electric just because of the auto start plus no oil or gas needed. Used it today and love it. Very powerful and I can even use it in my raised beds. Never had to go above the first level of power. Seems very well made. Thought it was supposed to come with a kick stand but it didn't. Not a big issue but would have been better.
