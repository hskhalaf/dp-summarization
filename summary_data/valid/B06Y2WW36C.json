The sound quality is very good, especially for the size. The Bluetooth works great, no cutting in and out, the volume is very consistent and it doesn\u2019t cut in and out like another radio I tried. I don\u2019t like that all the buttons are the same size and all in a row... you really have to look at the top of the piece to see what you are pushing because there is no way to tell the difference.

      "text": "After a previous iHome Clock Radio gave up the ghost after years of good performance, I decided to order this clock radio. After receiving it, I promptly unpackaged it and set it up to try the product. The setup was pretty easy but listening to the FM Radio stations was disappointing because they sounded like either poor reception or poor sound quality from the speakers. I paired my Phone through Bluetooth and played some music but the sound didn't get any better so I concluded that the general sound quality was very poor! I promptly put it back in the box and shipped it back the next day! :-(",

I have to keep unplugging it and removing the batteries daily and resetting the whole thing all over again. This is super inconvenient and I\u2019m not keeping it if that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be. Since there are mostly good reviews, I\u2019ll probably just return it and ask for another one. But if the replacement unit does the same thing, I will be updating my review and will ask for a full refund.",

Rather than the numbers being illuminated, the whole screen is lit up and the numbers are darker. This makes it light up the room quite a bit unless you have it on the lowest brightness setting. But the lowest brightness setting also makes it harder to read from across the room. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this alarm clock. It's not perfect, but it's fine.",
