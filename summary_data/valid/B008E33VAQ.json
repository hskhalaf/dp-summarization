It provided the protection needed, without weighing a ton and being super uncomfortable. Have recommended to others!",

It's a shame really, a couple of extra inches in strap length at the temple and this would be a great mask. As it is you need to sew an extension onto the existing adjustment strap then you'll be set.",

The only bad thing is that the velcro sometimes gets stuck in my hair, but I think that would happen with any umpire mask that has velcro on it. I would recommend this and buy again.",
