I used it strictly in my carpeted workshop where I used drills, welders, saws, routers, etc. The Shark kept the floor free of metal and wood shavings, chips, filings, etc. This new one will never match up. Not even close. Don\u2019t waste your money. seriously",

I like them, though, and will buy again next time, but a larger model. Bonnie B.",
