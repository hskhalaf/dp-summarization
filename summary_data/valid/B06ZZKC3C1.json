Seller suggested I may have gotten a defective bookend and offered to refund or replace the merchandise. I refused because it is really cute, and even if it is defective, it works fine for my smaller, paperback books. KnowingI may have gotten a defective one, and the seller willing correct the issue has made me upgrade my review.

The only reason I mention that is because I wouldn't expect it to support anything for heavy leaning. I ordered in black.
