I used these as part of the gift that I gave my students in a goody bag at the end of the school year. There are plenty of designs for boys (sports, dinosaurs, cars etc) and plenty of gender neutral designs (smileys, emojis, food, stars , etc) that make this easy to give girts for both boys and girls. Also, the stickers convenientely come on sheets that are inside of a plastic sleeve, which protect the stickers. The sheets would also be easy to cut in half, if you wanted to. Great for goody bags/birthdays!",

When I found these on Amazon, I knew I won the jackpot!! Each sheet comes in its own plastic sleeve. They are the right type of stickers too - puffy. You can't beat this price anywhere.

I personally like to cut the sheets up into smaller pieces, into 3 or 4 sections. My little one is only two so this helps slow her down from using them all at once. We also use them in our reusable sticker book and it's great. Sometimes the plastic front and sticky back separate when you try to pick them off for reuse, but not enough to make it significant. I got NO REPEATS out of the 80 sheets. Similar themes and styles for some but not the same. Highly recommend!",
