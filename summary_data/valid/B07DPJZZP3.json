The faces are beautifully done. I will would say it is a great starter set for little girls who love the Disney Princesses. The clothing is well made. Some clothes are interchangeable you just have to try them and see. The dolls vary in height and girth. I am pleasantly surprised at the quality For the price, especially for 12 dolls.",
