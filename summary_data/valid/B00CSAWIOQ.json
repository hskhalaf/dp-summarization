Tray needs to be attached immediately because baby/toddler is not secure with the belt staps at all. I do not have any trouble attaching tray. Cleans very easily however, the straps are a bit more difficult since they do not detach. Lots of grooves for food to get stuck in but just make sure to clean after each use and it is not an issue. Overall I could not be more happy with this seat. Saves space and does the job.",

It is a nice molded plastic and very sturdy. I have had it several months now and it is holding up very well. Plus it is easy to fold up and store when not in use.",

I wish these companies would start creating straps that are NOT fabric. If they could create something that is akin to the material used in an Apple watch strap that would be SO MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN. Everything gets stuck in those fabric straps - sauce, crumbs, everything. Being able to wipe them clean would be amazing. Instead, wiping them down just kind of seems to push the food further into the strap, staining it or making it a permanent part of the strap.",

My only warning - if you have these on a chair that has fabric, put a towel down first because crumbs and food can fall through the strap holes in the chair and you'll want to protect your chair because things will fall in there, its inevitable.

This is light weight and we placed it on a sturdy wooden chair. I didn\u2019t fell worried about it tipping over. This would be great for travel. It doesn\u2019t fold up but the tray is removable and optional if you prefer to have your little one use the table.",

Because we were staying with family whom had no children I wanted something that I could put on one of their chairs and would essentially be out of the way. My 14 month old fit it in it great and it is VERY easy to clean. Was also great to take to places that didn't have highchairs as it fits on to any chair an adult would sit in. Although we were able to ship it I would say you could fit it in a suitcase but it would take up quite a bit of room.",

I love how easy it is to remove the tray and just rinse it with water or quickly wash it with dishwashing soap. It\u2019s small enough to get into the kitchen sink and be washed without splashing too much. Such a good find!

Adjustable height means we'll probably use this til age 4, maybe even 5? (Although kid prefers to sit at little table for most meals now anyway...)",

We ended up ordering a Graco Slim Snacker and love it. It has more room for him, is padded and reclines. It also folds up easier.",

Will be the only chair we will ever need. It's definitely not fancy. No frills. But little one makes such a mess that I prefer function over form!
