Anyway, I immediately purchased the BH50020PC to replace the old one. It looks exactly like the old one, but unfortunately it's louder (and unconfidently moans when it runs), feels much cheaper, and most importantly FAR LESS POWERFUL. Why would Hoover mess with success?? My advice is to stay away from the BH50020PC. Very disappointed loyal Hoover buyer here.",

I attribute these eventual failures to carelessness. A word to the wise: If you let go of the handle while it is not upright and latched you may damage the handle when it falls to the floor. These vacuums are sturdy but not indestructible. The fact that we are buying the latest model is evidence of how much we love this vacuum.",

Instead of dragging out the big boy vacuum every time you need to vacuum ,you simply grab the Linx and walk around the house quickly cleaning carpet or hard floors as you go.

      "text": "I LOVE this vacuum cleaner. The ease of size and weight has made it a joy to vacuum. I used to procrastinate due to having to lug my vacuum up/and down 2 flights of stairs, now I use daily on the high traffic carpet regions and my entire hardwood main floor. I have three boys (two under three years of age), and there is always dirt/crumbs/etc. I have not had any issue with the battery life. This product has completely met, and exceeded, my expectations.",

Seriously, if you want something that actually works as a vaccum, look elsewhere.",

They've cleaned hundreds of homes and as we grow, so does our vacuum collection. For us, a vacuum has to have great suction, be durable, light, with no flimsy parts attached and are reasonably priced. They get abused daily and we love using them.",
