I also bought the Small /Neiko High Visibility Neon Yellow Zipper Front Safety Vest with 2 Side Pockets, ASIN/ISEA Standard, and it was exactly the size I was looking for my 13 year old skinny & tall son. This vest has velcro closures, and doesn't seem terribly durable, so I wouldn't recommend it for frequent use. However, for the price, it does the job, it's just far larger than what most people would expect for a 'small/medium'.",
