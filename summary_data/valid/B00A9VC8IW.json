Unfortunately the frying pan now does not connect fully with the hob (see pic), which obviously will impact on how well it heats on the hob.",

We were then told we could ship (at our expense) the items back for them to review and decide if they would replace them. So... we go without any pans for as long as it takes them to decide if the pans that are clearly not fit for purpose have failed?? Steer clear! We regret not reading other peoples reviews.",

The small frying pan seems to have become slightly warped - not sure why, but otherwise fine. Would have liked an extra pan - big wok-type pan would be very useful, had to buy this elsewhere.",
