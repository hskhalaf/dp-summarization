I use the product for muffins, protein pancakes, and anything else you can think of. It was hard to find for a while and now the price has gone up by 50%. THEY USE XYLITOL now. This is a more recent addition. Now it hurts my stomach, causes bloating, gas and every other nonsensical thing sugar alcohols are known to cause. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I used this for my meal prep business and went through about 25lbs a month. Now it\u2019s on to something without garbage. Check your label. Things have changed.",

MACROS: Most of the other protein powders had HIGH carbs and reviews of leftover stevia taste. Low carb, low fat, HIGH protein TASTE: No stevia taste. The peanut butter and chocolate is not very sweet and has a richer taste. I prefer this over most other chocolate powders. BLENDABILITY: This is a HUGE category for me and I didn't see enough reviews on this. Blends GREAT in both milk and water. No chunks, no chalky bits left on your teeth. Just a blended protein drink to enjoy.",

I don't make protein shakes, I always put protein in my oatmeal and do overnight oats and I eat it every day with peanut butter. 10/10 would recommend also because I have a really bad issue with whey protein since it gives me an upset stomach and gas but I don't feel that way with this protein at all.",

I have no side effects from the powder, it's easy to digest, no bloating or stomach cramps. I use it almost everyday for my morning shake or for a afternoon snack. I been using it for a year now, no complaints.",
