I want one that works without a service tech having to work on it day one. Im in the hvac industry and I know that there will always be issues with this now that its having issues with the refrigerant circuit. I belive I will just return the unit. Buyer beware!",

The temperature dropped to zero within 3 hours of being plugged in and has fluctuated, fully loaded with food, between zero and -14. It runs quietly. I love the fact that the freezer has easy to remove baskets (4) and I can see what is in it through the glass slide lids. I could not be happier with the freezer or more pleased with the shipping speed!",
