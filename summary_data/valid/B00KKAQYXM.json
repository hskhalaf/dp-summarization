It does not need an additional software for it to function. It\u2019s a plug and play. It is very comfortable to use. No complains so far. This is a level up mouse with a down grade price. My husband is going to love this mouse since he\u2019s the one who plays online. 5 glowing stars for this mouse!",

It's beautifully presented and packaged, and obviously well-made; hopefully made to last a long time. If not I will definitely buy another, and will probably keep several on hand as they are so well-made!",

I find this mouse to be very comfortable - it is somewhat large, so take that into account if you are considering it. No problems with any of the buttons or the scroll wheel, and it looks very nice next to the keyboard I bought here that also has color changing LED lights. I like that the USB cord is braided as well - I think that tends to make the cord more durable.",

      "text": "This is a good mouse if you are on a tight budget. I think the reason that I didn't like this mouse, is because I had played with an expensive mouse for the previous couple years to buying this one, and the slightly heavier weight and more programmable DPI setting may have spoiled me a little bit. I tried to play with this mouse, and I still have it as a backup in case something goes wrong, but it was just too light, and didn't have enough DPI setting for me personally.",

Overall, its a fairly basic mouse, right and left clicks, scroll wheel and scroll click, and EI forward and back buttons on the side. The mouse is NOT programmable to my knowledge. The mouse is very comfortable. If you are looking for looks and comfort, this is a great choice, if you are looking for function, I would spend a little bit more money and buy a mouse that is programmable.",

It also feels cheaply made, and has almost no weight to it. All in all, there are MUCH better discount gaming mice on the market for comparable prices.

I know this is a gaming mouse and I am not really a gamer I just wanted a RGB mouse for casual use...but for cause use this mouse is perfect and the clicks are just right!",

      "text": "For the price this is a great mouse, especially if you have larger hands like me. It glides smoothly across a mouse pad, had adjustable DPI settings (via the little button right behind the scroll wheel), and had a pleasing array of vivid colors that it scrolls through. I have had several compliments from people, as the scrolling colors grans their attention. It would be nice (and should be fairly easy) to add the option to stick with one color or scroll through all colors, hence 4 of 5 stars, but the button positions, size of the mouse, plug-and-play ease of use, and adjustable DPI settings make this a great buy for the price.",

The only drawbacks are that the plastic over the buttons is rather thin so it may wear quickly, but time will tell, and the finish is a slightly textured plastic that feels very slick in my hand. Another thing to consider is that if you have gorilla hands like I do then this may not be the mouse for you. It's nice and large, but the grooves on the sides are fairly narrow for me so my thumb doesn't fit in it which makes for a rather awkward grip.",

The only other quibbles I have are that there are no instructions with the mouse explaining what the small button under the wheel does (it seems to change both the light color and the mouse speed). A little slip of paper mentioning this would be more useful than the \"I like it/I don't like it\" card enclosed in the box.",
