We really like it for the yogurt but it would be a lot easier to make if it had a temperature monitoring function.

      "text": "Although it does many things, pressure cooking is what I mainly use the Instant Pot for. It can be programmed to perform a series of functions on its own. The Bluetooth feature on the Smartpot allows me to write recipes using the app and then just tap Start and watch the progress from up to 30 feet away. I feel the Smartpot is worth the difference in price from the standard Instant Pot, but it is rather pricey. The Instant Pot is also the only way I will \"boil\" eggs from now on. The shell peels extremely easy every time.",

I can make anything in this that I can make in a crockpot and its done and ready in 90 minutes or less! I do wish it was slightly bigger. I like to cook large amounts so I can freeze some. But really, with as fast as this cooks, you can still cook two batches of whatever in less time than it would take to make one in the crock pot.",

I will be getting in touch with the Company to see what they say, but it is supposed to be stainless steel.. it is thick, and looks like its stainless steel.. but not sure how or why the stains and discoloration got there . And I can not get them out. That is weird for stainless steel.",
