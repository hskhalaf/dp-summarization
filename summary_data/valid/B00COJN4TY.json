And if I was just doing stills I'd prefer a manual focus design lens. So the focusing capabilities are neither here nor there, so I'm sad to say I'm returning this lens",

      "title": "Great Optics with a very big flaw",
      "text": "This lens on my A7r produces excellent photos just as the reviews said it would, However, it has a flaw on practically all Sony NEX cameras. It constantly hunts for focus even though the camera does not request it. Many other users have commented on this behavior on Dpreview . The only way to use the lens is to put the camera into manual focus and either take it into auto focus when you want to take a photo or learn to manually focus things, which turns out to be quite easy. This flaw is something Zeiss should fix since they are not interpreting the E-mount spec correctly.",

Took it to the local camera shop and they put it on their A6000 and it did the same thing. Defective from the box. Sending it back. Maybe the next one I get will be better.",
