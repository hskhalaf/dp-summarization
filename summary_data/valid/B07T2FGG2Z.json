The cable melted, the metal connector deformed, a toxic-like smell was release. The entire device was too hot to touch. I believe if it was left any longer it would have cause fire. Context: The device was connected to a standard IKEA charger with a standard cable. Both have been used on with many other devices without any trouble. There were no environmental factors: no direct sunlight, ambient temp was less then 25oC, the device was not covered and not near any other devices. UPDATE: I re-ordered the earphones. The replacement has been fine so far",

With noise cancelling on you really feel isolated from your surroundings. Not with these Sony headphones. I had read many expert reviews and wonder whether they had been reviewing the same headphones. Sound quality is great, but I paid for a pair of noise cancelling headphones which these aren't.

If your on the fence as to buy or not I would buy again, the battery life is ace! Being able to use the right bud while the left is charging and then alternate gives these buds a long days use!

On both phones there was intermittent clipping sounds on all the music I played. The App was already there as I have other Sony headphones and bluetooth works just fine on them. Not these though. I uninstalled my app on both phones and updated the software to no avail. Am returning them today. They sounded good, but even then there was a slight up and down and wavering in and out of sound volume. I would not recommend, even at the lower price of \u00a3194 I paid.",

    "description": "Colour Name:Black| Style Name:SingleIntroducing the Sony WF-1000XM3 premium wireless noise cancelling headphones. Sony has taken the industry leading QN1 noise cancelling processor from their award winning WH-1000XM3 and updated it to a new QN1e, to produce the new WF 1000XM3. The brand new QN1e processor boosts the range of frequencies from which noise-cancellation occurs, giving you full control over the sounds you want to block out whilst listening to your music. That means it's never been easier to take the bustle out of travel and immerse yourself in sound. On top of that, the WF1000XM3 comes with Adaptive Sound Control to optimise listening settings automatically based on your behaviour and environment. The earbuds last for up to 8 hours on a single charge when not using noise cancellation, or 6 hours with noise cancellation. They come with a stylish portable carrying case, which will protect the earbuds when you\u2019re on the move and give an additional three charges And if you\u2019re in a hurry, you can get 90 minutes\u2019 use after just 10 minutes of charge. With the latest in Bluetooth technology, the WF1000XM3 can connect each earbud to your device individually. This allows for a more stable connection, with a faster response time meaning that your audio will sync perfectly with what you see on your device. Perfect for watching the latest show on your daily commute. Sony recommends you always update your devices with their latest available software. Software update notifications for WF-1000XM3, and the updates themselves, are delivered via the Sony Headphones Connect app, available free of charge on the Google Play and Apple App Store.",
