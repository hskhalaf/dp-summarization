This is probably due to my weight and the fact that the soft soul is what makes them so comfortable. They are consistently sized and very well made, I replace the insole with a Dr. Scholls which has more arch support, the insole last through 2 to 3 pair of shoes. The factory insole is fine, I just have a very high arch and require something extra. I would recommend them to anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet.",

They are ULTRA lightweight. I wish there was a little more arch support but inserts can help with that. They were not that expensive and they are really comfortable. I have only had them a week so I cannot speak to durability--but if I limit them to sporadic wear I am hopeful that they will last at least a couple of years.",
