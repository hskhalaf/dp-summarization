This is great if using a full size grill. I however, travel with my 18\" Weber and this compact starter is perfect and takes up much less room. I also use it when I only need 10 or so briquettes for slow smoking. I haven't noticed the handle getting hot because I use gloves when handling these starters and I think everyone should to avoid burns. Recommended.

Be patient and let it do it's job for 20-30 minutes, once it's done, simply dump into the grill and cook. If you need more charcoal than the chimney fits, I find it worthwhile to simply stack some unlit charcoal in the grill first, dump the ready charcoal from the chimey across the unlit charcoal and simply give it another 15-25 minutes to spread the fire across the unlit coals, and then cook. Great device, save money on eliminating the need for lighter fluid and eliminate the taste of the fluid getting to your food.",

Be sure when crumpling your newsprint to leave some air room--if it's wadded up too tight it doesn't burn!",

So buyer beware. If you don't mind heating a 2nd batch of coals and delaying your BBQ by 1/2 hour, then this is the chimney for you. On the other hand, I ended up buying the larger chimney which produces enough hot coals to cover the area of this small grill in one fell swoop.",

I have a Weber kettle grill and a big smoker and use the big one of these with regular charcoal and wood and it works great. I also received recently a kamado grill similar to big green egg and use coconut charcoal but only 4 or 5 chunks at a time. The big one fails miserably for that but this little guy works great for this task. Love to multitask tools but for this I need both. Thanks Weber for making size specific. This also would work great for tailgating and small smokey joe.",
