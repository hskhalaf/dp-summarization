She's a bit small for the monkey bars but she can easily play on everything else. Love that I won't have to paint it. Another reviewer suggested putting clear caulking aroun the base of legs where they pop into a plastic cap. We also did that to prevent water getting into the metal legs. Definitely recommend this one.",

The only thing is that you need to go around and tighten all the bolts occasionally. This is just a side effect of something that moves back and forth all the time.

We have had 4 swingsets one was like this one but a different brand but this one is better. For us it was pricey but well worth it. I believe it will last for years and years! The grips on the swings are heavy duty so littles cant bite through it. Only thing i didnt like is how close the swings are but it doesnt matter much for us. Took me about 4 hours by myself to set this up. Love it!!",

From what I read the wooden ones take several days to assemble and the wood can split when you tighten screws. This is also a heavier swing set and more wind resistant than wooden ones. My neighbor's wooden swingset has been blown over, but this one will definitely stay in place, it has anchors. I also attached a baby swing with ease.",

Husband has an almost 3 y/o grandson who doesn't seem to enjoy it much yet, but I know it will hold up for many years to come when he's bigger.

The only thing I am concerned about is when the children swing, there is some give to the main top bar that holds the swings and trapeze. If the \"give\" I'm talking about is part of the design that makes it stronger, then it would be nice if the manufacturer informed the customer of this.

It is perfect for our three and they love it. It is very solidly made and even my wife and I can swing with the kids and it seems very stable and barely moves. We are extremely satisfied and would highly recommend this to other families with similar situations and needs.",

As a result, when the last one died we decided to look for one which was more durable that our previous sets. This one has very adequately met our expectations. Although pricier than a lot of others, the quality is worth the difference. The instructions are clear and there were no missing parts. Many steps require two people but the assembly process is not difficult. We are very satisfied.",
