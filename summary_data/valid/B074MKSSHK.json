This is the most comfortable brace that I've owned. It fits either hand beautifully. I have beefy arms, and I was worried that this wouldn't fit. It's just fine. There is a little bean bag just under your fingers at the top of the brace. It cushions your fingers when they bend at night. I really like this feature. I recommend this brace for those of you who have carpal tunnel pain.",

This brace is just the right amount of support without being ridiculously restrictive or tight. The Velcro does not come loose and it allows me to sleep without the awful burning and tingling sensation that every carpal tunnel sufferer dreads. The material is nice and soft, and it adjusts easily while remaining secure throughout the night. After many unsuccessful treatments including surgery and cortisone injections, having an effective support brace is the only thing that prevents me from waking up every hour in pain. This one does the job.",

It\u2019s very easy to put on, cozy and comfortable to sleep in and I love that it can work for either hand. I\u2019m not sure if it was because of using this brace or a combination of that and taking a break from some of the things that were irritating it (hot yoga, mountain biking), but my wrist pain and numbness is now gone. I am so grateful! Whenever I feel a slight ache in either wrist, I sleep with this brace and things are back to normal the next day.",

It hurt so much it was all I could do not to scream. With this brace on every night, that doesn't happen anymore. What a relief and improvement in my sleep. A great product. Good price.
