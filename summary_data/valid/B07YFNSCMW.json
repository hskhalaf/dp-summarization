I would like to have a high flow setting I can use while the car is running. More vent holes. Summary: For high pollution areas this filter is not enough if that is what you are looking for. For the price this is extremely well made. Its almost like a piece of art. I would like to be able to increase the pull of the fans. I'd be willing to pay more for this. The filter is massive and could handle much more air flow. This is a very low key passive filter.",

After the easy set up we added a lemon essential oil and BAM. After a few days the smell was gone and there was a nice clean smelling car!",

Definitely made a difference after a day, and a week later I don't notice any smokey scent at all unless I really shove my nose in the fabric. Sound level is quiet, slightly louder than I expected, but excellent for a vehicle space. Worth every penny to me.",

This filter does an excellent job of clearing out small areas (a room in a house) for personal breathing safety. What I find most interesting is the subtle noise made by the vacuum effect, remarkably similar to the sound made by an 8hz binaural I use to meditate. Is it a stable field emitter? Possibly, it certainly seems to produce subsonic vibrations that harmonically stack into a stable background note. I don't know for sure, but I'd wager that this technology could be used to counteract dissonant microwave fields.",

I may wind up going through filters fast though as my original one is getting dark fast, but it's working harder than its intended use. Side note, I've forgotten to unplug it a couple of times and it was on overnight and the truck started fine, but it also has two batteries.",

It\u2019s easy to use, it works just by plugging it to the USB port, it\u2019s not really that loud but you could hear it. Too big if you\u2019re concern about style but the filter looks good, however you barely see any hair inside of the filter, but this happens with my other house filters so I don\u2019t really know if the fact that you don\u2019t see many hairs inside of the filter means that it\u2019s working or not. It light\u2019s up blue so thats cool and it\u2019s really not heavy nor delicate.",
