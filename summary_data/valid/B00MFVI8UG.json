Once it was installed, he likes that you can choose how fast it charges. He keeps it on 2 hours and it charges his car fully in that amount of time. It is quiet and I like that is lights up so you know that it is charging.",

I have 2 criticisms: The unit itself is very high quality (our electrician was impressed), but the mounting plate seems a bit cheesy. Second, if you pause the charger to disconnect a vehicle, say to run a quick errand, the charger will not start automatically when you plug it back in again- you need to press the pause button a second time. Both very minor concerns- I'd still highly recommend this charger.",

      "text": "Using it to charge a 2014 Nissan Leaf SL we purchased used a week ago. So far no problems. I ran the circuit myself using 8/2 Romex ($1.50/ft) and a 40A breaker ($9) purchased from Lowes. It was a \"used Amazon Wearhouse Deal\" and advertised with noticeable scratches but the product that arrived looked absolutely brand new. Using the 110V charger now seems crazy going from 20hrs to 4hrs if it needs a complete charge. The 110V trickle charger will go in the trunk in case we get stranded away from home or a public L2 charger. Now the wife has an excuse to park in the wood shop again. :)",

    "title": "Siemens US2:VC30GRYHW VersiCharge Hard-Wired (VC30GRYHW) : Fast Charging, Easy Installation, Flexible Control, Award Winning, UL Listed, J1772 Compatibility, 14ft Cable, Hard-Wired",
    "description": "Material Type:New\n\nSIEMENS VC30GRYHW VERSICHARGE 30-AMP ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGER\n SIEMENS VERSICHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGERS\nFounded more than 165 years ago, Siemens is a worldwide industry leader in electronics and electrical engineering, dedicated to innovation, quality, and reliability in the fields of energy, industry, and healthcare. Standing for technological excellence and delivering infrastructure solutions, Siemens is the world\u2019s chief supplier of environmental technologies, with about 40 percent of its total revenue coming from green products and solutions. VersiCharge is just one more best in class product in the green energy sector to be developed by Siemens.\n\nVersiCharge is available in plug in (VC30GRU) and hard wired options (VC30GRHW) VersiCharge makes it easier than ever to incorporate energy efficient practices into your home  VERSICHARGE SELECTION\nThe Siemens 30-A Level II VersiCharge electric vehicle charger is available in two configurations \u2013 Hardwire for indoor use only (VC30GRYHW) and Universal which can be used indoors and outside (VC30GRYU). The Universal unit arrives ready to plug in for use into a 240V receptacle and is easily attachable to most surfaces with the provided mounting bracket.\n\n CHARGING CONVENIENCE\nMost EV batteries will be charged from zero to full in less than 3.5 hours, leaving plenty of time to delay your charge by 2-8 hours with the easy to use time of charge delay feature on the unit. Additional features like the status indicating LED Halo visible from a distance and a clean cord management solution will leave you even more satisfied when you get into your fully charged EV every day.\n\n CHOOSE WHICHEVER INSTALLATION IS RIGHT FOR YOU\nThe Universal VersiCharge is equipped with a plug and cord assembly which can either be plugged into a suitably sized double-gang receptacle below or behind the unit. The plug and cord assembly can be detached from the unit for a hardwired installation. For an indoor only hardwire application, we recommend the more cost effective VersiCharge hardwire version (VC30GRYHW). Not only does this easy plug and play installation enable you to take your VersiCharge on the road with you, but it comes equipped with a mounting bracket and other hardware for permanent installation at home in your garage, carport, or parking pad. The weatherproof NEMA 4 enclosure, made of 60 percent recycled material with matte finish, is designed to withstand the elements no matter its location. The unit\u2019s standard SAE J1772 connector is ergonomic for user comfort and an integrated holster keeps debris and dust out of the plug for clean and convenient usage. The attached 20-foot cord (14 foot for Hardwire only) wraps over the top of the enclosure for expedient, clean storage.\n\n MAKING ENERGY EFFICIENCY EASY\nThe VersiCharge is jam packed with user-friendly features that make it easier than ever to efficiently and economically charge your electric vehicle. Monitor the status of your vehicle\u2019s charge with help from the LED color indication halo that\u2019s visible from across the garage and displays the stage at which your charge stands, from ready to charge to charging to fully charged. As demand response utility plans increase in popularity, inquire with your utility about utilizing the VersiCharge low voltage connection to enroll your charger in potential savings programs offered by your utility. Further adjust charging status to specifically fit your schedule and electricity bill budget with help from the delay timer functionality, which allows you to postpone charging for up to eight hours from the time of plug-in with the press of a button. Regardless of when you choose to charge, the VersiCharge power output can be adjusted to complement the outlet\u2019s capability, ranging in increments from a maximum power setting of 7.2 kW to 1.8 kW. Plus, by delivering adjustable, extended amperage options, the VersiCharge keeps up with evolving electric vehicle technology, helping to future proof compatibility over time. If you are looking for speed, please refer to the table below to compare the amount of miles charged in a certain time period by your VersiCharge over a Level I charger and other seemingly competitive products.\n\nVersiCharge is a Level 2, 30 Amp Max charger, providing the fastest level of charging  WHAT IS IN THE BOX\nOne Siemens 30-amp VersiCharge electric vehicle charger, one mounting bracket, and a digital manual on reusable USB stick. 240V receptacle that mounts in the wall of the home NOT included and must be purchased separately from a receptacle manufacturer.\n\n\n HIGHLIGHTS\n * Compatible with all plug-in electric vehicles (SAE J1772 vehicle plug)\n * 30-amp, 240-volt Level II charging capability cuts charge time in half versus Level I\n * User-friendly installation, design, and functionality\n * Flexible wiring options\u2014bottom-fed and rear-fed\u2014for flexible configuration\n * Dimensions: 16.5 inches by 16.5 inches by 6.5 inches; weighs 21 pounds\n * Demand Response capability to take advantage of utility savings programs\n * Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed for quality standards",
