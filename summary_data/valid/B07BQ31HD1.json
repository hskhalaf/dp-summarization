That is why I gave it a 4-star rather than a 5-star rating. Good thing is that it is easy enough to correct. Thought I had ruined it, but found that cleaning and thoroughly drying out returns it back to normal.",

I wish it cycled a bit longer to enjoy the scents a bit longer before refilling the water and oils. Other than that, this is a great product!",
