She did come with 2 light (Caucasian) wig caps, which was kinda shocking because most wigs come with black or dark brown( black girl friendly) caps. She did tangle but that is to be expected from a synthetic wig but she seems to be a good buy so fare.",

I wish it was easier changing the part since i dont wear my hair down the middle. Looks very cute, but don't get too close. You'll deffinantly be able to tell it's a wig, so I wear a headband",

It can look like your natural hair if you style it right, plus it\u2019s easy to do different hair style & it not look fake. A couple of people even thought I had put in extensions.

I think if you were a medium to deep skin tone it could work, but on my pastey butt if just looked laughably fake. When it says \u201cminimum tangle\u201d, I think that holds up- tangles happen but are easily fixed and never matted. Shipping was also late, which is a consistent review I have seen for this piece.",

I did trim the \"bangs\" a bit to help it frame my face. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!",

I wore it to a baseball game and got so many compliments on it and everyone thought it was real",
