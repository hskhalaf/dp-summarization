Nothing horrible and it resolved after a week. I haven't done over a 12 mile run in them yet but no problems. Similar feel to Hokas.",

      "text": "I started hiking with the altra Olympus 2.0 last summer after my old brand cause the loss of both tour nails on my descent of mount defiance. Worn them ever since. I stand on concrete at work all day. I suffered from major foot pain. I then got my altra mens 3.0 running shoe and all my foot pain went away. There is only one thing i don't like about the shoe is the glued on tread pads come off but i fixed that with some good super glue as they started too lift up. I would recommend altra shoes to everyone. I won't ever buy another shoe!!!!",

Other Altra all have a tongue connected to shoe for 1/2 its length to ensure it stays in place. Not sure what they were thinking to do free floating tongue.",
