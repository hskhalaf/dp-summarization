I previously had a similar item for years (batteries leaked and made a mess of it) and we used it not just for grilling but when the power went out, clamped it to the table to provide enough light to move around the house in the dark or to read to pass the time. This newer one seems even brighter. I plan to get much use from it.",

The magnetic base with the \"clamp on\" option makes it extremely versatile; as evidenced by the use on two different products. The \"goose neck\" is also a great feature that I find myself using quite a bit. Once I find a good location for the mount, it's easy to adjust the goose neck so that the lamp doesn't interfere with lid opening and closings. Very well constructed with solid material. Additionally, higher heat is not a concern for me when using this grill light.",

The light is very bright and the goose neck is a good length since I have to clamp it on the end of the grill handle. Other commenters have stated there is a problem with moister corroding the battery contacts so I bring mine in after each use. So far no problems! Seems like a quality product for the price! Excellent!",

He was always having issues seeing inside the grill and needing to use his phone flashlight propped somewhere on the grill so I thought this would be a great purchase and it was. There is a powerful magnet on the bottom so you can prop it anywhere on the grill and the neck moves so you can point the light wherever you want it. The light is SUPER bright and lights up the whole back patio! It was a great purchase for a great price.",
