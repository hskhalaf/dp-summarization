I even have a picture of the tap water that the people of the town drink and how this straw filters out the rock, cloudiness, and smell from the water.

      "text": "I bought this as a gift for my survival-enthusiastic husband and he loves it. Here is why: - This filters down to one micron, which is better filtration than the Lifestraw and makes drinking water safer - It has multiple purposes with the whistle, compass, mirror, and the tourniquet - You can actually screw it onto a water bottle to drink. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I tried three different brands of water bottles around the house before I got it to fit on one right. Squeezing the water thru the filter was a little hard at first but once the water started flowing it worked well. I back flushed it and let it dry out for a day before packing it in my bag for my upcoming trip to Big Bend. The extra compass, mirror and whistle are OK, but had no effect on my purchase decision. It is nice and light at 106 grams in the package (90 grams as pictured). I like that there are no extra parts or complicated procedures to follow.",
