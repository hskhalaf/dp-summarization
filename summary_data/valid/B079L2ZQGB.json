Food comes out crispy on the outside and tender inside. Love using it for salmon. There is nothing like frying in oil, so for items like french fries and sweet potato fries, it works well, but food will be different density than real oily fries. Air fried food is physically lighter.",

Also need ventilation for high fat foods, as this will cause a lot of smoke. All high fat cooking will though. I bought a very popular cheaper brand (gowise) first that had far more features, but it felt cheap... And broke during my first use. Also, two weeks later they are still pending my refund. I plan on using this often so I'm willing to get through the learning curve. I'll update as I use it more.",

I am going to try one more time and if it doesn't work out will return it :( :( Does anyone have Twin Turbostar Airfryer",
