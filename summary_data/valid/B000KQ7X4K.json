One more thing if you're listening, Pureology, could you please make the font size larger for SHAMPOO and also for the CONDITIONER? People who wear glasses can't tell one from the other in the shower.",

I've tried this is the only shampoo that leaves my hair soft and silky. It definitely is pricey, but a little goes a long way- all you need is about an amount a little larger than a quarter (for my hair, way less if your hair isn't thick). Finally, the scent smells so good!",

I wanted to stop using shampoos with sulfates and I was given a sample of this shampoo and I never went back. The price is intimidating but the bottle will last me about 2 years washing about 3 times a week, so that breaks down to a few dollars a month. I love being able to order through Amazon so I don't risk spending a bunch of money by walking into a beauty store.",
