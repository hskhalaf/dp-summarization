Also, the designers should have considered adding pegs to the underside of his shoes and include a stand for him, like they do for some of the funko pop figures. All in all, the designers should have known better, it's obvious this figure had design flaws.",

There was another review that mentions his arms bending forward after some time, and I also found this to be true, unfortunately. An easy way to fix this is to apply a tiny bit of super glue at the point where the rainbow meets his forehead, with a toothpick. Fixes this issue perfectly. It is unfortunate that I had to do this, but it was little effort, and now I have a wonderful spongebob figure.",
