A 'phantom touch' issue, where the screen resizes and tabs switch constantly as though a ghost is swiping your screen. I got a replacement unit and it had the SAME issue. Samsung has not been helpful in getting this fixed. It makes the ENTIRE device unusable. Ridiculous for something so expensive, some internet research shows numerous people having this issue. Meaning it's not isolated. Save yourself the trouble. Get a non-Samsung Chromebook. It's not worth it.",

      "text": "Used it 5 times... tonight it crashed and started a reboot sequence which ended it up with the screen going black. Then the only thing would work was the power light. Tried numerous times to do a recovery, but the screen would come on sporadically and appear digitized with missing bits (Video card issue). Recovery window came up twice then the screen went black again. Tried for two hours to get it to turn on again and then gave up and asked for a refund. Samsung's hardware issues are apparently not limited to their phones.",
