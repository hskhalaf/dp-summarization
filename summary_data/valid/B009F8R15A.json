At least not for someone with broad shoulders and a lean, athletic body. The white shirt is pretty thin and seeing through, so not a spectacular quality all over. The quality and the misleading fit do not match the $25.99 value. Buy it only for emergencies... like I had too.",

So I then purchased the same shirt in black (Van Heusen Men's Fitted Poplin Dress Shirt, Black, 16 34-35) and the sleeves were a full inch shorter and doesn't fit. Seems odd that the same shirt ordered in the same size from the same company would turn out to be differently sized. Weird.",

It's not a terrible shirt for the money, but if you want a real slim fit, be prepared to visit your tailor.",
