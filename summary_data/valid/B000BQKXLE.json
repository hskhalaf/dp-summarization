No longer do I fear getting sliced by my tape measure! To retract it, gently press on the large green button. It is US measurement only. I\u2019d have liked a combo with metric, but it is easy to convert inches to centimeters. I like it!",

As long as Komelon continues to put forth quality tools and a decent price point, I will continue to be a customer. Definitely Recommend!",

This one is more like they mixed the green with a standard yellow tape and this is what happened. Thankfully the color doesn't interfere with what is a great tape measure",

It fits the hand naturally as well, with a soft rubber grip. Addition: the markings' length difference between 1/16th, 1/8th, & 1/4 are substantial and greater than some other tapes I have, which makes it very easy to read quickly.",

The bright color makes it easy to find. I ended up buying an additional one for myself. Watch the pricing because it is much higher for 2 blades than buying them each individually.",

The tape measure snapped and came completely out. I emailed the company per its website describing the issue and have had no response. Had it happened at 25 feet I would not be writing this review. Too much time spent already on this bad $10 item. Faulty tape measure and zero customer service.",

Would strongly advise going with the regular old manual lock-out and avoid gimmicks that are susceptible to critical failure that could render them completely useless.",

It doesn't grab as tightly after a while. Had the first one for years until I left it at home depot. I got used to it slowly releasing, maybe like an eighth of an inch per second. Wasn't enough to deter me from getting another one, keeping the current one cleaner and the lock is working well. Great deal, paid full price.",
