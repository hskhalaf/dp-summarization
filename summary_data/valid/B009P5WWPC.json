      "text": "My Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX HD had great battery life (up to 4 days of light use) when I purchased it which decreased rapidly over time to the point that even with moderate use the battery couldn't make it through the day. Then after about a year the camera started malfunctioning (\"Camera Can Not Initialize\") and a month or so after that it just started rebooting itself randomly (even in the middle of phone calls). I purchased this phone based on good reviews and the claims of good battery life. I'm not even at the 2 year mark and the phone is almost worthless. I won't be buying a Motorola phone again any time soon.",

Returned both of the phones and purchased another Droid razr maxx(my 5th droid razr maxx) and it too has microphone issues. There must have been a batch of phones from the factory with bad microphones and thats what the suppliers on amazon currently have. I love the Droid razr maxx but I may have to switch to a different phone if the basic features don't work.",

My wife likes it, is happy with the features, speed, camera, durability, just about everything. Only issue.... It requires periodic hard boots (using the power and volume down keys - hence it lost a star). No rhyme nor reason for us to track this issue. She says the phone has way more capability than she has the time to learn to use properly, but that was the same for her Droid X.",

Have not activated it yet through carrier, hopefully that is a breeze! As far as phone condition it was pretty decent and would buy from this seller again if in a bind like I am now! No scratches on screen. Only the small blemishes that can be covered up by a phone case anyway!",

I have tested the RAZR MAXX HD doing GPS for 2 hours and 2 hours using the phone as a Hot Spot Internet connection before it ran low on battery power. Much superior compared to previous phone. I have little doubt the phone will run out of power when receiving GPS directions when plugged into 12 Volt power in a vehicle as the Charge phone did.",

Feels good and looks good. I highly recommend this phone.",
