      "text": "Great for running and other sports, sound quality is good although if your wanting isolation like other in ear buds these aren't the best. Because I cannot keep the in ear buds sealed in my ear for very long I find that these are the best alternative, retaining good audio quality. Wind noise and traffic can still be heard while wearing these so not the best in very loud scenarios. The headphone work seamlessly and I love being able to only use one headphone at a time.",

The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they sometimes cut the sound off when looking down, though that reminds me that my running posture is incorrect so might not be such a bad thing overall.",

      "text": "These headphones did not fit securely in my ears. Tried the different attachments but still loose. Have had many in ear hook headphones before with no issues. Think it must be the shape of the buds and the faxt they do not sit in the ear properly. Also what was disappointing was the volume on these. I did not expect them to be as high as wired or the wired bluetooth ones I have had in the past, however there was a big difference. Maybe this pair was faulty. I have returned them and will probably go for a beats pro high performance.",

The fit is comfortable, on the medium-sized fittings. The standard sound option is very good, with a rich sound and excellent noise cancellation. The app works well, giving the option to turn on and off 'awareness' mode, reducing the noise cancellation, and adjust the sound profile. I've used these for exercise and they were secure in place. The only potential negative is the size of the buds, although I don't mind this.",
