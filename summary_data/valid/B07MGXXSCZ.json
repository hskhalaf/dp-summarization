The shoes stayed in place well which is a huge advantage. My reason for 4 stars & not 5 is that these may not be sufficient for walking on harsher surfaces. We have many oyster beds here and I would prefer more protection around the edges of my foot for oystering. But for sailing and general water use, these are very nice so far. Thank you.",

      "text": "I have never purchased a water shoe but needed one for our upcoming cruise. I normally wear a 9 M or 8.5 W, but based on the reviews saying how large these run, I purchased an 8 and it fits perfectly. The width is very comfortable for my wider feet, the length is absolutely perfect. Best of all, the sole is surprisingly supportive and extremely comfortable to walk in. I almost wonder if I couldn't wear these for moderate walking during the entire excursion, they're so comfy! Highly recommend, pay close attention to the fit reviews and definitely go down either 1/2 or 1 full size from what you typically wear.",

They were super comfortable to wear on the beach, snorkeling, climbing wet rocks, hiking through trees and vegetation .... and love the look of them with my suit too! They drain well so your feet don't stay wet. I noted a few comments about the shoes not having a good grip. As long as I wasn't walking on algae-covered rocks, they did great. Beach sand didn't get into the edging of the shoe which can rub and cause blisters. I did have to rinse the shoes 2 or 3 times to get allot of the sand out when I was done, but all in all this shoe ROCKS!",
