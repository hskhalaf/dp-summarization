Couldn't find better specs for the price (CPU/RAM/SSD wise) Really good performance (No hard core gaming of course, I got this just as a backup to run some simulations and this laptop doesn't break a sweat, whereas my macbook air does), Light Weight (of course its not macbook-like, but it isn't heavy), decent battery life. I'm happy with this laptop.",
