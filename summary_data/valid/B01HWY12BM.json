Oddly, I had already given them that information in the original request form, but I supplied it anyways. After that, they never got back to me. I attempted to contact them multiple times, and was ignored. So, at the end of the day, don't expect them to honor the warranty. Because in my experience, they simply won't.",

The zip-seal is effective, but sealing it with my fingers was a little easier than using the plastic \"closer\" thingy. Not a huge deal, though.

I use them for out of season apparel, bedding not being used - HUGE deal for me. I like to switch out my comforters and bedding to the seasons and if I didn't have these bags, I would not have room to store my bedding that is out of season. LOVE these!",

The real test was when I went on a month-long trip abroad, where I was NOT settled in one place, and we were moving to a new place every 2-3 days, which means I had to use the manual pump frequently. Thankfully I had absolutely no problems with any of the plastic bags or the pump! Also, I was able to pack enough clothes for an entire month without the NEED to do any laundry, while my friends had to do their laundry at least once a week even though their bags seemed as fully-packed as mine was!",

I then noticed a nylon outer down vest was right under the circular vent - moved it down and it worked fine. So don't put anything nylon or not breathable next to the cap area.",
