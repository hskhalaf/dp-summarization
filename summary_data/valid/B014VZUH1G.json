This is clearly an old tube of lipstick I recall the same issue happening when Burt's Bees first released their lip line but since then they've updated their formula and I haven't noticed this so this has to be old stock. I am very disappointed and would not recommend!",

I have to apply it all over fairly heavily to get a good coat, then dab it off to get the look I want. That said, the shade looks dark and natural at the same time and is a good, dark shade of red.

It really helps the review if you mention what color you bought because sometimes Amazon doesn't show that info to the reader. Lily Lake is a slightly warm mauve-ish color. I like it a lot. The formula is moisturizing but stays on pretty well for a natural lipstick. Taking off one star because the tube is awkward. It doesn't spin up evenly, almost like it's slightly tilted in the tube.",
