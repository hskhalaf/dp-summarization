They looked fine, but did not seem suited for a lot of walking comfort wise. Also they run big, I wear 8.5 and got a 9 based on reviews and it was huge on me even with thick socks.",

There\u2019s plenty of room for socks or if I\u2019m only wearing trouser socks with dress slacks or a dress to work. The navy blue will match my light blue coat beautifully!

      "text": "These boots are great! I am a size 8 and the 8 fits pretty true. I can see why people say they are a little snug but they fit me just fine and any bigger would be loose and sloppy. They aren't high-quality, leather boots but they are cute and I've been asked twice if they are Sorels. Michigan winter has been pretty dry so far, but the puddles and the rain haven't permeated the boot yet. I'm taking them to Canada next week so we will see how they hold up. Overall, you can't beat the $30 price tag for a decent pair of boots! Very happy with my purchase.",

The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are new and so I want to see how they hold up this winter season. I may come back to this review and update.",

      "text": "Full boot review: I have a fat foot and these boots have ample space. They do not cut across the top of my foot where I feel my foot is suffocating much less cutting of circulation. The boots runs a little small (I'm 9.5, ordered a 10 and happy I did). I have put them to the test and wore them out in the rain and walked into puddles of water. My feet were warm and dry. They are stylish (per say) and have received several compliments from friends and strangers alike.",

      "text": "I would have given these boots a 5 except for the slightly snug fit. They are about a 1/2 size smaller than expected. A 10 is the largest shoe size I wear and then ONLY in a boot, with very thick socks. These are 10s and 11s swallow me whole. They are too snug for a thick sock so here's hoping I won't need a thick sock! Otherwise, they are stunningly beautiful for snow boots! They look and feel like boots that cost over $100. Very comfy, lined throughout. Can't wait for snow!",

But if I got a smaller size, my big toe wouldn't have enough space...",
