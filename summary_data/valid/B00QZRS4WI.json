It didn't take him long to figure out how to ride it and within hours he was flying down our driveway (it has a slight decline) and along the sidewalk. Our son rarely uses the footrest, he usually just spreads his legs apart. This bike was much more affordable than other balance bike, so we were a little apprehensive about its quality. But as soon as we received it we were relieved that it exceeded our expectations!",

The foot board is excellent. Highly adjustable. All the way up for my tall girl. Lil sis will have it all the way down next year ;)",
