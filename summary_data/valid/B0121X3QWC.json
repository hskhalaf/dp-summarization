Maybe the manufacturers are trying to be environmentally conscious, but I think a refillable plastic tube is worth exploring -- so only refills could be sold in cardboard. There's something about the dry plug of product scraping past the cardboard when in use that makes my skin crawl, same as when I wipe a wooden spoon with a dishtowel. Just me? Probably. I appreciate the all-natural (and minimal) ingredients, and I think the product could smell delicious except the cardboard is the dominant smell.",

I don't know why, I have never had any kind of allergies, but in some point before I go in to the water It stings, I think is when It dries. Another detail is the color. Because I'm brown skin when I trie to take it off I get like a pale sick color. At first I thought It wasn't working and the sun was damaging my sky but then I realized It was the lilac color it has. Dispite this details it woks for what I wanted, a strong sunscreen for surfing.",
