Unfortunately, that's where it all stops. Data passthrough is almost non-existent. 90% of the time it's at zero. No data. The other 10% of the time it passes data very slow and intermittently. This happens regardless of where it is located. Many reboots and re-installs always ended up with the same results - unuseable. Replaced it with a TP-Link Range extender for $24.99 (half the price of the Linksys RE6250), placed in the exact same spot and the TP-Link works perfectly. The Linksys was a waste of $50.",

I went with the second installation process which entailed getting the unit in the same room as the WiFi router and pressing a button on each device within two minutes.
