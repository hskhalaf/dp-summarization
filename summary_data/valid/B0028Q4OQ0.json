      "text": "I love this clay for several reasons: It's a medium hold, so my hair still moves without breaking the hold like gel does, and it's a matte surface, so my hair doesn't look constantly wet. I have very fine hair, so I only need a few dabs to get everything held in place, and it doesn't glue my hair to my head, so I still get good volume. If you have medium-to-fine hair and want something matte to do the side-part hairstyle with minimal maintenance, I highly recommend the Aveda Grooming Clay. It is kind of expensive, but also one pot lasts me several months, so it's not too bad. Your mileage may vary.",

I particularly like that it's water-based and washes out and off your hands with just water, hate the oily residue types you can buy from other cheaper brands.
