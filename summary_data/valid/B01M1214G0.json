However my old case was kinda looking ratty and I wanted something a little more colorful and not as bulky. So I went out on a whim and bought this one. I'm very clumsy so I needed it to be sturdy. So it has a gel layer that goes over the phone itself, and then it sits in a hard shell, I bought this and one of those glass screen protectors and wahlah, it's just as good as the fifty dollar cases but for a fraction of the cost. Love the rose gold color as well!",

I\u2019ve dropped my phone a few times and the case has fully protected it. My only complaint is the plastic piece that curves over the vibration switch somehow got slightly bent. There is now a small gab between the plastic and the rubber. Other than that it still looks brand new! I would definitely recommend this case!",

Not worth the postage to return but also not worth risking my phone. Probably just use it until I can get another Otterbox, soon. Although those corners broke, they offered double the protection and saved my phone. Chalk this one up in online shopping loss column.",

Honestly, I had a nice silicone one before this but it kept pulling out my hair when I would take the phone away from my ear! This one doesn\u2019t do that but it\u2019s not slippery, the silicone shell holds a nice grip! Definitely recommend this!",

      "text": "This case (I got the pink one) is very pretty and fits perfectly onto my iPhone 6s. It is slightly difficult to hold and type due to the smooth hard back cover, but overall I'm pretty happy with it aside from the fact that there is a small tear in the silicone at the top of my case. The tear was present when I opened the box, but I need a case so I'm trying to ignore it. Overall a great case, just would have loved it more if it wasn't damaged.",
