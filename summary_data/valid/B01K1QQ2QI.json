Just got an E-mail from the seller, and they are sending me a replacement...A REPLACEMENT!! This seller is the best, I loved my Air Fryer and I do not blame them for a rare failure, parts do fail, but the speed and care that the are showing a customer is amazing. I recommend them to everyone, this is just amazing, I wrote this review yesterday and they responded in less than 18 hrs. If only all Sellers cared this much.

The images on the front of the air fryer provide temperature information but the book provides guidelines on length of time to cook the food. It even provides suggestions on when to add a little oil to what you are cooking. Having the air fryer has made life easier. No messy oil cleanup and no lingering fried oil smell in the house which I used to hate. Everything turns out crisp and delicious. This was definitely well worth the money.",

I can easily fry 2 large quarters of the chicken or 6 large whole potatoes at once.",

They do work better than regular toast ovens in certain tasks, such as reheating french fries or chicken nuggets. This fryer is of medium size, and the power level is adequate. The non-stick coating works fine. The elevated wire stand meant to help air circulation is, however, very poorly designed and built. The gaps are way too big to keep fries or nuggets in place. It also comes without coating, and therefore always ends up with food sticking to it. Using it is a constant struggle and source of frustration.",

I had food inside and the fan/element went off, no lights, but the timer was still going. I unplugged it, checked the outlet, I can't figure out what happened except it just doesn't last.
