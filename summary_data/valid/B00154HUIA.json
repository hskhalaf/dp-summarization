To make matters worse, the two pieces are not permanently hinged so in between crushing one flipping ice cube at a time, you have to hold the bottom to load and then placed the top part on to crush. Awkward... AND the chunks are huge! I too vote baggie and a hammer and will be returning this nearly $20 ridiculousness.",

The fancy machines I tried were a huge pain and still didn't work as well, and the 2nd best method of using a hammer and a plastic bag was both louder and produced less consistent sized ice chunks.",

I usually end up filling a ziplock with chunks created with this and then use a mallet to smash them into finer pieces. It's an awkward tool to use for sure.",

Put the cubes in, press the handles together, it goes CRUNCH, and you have crushed ice. You get an irregular crush, but none of the pieces are too large. It does work better if it's slightly wet. It really doesn't take that much hand strength to use - I'm a small woman and it works fine for me. The only downside is that the two pieces of the crusher just hook together at the top and come apart really easily if you're not paying attention.",

Yes, but how much cleaning do you have to do when crushing frozen water?? The weight of the item feels cheap, I was expecting it to be significantly more weighted.
