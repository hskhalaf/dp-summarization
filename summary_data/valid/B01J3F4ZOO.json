      "text": "Bought this for my daughter for her birthday when hers broke. She has a 3 yr old and a dog. She said the first time she used it the amount of hair and dirt it picked up was embarrassing. Her last vacuum was a highly rated upright and less than a year old but after using this vacuum just once the difference is amazing. With her other vacuum, whenever she would shampoo her carpets she had to keep stopping to clean fur and hair off the carpet shampooer. After using the Shark just once she shampooed her carpets and there was NO ground in dirt or hair to pick up!",

The pet hair attachment was pictured, but not listed in the ad. The pet hair attachment came with the vacuum, but not the floor attachment. I would think if the attachment is pictured and/or listed in the ad, it should be included. The Shark Navigator Pro does a very nice job cleaning floors, rugs, carpet and stairs.",

The original had a separate hard floor attachment that used pads and it was fantastic. This one doesn't have that, you have to pay extra to get one. When we bought this one, it was delivered today and we love it (in spite of no hard floor attachment). It actually \"fluffs up\" the carpet (strong suction!!) and after having used another, less expensive, Shark, it was amazing how much pet hair and dust came out! We bought this one from Walmart, but would have used Amazon if the price was a little lower.",
