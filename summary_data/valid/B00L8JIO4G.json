To work on our training I got this gate so he can't jump on the door or me as soon as I walk in. At first I was hesitant because he's a very large dog and very strong but this gate is stronger and tall enough to keep him out. Very impressed, would definitely recommend this to anyone with a big dog or disturbingly strong, hulk-like toddler. Guaranteed they won't get past this gate.",

My smallest dog has identified the weak points where the pieces join together, so now I get to watch ALL my dogs snoozing on the couch because they've successfully taken down the hallway gate.

If we try to tighten it up, the gate will not open and close. We had cut the tightening screws to fit properly. We also had no choice but to use the wall mount pieces as we could not tighten it to the wall enough and still open the gate. Overall, not worth the money.",

      "text": "Ordered this specifically because it was tension mounted-no screwing hardware into door frames and walls. Technically, maybe, but the tension option easily slid with pressure. Couldn't risk the baby pushing these over and tumbling to the ground with them. Good news is the install cups are included, bad news is they have to be installed multiple times because there's no template for placement. You install the gate fully, mark the walls, uninstall fully, mount parts, then reinstall for good. The quality is good, though it buckles slightly against pressure if using the extender pieces. Overall pretty happy, just took longer getting them installed than I had hoped.",

Not so! \"Standing an impressive 37\u201d tall the gate is a perfect height to keep your little climber safe and is easily expandable to fit larger openings. If you have an odd sized hallway or door opening, the gate is versatile fitting doorways between 30\u201d-42\u201d. A 4\u201d extensions kit (above and beyond what is included) can be added to accommodate wider spaces. Additional extensions are sold separately. The gate can accommodate a maximum of 3 extensions.\"",

The other thing about this gate is it is tall. Though I have a very small dog he is a jumper and could easily jump over a short gate. This is good for a jumper or a big dog. I don't have it screwed in, since he is only 7 pounds he isn't going to push it over.",

This gate is not only so much safer but looks much better as well and OUR kids can go in and out of his office when they need to. They couldn't before, they had to stand at the door and talk to him which was a huge hassle. Best \"baby\" aka dog gate ever!!",
