It doesn\u2019t irritate their skin (they both have fairly sensitive skin). And the think the name and bottle are fun. It arrived right on time and in perfect condition. No complaints at our house.",

The smell was present but definitely not overwhelming which I appreciate. It's gentle enough for his sensitive skin and does a good job of cleaning him which is rare as my son's skin is very easily irritated. This product is no fuss and works really well. For the price point and the size of this bottle, I definitely recommend this product.",

As a low cost option its a good choice but I probably wont buy again. Also the first time it shipped I had to request a replacement because the top got broken during shipping so the pump part didnt work but it was replaced with no issue.",

No skin irritation at all, and he had sensitive skin so I was greatful on that as well. Will definitely buy again.",
