I had to remove the reel, untangle the line and reel it back while standing mid-current. I gave it 3 stars since because it had been a good reel until now.",

I should add the spool removal system is easy to use. I had bought another small reel and it was a compression system. Had to pull so hard I was afraid I would bend the spool.

Spend and extra 20 bucks and buy some scientific angler air cell or something. Overall a good product. It's still holding up. I've caught bass, catfish and big carp on it.

The only challenge I have with the reel is there is absolutely no resistance on the spool when reeling. This causes a strange situation when casting where the reel free spoils and actually takes in slack. It is something I have learned to keep tension on the extra line or touch the spool with my hand when casting to prevent the free spool forward. For the price this is something I can deal with, but the old click type reels solve this issue with a gear on the spool to always keep a small amount of tension on it.",

I've used it several times now to catch wild stream rainbow, Brown, and brook trout, as well as panfish and small bass.",

      "text": "Just came back from the 2016 iCast show where I looked and tried a lot of reels of the same quality. They all sold for a lot more even at wholesale pricing. No slop and the drag has a good range of adjustment. I was needing a fly reel that could be fished and could be use along with taken fish pictures. Preferring to have no name brands included in many of the photos this reel fits my needs. Now it's time to rig it up and go catch some fish and take some photos!",
