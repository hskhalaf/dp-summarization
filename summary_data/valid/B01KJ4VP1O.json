The insole is a little dodgy when it comes to staying put when you slip the shoes on. Other than that it looks and performs just great for me as an older beginner runner. The Flyknit and flywire tech are an upgrade and definitely worth What they do for comfort and performance.",

These provide good cushion for the balls of my feet, as well as my heels when I do squats. Ordering the right size can be a bit confusing due to all the convoluted options.(why can't they just say whether the shoes are wide, narrow, etc.?) Please note that the laces are for show, so if they give out its no big deal, they don't do anything because the shoe is so tight.",

They're a tad snug for my liking though. I usually wear a size 10 in Nikes, and the 10 here squeezes my foot. Not too snug for me to return them, but snug enough that I wish I'd ordered a half-size up. Overall, a very good pair of running shoes.",
