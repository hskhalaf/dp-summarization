      "text": "I was so excited to receive this in the mail and assembled it in less than 30 min. I tried to lay down and do some hyperextensions and the chair is so \"awkward\". I'm 5'10'' and the bar that is supposed to support your legs wobbles way too much. It is cheaply made and a very poor design. The cushions are very cheap as well and do no provide much comfort. After assembling it in 30 min, I disassembled the unit and boxed it all up to return to the vendor.",

      "text": "I bought the Sunny Roman Chair after reading several other reviews. I have had their spin cycle for a number of years so I already have been impressed by their quality for price compared to other brands. This did not disappoint. It's lightweight, easy to assemble and is great for a home gym. I'm 6'0\" 190 lbs and it seems a good size although I could see it being an even better size with someone even shorter. Bottom line, if you want something that is reasonably priced but delivers high value, look no further.",

Easy to put together but I feel a minor improvement could be an extra outer bracket on the support bar. I cramped down a little too hard and indented the metal just slightly. My mistake not the manufacturer. Happy with it so far.",
