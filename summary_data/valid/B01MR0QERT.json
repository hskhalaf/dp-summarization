This has woken me and my husband during the middle of the night on several occasions. It's one thing for the baby to wake me up, it's another for a piece of technology to wake me up just to let me know it doesn't have connection for a function I'm not even currently using due to being asleep. Worse, the shrill beeping has even woken the baby in her room across the hall during one of her naps. I contacted customer service and was informed there is no way to turn off or even decrease the volume on this beeping function.",

Oue family members can all access the video through the motorola app, so it\u2019s been a beautiful experience knowing that they have seen him grow. The video does freeze sometimes, and we figured out that if we play the music on the device, we can bypass that error.
