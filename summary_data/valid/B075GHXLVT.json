It allowed for us to breathe through sets rather than trying to rush through to the next. Because this product forces you to have better form, you can feel muscles worming that you didn't even know you had. I highly recommend this product for others to use!",

I just saw how cheap it was and the reviews were great, so I figured Id give it a try. It is indeed great. Forces way more stress on your bis, to the point that I had to lower the weight some.

It still does a great job, but gets a little bit uncomfortable as you get to higher weights/reps. Overall it is a great product and really serves its purpose. :)",
