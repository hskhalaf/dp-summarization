I also have a connective tissue disorder (I know, I'm a mess) which makes my skin unbelievably sensitive. I break out if someone just looks at me the wrong way so trying this was a risk. Turns out I didn't need to worry, my husband has given me a bunch of back massages and not one pimple has reared it's ugly head!",

Jojoba oil is great for your skin and didn't leave much residue behind - some, yes, because it is oil, but I have never felt straight-up greasy using this. I break out easily, and my skin didn't react at all to this. I've also used it in baths with good results. I plan to get more when my current bottle runs out.",

On the surface the smell is a pleasant (albeit generic and kind of fake-smelling) lavender. However, as I started giving my boyfriend a back massage the \"stingyness\" of the smell just hit me. It was of like there was something chemical about the massage oil. Sometimes it felt like I was smelling alcohol. Although the massage oil itself is fine, the smell is VERY powerful. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO SMELLS!",

      "text": "This is a great massage oil. The lavender scent is bold, but not over powering. The scent is just enough to elicit a feeling of calm. The oil itself has nice consistency. Not too thin, where is runny. But also not too thick too become sticky. It always my hands to glide across the skin, without any drag. As long as too much oil isn't applied, it leaves a nice moisturized feeling on the skin Overall, this is one of the better massage oils I have used. Especially at a price point well below other massage oils i have tried. I will definitely purchase this oil again",

I put this on my daughter after a bath and she falls asleep. Better to buy something from a store than to purchase a product without a return policy. I will make sure to check for that next time I think about buying something online.",
