Has several attachments to relieve different kinds of muscle knots. Battery lasts a good long time and recharges fully in a couple of hours. I've been sleeping better since I started using this. The seller is also very good. There was a problem with the unit that arrived (not the seller's fault) and the customer service I received was among the best I've experienced through Amazon. She immediately responded, and after verifying the problem with me, sent a replacement out straight away. So it's 5 stars for the product and the seller!",

What I like most about it is that is quiet when in use and the battery lasts long. It comes with a carrying case which is very convenient and looks nice.",

      "text": "As myself and my daughters father attend the gym regularly we also regularly have muscles aches and pains and using this massager has literally helped sooth those aching muscles. There are 20 settings of speed and I find even the 1st speed setting is so strong let alone level 20 however my daughters father likes 20 as his muscles are more accepting of the speed setting. With 6 different heads the options are endless and the stylish bag is great for carrying around and helpful to bring to the gym to loosen your muscles after a strenuous workout. Though the massager is big and sturdy its easy to use and works the knots out with ease.",

      "text": "This massage gun works very well and really has everything that can pinpoint muscle aches, soreness and tension. Its portable and comes with zippered carrying case with a handle, so taking it to the gym or the office is very convenient. The average battery life is 3 hours! One of the things you immediately notice about this massage gun is that it's powerful. Best one I have used yet, its easy on my muscles and helps relax them. Sorted my shoulders right out. Totally worth it though. Many thanks.",

It disperses the acids in our muscles so recovery time is a lot less. It helps take out rough knots in my neck and back. I love how you can change the level of massage pressure. It is easy to customize accordingly to the user.",
