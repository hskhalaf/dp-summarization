We had wall space for it, and we did not want to mess with in-floor heat as we were doing it all ourselves and were concerned about power consumption in our upstairs bath - too far from the electric panel to run more power. So we decided to try this. It will not make the room hot, but it will take the chill off, which is what we were looking for. We are very pleased.",

      "text": "We needed a space-heater for our MB bathroom while showering in the winter months. This is better than a portable unit because it occupies no space. We have a mid-century classic ranch-style home, so we had to convert a linen closet into a master shower because mid century Ranch's only had halfbaths. They're small, but adequate for all our needs after the shower was added except for a space-heater for winter. Our handyman wired & installed this heater in a jiffy, and gave us an additional electric outlet for charging our smartphones, the vacuum cleaner, etc. This heaters great for the price, and looks aesthetic too. Great buy!",

I am thankful that I was home and in the bathroom when this happen. I think there is a major design flaw with this heater. DO NOT BUY THIS HEATER!!!

My complaints: 1) The internal thermostat is set a bit low and, even when turned up all the way, it cuts off the heat before the room is fully warmed up, and 2) After a few months use the fan blades build up a really disgusting coating of dust bunnies, but I guess that's a sign that the unit is moving plenty of air over the heating coils.",

The thermostat would not kick the heater on until the dial was turned more than halfway. Taking it apart i found you could adjust the engagement point by bending a metal tab in the thermostat, and I moved the shutoff switch because it would engage far too early. Now it can heat my bathroom to a balmy 75 before shutting off on its highest setting. Install was fairly straightforward otherwise.",

If this stopped working, I would immediately and without hesitation buy another one. I also appreciate the thermostat; I read some complaints about it,but that must be fixed in the new versions because it keeps my van at the set temperature. LOVE it.",
