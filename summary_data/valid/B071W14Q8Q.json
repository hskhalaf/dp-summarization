I bought model A for a standard 15ft aluminum boat, but the cover is a few inches to short in length, yet that's without trying to cover the motor. It's just a hassle to have to exchange it when you bought the exact model the company recommends for your boat. As I saw in many other reviews, I would suggest getting one size bigger than the chart recommends. Especially in the case that your boat has a windshield or you're planning on covering the motor too.",

This boat stays outside, so cover is exposed 100% of the time. ultimately I had to put a center support in to keep it from pooling water, but worked perfectly fine. The second cover purchased was the green in March 2019. I am disappointed in it because of the fading, the color has faded real fast. I did notice the fading on the Grey cover, however it just wasn't as obvious because of it being Grey.",

Overall, I would give the cover a solid 4 out of 5. I do believe the cover could have used 1 or 2 more hold down straps sewn in at strategic points. I would suggest this tarp for storage more than covered trailing. DPS",
