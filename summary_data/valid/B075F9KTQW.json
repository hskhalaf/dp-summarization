If I knew this is what I'd get, I wouldn't have paid even $20 for it. Who wants the trouble, and even worse, the forever reminder of the gash?

I scoured the reviews for a simple and low cost desk (for use with my computers, Xbox, etc) and came upon this one; it looks good and is fairly sturdy, and also came well packaged - I had no damaged parts. :-) I got the dark brown/gray Espresso color and I really like it.

We ordered two and have them back to back with adjustable monitor arms and they are great! Plenty of room for all of our work, and my daughter can work next to me if she needs. It took us about 40 minutes to set up both, and they came with a very cool ratcheting hex wrench and blank cards, which was delightfully unexpected. I ordered these based on my experience with Zinus bed frames, which I also can't say enough good things about.",

      "text": "I'm really glad I settled on this desk over others I've seen on Amazon. It's very sturdy and well made for a desk less than $100. My only complaint is that, unlike other people who purchased this desk, it took me quite awhile to put together. I found that the holes were all slightly off kilter, so it took a lot of adjusting to get all the screws in right. It was a little frustrating but in the end, it worked out. The desk doesn't wobble at all and supports my gaming PC just fine.",

      "text": "The finished product after assembly is pretty good. The process of building it was horrible. The metal bars that slide together took over 20 minutes of near abuse to get to fit, and after 10 minutes of trial and error, I found that at best only 7 out of 10 of the screws that hold the wood top and metal frame together would go in because of poor measurements. It seems plenty sturdy with only 7 screws but it is still very annoying. Maybe I just got a bad one. If you're willing to take the risk, the finished table looks nice and is sturdy. Can't recommend but I won't say don't buy it.",

Buyers complained about tightening the screw too much which caused the external surface to bulge so I was cautious in over-tightening. No problems there for me. 2. Some buyers complained about defective parts but no problems for me.",
