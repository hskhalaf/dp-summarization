I\u2019ve tried them all- the CVS wannabe of this, Simple\u2019s, Loreal\u2019s... this is not only the best quality but Best bang for your buck. Gets off waterproof mascara without you needing to freaking scrub your eyelashes off. Great for dry or sensitive skin-ladies like myself. That nourishing feeling after is a plus for those worried about their eye area sensitivity or are missing some eyelid sensitivity. Once in a while I\u2019ll stray away to try something new... but I always come back. It just WORKS. Tips- use with reusable ;makeup remover pads and don\u2019t forget to shake! Good job, Neutrogena.",

You can just rub the excess into your skin after removing the makeup to help with moisturizing. If you think it\u2019s oily, try using baby oil. Then you\u2019ll appreciate how amazing it is. Baby oil never comes off, but within a few minutes of using this stuff your face is soft but dry. No oil! Love it!",
