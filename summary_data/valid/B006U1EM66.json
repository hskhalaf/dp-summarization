I'm an avid cyclist/runner and I would have to take it off sometimes to cool my ears down. I will change the rating when they fix this latest issue. See images for comparison.",

I can't return it since it's broken, so I'm writing my first review just to warn others away. Amazon should be ashamed for perpetuating this as this is a fundamentally different product than the one that received 1500 largely positive reviews.

      "text": "Went to Chicago this past winter. (I'm from Florida so i don't often see temp highs in the 'teens for five straight days) I bought this to keep my ears warm. They worked well in doing so. They were so comfy that i forget sometimes that i have them on. Only issue i had were at times they would slip off, and at times was difficult to keep in place. Overall though, i like this and it did the job well.",

They continously slipped off one ear or the other. This problem was even worse when I tried to wear my hat. While to portion on the bacl of my neck wasn't affected, the ear portion came off my ears whenever I turned my head. I didn't like them and wouldn't recommend them, but my wife also got a pair (of the women's model) and they work well for her.",
