Likewise, it was able to protect the foot from water intrusions. Despite these praised features, its rating dropped drastically because of its questionable durability. It made users feel that it was not a good purchase at all. To conclude, if the brand is to refine the TPS 520 GV Evo, it may soon be highly regarded in the outdoor footwear industry.",

I hope they continue to make these. Worth every penny!",

I don't know if they aren't an authorized vendor; or if they were knock offs. either way, I'll never make a pricey purchase through a third party seller.

Some may not like boots this stiff but walking on rough terrain at this price point I've not found better. The VIBRAM soles (IMHO) are the key. I experience far less fatigue due to the stiff nature of the boot. When stepping on stones and sharp rock edges, the pressure points are dissipated by the sole of the boot thereby causing far less fatigue. It provides excellent ankle support. Highly recommended.",
