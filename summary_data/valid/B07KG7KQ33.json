It did not leave the majority of users disappointed when it comes to comfort, fit, and durability. By retaining its classic look, this soccer cleat is the perfect combination of vintage elegance and modern innovation.",
      "pros": [
        "The majority of buyers were delighted by the fact that Puma King Pro Soft Ground is relatively more affordable than the original Puma King soccer cleats",
        "This soccer cleat provides a great fit for players with wide foot, as stated in some reviews",
        "Many players mentioned that the Puma King Pro SG felt comfortable right out of the box",
        "Several users were impressed by the durability of this soccer cleat, with some having had theirs for a few months to a couple of years",
        "One person said that the cleat fits like a glove"

      "cons": [
        "A couple of players noticed that the Puma King Pro Soft Ground is a half size smaller than their usual size",

They look great and we\u2019re high quality. I\u2019m am a size 11 across all my Puma boots, but these were far too tight. I have quite broad feet, but even so they were so narrow I couldn\u2019t get my foot in. Don\u2019t assume because you use other Puma that these will fit. If your feet are narrow, game on!",

The boot itself was slightly tighter than expected on the first wear but this is usually expected in a New pair of boots. After a little bit of running around in then the leather started to mould to my foot shape making them very comfortable. Studs are a fantastic length for wintery conditions and proved very useful at preventing slips. Very happy with the product and would definitely buy again",
