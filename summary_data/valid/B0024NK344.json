I am loving it. 1) heavy file size - check (Spotify/tidal) 2) Audiophile headphone - check (DT990 edition 32ohm) 3) DAC/Amp - check (Audioquest Dragonfly Red) complete setup. Using with smartphone and laptop. without dac/amp it was clear but not loud enough. Bass could be better but I am happy with this much.",

The clarity is amazing, with previous headphones I had to turn up the volume to hear a detailed sound, with these headphones I can have the volume much lower and still hear the details. When listening to bassy music I can use an equaliser for more bass and the headphones really deliver a punchy bass that doesn't sound muddy or distorted.",

A few weeks ago by chance plugged them into an iPhone and then android smartphone. WOW in comparison with various Bluetooth and dedicated newer headphones there is no comparison! Rich sounds across the spectrum although with MP3 that's not a big achievement. In 1989 paid about \u00a380 not a major increase for good sound. Four stars as the headband pressure can be a little excessive for prolonged periods... Enjoy...",
