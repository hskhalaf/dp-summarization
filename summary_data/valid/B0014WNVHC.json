But (isn't there always a but?) the back is hollow. I need a flat back to attach to my granite wall. I intend to use industrial Velcro. When the weather improves I'll cut a slice of plywood and epoxy the plywood to fill the back of the magnet bar. I currently have a magnetic knife holder attached to the wall with Velcro but the magnets are too weak to hold the 8\" knife. Finding the right knife magnet bar has turned into a multi-month nuisance.",

If the screws are too tight, you the side pieces might not fit. Or worse, you might peel paint off the wall with friction. If not tight enough, it gets wobbly. Even with the screws as tight as I can get without peeling the paint on my walls, the whole bar wobbles in the whatever direction you move the knife.",

If you were to try to remove the bar after installation w/o the spacers you'll likely damage the mounting surface. Since I installed this onto the refrigerator surround panels and was able to get to the other side from where the bar was installed, I used machine screws w/ nuts to also allow easier removal. Bars that allow access to the mounting screws are a better design for wall mounting if future removal is desired.",

Probably not the most self-explanatory method and I don't think there was instructions when it arrived. However, I looked it up online and just really figured it out after some thought.
