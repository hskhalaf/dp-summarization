The slide pockets inside are huge and there are many. I got the gray color and it is beautiful, really a blue gray or a light slate. The pictures show it standing up so I was surprised it came folded flat. The bottom stitching is sturdy, so maybe it would flatten over time and stand without puddling. Very nice, well made, just bigger than I need.",

You'd be surprised how many bag are not machine washable and with COVID, I am not taking hat risk. It has so many pockets on the inside for all my things and I still have space inside. It's practical, cute, and, while the price point is higher than I'd normally purchase, I think it's worth it.",
