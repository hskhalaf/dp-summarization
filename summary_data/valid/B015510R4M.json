I mainly play FPS games like Siege and it has gaming modes for Racing, FPS and many more. These basically just change the colour grading to make the perfect gaming experience. The 144hz and 1ms response really make a difference for me especially been as I am a semi-pro. Highly Recommend!",

AOC does this also for the nvidia gsync version which rather then a red strip, includes a green strip of course representing nvidia. My model came with a stuck pixel however at this price point, really didn\u2019t bother me as its hardly noticeable due to the size of the display. Over all, if you have a AMD graphics card and are looking for a cheap decent quality monitor then I\u2019d highly recommend this one.",

Its easily fixable in the settings (using buttons on the monitor). Putting Hz up to advertized digits is another story. Thats why 1 star deduction.

The Monitor has an \"image setup\" function, which would allow for adjustments, however it seems non-adjustable with an HDMI connector.
