I am a 34D and have usually bought sports bras with clasps because they are typically higher impact. However, they are not as comfortable and the clasps inevitably start bending out of shape after repeated wears. I\u2019m super excited that this style works and provides enough support because it is very lightweight and comfortable. I am however, using it in winter when I am wearing multiple layers. But I still think it will work well even in just a tank top. Recommended even for larger bra sizes!",

For this reason I don't buy them in other colors. But the product is quality. Though I compare them with the ones I bought in the past - the fabric of the latest ones is thinner.

      "text": "The material and the overall construction feel comfortable. Though fit, I would say it is low impact and wonder if lady with bigger breast might find it supportive enough for more vigorous exercise. Another problem is when I wore it with my AK Ultimate Direction hydration vest for a 32km trail run last weekend, the bra chafed against my neck when one of my water bottle was full and the other empty. It has never happened with my other sports bras even though the water bottles are not balanced! Last week, I had to keep the volume of both water bottles well balanced to stop the pain. I think the seamless design doesn't work very well.",

However this is an extremely comfortable bra that I like to wear around the house or to work. It wicks sweat so if I'm doing any heavy lifting or its 100+ Fahrenheit I'm not stuck in a soaking bra. I wear a 32 DD and the small was great. It's a very stretchy material.",

Finally, it wicks away perspiration and allows air to flow, so it\u2019s not too hot. This bra will work well all summer, I think.",

No cups though, so be aware that if you're cold then others will know it.",

That's important to me, being in Texas. I got the white, and it's definitely an undergarment - not to be worn by itself. I've had sports bras in the past which stick to sweaty skin enough to almost dislocate a shoulder when you pry them off - I have not had that problem with this bra. I'll probably order a second!",
