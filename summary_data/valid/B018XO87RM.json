It had lasted really well and I had only paid $7.99 for it. So I thought buying this \"leather\" one would last even longer. When this wallet arrived I was very disappointed. It was so stiff. It did not feel anything like leather, or even as nice as the one I had paid $7.99 for several years ago. The magnet was very weak and would not attach when I had the phone open. I returned this item .",

Convenient, compact, and secure way to carry iPhone, ID, credit card, and cash. Easy to remove and reinsert phone with soft bumpers. Case doubles as stand. With a little practice, case does not interfere with photo taking, hanging downward. Well made and useful. Only problem encountered is strong magnet erases hotel card keys.",

So, when it is closed a corner of the phone is slightly exposed which is not good for the phone. Because it might develop a scratch or something more! I did not return it because, I think when something like credit card or DL or some important slips inserted in the given slots, that gives a little thickness to the pouch, which, when closed, fits the phone better. Also, I did not return it because I needed one badly. Otherwise, the product is definitely quite good. Sleek looking. I recommend it.",

Basically you can't have anything too bulky in there or it won't close. My whole goal was to put my cards and cash in it so I am a little bit disappointed.

The card pockets have a tendency to stretch over time which is why I purchased a new one after two years. Otherwise this is an amazing product.",

The detachable strap is perfect for someone who misplaces their phone easily as it fits on the wrist. I also like the slots where you can put money, cards, pictures, etc. I placed cash inside for her and she can carry it to school for lunch that way. Overall, great product for the price!",
