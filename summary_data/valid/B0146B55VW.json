      "text": "This is a great digital scale, which I have been able to easily replicate results with. Very accurate and for the price around $120 this was a great deal compared to other lab grade scales. You must correctly set up the scale and calibrate correctly in order for it to work, but the user manual included is very well set up and provided me all the information I needed. It's also very important that the scale is used at a constant temperature as the sensors inside are temperature sensitive, so when it's first set up it needs to come to the same temperature as the room for accuracy.",
