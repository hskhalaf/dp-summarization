      "text": "Was looking for a bench for our entryway by the staircase, that had both a backrest and storage. This serves exactly that. It was well packed and provided with clear instructions. Having a handy drill helps with the screws. Due to the partition in the middle of the storage space though, it won\u2019t fit a lot of large items but we just needed something to store scarves, gloves, etc. so this was perfect for that. It is very cute looking and can be a great accent to any room. The rustic brown is a gorgeous chocolate brown color. Highly recommend!",

I should have done my measuring first. I am in my 60's and I do not enjoy sitting so low, especially getting back up. I plan to put it on a mat or brick...base. It has a nice finish, soft wood, so the screws go in easily, but I don't think this will last long enough to become a family heirloom! I was able to put it together by myself. It does look as good as the picture.",

Apart from that glitch, it was really good. My daughter loves it! I like it as it doesn't take up much space, yet a good utility.",
