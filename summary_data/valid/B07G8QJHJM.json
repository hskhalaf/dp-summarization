Its trendy look did not compromise performance, especially in terms of comfort, surface traction, and arch support. Despite these good points, a few mishaps were raised. Everything considered, the pros presented by the Chaco Mega Z/Cloud evidently outweighed its cons, making it worth a shot.",

        "The stylish look of this multi-sport sandal was complimented by numerous consumers",
        "An abundance of brand loyalists stated that this gear had softer straps than their other Chaco sandals",

      "text": "Chacos are the best because they are thick enough to protect your feet even when hiking fairly brought terrain, but don't have any uncomfortable velcro, or straps between your toes or any other unpleasant feelings many sandels have. They also work like small flippers when you swim. These are particularly nice in that the webbing is nice and wide, and Chacos always adjust nice and easy when you first get them. Once you wear them a while, you will have to spend some time trying to wash the sand out of tunnel where the strap passes through the sole. Not much choice but to pull the strap back and forth and hose off all of the sand each time.",

They are a bit heavier than I expected but I believe that is because of the sole being so dense. Because of this I expect them to be very durable and long lasting.

I was never able to wear them for long periods of time. So..... of coarse went back to old faithful. Thank you Chaco for listening and creating a sandal that is even better than the original.",
