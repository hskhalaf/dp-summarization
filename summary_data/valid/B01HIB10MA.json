      "verdict": "The LunarStelos has all the makings of a handy, reliable, and lightweight trainer. Besides being very affordable, the superior comfort, excellent breathability, good arch support, and really cool looks should make this an easy option for neutral runners. The shoe has the speed to take on up-tempo runs as well as the cushioning and support for piling on the miles. Although an entry-level shoe, it should also be a very solid choice for seasoned runners during recovery days or for long and easy runs.",

        "Extremely comfortable is an expression that comes up in most of the reviews of the LunarStelos",

        "A couple of runners valued the cool looks of this shoe",
        "Breathability is very good, as noted by more than a few",
        "This is a good training partner in the gym, according to more than a handful of reviewers",

      "cons": [
