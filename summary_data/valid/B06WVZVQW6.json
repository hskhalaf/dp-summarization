The rain fly will not fully protect this area. It would have been nice to seek shelter from the rain while sitting in looking out. Overall, we love this tent.

We did have some water leakage through the base of the tent, but we were in a pretty severe storm. The tent is sturdy and withstood the storm though. We are unable to exchange/return the tent because it has a 30 day return policy only (something to also consider when purchasing this tent).",

Hanging out with beverages in our chairs in that room was just as fun as sitting by the fire without the annoyance of the black flies. The tent is sturdy, and large enough for a queen air mattress and all of the necessities too. Pockets for your personal items, hooks on the ceiling for a fan or a light - flaps for air and a rain flap for reassurance. Very happy with this purchase.",
