The metal is beautiful too. We both just love how it looks. It is HEAVY. The box said it weighed 70 lbs. It's not a light weight piece. It didn't take him very long to put it together either. The drawers don't pull out as easily as we'd like but it's okay because it will discourage our younger grandchildren from getting into them. We are more than pleased with this purchase.",

The screws provided are quite short and will likely need frequent tightening. I find this to be a design problem.",
