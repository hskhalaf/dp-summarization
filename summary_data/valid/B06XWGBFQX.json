She said she had no idea what a difference golf shoes make and her game has improved since she started wearing these shoes. She loves the comfort and more importantly, the fact that they are water proof in this wet Spring weather.",

I am hoping that by continuing to wear socks that cover that area and adding blister blockers that they will break in. They repel water well and other than my ankle/heel area issue my feet feel great!",
