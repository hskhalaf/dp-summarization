Despite what I have read on some reviews, setting this thing up was a breeze and took maybe 10 minutes....max. I set it up for both bands. Then, I plugged it in on the same floor as my router and the range covers my entire house. No more dead spots and the speeds are much faster too. I couldn't be happier. As an added benefit, my wifi now extends far into my yard as well. Very happy.",

Up and running in 5 mins, using the same WiFi network as Xfinity (no more switching). My wife who complained the most said she noticed a significant difference in WiFi when she is upstairs (problem area). I\u2019m buying a second and removing the Netgear routers.

I'm glad I bought the bullet and ate the big bucks on this one. It has zero lag and speed tests as fast as the main cable modem that it is extending.

      "text": "Had some trouble with the latency (lag time) when the Blink security camera when it was activated waiting as long as 30 seconds to view the video using a Netgear WiFi extender. Not that the Netgear (EX2700) extender was bad but the WIFI extender just wasn't for the lack of better word \"powerful\" enough to handle that type of video steaming. The TP-Link | AC2600 solved that issue. Alerts and views are now pretty much instantaneous while going to live view takes about 5-8 seconds. In A.P. mode (Access Point) it seems even faster. I plan on keeping it in A.P. mode once I get some cat-5 cable. Not cheap but it did solve my problem.",
