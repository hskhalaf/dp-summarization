The filters also last a bit longer in these fountains compared to the previous one. Great purchase my cats went right to them the first night.",

You have to unplug the device, drain it, take off the top pass the plug through the bowl and you can finally clean it. I do recommend washing it every few weeks though depending how messy your pet is. I also recommend getting a few filters as you need to replace them like every 2 to 3 months to help purify the water. If the bowl isn't clean properly though it could plug the water pump that purifies the water and stop working.",

Be sure to follow cleaning instructions because you actually have to essentially take the pump apart. Customer service was friendly and quick to resolve an issue I was having. Also know the filters need to be ran through water so you don\u2019t freak out when your cats water turns grey(they contain charcoal).

However, I took the time to disassemble the mechanism and soaked everything using a water and vinegar solution (I have hard water, and cleaning with water alone was not sufficient). It started right back up with improved performance. The Pioneer Pet website has useful videos on disassembly and cleaning if you ever run into this problem -- after watching the videos, I found the disassembly and assembly very easy.

It runs very quietly unless the water gets too low, then it will make the standard 'air in the pump' noises which can get loud. If your fountain does run low and you refill it, the pump sometimes will continue growling until you unplug the unit for 10 seconds and plug it back in. This allows the water to fill the pump chamber and the air to be released from it, it will quiet down in less than 5 seconds.",

From time to time I'll find one of them has even fallen asleep next to it! It's vitally important that cats drink enough water to stay healthy and having drinking fountains that are fun for them to drink out of makes the difference. Also cats are wary of stagnant water so if they see moving water they are more likely to drink.",

This fountain is quiet, we think it looks good and our 3 cats love it. We clean ours and replace the filter every 2 or 3 weeks. We only use spring water in it and add water to it every day so the water level doesn't get very low. Best fountain for our cats!",

Easily taken apart and thrown in the dish washer, as opposed to wrenching apart many plastic parts that feel like they may snap and break apart. Cat tongues are scratchy and will eventually wear out that plastic like fine sandpaper... not this fountain. Hard to tell the water level so I dropped a ping-pong ball in the reservoir to gauge it at a glance.",

This fountain design is much superior to the ones with plastic bodies, because it is so much easier to clean. Even cats with the most refined table manners will get food and fur in their water bowl. Unlike the plastic ones, this fountain has no nooks or crannies in which bacteria can hide, and everything except the tiny pump can go in the dishwasher. The pump has a volume lever, so you can adjust how forcefully water is pumped, based on your cat's comfort level. It's well worth the difference in price over the plastic models.",
