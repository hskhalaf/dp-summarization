The factory edge is not good but it takes a decent edge if you take the time to sharpen it. The things I didn't like about it is that it is heavy, much heavier than the western chefs knifes that I'm used to. The round handle caused hand cramps for me. Overall it is a great introduction to Chinese Cleavers. Maybe you like it and you stick with it. If you don't like it you know what you don't like and can look for Chinese Cleavers with slightly different styles.",
