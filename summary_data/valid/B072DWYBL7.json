It has saved me the problem of worrying about whether I remembered to turn the stove off in the mornings when I leave for work.

So I had to order another kettle (a different manufacturer--at least, ostensibly--though) this morning to replace this one. This kettle isn't expensive, so it's clearly not a huge financial burden to replace it, but what is the cost of landfills being filled with more and more planned obsolescence appliances?",

The other issue I have is that the button to start is a little funky. Oddly, the kettle has to be in a certain position on the base for the lever to stay down. All that to say, though, I would recommend this kettle.",

I hope I don\u2019t die from contaminated Chinese metal and plastic but it precludes my need to visit the gourmet coffee shop for a couple of coffees each day. Fit and finish are fair. The kettle wobbles a bit on the base (just like the one my wife\u2019s coworker has so it\u2019s inconsistent). As far as easy to clean, just fill with distilled white vinegar and boil it ... then use the vinegar to clean calcium from your water faucet aerators, shower heads, shower glass.",

The way the lid opens, when you pour with your right hand, you can't see the window that lets you see how full the pot is. Pretty sure my last pot had a window on both sides, or maybe the window was simple enough to see by looking inside while pouring. But, the Amazon Basic window has a bulky frame and you can't see it well through the lid opening (which doesn't open too far). If you can live with that, it's a great deal.",

      "text": "We use an electric kettle like this a lot, and I mean a lot, being avid tea drinkers. The problem is that they burn out or the switches go south too fast. We've tried several brands and only one from Germany lasted more than 12-18 months. So, when the latest one went wobbly, we got this one. A little smaller than others, it takes up less space on the counter, which is nice. It's very attractive, and we will see how long it lasts. But --- even if it goes after the warranty expires, the price for replacement is not prohibitive.",

Most disappointing, the button on the handle that pops open the lid has stopped working properly, just a few months after having bought it. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm pretty sure this thing was less than 20 bucks.",

Every time i need a cup of tea, it fires right up and quickly heats water. 3. Efficiency. I don't waste time / energy heating too much water. I never make a pot of tea, just cups. 4. It is small.
