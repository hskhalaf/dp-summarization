His arms and feet can move all round his body, so you could have the most ridiculous poses with this one!! I got him a little while ago. I have a stop motion series on my YouTube channel, the series is called: The Chubby Warrior!! So if you want to please go watch this adorable Kirby on action!!! (p.s be very carful with the fire holder piece!! I tried to put it in the little whole in the fire piece, and it broke... So be careful with that) ;)",

How can you get Kirby's iconic moves right on a figure? Well they outdid themselves this time. The figure is extremely articulated more so than the others. With a method using magnets. You can pose the hands and feet all around the faces interchange with magnets and lock safely and securely and I absolutely love and adore it. It's going to work perfect for my stop motion and any child will love this figure. I'm thinking about buying another one before its price Rockets.",
