The dark brown shade is very warm with an orange/red hue that didn't match my dark brown coloring nor my mothers. I hoped it would be more of a neutral tone. This should be marketed for someone with auburn/ red hair.",

It hardly smears & it washes off easily for night time beauty routines. I believe in this product & have tried so many other brands & I always come back to this.",

Fortunately my sister dyes her hair a pretty red shade, so I'm going to unload this on her. For the price I'll try the dark brown with fingers crossed it's a true BROWN shade.",

I have somewhat oily eyelids and this stuff doesn\u2019t budge, even without a primer or setting powder. I love that it\u2019s easy to apply, doesn\u2019t dry up like the liquid and gel liners, and doesn\u2019t smudge or start dripping down into fine lines like every other pencil eyeliner I\u2019ve tried.

      "text": "I was a bit worried that the color of this pencil would be too light for me, but thankfully, it is perfect! I have wheat-colored medium ashy-blonde hair and my eyebrows are about the same color as my hair. I thought that this pencil may be for those with much lighter blonde eyebrows, but the color matches my brows very well: perfect for filling in areas that need more volume. I would imagine that this color would work well on someone with a shade or so lighter or darker than mine as well. These pencils are great!",
