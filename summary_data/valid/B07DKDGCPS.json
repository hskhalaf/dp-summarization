I bought it as Christmas angel tree gift for a little girl, but it's so cheaply made, I just can't give it to her. Had I paid $10 for it, I'd consider keeping it at my house for my grandkids, but I want my money back!! It's like something you'd buy at a dollar store.

Advantages: Big drawing surface, colorful surface, and shaped magnets Cons: poor quality, pen and string literally came undone the first day. I will need to find new string and tie it to the board. Not impossible, but definitely inconvenient especially after paying $20.",

I\u2019m most excited about the large size of the drawing board and how lightweight it is. Having the 2 drawing tools means we can draw together with plenty of room. The stencils are fun to draw with too. And when the fun is over it swipes away easily and nothing left behind. I love how the board is colored so when you draw it\u2019s red, green, yellow, or blue. Really makes playtime fun and helps develop your childs imagination! Love this product and will definitely be purchasing again as a gift!",
