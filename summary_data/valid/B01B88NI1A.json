This seems to work better at keeping her more regular and she seems to like the flavor. The lactulose was a sticky mess getting it down, the laxatone many times would go untouched. She's not \"regular\" and probably never will be, but she is more \"regular\" than before and no constipation issues since starting. I do only give it to her once per day, through instructions say twice. This reninds me, I need to order another bottle.",
