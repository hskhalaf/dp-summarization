Because of issues with acne, I use oil free moisturizer which doesn't do this trick when my skin is really dry due to acne medication. I add 4 drops with my moisturizer day and night and it helps keep my skin hydrated and smooth. My skin has a glow to it plus it seems to help with oil control since my skin isn't overproducing oil due to dryness anymore. This oil has not caused my skin to break out.",

It's not a dry oil so if I want to not be shiny when I leave the house, I need to plan a little ahead of time. It's not clogged the first pore of mine, but of course I do make sure my face is clean and - if layering - have clean (non-clogging) products on it before I apply this.",
