      "text": "The bulbs look great... nice packaging, nice glass, nice design. The color is warm and welcoming. Not too warm but not too cold. The only problem is the quality control. I ordered two packs of these bulbs (8 bulbs total) and had 1 of the bulbs pop on the first power. None of the bulbs were handled with bare hands, they were all left in the bubble wrap when screwed into the sockets. I am working with Amazon for an easy replacement of the item. The other 7 bulbs worked fine so I just need a replacement bulb. Hopefully Amazon is accommodating and does not require me to return the item for a refund and re-purchase the item.",

While the Blaze Bulbs are cheaper, I have preferred these from G&B. The filament looks much more interesting on G&B with a zigzag wire as opposed to BB which are a thin, flat wire - only visible at a dimmed setting. Note that one bulb came in with a stem broken but bulb intact. TL;DR: Buy these for the smaller size and interesting filament if using a dimmed output setting.Otherwise, at max brightness, they perform just as expected.",

I wasn't impressed with the price though. When I found this offer I was elated. These are only the third of the price! Now all my rooms have warm and cosy light rather than harsh hospital light.
