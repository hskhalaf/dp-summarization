      "verdict": "Balancing style and comfort, the Lacoste Lerond Leather keeps things low-profile. It\u2019s made up of high-quality materials and has a durable construction, offered at a budget-friendly price tag. However, a couple of issues were also found, involving the rather thin sole and the tight fit across the foot for some users. Overall, this model is ideal for those who are looking for an affordable and stylish casual pair of kicks for their daily wardrobe.",

      "text": "Size seems fine but higher heel than a previous model (also Lacoste and very similar - though was getting the same one but was sent a different) which results in rubbed-irritation on the back of the leg - not very comfortable. Would go for a model with a lower heel to eliminate the potential issue. My son did not experience such issues with any other shoes before but I guess it is too late now to return them since he wore them? To clarify, yes, he wears proper socks, so it is not that - damages the skin through the sock, so it is pretty bad.",
