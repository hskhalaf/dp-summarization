Pigment is out of this world and the price could definitely be worse for what you are getting. I paint super thin so a tube will last me forever, and the color sets with the smaller sized tubes work best for me to be able to try new colors without committing to fun sized tubes. The signature color set is beautiful and I would recommend giving ANY Williamsburg colors a try.",

      "text": "After using W paints for many years ( I bought into the hype, foolish me) i would notice grittiness in many colors and a fading over time. Golden paints bought Williamsburg :( and while they brag about their high pigment quantity the proof is in the pudding and their colors absolutely fade. I suspect fillers in these paints. Not immediately but over time. Want to feel disappointed and cheated when you see your painting looking dull? Then go ahead and use these. Pure pigments mixed with linseed oil with no fillers will stay vibrant and will never fade. Now that I make my own oil paints, I clearly see the difference. I don't recommend these to any working/ professional painter.",
