I would recommend the x500 magnification to capture things like the eclipse and add the x2 teleconverter for close up shots of the moon (or the sun if you put a solar filter over it). I would also recommend getting a remote to take photos as button pressing is too shaky. Again, my knowledge of photography is extremely low so I don't know what kind of problems this lens would present for a professional. But for laymen like me it was absolutely perfect. Thanks!",

It does take some getting used to but I have taken some nice pictures of the birds eating at the feeders in the backyard. I have a nice picture of a woodpecker that every time I open the door it flies away. But with this lens I was able to take the picture through the storm door and got a very nice picture. Will post the pictures when I get a chance later. I will try and get some moon photos one it gets a little more nicer.",

I need more practice but so far this lens has been great.",

It is easy and straightforward to assemble and hook to my Nikon D7100 with included adapter. My first photo is to take a picture over a 30 feet high tree leaf from over 300 feet away, and the result is amazing. I never expect that it is so clear! Since then, I have taken many pictures including light house, moon etc. and I am happy with this lens.",

The focal length is fixed on 500mm, if you put the converter on, it becomes fixed on 1000mm. I asked this question here before buying it and nobody answered it clearly.",
