The temperature settings are hidden underneath the handle. With small hands, the position of the dial requires 2 hands to turn it. The iron needs to be at eye level to see it...very awkward and potentially dangerous. I made the mistake of giving it a try and it is too late to return it.",

I bought this iron because I'd had a Rowenta, and Oliso and a Black & Decker for the past 10 years. When I am working with cotton the MAIN issues I have are getting an iron that gets hot enough and an iron that has plenty of steam capacity. Black & Decker wins on BOTH of these features! Not by a little bit, but by a BIG margin! THANK YOU for making a good product at a great price and works dependably.",

Our previous irons were $15 - $20 irons and while they worked, they just didn't do justice for us like this iron does. Yes, it is a little heavier than what we were used to, but that is because it is a bigger, stronger, heavier duty iron, so it all balances out. Would purchase again, but hoping not to have to do that for many more years.",
