Gliding the French style pin in your hands is intuitive, and this pin is much simpler to clean. It is also more compact and fits in any drawer in my kitchen. I've primarily used this pin for pizzas and tortillas, as well as some other flat breads. As for this particular pin, it is well made, has a good heft and solid feel to it, is straight to the eye, and otherwise has no problems. And subtle flaws in the design have eluded me, if they exist, and I am perfectly happy with this pin.",
