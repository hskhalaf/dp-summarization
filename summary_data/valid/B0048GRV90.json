Definitely a great buy! and of course they are way cheaper here on amazon than in retail stores",

The size actually makes it a little easier to position and simulate a hook to the body. At their price point its hard to find a better value. *Update* After about a year of ownership and about 20 training sessions with these mits they have now become entirely useless. The threading on the connection between the glove and pad has come out all over. I would recommend spending your money on another set of mits.",

These are stiff and allow no movement or bendyness. This caused a lot of pain in my wrists and fingers, because I ended up bending the top of my my fingers and gripping the holes from the side. I managed, but looking back, it could have caused a hand injury. They also do not have any velcro so sometimes your hand feels it might slip out. They're not a bad price, they got the job done. But I will be purchasing more heavy duty ones.",
