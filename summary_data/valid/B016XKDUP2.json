There's some hold or compression which helps smooth out bumps. If they came one size larger I might be able to wear those but they probably wouldn't smooth out bumps as much.

I tried a pair of Bayleaf leggings at the same time, but I prefer the high waist of 90 degree. I am 5.6 and 125 lbs. I originally ordered a small, but had to exchange for an extra small because the waist wouldn't stay up and the fabric around the ankles was loose, which looked weird. The extra small fits better, but the waistband is quite snug and can be uncomfortable when seated. That's why I awarded 4 stars. Still, I am going to order another pair.",

They will not be warm enough. I really like the length--I'm 5'5\" with maybe a 30\" inseam, and lots of times leggings are just a wee bit too short to wear with booties.

I usually wear a Medium to a Large depending on the season (winter weight gain means my hips increase from 43\u201d to maybe 45\u201d+ \u263a\ufe0f). I bought these in a Large. First, the show every little bump & dip instead of smoothing over. I think they skimped on the inner lining. Secondly, they give easily instead of holding you in. Thirdly, the stitching & sheen on the fabric makes them look like workout leggings only which limits their versatility. I use mine for sleeping now so it was essentially wasting my money on fancy pajamas.",

Lastly, I live this fabric, it\u2019s warm and a yet still breathable. However, this is definitely NOT fleece lined.",

I have ordered many pairs over the last couple years, and continue to come back to them when I need new pairs. Just so easy to have them delivered to my door and I know they will fit. When I first bought them they were around $20. And then they crept up to $25, and I just paid $30 for this pair. Not too happy that the prices keep increasing. As long as they stay in the $30 and under price range I will continue to order them.",
