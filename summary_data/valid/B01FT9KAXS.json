      "text": "WRONG COLOR ARRIVED!!! It arrived, VERY LATE, almost thought it was lost with the runaround that UPS was giving me. Anyway, it arrived boxed in another box. I had marked BLUE? But was given GARNET. Really don\u2019t want to deal with repackaging and shipping it over again for the wrong color. Plus it\u2019s pretty heavy. So I\u2019m just keeping it. Other than wrong color and lateness, everything\u2019s good. Nice and sturdy, not cheap and flimsy looking. Color, although wrong, is nice. Easy to ride. Perfect for my 10 year old. Almost exactly what she asked for.",
