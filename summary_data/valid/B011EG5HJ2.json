Also, the wheels that you can buy to add to the experience are not worth the time or money. The apps I got online gave me a better virtual experience than the wheels did.

The cell phone needs to be inserted into the view master to work so if you get a call you can't answer it. I would recommend that if you buy this for your child, go to a phone store and purchase a used phone with no contract. Problem solved that easy.",

Much sturdier than the actual cardboard builds, this would be great for kids. The discs that come with it are overpriced and not all that engaging but it's an interesting toy. Cardboard content is still developing so eventually it will have more uses than it does currently.",
