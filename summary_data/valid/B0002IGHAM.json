      "text": "Quality tool for the price. Hickory handle with fair grain alignment. Solid head attached tightly with no gaps. When it arrived, edge was terribly dull and full of burrs. However, about 45 minutes of stone, sand, and leather later I got a razor sharp edge on it and a better profile. Knocked some kindling out of a chopped piece of hardwood, no problem. Surprisingly effective considering how short the handle is. I wanted a hatchet that carried well on a belt and had a good hammer poll. This short handled tool fit the bill. You need to provide your own sheath, though. I would recommend this tool highly.",

I drawered it unless I really needed to hit something to break it apart. This week, the head snapped off while chopping a rotting stump. This was definitely less than normal wear and tear. At closer inspection of the head, there didn't look like much wood holding it to begin with. Last time I buy a tool online without inspecting it personally.",
