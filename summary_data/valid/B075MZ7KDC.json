Fear of him accidentally turning the gas and/or burner on led me to this product. Super easy to install. I really thought it would be a major pain to use the knobs with these covers but I don\u2019t even give it a second thought now. Once in awhile I forget to put the cover back up and I feel like it would still be protected. Maybe not with a toddler that\u2019s outfitted with those thumb things but for our situation, we\u2019re good. Seem quite durable as well.",

These arrived promply, popped on effortlessly and are clear, so they do not obstruct the view of the temp control markers. They open/close easily with one hand to access the control. They can be secured with the included double side tape. We elected to leave them loose and it has worked fine. The first thing baby did when he came into the kitchen was make a bee line to the range and start flipping the covers! They just turned harmlessly. Very pleased with this purchase.",

I can not attest to the adhesion yet as i just installed them, but they seem sturdy enough.
