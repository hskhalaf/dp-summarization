If I had noticed high report of problems, I never would have purchased in the first place, despite glowing review on CNet. Returned for credit, but only got 80% of purchase price ($300 or $379) since it quit after 30 day warranty. Their warranty repair was messy and I didn't want to repair what was a lemon to start out with. Now I don't know what new chromebook I will buy next. I am still using my old HP. It won't be an ACER, that's for sure!",
