The nib end (with the transparent collar/disk) helps the stylus glide smoothly, without obstructing view of the tip. Nice to have two styluses in the kit, with extra replacement nibs and soft tips.

If you want to try a sketching style pen but either unsure or not willing to spend the 50 plus dollars for a bluetooth pen then give this one a try its worth the price especially as a starter pen or even a sturdy backup to a more expensive one",
