The instructions to attach and clean the bra make sense, the bra provides good coverage and doesn't create any unflattering lines under tops, and it stays on securely. I didn't rate this product higher because the stickiness is somewhat uncomfortable if you sweat in the bra and because I personally prefer more support along my sides. Otherwise, this bra works well for backless dresses or tops with large cutouts. Disclaimer: I received this product to test, but my opinions are still my own.",

They squashed me into an unnatural dome shape and pinched me in all around the edges of the cup. Hard to describe, but awful. I peeled them right off and put them in the trash.",

It push ups just the right amount. I don\u2019t feel overwhelmed with straps everywhere. It is seriously the best bra ever! Shipping was also next day and the buyer is absolutely amazing!!

Overall, I think its a great bra and I would recommend it. I got the one the snaps in the middle and I think ill probable try the one that glues on the side next.",

The self adhesive part sticks so well, and when taking the bra off there is no pain whatsoever. Very comfortable and looks great under clothes. It comes with photo instructions, with all the yes\u2019s and no\u2019s how to put it on. I have bras size B and C, so to be on the safe side I decided to go with B cup and it was the right decision as they run lil bit big. Overall a happy customer over here.",
