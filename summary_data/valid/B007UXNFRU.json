The other pair lasted a few years before the lining on the heel came loose and made the boots hard to get off as the lining would bunch up behind my heel, and when I put them on sometimes it would get under my heel. This pair had the same problem the first day I put them on. I am very disappointed as I usually equate Carhartt with quality products. I threw them away within a week and had to go buy a different brand.",

It\u2019s nearly the end of January and these boots are literally falling apart. 4 months worth of wear for almost $200 is not money well spent. I will say they stand true to being water proof but aren\u2019t light weight and rubbed my husbands heels raw the first month he tried breaking them in. Overall I don\u2019t suggest buying them and fully intend to go back to the Justin brand he was getting 18 months out of for $80 less. Disappointing purchase!",
