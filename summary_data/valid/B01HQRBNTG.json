When it broke, I went back to this company and decided to try them out again and I cannot recommend this product.

I still take it slow on pull-ups because I do not feel comfortable jerking the bar around, but probably shouldn\u2019t be jerking myself up anyways. It is low enough to the floor that I have to keep my legs bent to not touch the floor. But, it\u2019s a decent product at a reasonable price. It does what it was intended to do.",

The bar had been \"crimped\" on the opposite (wrong) side, causing the two pieces to fit in different directions. This renders everything completely useless.

Looks like a last second package job, I assume they put the wrong screws inside after someone else returned this item. Instructions say to put \u201cplastic-o-ring\u201d between both bars, but the long Allen bolt isn\u2019t even long enough to reach the other end! Can\u2019t even fasten it, so safe to say my assembly couldn't even get past step 1. Returned as soon as it was received.",
