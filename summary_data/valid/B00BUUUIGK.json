It is not heavy duty construction or stable at all..it is wobbly and wheels are not easy to direct and it is also a lot smaller than a Macwagon should be. It definitely seems collapsible as in will break while in use. It did come in a Macwagon box but it is NOT an authentic Macwagon. I have used a friend\u2019s Macwagon on numerous occasions which lead me to purchase my own. The carrying case does not have the logo. I will definitely be sending this back. I am so disappointed in this product!!!",

The description of the wagon indicates that it is \"great for beach trips\", as did a few reviews, however, on our first trip to the beach with the wagon, we found that the wheels would not move in the sand. I should have suspected such, with the slim wheels, but was a bit hopeful because the seller's description indicated it would be great for beach trips, which was my primary reason for buying the wagon. It was definitely smooth moving on the sidewalk, and held all our beach gear well. Just was a pain to drag through the sand.",

And even then, it wouldn't add a lot of strength. Better to buy a wagon with the front wheels embedded inside the corner verticals.

It was the last one I looked at and I loved the \"americana\"print. I plan on packing my blow up kayak in it and there's definitely enough room for it and my accessories. I'm so glad I purchased this one.",

We're seniors, ok? \ud83d\ude1c This little wagon is perfect ~ it folds up, making it easy to keep in the car. When we get back from shopping, all we need to do is \"unfold and load\" it, then wheel it to the building's front door, step into the elevator and within minutes, arrive at our door. Voila!",

No more taking multiple trips to unload my car. While camping I like to put my cooler and cooking gear in it. It handles uneven terrain fairly well. I would imagine that heavy duty use or repetitive use on dusty/muddy, uneven surfaces would probably break it. But, for light weight work like unloading the car or tailgating this thing is awesome.",

I compared this to the Ozark Trail wagon from Walmart which a friend had and this didn't match up to it. That one also cost less. It was a no brainer to return. Sorry Amazon I still love you. Never had any issues before, but this time I just found a better option.",

I'm old and weak (!) but even I have no difficulty folding it up and lifting it in and out of the car. I don't think it would work well on non-tarmac surfaces e.g. a beach because the wheels would need to be bigger and wider but for getting to / from a building on paved surfaces it's perfect.

The true useful inside measurements were: 31 1/2\" length, 17\" wide, 10\" deep. Barely gave enough container space to hold half of what I wanted in terms of height and so I had to use straps and load less on the wagon.",
