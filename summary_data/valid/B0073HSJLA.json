      "text": "I would rate this a so-so camera. I like the fact that it's a digital water camera, however, the pictures are not any better than a waterproof disposable camera. It doesn't matter how new the batteries, clarity is always an issue. If the camera or the focal point is moving in the slightest, the picture will be blurry. I have used this camera snorkeling and the pictures were alright. The water was unbelievably clear and the lightening was wonderful so I expected more from the photos. I have also used it at water parks and some of the pictures are clear enough to use. If I could do it over again., I would invest in a different camera.",

It may not have the resolution of the newest GoPros, but it is as good as I will ever need. It held up very well in the rain. The only problem I experienced was loss of battery power in near freezing temps. Not the camera's fault. New, warm batteries worked just fine. As soon as the batteries warmed up, they were good to go again.",

It takes photos, videos, allows some creative touches that are fun for kids and while the quality isn't always the best it will give your kid a good first experience with cameras.",

      "text": "I bought this camera to do home inspections. I thought it would be perfect. The problem I had is using the camera in low light to dark conditions like in a crawl space. The problem I had was the camera would not always flash. I sent it back to Nikon service twice and they said there was no problem. They said to set the camera at a close up setting and that would work. It didn't. The camera has no setting to have it always flash. It might be good for kids , but I think they have some bugs to correct.",
