Finally took a shot in the dark and came back to a buck but I'm completely unenthused. The knife is awkward in your hand it's hard to get in and out of your pocket with the rubber grip and it's difficult to use fully one handed. Slow to open. Also the seatbelt cutter got caught on my pants which is never happened to me before with a rescue knife and cut my pocket. So I'm down a pair of pants and not happy with a almost $50 knife.",

As with most knives of this style, the seat belt cutter would be next to impossible to resharpen. Not USA made.",

Imagine stuffing a slightly gummy, grippy, knife into your front jean pocket and walking around all day. It's also a little on the small side and I have pretty small hands for a guy. It's an ok knife, but not something I use or handle often. The handle issue makes this not possible for an every day carry item for me.",

I hound it on here for about 35 dollars and ordered it immediately. It has been great ever since i got it, it keeps a sharp edge and is very sturdy.
