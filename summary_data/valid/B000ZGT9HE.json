      "text": "This was super easy to put together for 1 person in just a few minutes. It took a 2nd person for 1 step, which was raising it up and putting 2 legs on. It is lightweight, sturdy, and it arrived quickly. The only reason it is not 5 stars is that the tie downs are sold separately and it is absolutely necessary to tie it down! I would definitely buy it again. 12-8-18 UPDATE: A month after setup we had our first snow, it didn't go well...granted it was a wet heavy snow but the canopy was completely destroyed. If you want to unhook the tarp before the snow then it will hold up, but what good is that?",

Four year later, my original king canopy still looks like new and my (3) cheap canopies have been torn up and blew down in the wind and rain. I just bought another King Canopy a few weeks ago for our camp. Going forward, I will only buy \"King Canopies\" for my outdoor \"Covering Gear/Equipment\" needs.
