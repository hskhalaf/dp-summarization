TriNova does give you a free something if you take a survey and give them your contact info to be bombarded by ads for other products ... but, not only is thee FREE product NOT another bottle of the product you purchased as promised, it is something not even related nor appealing and I'm guessing not as valuable. Bottom line ... buy this product only if you are OK with only getting ONE bottle of Tire Shine.",

It\u2019s all about prep too, make sure to use brake cleaner or a heavy detergent before application because it does well to repel water and other chemicals, which could lead to splotches on subsequent applications. I just purchased my 3rd bottle and can\u2019t rave enough about it! Amazing product all around",

It will have a high shine which will turn to satin after 3 or 4 days. Apply every other week and then every 3rd week after 3 or 4 apps. The best part? It won't sling all over the side of your car! Cooler temps may require longer dry times. 30 minutes is based on 75 degrees and higher",
