      "text": "I had always assumed that the manner in which Apple users praised their system and cursed Microsoft was nothing but propaganda but I was worn down by the relentless tales and I finally switched. Wow! the stories are absolutely true. Yosemite is to Windows 8 as a Derby winner is to a donkey on the beach. The laptop is wonderful and the graphics are absolutely superb. It seems churlish to find any faults but the need for a large touchpad makes the keyboard less comfortable and leaving out the DVD drive to make it slimmer is plain daft - I have never been convinced by any form over function argument!",
