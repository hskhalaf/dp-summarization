It fits perfectly on our Chicco KeyFit 30, is heavy enough to more or less stay put, looks nice, and the opening in the front makes it easy to check on the baby without waking him up. This keeps strangers from getting in his face, and also helps him stay asleep when he falls asleep in the car. Useful little blanket.",

This product has multiple shortcomings: 1) with the slightest of wind, canopy flips up from the back and becomes useless and difficult to constantly readjust; weight would help a bit; 2) the Velcro straps fall to the sides of the car seat handle causing the canopy to sag; 3) the \u201cminky\u201d interior material is not breathable, and on warm days causes my daughter to overheat. I have yet to wash the canopy to see how durable this canopy is but worry based on other reviews.",

The product is great, love the fact you can button up the front middle portion to either completely close or like I do and sometimes leave the very top button unbottened so that I can see my baby... the inside is very soft. It is not extremely thick not extremely light so it could be used in either type of climates. If it\u2019s too cold of course just have another blanket inside with the baby. You don\u2019t want to over cover your baby and get them sweaty and uncomfortable. Babies can sweat very quickly",

It is handy if you have the baby in a store or public place where you want to let the baby sleep, but that's about it. Once the cover gets blown somewhere it is such a pain to fix, If you plan to use this outdoors you'll spend most of your time adjusting it to keep light out, or pulling it away from the babies face.",

Only thing I don't like is I wish it was a little longer on the sides. But with a little adjusting I'm able to make sure the sides are covered. This only matters when it's cold or windy.",
