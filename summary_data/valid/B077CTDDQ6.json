The phone's battery life is shockingly weak. For regular usage, the phone has be charged at least 2 times daily. Also, it has some of the worst ringtones and sadly, it doesn't give any options to upload external ringtones. I'd return this phone if it hadn't crossed the Atlantic.",

It is in good condition for a used phone with no scratches on the screen, it does have a few small chips in the paint, but again, for a used phone it is in really good condition. I was easily able to get it activated, and have noticed no problems with the phone after a few days of regular use. I would definitely buy from this seller again!",

The only thing that I was surprised about was the size. I thought it was bigger, but it's a great phone anyway. Super fast, definitely since I upgraded from the first generation pixel XL. I would definitely give this a 5 star, and also it came very new looking. Very little scratches.",
