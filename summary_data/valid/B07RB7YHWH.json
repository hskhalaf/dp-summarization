      "text": "Having owned the last 4 pairs of Powerbeats - I\u2019m an avid gym goer - I find these are An absolute dream. No wires, intuitive controls and AMAZING sound. Being a musician and somewhat of an audiophile, I do like a high sound quality running through my ears, these don\u2019t disappoint. Though not true audiophile headphones, for a truly wireless set they are heavenly. Bass response is still in your face but has been tuned slightly to be more \u2018grown up\u2019 sounding, trebles sing and mids are nice and pronounced. Perfect for gym, travelling, moving and just listening in general. If you like Beats or want a fun, excitable sound with a dead secure fit, these are for you.",

It took 2 weeks to receive a box to return them to apple. They replaced a faulty left earpiece. Dont be tempted they are unreliable many gym friends say exactly the same. Rubbish expensive and once the one year warranty wears out thats that. ie \u00a3 20 a month for a year for a set of headphones that you then have to throw away.",

They\u2019re supposed to be IPX4 rated which protects against water splash from all directions, yet within a month the product had developed a fault which Apple told me was \u201ccorrosion caused by water damage\u201d which invalidates the warranty. I would not recommend using them outdoor. And be careful not to sweat too much either..",

One problem I'm not sure whether is because of it is that the music can be discontinuous occasionly. Most likely It's the problem of my phone or the Apple Music, since it also occurred on my previous earphones.",
