This watch being solar is very convenient in the long run. No going to the store to get a battery replaced. The leather strap on this watch is definitely on the \"tough\" side. I really had to work it to get it bend around my wrist easily. However it does look nice once it's softened. Overall very happy with the quality on the glass, the face, and the housing.

Ultimately, not having to replace a battery sold me on it and I couldn't be happier with it. Love the style -- you can wear it with business clothes or jeans and a tshirt. The design is simple and elegant. I like that the hands glow in the dark, there is no second hand, and the date window is just a date. Having a cell phone, I hadn't worn a watch for years. I now wear this one every day.",
