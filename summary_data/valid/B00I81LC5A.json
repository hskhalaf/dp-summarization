The biggest problem I\u2019ve faced is the adapter for the 22 rod is too large to fit a patch down the barrel and will not clean a 5.56. The two compartments on top of the case are also extremely tight and hard to close which makes them a pain to actually use. Other than these two issues everything else in the kit works well enough. If you\u2019re looking for a general cleaning kit and don\u2019t specifically need it for cleaning a .22 or 5.56 then this is a good kit for the price.",
