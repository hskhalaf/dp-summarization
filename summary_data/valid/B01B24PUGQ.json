So anyway, putting on takes some getting used to and taking off the waist strap can get tedious. I love how cushioned it is from every angle. It's not something that easily fits into a bag so if that's something you are counting on, don't waste your time. I love this carrier and I look forward to carrying my little one facing out now that he can hold his head. I will update once I try every carrying position!",

The hip belt provides great support and the extra \"click\" on the buckles is a smart safety feature.

I plan to give it a try on friday 11/27/2013 at an event im going to and see if maybe i was just so tired and achy from sleep deprivation (my son is 7 weeks old and crys ALL night) I will update and let you all know if i plan to return it.

Wish the fabric was a little more breathable (since it's so hot out already and we were hoping to get more use out of the carrier outdoors), but overall GREAT design. I love that my little one is secure and in a position she likes. I look forward to being able to use all the other positions (since we only use the front/facing in right now). Glad it comes in a flat black, too, so my husband doesn't hesitate about wearing it. ;)",

The only thing about the mesh material is that it's pretty rough on baby's skin so I have to put a small towel or blanket at the bottom especially when she's not wearing pants. Baby likes to be able to see outside and this one is recommended for good posture.",

He falls asleep almost immediately when I put him in it. I know I am going to enjoy the option of facing him outwards once he gets a little older. This is a great carrier!!",
