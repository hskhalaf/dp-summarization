I have none of the \"crazy\" dreams that I have with other products and if I do wake up during the night, I fall back to sleep immediately. This product has not caused me to worry or fret when I wake up during the night. I am so drowsy that I fall back asleep almost immediately.

They interrupted sleep, my thinking, and soaked me day, and night. They caused severe exhaustion and killed my workouts. This stuff made all of that go away from the 1st pill!!!!! After a few weeks I have now added a pill after workouts and that is great. The muscle soreness is far less than ever. Great product I highly recommend. My husband is so happy how it works he is gonna start taking it for his energy and workouts too.",

My only complaint is the price is too high, but once a customer they occasionally have offered up no-strings discounts here and there, even buy-1-get-1-free, which helps. I do wish they would lower the normal price, their cost is likely a small fraction of the current price.",

I have also been INCREDIBLY stressed out for almost 2 years due to finances, relationships, etc. I knew about cortisol and wondered if this could make a difference. While I DID notice a big difference after a few weeks of taking the Cortisol Health Suppliment, I knoticed a HUGE difference when I ran out of my supplements and procrastinated RE-ordering them. I have gotten more squishy in my tummy, grumpy and I have slept like crap! So I\u2019m ordering some TODAY! And I think I\u2019m going to also try the Insulin Health as well!!",

She started using the product in April and within days she was sleeping uninterruptedly. As for her tummy area, it hasn't gotten worse--which is a plus-- but she cannot say for sure that she has seen much improvement there. She wants to keep taking it as it really helps her sleep better.",
