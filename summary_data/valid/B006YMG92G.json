If you enjoy this you should also try the PS2 games, Generations (II and III) and Heritage of War. Growlanser III is also very good and the second best of the series. You can get HoW cheap digitally for PS3 on the PS Store.",

      "text": "This is a much deserved return to the traditional gameplay mechanics of the first two growlanser games in the series. It's definitely a great addition that adds to the overall success of the franchise, especially after playing the lackluster Heritage of War. Quite ironic that the stateside release had this game localized and shipped years after Heritage of War.",

And having played II, III and V I didn't think it was possible to be better than II. Gladly I was mistaken, IV truly is the best of the series. It is long, has hundreds of choices, a great combat system and this PSP version even has other storyline branches the original didn't have. If you ever enjoyed the other titles in English, or just want something new to pickup and try that'll last you a while I highly suggest you get this game.",
