What's up with that??? It's not okay to gouge dark skinned people because you added a drop more color.",

The first tube was rather thick, the second was more watery and now I've gotten the thick again. The thinner consistency covered better that the thick. My friend also uses this product and has experienced the same thing in different tubes she's gotten. It's a nice, light base... I wear it when going to the gym to save on the cost of using my more expensive base.",
