I also keep having issues with the fabric not fanning out well in the rings, but I'm hopeful that will improve as it softens from use.

      "text": "I've never been huge on baby wearing but I fly with my daughter periodically so I need some kind of carrier to keep my hands free. I like the simplicity of the ring sling but I couldn't justify spending $90 on a piece of fabric with a metal ring, I just didn't get it. Amazon to the rescue! I found this sling and love it. The color is cute, it washes well, and it's comfortable for me and baby girl. I don't use it super often, but I like not dealing with clips, zippers, buckles, and other mechanisms. Highly recommend!",

My problem is... the honeycomb texture prevents proper usage! You can\u2019t adequately get the rails to sit flat and therefore there is always slippage. The texture is uncomfortable on the skin and i stopped using it after 2 months of trying to get used to it. But a flat textured one, I haven\u2019t used them but I am sure they work a hell of a lot better than this honeycomb one.",

So, be careful hang-drying it. Personally, I hesitated to wash it in my machine. So, I hand-washed it in cold water and I\u2019m glad I did. So much fabric dye gets everywhere.
