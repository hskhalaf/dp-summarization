The brush has a rubber gripped handle which makes it comfortable to use. The bristles glide nicely through dry or damp hair. Doesn't make your hair staticky or break your hair. Leaves hair smooth, shiney and manageable, amazingly it also cuts down on the drying time. Love this brush!",

My hair is thin so I appreciate the boars hair which pulls less on my hair and allows me to still get some lift in my hair style. I also love that the brush is one solid piece so no hair gets caught in any seams. Thank you for a wonderful product.",
