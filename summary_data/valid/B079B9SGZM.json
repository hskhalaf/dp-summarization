This usually takes a two or three attempts to correct. I've tried removing and re-adding it, different plugs, and none of it helps. Pros: fits standard wallplate Cons: Very finicky\u2014often does not work on first or second try If this became a little more reliable and added HomeKit (surprising absence in the iDevices lineup), this product would increase a star or two.",

Certainly not fun to try and turn lights on or off unsuccessfully and have to pull your phone out anyway. Alexa works about 95 amd this is their own product. Strange. Looked for a firmware update because I thought there\u2019s no way this can be this bad but alas no fw update available. Pros: easy and flawless setup. Cons: it doesn\u2019t activate the switch when you press the device; it doesn\u2019t work.",

Now when I turn one light off, another follows with very minimal delay. Problem solved. I also appreciate the slim design and standard gang sizing. I just increased the size switch plate and have a very clean look - couldn't tell that it is not hardwired. Setup was relatively easy once I realized that it only paired with one device.",

If you have 4 switches connected to turn on the lights in your room, for example, it will turn on one of them, but not all 4. They don\u2019t say it will...so I\u2019m not complaining. Just reminding you when you plan your system you should keep that in mind.",

After waiting a bit and hitting it several times, the Instant Switch turns its associated plug off. And so on. I don't know if I'm just not hitting the Instant Switch in the sweet spot, or if it just needs to juice up before sending a signal, but it's not fast. Other than that, they turn iDevice plugs on and off. 3 stars for doing the job, but slowly and poorly.",
