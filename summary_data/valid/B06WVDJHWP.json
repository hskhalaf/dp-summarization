      "text": "My girls absolutely loved this as they love dress up, however, the jewelry fell apart in one day. Super cheaply made but the kids don\u2019t know that, they just love to click around in their heels. The bows/decoration on each shoe comes off and the little attachment to it once lost is hard to find. Overall they are a hit and don\u2019t squeeze or hurt their little feet like others I\u2019ve seen.",
