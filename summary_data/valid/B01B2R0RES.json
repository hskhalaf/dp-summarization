The fabric is itchy, but it's fiberglass, so that is to be expected. My only real complaint is that one of the handles ripped halfway off the first time I took this out of the bag. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a huge deal since I consider this product to be single use like a fire extinguisher. I ended up putting grommets through the corners and making my own handles which turned out to be a much better solution than sewing them back on.",
