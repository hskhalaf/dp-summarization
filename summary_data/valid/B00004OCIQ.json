And that probably the first and last time I'll ever write the word \"corer\". Pretty hard to actually mess this product up, but it's remarkably useful. It cores away regardless of apple size. Sometimes you miss the center and have to try again; sometimes the core is too large and you have to have a 2nd go. Pop the core out with your finger, rinse in the sink, and enjoy your freshly cored apple.",

I'm disappointed enough where I might just cut the apple again. The diameter of the corer is small so you have to thrust the corer through the apple several times (3-4xs) to get all of the core, and it immediately causes your apple to turn brown from the cutting. I and my son like to eaty fresh apples and the brown make them unappealing.",

This is an excellent tool and great idea ... but could be better. Review Update: On 5/18/14 I sharpened the corer and uploaded a picture to the product description. My corer now has a sharpened cutting edge that moves through the item very smoothly and reduces browning on cored apples.",

Look inside and you can use the tool to precisely remove any remaining core bits. It rinses right off. The reason I bought this thing is because I like to give my kid apples, but I don't want her eating the seeds (they contain arsenic).",

Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple, but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "A great tool as are all OXO tools I've tried. I understand they cannot make it too sharp for safety reasons, but if it were just a little sharper it would be 5 stars. Being dull, it's safe, but requires too much pressure to push through an apple. Ironically, applying the extra pressure actually makes it less safe because it's not as stable when one has to push so hard.",
