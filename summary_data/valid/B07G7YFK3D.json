      "text": "So this is my first time buying jordans online and I like amazon so I decided to give a try cause I wanted these kicks. So the shoes came in right box but there was some dirt marks on bottom of shoe that look like they might have been worn then cleaned ? But other than that they seem to be fine but didn't buy used so I was a little disappointed .",

I\u2019ve bought foams for the past couple years and I\u2019ve never had a pair in this condition sold to me, I sent it back within an hour of it getting here. Check your product before mailing it because I wasted my money & waited for them to come in the mail for nothing.",
