I've replaced the original NiCd batteries with NiMh batteries from Expert power, and in all cases they have had better life and much better run time than the original batteries at about half the price. Just be sure that your charger will handle the NiMh batteries. The black and decker and Makita chargers I had worked fine, but the Dewalt had to be replaced. No problem, you can by a new charger from these guys too. Excellent company, Excellent batteries. Just save the caps from the old ones to reuse with the new ones.",

I for one do not know how they get such a high rating given that they seem to just all of a sudden...DIE. Year one, great, year two fail. Charge them up go to use them, get one or two (with luck) screws put in and they just wind down to slug pace and finally give up all juice. The red Engitech units purchased years before these still work fine, although they don't hold a charge for as long as they used to. I suspect it is time to upgrade to Lithium-Ion batteries which means a whole new drill. Sad.",

The pinch-clips fit far too tightly, hopefully they will wear down a bit in time. EDIT, January 2015---- Batteries still fine. Just as good or better than the originals. I don't use them daily, but when I do use them, I use them very heavily. No complaints at all. They also are not hard to remove from the drill anymore like they were originally. When I first got them, you basically had to be Thor to get them off, but now they come off normally.",

Unfortunately, they won't hold a charge after 20 months of very light use. The charger shows a green light after a few minutes but their voltage drops rapidly. So rapidly that I can't even drive in 4 screws before they're dead. My Makita batteries lasted around 10 years. If you're okay with replacing batteries every year or so, then you might be happy with them. But if you're expecting OEM performance and longevity, they'll fall short of the mark.",
