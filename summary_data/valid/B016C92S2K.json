It was dropped on the playground, and shuffled everywhere we went. Even given the heaviness of his load, this backpack never broke a singe thing. Even after the school year ended it is completely intact. It\u2019s hard to find a backpack that survives my 12 year old the entire school year like this one did. I will be getting a new one since I washed up the old one and it is now my husbands.",

This bag is able to hold my basketball, a pair of size 11.5 shoes, as well as space for water bottles, supplements and valuables. The top zipper is great for storing valuables such as phone and headphones as the pockets are lined and soft. The two side compartments hold my supplements and shakers. Overall, a very stylish and good looking product. Under Armour hit it out of the park with this one. I was hesitant spending $50+ on a gym bag, but this bag is certainly worth the investment.",

I'm putting on it: full size basket ball, training shoes, socks, shirt, underwear and a couple of accessories. And still I have some spare space. Recommended.",

Update: this backpack is simply amazing! It lasted him ALL year, with no damage & im considering using it for ANOTHER year because it is such great shape! I just bought him a 4 INCH binder & wondered if it would fit inside the top/main opening....IT DOES!!! 2 thumbs up!!!",

Could only give this item 4 stars because realistically, this bag is slightly smaller overall than a Rothco (blk) book bag that I purchased earlier, & the Rothco bag only cost me less than 1/3 what this bag cost me. But I purchased this for the color scheme & because this bag is more compartmentalized than the Rothco. So overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase, I'm just not so sure that a $69 price tag is justifiable for such a small bag, if it was more in the $50 - $55 range (or less) 5 STARS.",
