The only way to get the Li-ion battery is to purchase it separately from Brady ($85) or buy the BMP21-PLUS kit for and addition $100. The kit does include a charger which would be the only way possible to charge the battery, so you probably should not buy the battery unless you buy the charger too.",

      "text": "I had a BMP21 working with a Laser company. It was definitely a great tool so I bought the PLUS for my home project use. Great tool, user friendly, I'm building my house as I go so this maybe a little overboard but labeling my electric, phone, cable, Ethernet and so on really helps keeping things straight. You may not get to work on it for a while so it is definitely easy to have these labels on the cables, helps you jump back in the game without delay of re tracking what goes where. The Brady BMP21-PLUS has an honest price and I feel at this time is very durable and user friendly.",

Very easy to use, although I haven't explored all the functions. Only slight niggle is the keyboard - QWERTY would be better, but this may not be a niggle for those working mainly with numerical/symbol labels.",

      "text": "Initially I was using this for wiring and circuit breakers, works great for short labels. Then I wanted to make a longer label in large type - easy right? No. This unit allows you to enter the text then errors out saying its too big and deletes all your data entered. Yes I tried setting the label type. This unit is hard to use, confusing and has a very terrible user interface. If you have a single purpose for this like wires it is probably OK. If you want to label a variety of other things - this unit falls very short. It now sits in a drawer because it is so useless.",

BMP21-PLUS has ultra rugged construction and world class materials combined in a toolbox-ready fit-in-your-palm label printer that produces continuous-only labels up to 3/4\" wide. Choose from 70 label parts across 8 incredibly durable materials including self-laminating wire markers, heat-shrink wire sleeves, cable flags, 8-to-10-year outdoor vinyl, nylon cloth wire and panel labels, terminal block and patch panel labels, and chemical-resistant polyester and polypropylene. When it comes to durability, the BMP21-PLUS has heavy-duty molded-rubber impact bumpers and an optional hard carry case, and it has been drop-tested to MIL drop-test standards.
