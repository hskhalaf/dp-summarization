It was so easy to get started I thought I was doing something wrong. It's not very loud either which is nice! I highly recommend this dishwasher.",

Then suddenly, we started to see stains left on the dishes and tried multiple runs on same dishes so that they can get cleaned. And after couple of weeks, it got worse and even multiple runs did not solve the issue. Basically it stops resolving the cleaner (we tried tablets, powder, liquid cleaner) from the dispenser. I took this pic this morning after 2x longest program run and 2 tablets are almost never dispensed and so the dishes were terrible! So I am not sure what the problem is but I do not recommend this product if you are planning to use it more than 2 months.",

With proper positioning, my 10.25\u201d plates fit with room to spare. Dishes come out clean. Much easier to install than the directions describe. The quick-connect hoses make it ridiculously easy, but note, the directions have not caught up with the assembly provided. The assembly is so easy! Just make sure your faucet has a threaded end. Great machine. Easy to install. Mine is on a rolling cart. Perfect!",

      "text": "I bought it because there was no way I could either fix the ailing dishwasher or replace it. It is noisy for sure, when running. Help from the company is poor, in fact they just repeat what appear on the FAQ's, I ran into some issues with the plumbing. Also, don't be fooled by the fact it says it is counter-top. These products are easy to install (no doubt), but they occupy a large amount of counter-top space. Since the time I purchased it to the time this review appears, the old dishwasher was finally replaced. This is now on a standby mode, though we doubt it will be used that often. But, it worked as a good replacement.",

When it was shipped to me, I had to go to the post office to pick it up because they couldn't just deliver it in one of the little mail trucks. So...UPS anyone? It's also quite heavy, a little over 50 lbs with all of the shipping material. (To be expected as it IS a dishwasher!)",

Also, it hurts my back to stand at the sink and do dishes. She wants nothing to do with it and considers it an obtrusive eyesore on the counter. I LOVE IT! because it gets the dishes CLEAN and SANITIZED, it is very easy to use, remarkably quiet and spaceous, and portable. Yes Virginia, you CAN take it with you!",

I put the dishwasher through the test with all sorts of food stains and the only thing it didn\u2019t get was caked on sticky rice. Amazing! Clever design on the inside makes use of the limited space. The washing process itself is quiet but the draining sound is sudden and scary lol so I can\u2019t run it before bed but I don\u2019t mind.",
