My gym has thin carpet floors and I met more friction than necessary when moving the sled. I took it outside to attempt to push in the grass and the sled just dig into the ground. I have not tried it on turf yet. A little worried that the plastic shoes may mess up the turf. I am very displeased with this sled.",
