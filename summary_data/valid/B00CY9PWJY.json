This device is used as a rear projector; this means the image must be crisp and visible over 100ft. away. The high powered 3,000 lumen bulb and HDMI ports allow for this distance and more. We haven't used it for any 3D projecting so do not know how well that works however.",

Have had others comment on the clarity and features that come with it. This replaced a LCD 50\" TV that was hard on the eyes playing COD Ghosts and Black Ops II. Never had tears or strain on my eyes playing long rounds of zombies or extinction. Would highly recommend to anyone who doesn't own a DLP projector or knows the difference between the other OLED, LCD, or older models. World War Z is just mind blowing in 3D :P",
