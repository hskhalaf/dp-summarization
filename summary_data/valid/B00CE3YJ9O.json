The portable pendant is too big to wear around a neck, but we tied it to her walker and she can walk around her home with security knowing she can contact us at anytime. She can also answer incoming phone calls and know who is calling with the voice caller ID with the portable pendant. Also, there is no monthly fee. Just purchase the product, set it up, and you are ready to use. Don't waste your money with lifeline or any other service that charges you!",

      "text": "We previously bought this for our main home and like it so much that we got another one for our city apartment. It does the job without subscribing to a for-pay service. We have button 1 set to my cell number, and button 2 to our daughter. My wife has dementia so I remind her each time to press 1 if she needs to reach me, and I'm never away for long. It would be a bad idea to have a button set to 911. She has accidentally called me or our daughter several times .and it would have been very bad if she had reached 911 and not spoken to them.",
