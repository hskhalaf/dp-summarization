I've tried three different styles, but all hand grips on the dumbbells I encounter in my travels are larger than will fit in the kettle gryp. Great concept, but turns out to be useless. Buyer beware, this is definitely money down the drain. Here's hoping someone else will run with the idea and create a version that works!",

Considering what the cost of a new, or even used, 35 lb kettlebell would be, this is a great alternative.

The only downsides are the ones that are impossible to fix compared to a real kettlebell. The resulting combination of this handle and a barbel is much taller than a kettlebell. So if you are doing anything like a Clean, it will flop back. Its hard to do a clean smoothly. Also, the resulting combination of this handle and your dumbbell is wider than a kettlebell. So if you keep the bell up high when doing swings, you may need to Sumo out more.",

The manufacturer claims their Kettle Gryp will accept dumbbell handles up to 1.5 inches in diameter. This is true only if you remove the rigid foam inserts, which are bonded in. With the inserts in place, the Kettle Gryp will only work for handle diameters up to about 1-1/8 inch. So if you have coated dumbbells, e.g., neoprene or vinyl, the Kettle Gryp will not work unless you permanently remove the foam inserts, and even then coated dumbbells may still not fit. For those of you with CAP style dumbbells with uncoated steel handles, Kettle Gryp will probably work.",

      "text": "So as the title says this is about the best way I have seen to really take your home gym to another level for under $40! instead of spending hundreds of $$$ on various kettle bells you can simply convert the dumbells you already have! I have used 3 different handle sizes and it works fine. The only thing I will say that's not ideal (really not the products fault) is once you start using heavier weights it becomes a bit clunky and awkward to use without taking an exaggerated leg width stance. Otherwise a good purchase!",

It snaps on quickly and allows you to have a range of kettle bells without having to buy them all in different sizes. Great addition to the stay-at-home gym!",

One thing that I don't like very much is that there is no sort of grip on the handle. The plastic feels like it might slip out of your hands if your hands are sweaty, not a good feeling when you're swinging around a 40lb dumbell. I've remedied this myself with grip tape and weight lifting gloves but it's something to keep in mind.",

Cons: it feels a little too light and I worry it'll break when I'm flinging especially heavy weight. This hasn't happened, and I'm sure it's been tested so I'm not too worried.
