They deducted $6.00 from my refund - not cool!! Very, very disappointed and feeling misled.",

I\u2019m a 6.5, but I bought a 7 (which were a tiny bit big at the toe) because my feet swell in the heat, I plane to hike in these and swim. The material is soft, I dont foresee getting any blisters in these. I have wide feet, the width was not an issue. The part around the ankle is soft neoprene. I just hope they last a few hikes in rocky Hawaii. Worth it for the price.",

There's no support for your feet & would actually in my opinion they would be bad for your feet if you're standing up for very long . These may have been worth about $8.00 at the most. Returning would cost more than they're worth.",

They felt comfortable(they weren't too tight or stiff) material was nice, and overall a nice quality. I don't imagine you'd want to wear these on an extensive hike because they are just a water shoe. I'll update after this weekend how they held up in the water, how quickly they dried, and whether they were slick on Creek rock.",

They are light weight and dry overnight if you take the insoles out or more quickly if you leave them in the sun. Pretty comfortable and easy to get on and off. They gave me additional traction on slippery rocks. A little sand will come through the mesh and small pebbles got stuck in the outside bottom of the sole but it didn't bother me and wasn't hard to get them out.

Yet walking on sidewalk, rocks or gravel, it is still comfortable and I don't see any nicks on the bottom. I originally thought they might fall off when I was walking but that has not happened.

They did dry rather fast and were comfy for standing for long hours on my board, I didn't end up with any blisters after 4 hours like with other watershoes. 4/5 stars only because they are kind of wide and can't be tightened since they don't have actual laces, just elastic. For the price they were a good buy and just what I needed for my weekend camping trip.",

Thus I am unable to get the shoe on my left foot since I cannot loosen the strings. They are permanently in place, and cannot be loosened enough to get on my foot. Also the right shoe is a little small, so I should have ordered a size larger. I need to return the shoes. How do I do that?",
