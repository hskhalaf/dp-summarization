The little rosebuds in the bottle are a nice touch as well! :-) I received excellent customer service from this company! The first bottle I got didn\u2019t smell right. I reviewed it on their website and was immediately contacted with a friendly email. I received a new bottle within days that smelled wonderful! I am 100% happy with both the service I received and this awesome oil! Thank you Amaki!",

My skin is on the dryer side so I can't say how this would do for super oily skin but for combo/dry skin I highly recommend it. Great for winter months as well.",
