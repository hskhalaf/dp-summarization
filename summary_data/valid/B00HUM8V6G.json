However, everything worked well and received delivery on time with no problems at all. There was an option to plug the Microwave into the Oven, but that was necessary because we had an additional outlet.",

Make sure to confirm measurements of your opening prior to purchase. My cabinet opening turned out an inch shallow because I assumed similar size of the old oven. Not a big deal really and I may retrofit it at some point. The shipping was great and the packaging was almost all recyclable which is unusual for this kind of thing.",

This replaces a 20 year old Jenn Air unit that had all the bells and whistles. This one has fewer extras, but was also much less expensive and we are very happy with it so far. Overall ordering through Amazon was a very positive experience for us. Would order from this vendor again.",
