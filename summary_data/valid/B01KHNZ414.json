There is a space for a water bag, I put a 3 liter bag in and there is even a slot through the sleeve for the tube and straps to hold the bag (see photo), the tube goes through the right side. Light weight as well. UPDATE: I\u2019ve now had this for a couple years and put many miles on it, I use it all the time for day hikes and cycling. Still looks new, no issues at all. I want to add that I\u2019m impressed with the odor resistance. I get pretty bad but this doesn\u2019t catch it.",

It was pouring rain and I put the rain cover this thing came with on, it ripped while I was putting it on, that was one of the huge advantages of this backpack!!!! Also seems as if the stitches are already wearing out around the whole backpack. Seems like quality. Not so much anymore :/***** This backpack is great! It holds a good amount of product, comes with a rain protector, backpack net, chest/stomach straps various pouches. I fit everything I need in here and more! I\u2019ve hooked up multiple things to the straps on the bottom as well and they hold up.",

I like that it has 2 mesh pockets on the inside to hold anything from bouncing around, and a few other pockets to hold everything needed for walks with a dog. It feels pretty sturdy, but is light. I'm a larger shoulder man and have no issues strapping it to me. It doesn't have a lot of excess strap around my chest or stomach, but still fits comfortably. The only complaints I have is that some of the reflective printed material is rubbing off and the back padding isn't real thick so it doesn't allow a lot of air flow.",

What i like about it is that it holds shape very well and doesn't collapse on you. There's a stiff board that runs along its length which does this. It's a solid build, had got a rain proof cover and sits really comfortably on your shoulders.",

I own several Camlbaks, but was looking for a cheap alternative (without the water bladder) as a daily beater commute rig and this absolutely checks all the required boxes. Very handy for a aero commute bag that fits a change of clothes, food, and daily necessities. Waist strap takes the pressure off your shoulders and the helmet net is admittedly very useful, making bike commuting long distance into an office environment much easier.",
