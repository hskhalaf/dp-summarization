Also, odor is almost as bad as the worst offender in my 6-brand lineup - not what I expected when advertised as low odor. For the disappointing half inch wide small braids in the bag, the price per braid is not worth it. If they all were the advertised size, that would change.",

We only give our dog the bully during meals when he is on his bed (and not under the table). One 12\" bully will last 2-3 meals. They do have a smell, but I only notice when opening the bag.

Of course, Peyton is kind of big, but only 6 months old, so someone with a more experienced or larger dog may find they don't last as long.

Our 11 week old Labrador pup had no problems managing these large braided sticks. They are about an inch wide. The first one out of the package measured just over 12\u201d. Twelve inches gives us about 10 inches of bully stick because when she gets down to the last couple of inches we\u2019ll take it away so it doesn\u2019t get swallowed. I like that these are braided as I believe it will last her longer than a single strand 12\u201d stick. Very pleased with this product.",

The rest were ranging from really thin half inch to a bit more than that. My 5 months old labradoodle chewed threw the thin ones in one day! Cost per bone would make more sense if consistency was better. Was going to buy a larger pack but now will look elsewhere",
