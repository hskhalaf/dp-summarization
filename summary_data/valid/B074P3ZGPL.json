      "text": "This product was very nice when I initially got it. I thought that it was just what I had been wanting to keep my feet warm when working outside in the winter with horses and loved the remote control. Basically, after the first time of washing the socks, they barely heated up any longer. The instructions state that it is okay to put the socks in the washer, but not the dryer. However, I wonder if I had hand-washed the socks if it would have made a difference. For the price, this was an extremely disappointing purchase.",

I work outside and was really looking forward to these socks. I can tell you, without even going outside, that they are completely useless. After putting them on and not noticing any heat on my feet I decided to try something. I put one bare foot in my boot, and the other with this sock on. They're was no difference that I could tell. The heat output is so little you can't even feel the difference between this sock and a bare foot. Don't waste your money on this product. I am returning mine",

Many other models just warm the bottom of your foot, but this actually has heating elements around the toes. We use these when skiing and anytime we are outside. I noticed some complaints about the socks being very tight, but just order a little larger than you need and they will be perfect. The power charger takes a few hours but they last a long time even in the high heating mode.",
