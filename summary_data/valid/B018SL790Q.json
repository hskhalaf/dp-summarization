Love the simplicity of the withings and the looks. It is nowhere near as clunky on my small wrist as the versa and looks way better. I like the healthmate app very much. Best $36 I ever spent. I believe this will motivate me to move more as the count is way more accurate.",

I suspect if you used it to track walking activity as an exercise, it does okay. But if you are used to counting all of your steps in a day, you will be very disappointed.",

It is waterproof with the origin watch band, but I change it with a leather one because it looks cool. It doesn't have a screw on it, the time is set and calibrate on your phone. One problem, a serious one if a precise time is important for you, the time is not precise. For two weeks the watch can be fast or slow five minutes, it happens, so just don't forget to calibrate it.",
