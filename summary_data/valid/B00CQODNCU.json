I installed dusk-to-dawn bulbs in these and they work great for less than half the LED units, and you can actually change the bulbs in these, like at Halloween or Christmas when I like to put colored lights up. My only gripe is that these are NOT oil rubbed bronze, even though that's what the box says. They are just straight black with no texturing. And they are smaller than I expected. I took a picture next to my old dusty broken LED pieces of crap.",

It looks way better in person than the picture...and the pictures looks nice. My boyfriend hung it for me in about 15 minutes after getting out of box; it's pretty and works great, no problems. I particularly liked that it takes up to 100 watt bulb, whereas most 'affordable' fixtures seem to support 60 watt, and another big plus is that the bottom is open so you don't have to disassemble anything to simply change the bulb.

If they are under an overhang outside, they are okay, but if they are at all exposed to light and rain, they fade and rust terribly. Even the ones that only get minimal light and rain have some fading and rusting. They are a decent price and easy to install, so if you have them in a side area or under an overhang, I think you'll be fine. But if you have them in an open space, I would definitely not recommend buying these.",

So I had to use the included hardware which did not fit with my outlet box and I had to hacksaw the heads off the mounting screws to make it fit securely. I spent probably 3 hours removing existing hardware and installing two new lanterns in freezing temperatures. The lantern is also a bit smaller than I would have preferred. I am satisfied but not over-joyed.",
