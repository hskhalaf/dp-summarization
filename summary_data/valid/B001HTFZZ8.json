Historically I've used a slant board to stretch my calves but after using this the first time I had some difficulting walking the next day as my calves were so sore. I have extremely large calves that always elicit comments in the gym and I firmly believe that the reason they are so large is because of the amount of calf stretching that I did in my youth but these exceed anything I've ever used before. I think that if I had these when I was younger that my calves now would be bigger around than my thighs.",

The double ProStretch allows for a much greater stretch than the single ProStretch. The secret is to place one foot in one of the cradles to stretch that foot and leg, then enhance the stretch by placing the forefoot of your other foot on top of the heel cup of the empty cradle and adding weight to that side to increase the stretch. From reading other reviews of this product it seems that many people are unaware of this technique.",

This has been a miracle cure for me since I am always at the gym on either the treadmill or elliptical machines. It actually helped cure my plantar fasciitis. I also gave this as a wedding gift and the bride uses it daily now to help with her sciatica. One of those exercise equipment pieces that really works! Money well spent.",
