And the battery life when not plugged in is rubbish. Not only that, our older model had a little hole in the bottom of the camera unit which allowed you to mount it. This one clearly requires some kind of secondary product to facilitate the same feature. It's a hole where something screws in. Not happy.",

      "text": "We bought this to replace our vtech monitor that stopped working abruptly after 9 months of use. Really disappointed with this one. The camera is super low quality so it is almost as if there is a delay in the screening. Doesn't feel like real time, with a lot of motion blur. Also, the camera periodically blacks out for about 30 seconds to a minute. I don't know if that is just because the one we received was damaged, or if all of them would do that. The quality of the vtech camera was SO much better that we are just going to purchase the old monitor we had again with a two year protection plan this time.",

The sound is great on it, I will add! If you\u2019re a second-time, third-time, fourth-time and so on mom, and you want to be able to see your baby, but don\u2019t care too much about the video quality this is a great monitor for you!",
