Now, after around a year, the power button on the replacement does not work at all, which has rendered this device useless. This monitor is too expensive to be this poorly made.",

The Caregiver can move far away from the baby or the patient while carrying the monitor, and observe what the child or the patient is doing.

      "text": "we love this monitor except that it won't hold a charge. The charger has to be inserted at a specific angle and held down with something heavy and still sometimes doesn't charge (like this morning when the battery drained despite being plugged in and started beeping at 6 am, waking us all up. The worst part is, we already called the company and had the monitor replaced for the same issue, so this is our second one with this problem. I am so frustrated because at this price point there should not be any issues like this!",

Either we received a previously returned, broken unit, or this company is literally just ripping people off. The manufacture date is 03/2016 so maybe it's been sitting too long.",

Also we wanted a monitor that didnt go over wifi due to creepy stories of people hacking in and watching through the camera. This unit has its own wireless connection that doesn't go over wifi (internet). Great purchase.",
