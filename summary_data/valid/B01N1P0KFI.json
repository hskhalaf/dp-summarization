The batteries drain quickly and the controller shuts off without triggering a low battery warning on screen. I've not even had these batteries for a month yet and they are preforming sub-par already. I would not recommend this product to anyone. The batteries do take a charge and fit in my controller perfectly but the play time is very low (roughly 1.5-2 hrs.) and that just doesn't work for me. It is not fun en-gauging in a battle just to have your character stop moving and get killed by npc's or other players due to a dead battery.",
