My only beef with these shoes is after just 3 months of wear the soles of the shoes have started to peel away from the rest of the shoe. $80 bucks is a lot of money to spend on a canvas sneaker just to have them start falling a part after 3 months. It's super disappointing too since they are so good to my feet! I glued part of the sole back down, but more of the sole is peeling away",
