We tried it and it's still working after two heavy rainstorms. Application is easy with a sprayer, and because it lives up to the claim that it doesn't wash away, it's more economical. There's an initial mild but inoffensive odor that quickly disappears. Only the deer will notice it after it dries. Best of all, since a single application six weeks ago, the deer have completely avoided the plants they normally devastate -- including hosta, peach, blueberries, and vegetables. Until Deer Out, we didn't think that was possible!",

Then I sprayed and now, 4 days later I find they got three hostas in the front yard. afraid to look and see if anything else gone. If I really have to spray every 2/3 days when we have sunny days and clear nights, I'm really throwing money away by buying this stuff. Just ordered a different brand since someone suggested switching back and forth. Is it really worth all this time buying plants, planting, spending money on spray to feed the deer. Might just give up and cut down and go back to ugly bare yard with no hydrangeas, coneflowers, hosta etc.",
