      "text": "Timberland boots have always served me well during years in various brutally cold, wet and snowy winter climates. These fit just like I expected: very comfortable, warm, and waterproof which is essential for me. If you have high snowdrifts,the tops may be a bit short. First heavy snow since purchasing them and trudging through drifts some snow went down inside, but interestingly, the interior seems to wick the moisture away from my feet which is fantastic. And compared to my last (non-Timberland) boots which squeaked on every hard floor in existence, these are silent. It's the little things I appreciate like not slowly going insane from squeaky soles everywhere!",

I love the fit and how comfortable they are! that alone earns a good rating from me. if they would have came new like they was suppose to, i would have happily rated them 5 stars. If you want some boots that fit great and feel even better, grab these!",

You know how you might have to \"unlace\" a pair of taller boots or high top sneaks to get your foot in? The top two spots get laced through boot hooks and are not permanently fed through grommets or eylets so you can easily pull the tongue way out for putting them on if it is a tight fit.",

I returned them because they run a full size too large and because there is absolutely no arch support, they hurt my feet the moment i tried th em on. The ad is darker than most shoe images. I couldn't see that they are sold with cheap flat strings that at best will last a month due to the four top hooks. I rated them 3 because you can add good strings and arch supports for about $25.00",
