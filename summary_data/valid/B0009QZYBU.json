It's super light weight, non greasy, and it smells good. I have been struggling with keeping my hair moisturized and this has been helping alot. I have 3c, 4a, and 4b hair. I spritz some water in my hair and then seal it with Cantu Shea butter and then a nickel sized amount of this curl activator. I'll definitely be re-buying this once I run out.",
