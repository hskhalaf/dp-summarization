If considering this board, be sure to get high strength magnets if the black side is planned to be displayed, otherwise flip to the exposed metal side and know that pad magnets will adhere well.",

I returned it and Amazon sent me a replacement, the replacement had the same problem except more so (more damaged areas than the first one).",

Only two minor complaints, very glossy so brighter rooms might suffer from glare and the magnetic backing is likely only good for stronger magnets, I have tried several household magnets but the slide down the face of the board over time.

Installation was a little tricky but it was surprisingly smooth and no major issues. It looks great on the wall. I bought neon markers to go with it, but my daughter likes to keep the same thing up on it all the time. That's not the product's fault though. But she does use it, and it looks kind of artsy. I'm happy with it.",
