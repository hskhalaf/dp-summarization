I find the wood gliders with cushions ugly, wanted something a little more modern/chair like. This chair has been great-many hours spent nursing a baby in it. I'm 5'1 and can easily lean back. My husband is 6 feet and is also comfortable. The upholstery is holding up-wipes clean easily. The only down side is that it seems to be a magnet for pet hair- we have a black dog and the cream chair so it's quite noticable. It's also super heavy and awkward to move for cleaning/to a different room.",
