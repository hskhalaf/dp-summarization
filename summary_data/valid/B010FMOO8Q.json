The result is in the attached photo. As you can see, it is NOT silk. Rather than burn and turn into ash, the material melted into black beads. The smell was distinctly plastic. The material is not silk, and the description is false.",

My dad is a little over 6ft so it's a perfect length also for how ties should hang on a man in a suit. Keeping this as spare 'go to gift' for any other male friends/family members, very beautiful.",

If you need a tie for a specific occasion (I needed a black tie for a funeral) or if you just want a broad assortment of ties, I would recommend this. I would also have been happy with this as a father's day gift when my kids were younger (although the lack of a box might be a problem).",
