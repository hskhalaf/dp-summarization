I'm very careful and very strict about keeping liquids away from my electronic devices. I'm very upset with how the company has dealt with this issue. I will not be buying an Acer again.",

California law mandates that products shipped to California customers must have free shipping for warranty repairs over-riding whatever the manufacturer puts in their warranty agreements. After spending over 30 min on the phone with their supervisors, Acer finally agreed to pay for shipping as \"one-time courtesy\" even though it was their obligation under the California law. Hope your states have a similar law on the books protecting you from such scavengers.",

Another issue is that 1/3rd of the time the laptop will not wake from sleep. This has been going on since around the 2 month mark.

Fan started making crazy noises, so I turned it off and left it in a cool area for the rest of the day. Booted it up the next day and the fan was burned out. This laptop literally lost its fan playing CIV V. Maybe I have a defective unit but I'm not the only person this has happened to!",

However, as it came to me, there were tons of problems. Although it starts very quickly, but the power of this laptop is very weak! You cannot run a few files simultaneously. As you do it, the fan runs angrily and it becomes very hot. The noise that the fan makes immediately elicit your doubt regarding its power force. One opened Microsoft Excel file is enough to make it die. Second, black screen. Very frequently, it does not wake up from sleep. You have to restart it. Very sad!",

Speed, graphics and battery are great for the price. Construction feels nice and solid. Backlit keyboard with num pad is a big plus. The screen won't blow you away, but there's nothing wrong with it.
