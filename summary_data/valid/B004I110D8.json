This travel bottle is amazing I fill it up with my tea kettle before I leave my house and it stays warm all day. I\u2019ve even used the water more than once!",

Although a bit heavy, it has been really helpful not to have to look for a hot water source when we are out. In addition, the container/cover make things a lot easier. Often, after I warm up the baby bottle, I will pour the water back into the thermos in case I need to warm up a bottle later on. It's not much different from a regular thermos, but with the container/cover that fits and screws right on top, it is extremely convenient.",

The cap where the water pours out of always has water trapped inside. No amount of shaking will get rid of all the water. Plastic and water = mold. Very unsanitary. Worst product design ever.",

The cup that comes with this is too wide and you have to pour half the boiled water from container in the cup to warm the bottle.. which is minor issue because i can just put a smaller cup in diaper bag . But the cup is pretty much useless unless you have thick short bottles or don\u2019t mind using half your water supply. With a narrower cup the size of the bottle i can warm about 3-4 bottles.",

I poured boiling hot water in it in the morning (ended up not using it that trip), forgot about it and when I emptied it that night the water was STILL piping hot! It would have definitely warmed up my babies bottle still. This is a GREAT product! I am buying one for my BFF. One person said it was too big but I disagree. I thing the size is legit for what it does. It needs to hold water, keep it hot and the top has to be big enough to place most all bottles in.",

I put boiling water in this container before I leave the house and it stays hot all day. I've even forgot to empty it and it's still hot the next day. This is super easy to use and doesn't leak! I most definitely recommend this to anyone who needs to warm formula/milk up on the go!!",

This thing leaked out 90% of the water (I filled it to the bottom of the neck). It soaked everything in our diaper bag, the seat it was sitting on and when I picked up the diaper bag (not knowing) got me wet. So as I said great concept but ours leaks.",
