I definitely saw a difference in my hair after about 4-6 weeks of using this when I washed my hair (every other day). So I would say it does work to strengthen/stimulate healthy hair growth. Unfortunately it just stopped working and thinking it was the battery I went to change it and the battery compartment rusted. I was diligent about storing it in a dry place and taking off the rubber massage plate to let it fully dry out. I\u2019m debating on buying a new one but not sure if I want to replace every 6 months.",

I have used this for about three weeks now and my scalp looks healthier then ever. This product massages and lifts dead skin and build up from your scalp. I recommend this for people who have prorasis and other scalp problems. Plus massaging the scalp promotes hair growth and who doesn't want that. This will need batteries and yes it really is waterproof! Hope this review helps!",

      "text": "GREAT shampoo brush- it felt like my scalp could finally breathe after I used it. I have oily/congested scalp issues so it's important for me to make sure my scalp is completely clean! Pros: easy to hold, love the different settings, doesn't hurt to use (I have a sensitive scalp). My main gripes would be that the batteries have to get switched out every week (if you use it everyday). Also the screw on border that holds the prongs in place doesn't stop water from getting in, which ended up frying the batteries and rusting the screw. Because of this, I haven't used it since. Besides that, its fine, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.",

Sometimes when I forget to use it and get product on my scalp, I'll just spray my scalp all over with a water bottle and use this and it helps break it up.",

    "description": "Color:BlackWe\u2019 ve all had a scalp massage, right? It\u2019 S one of the best parts of getting a haircut, and is a nice way to end a spa treatment. Afterwards you feel super relaxed, and your scalp might even have a tingly sensation. But scalp massage has a number of benefits you may not know about: it increases blood flow to your hair follicles which in turn promotes hair growth, distributes the natural oils of your hair which boosts shine, can help to control or even eliminate dandruff, and of course, gently cleanses and lightly exfoliates the scalp. Simply adding an extra step to your shower could Score you all of those perks: the Vitagoods Scalp massaging shampoo brush is a gently vibrating water-resistant scalp Massager that fits perfectly in the palm of your hand and takes your daily shampoo up a notch. The flexible rubber tips of the brush gently massage and invigorate your scalp while lathering up and distributing your favorite shampoo, and because the Vitagoods Scalp massaging shampoo brush is handheld, you can apply as little or as much pressure as you\u2019 D like. \nhow to use apply a small amount of your favorite shampoo to your scalp and distribute through the roots of your hair. Press the on/off button to activate the vibration to desired speed on your Vitagoods Scalp massaging shampoo brush. Hold the massager in the palm of your hand with the rubber tips facing away from you and the handle in between your index and Middle fingers for a firmer grip and better control. Starting at the front of your head, slowly glide the shampoo brush over your entire scalp, using as much or as little pressure as you'd like (let the massager work it's Magic!), and taking care to spend extra time on areas Where you may have noticed flaky or dry scalp. Note: if you have long hair, take care not to pull through the length of your hair. When finished, press the on/off button to deactivate the vibration, and rinse any shampoo suds or residue from the rubber tips. \n\ncaring for your Vitagoods Scalp massaging shampoo brush remove the silicone bristles from the device and rinse it under the water faucet/shower after each use to ensure that all shampoo suds and residue has been removed. Use a damp towel to thoroughly clean the outside of the scalp Massager. Leave the items to dry outside of the shower, or somewhere where the brush can completely dry before re-assembling. Do not submerge in water. \n\nclosing the battery compartment when closing the battery compartment, be sure to firmly press on the battery door and tighten the screw completely to prevent water from entering the device.",
