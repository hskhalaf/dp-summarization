They were less bitter than some brands but also less chocolate flavor. Kind of dusty tasting.",

This is 100% raw, organic and vegan product; not the same as the chocolate and cocoa versions that are readily available. Taste the difference immediately, store in dry, cool place, tightly sealed; it will oxidize quickly if exposed to air and moisture. Buy quantity you expect to use within a short time (2-3 months), there is no preservatives or additives that will extend shelf-life like non-raw versions give you. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys chocolate and cares where it comes from (Peru in this case).",

Definitely recommend! I LOVE this cacao! Very strong in flavour, and bitterly sweet. Has a wonderful dark chocolate taste. This powder is very finely ground, can be very versatile. Comes in a huge bag that will last me forever! Definitely worth the price! I use this cacao for a lot of stuff already, and probably more stuff in the future. I've already used it for baking (brownies are to die for!), and I put it in my coffee (tastes so good!)",

Unlike some other super foods in which there is little or no evidence for the benefits, there is actually some solid scientific evidence supporting the health benefits of cacao. As a bonus, I find it satisfies my craving for chocolate.",

It isn't easy for many of us to find superfoods like raw cacao in stores (yet!) so online availability is great. The product itself is first-rate, delicious, and an excellent addition to my breakfast smoothie. When you read about all the health benefits of cacao, rather than commercially produced cocoa, and find how easy it is to add those benefits to your daily diet, you'll be quickly won over.",

It has a bit of a bitter taste that I'm still getting used to (since it doesn't have sugar added) but I generally add a half a teaspoon of raw agave or honey and the combination of flavors is great. The cacao has a lot of antioxidants and minerals so I highly suggest others to try.",
