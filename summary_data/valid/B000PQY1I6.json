A little bit cumbersome as it\u2019s a little clunky (solid metal front piece) and you have to reset the lock after you\u2019ve opened it prior to inserting the front to close it again which is a little cumbersome. But ultimately very sturdy and works very well!",

I read from other reviews about going through all the combinations to get the right one, you have to have some patient crooks to get that done, breaking a window would be easier. This product is very sturdy and will be impossible to remove if you forget the code, unless you remove the entire area where it is installed.",

Our house has multiple people going in and out, people borrowing things, kid coming and going, family cleaning for us, many family members all round. This key lets us store an extra outside without the location changing because someone forgot to re-hide the key and tell everyone else where it is (communication not good).",

Our box is used frequently and its a pain to have to punch in code once to open then again to lock the cover back into place.",

I always tell my locked out friends why not invest in a simple yet effective way to get back in your home when you lock yourself out, which you will do. Highly recommend this product.",
