AIR FLOW SUCKS IN THIS CASE! The slanted plastic front cover you can see in the pictures blocks at least half of one of the front fans. THere is essentially the same problem on the top of the case, too. Cable management is a pain in the butt.. yeah there is space behind the MOBO for cables, but its thin. I will be replacing this case as soon as budget allows.",

It is an obvious design flaw as it does not look proper installed that way. The large number of drive bays is unessecary in a case this size and actually makes it impossible to fit dual GPU support and limits the room you have to work connecting the motherboard to the wiring. My GTX 1070 ti barely fits and there is a lot of flex in the case when seating the card. I am returning this case and buying something with better quality and that fits a standard DVD drive.",

I had bought two of these when I built my kids' computers, and I had to install the operating system by positioning the drive outside of the case.

It has a good amount of space and drive bays in it, except for there isn't a whole lot of space between the motherboard and back side panel, making cable management sort of difficult. My only complaint besides cable management difficulty, is that the screws are really cheap and strip/break easily. I've already have 4 screws strip and 1 break. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, with a side not that they should buy screws separately.",

Be careful as to the 5.25 and the 3.50 drive bays. Theres only one 5.25 bay that's useable. So no room for a media reader.

Pre-installed fans 3 in all just add to the value.

Plenty of room for ventalation keeps things nice and cool. The glowing blue LEDs 'almost' seem to swirl just a little bit. The case is light because many parts are plastic but it doesnt feel cheaply made as the doors are metal and the side panel is real glass. I bought a more expensive rosewill case for my build but I could have saved alot more money with this one. For the price its a great buy!",

I would how ever say a few RGB strips really add to the overall look. and if you really want a center piece you can go with a mini itx motherboard and load it with RGB strips, fan, and components and even add figures such as funco pops to the inside.",
