That being said, I'm not sure if I will keep it. It takes a long time to put on with the zipper on the bottom - just getting my dog to hold still until I zipper it can be a challenge. He also seems to feel very confined in it and doesn't like the his legs covered. Haven't tried to get him to go out in in yet, but not sure he will wear it so might have to return it.",

The lining is not waterproof, though, and because of her short paws I had to flip the sleeves, so it gets wet and dirty more easily.",

My dog is usually a size 14 or a S/M depending on the manufacturer. These jackets are weird. The Medium size was WAY too big and the small is a tight fit and doesn't cover 13 inches. Therefore the dog's bottom gets all wet and isn't covered. The sizing isn't very accurate.",

      "text": "Excellent raincoat. I have bought a few and returned them. The quality of this and the style is exactly what is needed in a dog raincoat. High quality zipper (not Velcro), covers his front legs, and his belly! He is protected from the wet and muddy! Exactly what a raincoat is supposed to do but only one I have found that does it. Fantastic product and my dog put it on immediately and no hassles or complaint from him. He loves it!!",
