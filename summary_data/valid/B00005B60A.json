      "text": "I bought this for my 59 year old hubby for his birthday. I purchased a Flybar pogo stick for our 6 year old granddaughter and Grandpa was jealous. He'd had a pogo stick when he was young and loved it. Well, he's in love again! He's mastered the pogo stick in a very short period of time. For the record, he's just under 6 feet tall and weighs 200 lbs. This pogo stick has a very stiff spring. My hubby doesn't bottom out this pogo stick - even jumping hard. Our son is 6 feet 2 inches and 220 lbs. and he has to try very hard to bottom out the pogo stick. This is definitely appropriate for an adult.",

I can vouch for this stick up to one thousand twenty two jumps. Husband beat my record by ten jumps the next day and I have zero interest in jumping for 20 minutes straight again for another record....but the pogo stick is great. The spring hasn't buckled under the weight and the pad on the bottom is still intact after 7 months of use.",

He graduated from doing two bounces with support, to doing over 200 consecutive bounces without falling, and making deliberate designs by jumping in specific directions, all within a week. He absolutely loves it!! (I would not get this model for a much older child, though, because even at about 50 lbs., he is occasionally \"bottoming out\" the spring when he jumps and says that is uncomfortable). He'll need one with a stronger spring, soon.",

I would advise parents looking to purchase this for a child to look elsewhere- the minimum weight is 120 lbs to even engage the spring, and it is probably about 4 1/2 high or more. The rubber nub did fall out once, but J.B. Weld secured it in place quite nicely and it hasn't fallen out again since. For the price, this is a great entry level pogo sticks for adults looking for a jumping type workout or fun with simple tricks.",

Nice sturdy pogo with heavy duty spring. Didn't take long to break it in. I can bounce high or low, it's easy to control. If you are on the tall side, get this one instead of one of the shorter ones, the higher handles make a difference.",

It was a big difference right away. It is definitely heavy. But for our son, it was a better fit. Initially he got bruising on his knees pretty badly, but he persevered and that seems to have diminished in a matter of weeks. The handles are very sturdy and have a bike-like grip. Super glad we went this route.",

On the other hand, it does serve it's purpose and seems to be well built. I don't think I'll break it and it's a fun toy to bounce around on. The knee problem is there, but it's pretty minor. I didn't have bruised knees, but you can feel the pogo rubbing up against your knees as you jump. Good product.",
