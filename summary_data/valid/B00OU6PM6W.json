A visit to a therapist afterwards confirmed that I have collapsed arches, which means my foot does not have the same kind of springiness that helps support my body weight during walking. Sort of like driving a car the didn't have suspension - it makes for a jarring ride. I then looked for a pair of good athletic shoes I can use with foot support, and this product does not disappoint. It's like walking on air! Woohoo!",

He loves them and says they feel great and he can tell they help him. I have noticed that his feet, ankle and leg are now aligned and he does not overpronate at all in these shoes. I'm grateful for the product. I was skeptical about paying so much for a pair of shoes online that may or may not work, but I would buy these again with no hesitation. I may post pictures later to show the difference these make in his alignment. Also, these were true to size.",

In an extra wide size they minimize the pain even more, by eliminating the pressure from normal width shoes. I will be buying a spare Fortitude 7 pair of Asics shoes in the next few weeks.",

      "text": "Got em for $75. The doc said I need shoes specifically designed for under-pronation, and the Fortitude has delivered. They have reinforced heel stability and a thick, plush sole with a guidance line and plastic hardware. The material is fairly stain-resistant, and the toe seems more hefty than my GT-2000s. I dislike the color scheme, but I wear a 4E, so I am generally more concerned with the utility factor than style. High quality. Reasonable cost.",

    "description": "Built for the upmost comfort, the Asics GEL-Fortitude? 7 sneaker is the prime choice for any running enthusiast. Designed with Rearfoot and Forefoot GEL? Cushioning System, it provides the upmost comfort with every stride. In 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
