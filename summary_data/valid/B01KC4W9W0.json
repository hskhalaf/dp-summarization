It was doing a great job cutting up a fallen tree. But I had to keep stopping to adjust the chain. It kept coming loose. Even popped off twice. I know in the manual it said you would have to adjust it on your first use, but this seemed a bit much. I had to stop every 5 minutes. The chain is now dull after one use.",

I can't reach MTD Products at all, and their local service reps tell me they don't want to work with MTD/Remington anymore. It doesn't restart easily when warm. Total piece of crap. I regret this purchase and am trying to return it and buy a better brand.",
