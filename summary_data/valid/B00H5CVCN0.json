The little drawer is handy as well. The rubber grips at the bottom prevent it from sliding around on my cheap Ikea desk. Great little find.",

The two-section piece only fits on one side (until I forcibly bent the metal structure). Many of the metal pieces clearly don't line up and aren't joined at the correct angles.

The rating was more for that fact that it 'rocks', in the sence that it's not well leveled. If you hold the unit face-on, you can see that it's got a slight twist to it, and when you set it on a flat surface, it can rock slightly from one corner to the other. Not a real big deal, it's still useful, and I'll use it as it is.",
