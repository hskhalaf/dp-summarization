I use these to make keto / no carb pancakes with eggs and cream cheese. Normally they can be kind of tough to flip. With these, before I start mixing I place each pan on its own burner. When the pans are up to temp I pour the entire mixture into one pan and cook for five minutes. I then insert the other pan (already warmed up) and flip the whole assembly for another three minutes. Works absolutely perfectly.",

Today I did omelettes and again, easy and great. We have a bed and breakfast so these pans will be used a lot. I just ordered another set so that I can make more than one item for breakfast at a time. Love these.",

      "text": "I got this item to make Spanish Tortilla, until now I used to flip the tortilla using a rimless 12 inches stainless steel or aluminum lid. Yesterday I use this double skillet for the first time with excellent results. Perfect size, light weight important when you have to flip the tortilla and the non-sticky surface a plus. These 2 skillets and a bowl is all what you need to make a Tortilla. The recipe for Tortilla that comes with the skillets is not my favorite. If you are looking for a good one search for Finecooking Sarah Jay, very similar of what what grew up with.",
