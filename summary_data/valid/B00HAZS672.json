The mattress pad it comes with is basically useless but it was clearly labeled as 1 inch thick when we purchased it so we knew to buy another. It is avery pretty product a very attractive addition to any nursery. My only critasism is that with the wheels attached it is quite tall which makes it a little difficult to put baby in when on the lower setting especially if you are short like me (only 5'2)",

I'd compare it to an IKEA furniture when it comes to assembling but even easier then that. There weren't that many pieces to have to put together and you only need an Allen wrench and screw driver. I did purchase a seprate mattress, the one it comes with is very thin. But overall great crib for a small space.",

There was a light odor unpacking the pieces but nothing of concern, and it dissipated before he was done assembling it \ud83d\ude09. An even lesser odor has lingered a bit but gets better each day. It seems rather sturdy. I got the natural color version so there's no paint issues. No dings or issues with quality. My baby was nice and calm when we set her down in it (win)!",

      "text": "We are expecting our first baby and live in an450 sq ft cabin so space is paramount! This little crib which is advertised to fit babies up to 18 months is the perfect size. It was easy to assemble...probably took me and my mom 30 minutes. Left the wheels off so it doesn\u2019t sit higher than my window ceil and you can see the holes where the wheels are meant to go but that doesn\u2019t really bug me. My dad took a look and was really pleased saying it was a sturdy and well made crib. Excited to see our little girl in it soon!",

My husband put it together and said it wasn't super easy but not very hard either. The mattress it came with isn't much, so we got another one to go with it. The compact size is nice and I love the grey.",

We did let it air out in the garage for a few days before assembly because other reviewers had mentioned a strong odor, but once it aired out and was assembled the odor is almost non-existent. It is small enough to fit in our master bedroom as we are limited on space. I can't wait to see our baby sleep in it in a couple weeks.",

I have since spent another 1.5 hours trying to remove the large and ugly product stickers plastered all over the crib. Even with GooGone this has been an ordeal. It seems like someone thought they could save a few pennies ordering cheaper stickers, but these things are 95% adhesive and 5% tissue-thin paper that is impossible to peel off. Now that I'm done ranting, the crib itself seems nice and sturdy. It looks attractive and was easy enough to assemble. The casters are a nice feature. If you buy this crib, also buy a bottle of GooGone.",
