He has played one runs with it since turning it on Christmas Day and 12 days later it still has battery life. He is very happy with all the features and how easy it is to use.",

This GPS has serious accuracy issues as compared with other devices that friends have. It was 20 yrds off on a 230 yd hole compared to Garmin watch and laser device (both of witch were withing 4 yds of each other). I don't need a watch to guess how close I am.....I want one to tell me. I used the support of the website, and updated the watch with the satellite locations, and it was off on two different courses. Too bad, as it is a beautiful watch.",
