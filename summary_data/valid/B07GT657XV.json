They quickly sent me a replacement monitor . I received it today , and all the functions operate . The previous monitor had a defect where the arm positioning assistant would not work at all which made me skeptical of the blood pressure readings . I am fairly confident now that the new replacement monitor is giving me good readings . Thank you Greater Goods !",

After making that slight adjusting, beginning day 3, the numbers were almost aligned, not quite, but not enough to cause me any concern. I was quite pleased. What I liked most of all was the automatic arm placement that starts measurement immediately. I would highly recommend this unit.",

The wrist cuff is compact, easy to store, and far easier to use than traditional BP monitors.

I was going to reach out to the company but decided to cut my loses. Just keep this in mind if you decided to buy. Will invest in a better kind next time.",

The monitor that uses the arm cuff has only one height size for the cuff (though it does have two lengths) so I was hoping for a wrist version that might more easily fit my small size. Unfortunately, the readings on the wrist monitor were consistently higher in the upper number (by about 10 points) than the readings using the monitor with an arm cuff. The arm cuff monitor was checked for accuracy against my doctor's machine just a couple weeks ago, so I know it's accurate. The lower number was also a little higher but no more than 5 points.",

I\u2019m following the instruction booklet on how to use it but it also keeps sending me to an error screen and shutting off.
