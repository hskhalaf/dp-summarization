While there is not an aggressive bone in his body, he is fearful of anything strange or different or new, from the passing of the garbage truck outside to an unknown person visiting the house. A trainer who specializes in fearful dogs recommended--among other things--this collar for Pete. She said it worked for some dogs but not for others. I got it through subscribe and save and tried it for two months, but he acted no differently wearing it or not wearing it. If it works for other dogs, I'm happy for them.

Once I put a new collar on him, he calms down pretty quickly. He's a pit bull rescue with an abusive past so he gets agitated and hyper protective at times. This collar makes a huge difference. I bought a cheaper collar a while back that smelled so strong I couldn't stand it and knowing about dogs' sense of smell, I couldn't use it on him. I'll only ever use adaptil from now on.",

ADAPTIL is a vet recommended, clinically proven, drug free solution that helps your dog feel calmer. The ADAPTIL Calm On The Go Collar provides \u201ccomforting messages\u201d (dog appeasing pheromones that mimic a mother's nursing pheromones) that helps dogs feel calm and relaxed in situations like loud noises (thunderstorms and fireworks), being home alone, traveling or other fearful situations. These odorless messages are only perceived by dogs and provide a strong signal of security and comfort. By making your dog feel relaxed and less stressed, it helps to reduce problem behaviors. Cats and people are not affected by these pheromones. The collar is easy to use - all you have to do is put the collar on your dog, and their body heat will activate the calming pheromones to help your dog feel calm all day. Each collar will last up to 4 weeks, and should be replaced around that time for maximum effectiveness. The collar should be removed during grooming and bathing, but other than that, your dog can safely wear it at all times.",
