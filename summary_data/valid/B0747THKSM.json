I do like that it has more natural ingredients than all the junk in Jergens and other gradual self tanners, so I'm thankful for that. I just wish I got a deeper color out of it.",

It did not work at all, the tan still faded as quickly as without an extender, and I did not see any new gradual color developing, which I expected since it has a small amount of DHA. The cheap Jergens stuff works better than this and is half the price. Also the lotion did not rub in well and had a scent that wasn't that great (like candy).",

It was really easy to put on (I bought the Skinerals mitt to go with it) and I had no issues with the color guard! It was easy to see if I missed any spots and was super easy to fix. It dried pretty quickly and the scent wasn't too bad! I waited about 8 hours before washing it off in the shower. Will definitely buy again!!",
