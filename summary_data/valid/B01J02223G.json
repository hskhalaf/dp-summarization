Only reason it didnt get 5 stars is that there's no organizer to store everything. We use the ice bucket to hold everything but you kind of have to dig around for what you need. And if you need the bucket then the tools are left scattered on the counter. I know there are products that come with a holder but based on the reviews the quality wasn't up to par.",

I've seen/used so many that the ice just slides off... not this one! NEGATIVES - The bucket is smaller than I expected. - The wine opener has a rubber part that can off the first time I opened a bottle of wine. Not very impressive.",
