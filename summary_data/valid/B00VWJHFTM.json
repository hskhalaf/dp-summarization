I know its cooked right and will taste good enough :). when i get home just throw it in the dishwasher and done.",

I've hand washed, microwaved, frozen, dishwashed and they are still like new! As a thank you they put in an extra dish set. How cool is that!!! Chain stores aren't personable like this company. They have a loyal customer in me! :)",

      "text": "This is my first time ordering any sort of meal prep Tupperware and I love these . When they arrived they were actually a little bit bigger than I thought they would be which was perfect for me and their the perfect size for all my meals. They stack very well and condense down to be a pretty reasonable stack when you're not using them. I ordered 2 boxes of them and I'll probably order another one soon. They've been great for taking to work or eating at home. I'd definitely recommend them if you're getting into large scale meal planning.",

Cons -Sometimes they are easily opened and others its a massive fight -Depending on what you put in them I have an odd issue with something almost becoming embedded in the container even with some dawn and scrubbing it doesn't seem to want to come clean...weird Overall I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it",
