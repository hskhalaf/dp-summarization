      "text": "I walk two huskies several times a day. It is a delight to have my hands free. I got a swivel hook to put both leashes on one hook so the dogs can trade places while walking. It is good to have to waist belts is you have two walkers of different sizes because it takes a bit of time to get the fit just right. The bungees on the leashes are good shock absorbers. I would love to see the belt have a wide cushion in the back to offer additional support when the dogs pull. I solved that issue for myself by cutting a bit of a swimming noodle in half and making a back cushion.",

The double bungee system does a marvelous job in letting him know when he's pushing things too far, and the dual handles really help with control when things get too exciting for him. Because he's now less successful pulling, he's finally making real progress with training after a year of very slow work. Thanks so much. I only wish it came in blue because my other black lab's entire gear setup is blue!",

I didn't use the part that goes around the waist, because my plan was to be more hands-on than that due to multiple other dogs being there. The leash is great! the many ways and places to grab the leash made it feel very intuitive and it was easy to pull my dog in closer when more, let's just say \"energetic\" dogs were nearby. The leash was a big hit with other attendees who asked where they could buy one as well. I'd say money well spent!",

This one I don\u2019t have to periodically adjust the waist because it doesn\u2019t come loose! And the length is easy to adjust because of the multiple rings at various lengths.

The bungee makes it easier on my dog when she stops and I don't...automatically giving her a gentle pull as I keep running. The adjustable size is great for walking in areas where you can give your dog more freedom. I have been using it for about 2 months, and it appears well made and durable. Highly recommend!",

Also, it's reasonably long, when using the full length, but has the ability to clip to intermediate length, so there are two different shorter lengths you can have, depending on what you need. I think it's also super helpful that you can easily convert the part that's not around your waist into a conventional leash so you can hand the dog off to someone without taking off the belt portion. And the ability to also quickly tether the leash around a stationary object without unclipping the dog is great as well. I'd definitely recommend this product!",

The only issue is that the Bungies on all three parts no longer work. They\u2019re stretched out to their limit after just 3 weeks of daily use. Unfortunately but still my favorite.
