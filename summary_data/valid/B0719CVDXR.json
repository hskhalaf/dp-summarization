What we did is just forget about the belts and tucked the flags on each side, only using two flags instead of the 3 it comes with. Product came on time and in great condition. Overall, you can't beat the price, therefore, I gave them 4 stars.",

We tied them around our arms instead or held them in our hands. The actual flag part is cheaply sown to a velcro latch that gets put on the belt and it is so horribly sown that after one game of capture the flag, most of them were ripped from the velcro pieces. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND, especially for the cost. They are not good quality at all.",

The kids in my neighborhood have made a makeshift football field in an empty lot next to our house, and they literally spend hours playing flag football on the weekends. The quality is great, and you can tell that a lot of thought went into the product. My oldest son even asked if he could take it to school so they could play during recess! This is a fun way to get your kids outside (away from electronics) and into the fresh air. Very excited about this product, and I'm looking forward to seeing what this company offers in the future!",

This set of kids flag football belts and flags includes a custom 32-inch adjustable, durable nylon belt complete with secure D-ring closure and detachable flag system. To fit a larger waist, simply use the d-ring closure to secure 2 kids belts together to make a larger belt.\n\n Quality, hand-sewn attachments are used to secure the flags to the belt. The attachment is not sewn in place which enables you to slide the flags for flag football where you want them on the belt. This flexible feature allows you to adjust the belt size to fit each individual player without worry of flag placement.\n\nWith this 14-player flag football kit for kids there are enough flag football belts and flags to equip 7 players per team with a belt and 3 flags. When every player on the team is equipped and ready to take the field, game delays are minimized and the need for swapping belts when substituting players is eliminated. This flag football gear is also great for the young football player who wants to practice their skills and improve technique in the off-season with friends and teammates.\n\n For backyard play, 14 kids can participate in their game of choice! These flags and belts for kids are an excellent option to add a layer of fun to traditional games like tag, sharks and minnows, capture the flag and hide and seek, plus football pick-up games and scrimmages.
