As you can imagine I would focus on making sure he was eating and had everything he needed that I'd forgot to pack snacks for myself. I started buying these by the box and load up my purse and diaper bag. I do like that they are healthier than other bars. I don't feel guilty giving some to my son. The almonds are very filling and the honey and coconut gives it the perfect sweet taste. I plan to continue to make these a staple in my diaper bags and purse. I highly recommend these snacks!",

These bars are great because there's no grain involved. It's just a delightful blend of dried fruit and crunchy toasted almonds- a bit of a tang to balance out the sweetness. Not TOO dry- still moist, chewy, crunchy, and very delicious. This, I look forward to- and in a pinch, it makes a tasty dessert- healthier than lots of other things. Glad to buy them directly from Amazon delivered at home.",

I came home with three only because I had left three bars in my car to make sure I would have a couple. I do have two Warnings - the first has to do with the chewing power needed to finish one of these bars ... if you have TMJ know you can only eat a half of a bar at one sitting before having to put it down for awhile. Second is - they are very addicting and you may find yourself hiding them from others. Enjoy!!",

None of the flavors are over-powering and the almonds add a nice crunch to the soft bar. The bars are all natural with 0g cholesterol, low sodium (25 mg), low sugar (12 g) and 3g each of protein and fiber. The 190 calories are a good mid-meal snack and it has become a replacement snack for me. I eat about 5 bars a week and have still not grown tired with this flavor combination. The 1-Star deduction is for the glucose syrup. Highly Recommended!",

Not so much in finding tasty or non-expensive food. I was looking for a healthy yet flavorful snack that won't break the budget and I decided to try this Kind bar stuff. Boy was I blown away by its freshness and rich flavors. I started with the coconut almond. So yummy and filling. A perfect way to grab a quick bite when you're on the go and without sacrificing health or flavor. Highly recommended!",

I ordered a box for my sister, who has Celiac disease (cannot digest gluten), and hers were shipped promptly as well. The problem is that the Kind bars were stale! They were hard and not pleasant to eat. I called my sister and she had the same issue. I buy them all the time at my local grocery store and have never run into this problem. Therefore, I will not be ordering them or any other food items from Amazon again. \"Kind\"ly disappointed.",
