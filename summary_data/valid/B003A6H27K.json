I do a lot of portrait work and have a Yonguno f2 35mm which I use all the time, but I wanted something with Image Stabilisation, since I wasn't getting perfectly clear images. This lens was a good price. I got it and the first thing I loved was the weight, it felt like it was worth the money, it's solid and very well built. The image quality is fantastic. I started shooting straight away and the images are so much better with the IS on. The f2.8 is very good and offers a good DOF. I would defiantly recommend this lens.",

Has a lock to stop the lens moving in transit which I thought was a good touch. It is slightly heavier than I thought it would be but feels very comfortable to hold. Wish I had bought this sooner.",

There is a stutter on occasions when the lens is focused on a subject and a jitter when panning. Also, the roller that glides a change of focus is stiff instead of smooth, so there might a jerk at times during life shooting zooming in or out. It's best to using editing software to zoom in and out and keep the lens at a consistent zoom when filming. Maybe my lens is faulty and other lens don't have the same problem. I will have to investigate. But the picture quality when videoing is sharp.",
