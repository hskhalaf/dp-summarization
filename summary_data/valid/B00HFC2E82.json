Welch's (Facebook) said it has to do with the grape and lemon concentrates with one more naturally hardening and the other having a softer texture. The ones from Walmart are usually unnoticeable so it just means the grape ones need to be eaten long before the end of their shelf life. Still, I can't recommend them highly enough.",

It sat in the full sun for a bit before getting the notification. The fruit snacks got extremely soft and a little mishapened. I immediately put the box in the fridge. They stayed there overnight. They were perfectly fine the next day. These are my kids' favorite fruit snacks! Order two...but maybe not during the summer. It's well into the 100 degree range here.",
