      "verdict": "The Polo Ralph Lauren Ian is a sporty shoe with a streamlined design. It features a nicely cushioned footbed that\u2019ll allow you to walk comfortably for hours, an excellent fit that everyone from the narrow to the wide-footed can use, a grippy sole, and a very durable make. It also retails at a competitive price.Balancing the scales a tad is the sneaker\u2019s lack of support. The model also dirties quickly, and the suede version is particularly hard to clean off. Other reviewers mentioned that the sneaker tends to run long.",

Anyhow, after all that which was clearly noticeable upon opening the box, the one shoe has a tag stapled to the sole saying they are $49.00. Also noticed same tag on outside of box. Curious why I paid $89 for this pair of $49 shoes. May have dealt with the defects if so but either way, not what I paid for and returning tomorrow",
