I bought this one because it was advertised as a Sony produced controller for PS2 and I'd been worried a knock-off wouldn't work as well. When I purchased this, through Overstocked IT, I was thrilled it was only 13 dollars, but I was clearly conned. At this point, it behaves as though the analog stick or d-pad is perpetually going to the right. I am going to crack it open and see if anything is gummed up or not making contact, and if that works, I'll kick this review up a bit. If that doesn't work, though, it's going back and this review is staying exactly the same.",

If you ask me the controllers were better off wired like this one as the longevity is amazing over the ps3 ones. I owned my other one for over 6 years now!!!!!! These ones are more durable as well. The sensor in the ps3 ones are sensitive. One drop and BOOM it's broke unless you can take it apart and fix the sensor(YouTube vids can show you how). Not an issue with these controllers.",

They respond perfectly and the cord is a good length. The Dualshock technlogy just adds a bit to the game experience and lets you know when the character has been hit or when something is occurring.

Aside from a keyboard and mouse, It's the most comfortable controller that I've used in my 20+ years of gaming. Just don't get frustrated and throw it against the ground. It's not the most durable thing. You may have read some reviews that say the buttons stick, and that is true, sometimes. It's certainly been an inconsistent experience for me. And it's probably not a good thing that, in 2013, it still costs more than most games out for the PS2 now. Wait, this is a four star review?",

    "description": "The Dual Shock Controller has graduated to the next level. We're talking sensitive here; the buttons are now pressure sensitive, with up to 255 levels of sensitivity. Exciting, you betcha! This could mean surgical precision as you accelerate, decelerate or maneuver through a course. Or, even more fighting moves and secret weapons available as you battle the forces of evil. Ready, set, game!\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe layout of PlayStation2's Dual Shock 2 controller is nearly identical to that of the original PlayStation's Dual Shock controller, which is good news for most gamers. The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.",
