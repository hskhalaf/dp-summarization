I have a rather pedestrian turntable from TEAC with a really good Ortofon blue cartridge and a built in amp and by sheer instinct (and knowing Pro-ject's reputation) I went for this and I'm astounded by the improvement in sound. It went from one rather bland shade to an explosion of color and depth. I'm finally hearing the essence of what vinyl connoisseurs have been preaching about for years. This is an AMAZING product.

It was crazy easy to set up (plug and play pretty much) and it immediately corrected audio issues as well as gave me the power of sound that having a turntable requires. This was an afterthought for me as I had purchased a nice player and a nice sound system only to realize I forgot you needed a preamp to make it all sound great and loud. This is the most satisfying purchase i've made in years because of how easy it is to use and effective it is.",
