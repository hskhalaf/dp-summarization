      "text": "This is a good looking backpack, made from durable material. The red and white striped inside is fun too, but the main zipper isn't as easy as it could be to use. It's a little sticky, and the flap covering the zipper adds to the bag's overall design appeal but takes away from the zipper's accessibility and function.",

I've had it in the rain already and it survived a soaking with none of my items in my bag getting wet. It's a standard backpack with just a front zip pocket, but inside is big enough hold my 13' laptop, a pen bag, a couple notebooks and my day planner.",
