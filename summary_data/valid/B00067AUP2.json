It needs something additional to help keep baby in place. Second, I don't like vinyl type covers on baby mattresses because they don't allow the baby's skin to breathe and he end's up with his back covered in sweat. This wedge is has a plastic cover and does just that. I returned this.",

It has two foam pieces that come out. It comes with one in and one you have to put in. I tried a few times and I could not get the second piece in perfectly, so it's a little off. my son doesn't seem to mind, but I wish I could have made it perfectly flat.",
