For me, that alone is worth the price of admission, but the rest of the thing is great, too, as is Makerbot's customer service. Recently, experimental nozzles have become available for it from the manufacturer, along with such things as PLA filament containing wood, and so on, which greatly expands the capability of the printer beyond the basic PLA which, until recently, was all it could use.",
