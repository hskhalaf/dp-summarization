I don't know if this is because I wasn't using regulation-size playing cards or if it's just a crappy product, but I am returning because it's more of a hassle than shuffling by hand for my particular needs.

It is definitely made out of cheap plastic, and I can see why many reviewers have complained that the small black clips that hold the deck tray in place have broken.
