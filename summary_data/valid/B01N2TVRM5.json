      "verdict": "The Puma EvoPower Vigor 4 Graphic Turf makes an impression with its bright and bold colorways. Those who tried this soccer cleat first-hand attest to its impeccable quality and excellent comfort. Players with wide feet love that it has a broader width compared to other firm ground models. However, some were quick to spot the slight sizing issue, mentioning that this soccer cleat fits smaller than usual. Then again, with its rather economical price range, this soccer cleat remains to be a hit among fans.",

I will probably buy this shoe again. Lets see how long this pair lasts me.",

Thanks for lousy sizing, Puma. Seems like by 2017 we should have been able to figure out standardizing shoe sizing...",
