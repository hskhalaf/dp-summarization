      "text": "This camera is a wonderful product for it's price. PROS It takes wonderful pictures in low light. It is very user-friendly. Crisp, clear pictures. Rechargeable EN-EL8 Battery lasts forever! Great Price! Very Stylish and skinny. CONS Wi-fi is very complicated to figure out. ON/Off button sticks out a little too far, so it turns on in your pocket sometimes. Picture storing software that comes with the camera isn't that great. ALL IN ALL THIS CAMERA IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR A WONDERFUL PRICE!",
