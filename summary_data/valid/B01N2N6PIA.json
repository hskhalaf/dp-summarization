I consider this a must have item. I can now fit much more in my recycle bin. Cuts thicker boxes as well that contained TV's and furniture.",

I began to look through the various battery-operated scissors and came across these Hi-Spec 3.6 V electric scissors and read the narrative about the various uses. They fit the bill, after they arrived I used them to cut boxes, trim my rose bushes of blooms that had died; and other various things such as tarps and heavy cardboard boxes with ease. Would highly recommend these scissors and read the accompanying literature on how to use the various blades.",
