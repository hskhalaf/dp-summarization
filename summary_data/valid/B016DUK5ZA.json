I keep the square tent set up all the time, and most of the babies toys will stay in there. It takes about 5 minutes to set up the other two parts. Definitely a good buy.",

The balls do not stay inside of it so we are constantly picking them up; much more often than with the inflatable pool. It makes the kids happy but it is more maintenance which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.",

The clasp that holds the tunnel and the tent gets undone very easily sometimes. But not always. One suggestion would be velcro stickers on the sides of the tent could be replaced by zippers.

The way the tube attaches is a little haphazard..little elastic bands with plastic little dowels to slide through. They are a little flimsy so will see how it holds up to the 1.5 year old. It also would not fit much beyond. 3 year old. That being said, for the price, it provided the fun we were hoping for.",
