      "text": "I have had this watch for about 3 years now and it is still going strong. My only complaint is that sometimes the GPS could act a little crazy on the long runs and mess up your speed or distance. I believe that having both sensors running would balance this out but all-in-all this helps me to prepare for my marathons as I can gauge my pace and distance. What I also love is when you sign up on the community you can run routes that others have mapped out or just join friends and make a little competition to keep you motivated to run farther every month.",

While in Afghanistan, I did not always have access to internet via my personal computer. If the satellites are not updated, it takes forever to connect. And sometimes, it does not connect at all.

While the amortization of this watch is less than running shoes, this is a luxury item, not a necessity and my expectations were much higher.",

The band is a hard plastic and not very flexible. The main reason I returned this watch for a refund (and replaced it with a Garmin, which is awesome) is that it did not work. I used it about 10 times, and only 3 times did it connect to a satellite for gps to be enabled. Even when the gps was enabled, the pace per mile was not accurate. I do not recommend this watch for any serious runner who wants a good watch to aid in training.",
