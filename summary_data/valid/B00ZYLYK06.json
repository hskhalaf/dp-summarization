Everything works amazingly and I've had no issues over the past few weeks of constantly using this breast pump.",

I would have to say this got more milk out then the one the insurance companies give you for \"free\".",

I think it can go about 1.5 - 2 weeks (that's 7- 15 pumps total). I purchased this pump to use 3x day during the work week and while it's comfortable (with the silicone shield) and compact, it could be SO MUCH BETTER.

You can switch between the expression and suction with no problem. You can also adjust the strength of those two setting, but I haven't been able to figure out how to adjust the speed.

So it will be interesting to see how long batteries last. Got 2oz (60ml) out on first pump while BF my daughter on the other side. Purchased to help build up freezer stash to pump while feeding without being tied down to a pump plug. So far so good",
