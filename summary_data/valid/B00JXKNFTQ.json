Very good, but it has to be used with an ice cream maker and instructions must be followed because at first, I thought this was just sugar in a bag because i fist tried to make it with skim milk and it tasted horrible, but the secret is in the heavy cream. I made mine with a little bit of evaporated milk to make up the two cups of regular milk. Well, needless to say, it came out DELICIOUS :). Thank you Nostalgia <3",

The package says only pt half in your ice cream freezer, but I have the kitchen aid and filled it up a little higher. It worked fine and was a softer consistency which I like better. I think it's tastes similar to Dairy Queen and a only 70 calories. It's very easy to mix, just uses whipping cream and milk so bought a box of them. Only wish it came in chocolate also. Will buy more!",
