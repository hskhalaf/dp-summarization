      "text": "Very disappointing. This is a totally updated but much less quality version of the classic (4 yr old) version of Violet. This pup is not nearly as fluffy, as you can feel the battery box much more than the previous. Even more disappointing, as we were replacing a well-worn earlier version, is that you now can ONLY customize the child's name, color, and food and completely lost the options for choosing the songs played. A trait that was extremely well-used and refreshed with the older version. Why in thr world would Leapfrog take this functionality away???? Definitely a cheaper made product and certainly a downgrade. Why fix what isn't broken???",

I love how you get to personalize the songs with your kids favorite food, colors, and name. I don't mind having to buy a new one every few years (usually it stops working due to the wires inside coming loose from being loved on so much)",

Even though they both say the same thing each one was customized to say our daughter's names. The dog tag lights up when the music plays. Each paw controls a different group of songs. It even has a lullaby song feature that plays for 5 or 10 minutes when you click on the back right paw. The girls love it!!!",

So when my son tells Scout to play bedtime music at night, it flashes a few times and lights up the entire room. Just like my daughter with her Violet, my son will turn the music on in the middle of the night if he wakes up, and the very bright light just wakes him up more. For some reason this seems to be particular to the light used on Scout -- the Violet that my daughter has isn't nearly as bright.",
