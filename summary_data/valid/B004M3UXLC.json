Centos 7 loaded flawlessly , only missed step was clearing nvram using switch 6 on motherboard but after that everything is perfect. Well worth the money can\u2019t beat the price for what you get.",

I brought up the issue with StallionTek and received a response next business day with them offering to inspect and or replace the unit/board if necessary. You can get hardware anywhere but good service is hard to come by. Will definitely be purchasing another one in the next couple months.",

Update: I used this server as my main computer for a year or two and it just fine. Some things to note is that certain Windows types won't use both cpu's. I ended up getting Windows 10 ultimate. Since it is a 1U server certain pcie cards won't fit, so I ended up running a pcie extension out of the case to an external graphics card.",

I plan to get two drive sleds and put some data SSDs in the other two slots. Now if I could just find enough ram to quadruple to 128GB for the price of this server. Using mine to run esxi (on an internal SD card) so I can continue doing Cisco la be my environments. Oh and this thing runs pretty quiet, so no problems putting it in the office with you.",
