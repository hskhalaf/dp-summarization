It's very well made and has a cover over it so when not in use, you don't even know it's there. My 4 year old can now climb down this from the second floor all by herself so I can sleep much better at night. Worth every penny.",

I decided on this product as opposed to a hook and ladder setup. Wasn\u2019t sure if my 8 year old could get the hook and ladder setup from under her bed, hook it, open window, and climb down (especially if light/electricity is out). This product takes a couple crucial steps out of the process and during our fire drill, my 8 year old daughter could easily get out of the house. I would recommend this product to households with young children, even though it is more expensive than the hook and ladder style.",

Only suggestion would be for them to coat the stand-off legs in plastic so the metal doesn't mar the side of your house when you test it out.

    "description": "Size Name:Two StoryDuring a fire, every second counts. That's why the Werner ESC-220 Two-Story Fire Escape Ladder is made to help you and your family evacuate your home quickly. Designed for placement on your home's second story, this durable ladder installs in the wall below a window, so it's always ready to go and can never be misplaced. When Every Second Counts According to the U. S. Fire Administration, a small flame can grow out of control in 30 seconds, turning into a major fire that threatens serious injury or death. Moreover, most residential fires occur at night while we sleep, and they spread too quickly for the fire department to respond. For the best chance of survival, families need to be able to escape from an upstairs window within 30 seconds. The ESC-220 makes that possible. Permanently Installs for Peace of Mind In the event of an emergency, you need to secure your family, not your fire ladder. That's why the ESC-220 permanently installs into the wall below a second-story window. This clever design means you'll never spend wasted time trying to locate your emergency ladder. An added bonus, the ESC-220 blends with any d\u00e9cor, as it can be painted or wallpapered to complement your room. User-Friendly Design is Strong and Heat Resistant Because you have only seconds to exit a burning home, the ESC-220 is easy to deploy--it fully extends to 17 feet, 2 inches when the release tab is pulled. This escape ladder is also incredibly strong and sturdy, with heat-resistant nylon webbing and anti-slip flat rungs and stand-offs. To help keep you steady, a helpful first-step assistance strap provides safety and stability. What's more, the ESC-220 holds up to 1, 200 pounds, which allows multiple family members and rescue professionals to use the ladder at the same time. And unlike one-time-use fire ladders, the ESC-220 can be repacked and used for practice drills.
