It only required some minor adjustments to eliminate some ghost flushing after it was installed. Since it uses so little water the tank refills almost immediately. We were so used hearing the water run from filling the old style tank we thought it might be broken. Very pleased with this unit and will probably purchase another when we remodel the second bath.",

We've been using them consistently for the past 7 months and have had zero issues with either toilet. I read reviews of people having issues with the buttons and needing to adjust them, we never had that problem with either toilet. We can use the #1 button for #2s and the toilet has no problem flushing it all down. We rarely ever use the #2 button. We paired it with the Brondell LumaWarm seat warmer. Fantastic toilet!
