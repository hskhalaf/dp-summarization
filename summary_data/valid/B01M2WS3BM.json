I bought this kit and some No.7 rubbing compound to remove some scuffs and a little paint transfer from the right rear fender of my Kia (my wife backed into it) and from the rear bumper of her car. The drill attachment is pretty stout, very decent quality, the velcro sticks great, and even though it came with an assortment of 7 foam pads, I only used one of the foam pads to take out the scuffing and transferred paint from both vehicles and then the woolen buffer pad to shine and clean it all. Worked like a champ, both vehicles look 100% better!",

If there is a knock to be had, I wish the backing pad was slightly undersized to minimize the possibility catching the edge as you reach into crevices... but it's something that I could probably trim down myself.",
