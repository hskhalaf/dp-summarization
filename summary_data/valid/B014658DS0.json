The inclusion of the USB connector inside the body of the recorder is I think is a mistake. It needs a lot of room around the port on the computer to be able to connect and it causes the recorder to be physically larger than it would need to be otherwise. A short USB cable is a better solution. The quality of the recording is outstanding when playing back on a computer. Nothing is perfect, but this close enough.",

Replaces the somewhat identical VN-702PC I've used for several years when recording field notes while birding (and on occasion satisfactorily recording bird songs). Improvements include a power switch that moves from off to on (no spring!), a battery compartment cover that seems designed to hold up better, and a built-in USB connector (replacing the cable connection of the old model). Only time will tell if it holds up as well in the long run, but early indications are favorable.",

In this situation, I had to print off the 80 pages manual from the Olympus website. Only after going through the manual was I able to figure out how the maximize the use of this recorder. Would recommend the clip-on microphone and the hard shell carrying case accessories. They make it so much easier to use this recorder.",
