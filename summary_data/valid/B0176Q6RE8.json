Other products had such a strong flavor that I discontinues use. The quality was another large factor in my purchase. All around good product.",

BUT the fact was that I received a plenty of compliments from my friends... I always had acne on my back and some pigment spots on the face, the complexion of my skin became smoother, no vivid spots any more. Only thing is that I usually forgot to add the powder to my smoothie as it changed the taste of the coffee. So next time I'd better order pills.",

It does dissolve with a bit more stirring, but we like it and it is from grass fed beef, unlike GL which should put it on their packages if they do. We like it.",

Some of the reviews complain about the packaging, but I just pour it into a large jar for storage anyway, so this packing actually made that easier to do than pouring from a canister. Overall, a really great product! I just wish it would be added to Amazon's Subscribe & Save program to make my restocking easier.",
