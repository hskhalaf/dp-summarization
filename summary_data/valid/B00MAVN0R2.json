Additionally, the design of the wallet makes it very difficult to actually fill very many of the credit card slots. The wallet gets extremely thick and it becomes difficult to select a specific card and remove it when needed. This wallet is probably best for people with no more than one ID card (2 max) and no more than 2-3 credit/debit cards max.",

Not going to return as it's not worth the effort and it's a quality build for the price. Update 11/21/17 I decided to upgrade this to 4 stars. The slim design is really worth whatever it lacks in height. I'd adapted to folding receipts. The wallet has held up very well and shows little sign of wear.",

It accomodates U.S, currency fine but it is too narrow to accomodate the standard width of credit card receipts (unless you are willing to fold them in half sideways, ha) This is why I have only given it three stars.

So I am getting 2 Alpine Swiss wallets to replace their old wallets. I'm sure their experiences will be just as good as my husbands. :)",
