      "text": "Let me start by saying I love how this blender looks. The fun yellow color I got looks great in my kitchen. However that\u2019s as far as it goes. It does a terrible job blending things. It somehow gets an airbubble at the bottom where the blades are, pushes things up away from the blades and then the motor just spins away while thing is being touched by the blades. I repeatedly have to push stuff down into the blades to get it blended. A normal smoothie made with frozen fruit can take me almost 10 mins to make. Crazy. I hate this thing and wish I had just sucked it up and gotten a vitamix.",

I usually have to unplug before trying to remove pitcher.. After using for a while removing pitcher gets much easier. So rating from 2 stars to 4.",

I had purchased an extended warranty 4 year and I thought it would be repaired if I had problems during that period. NO such thing!!!!

With a full pitcher of blended margaritas in the pitcher, this was not an easy task and quite cumbersome. It is not user friendly and I would never recommend this blender to anyone. Although the plastic pitcher seemed light weight and possibly easier to handle, the whole design of this blender is flawed and is a burden to use. I would love to return this blender, but due to a glitch with delivery through Amazon, I am past the return option. Buyer beware!",

Replacement part included the entire pitcher; it was almost as much as a new blender, so I got this one. It does a great job, but the pitcher doesn\u2019t clamp down firmly, causing a pronounced loose rattling when it is working; have to press down with some force to limit that. Worst of all, I am very reluctant to let it blend for a long time, hands-free. It is also far noisier than my previous model. Lastly, there are redundancies in the controls that are probably for safety but, for me, they are just annoying.",

So far, the KitchenAid has been able to crush anything and everything with ease, including huge frozen strawberries in a smoothie. It's used mostly for making them, BTW.

Ice crushing feature is great. I would definitely purchase this again if I needed to.",

I use it for my smoothies every morning it crushes it blends I just bought another for another house The jar is plastic so it is very very light and easy to handle and very very sturdy. I can't say enough about it I honestly have never had a blender that works as well My smoothies consist of carrots apples celery peppers bananas frozen blueberries spinach and everything gets chopped up nicely. I just hope it is not discontinued.",
