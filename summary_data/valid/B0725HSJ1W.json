I wish I had looked at the manual (all 134 pages of it!) and found out how complicated it was - then I would not have bought it.

    "title": "Olympus TG-5 Tough Camera - Black",
    "description": "Ultimate adventures often involve the most challenging lighting conditions. From arctic twilight to the undersea world, the ability to deal with low light in particular is the key to a great image. A new image sensor with superb high-speed and high-sensitivity performance combined with the latest True Pic VIII image processor taken from our flagship system camera gives better image quality than before with enhanced dynamic range and improved response time. The new TG-5 lets you link GPS, compass, manometer and temperature data to your photos and videos, and transfer it via Wi-Fi to your smartphone or tablet. The dual-pane protective glass is just one new addition to the other proven tough capabilities, you can keep shooting whatever nature throws at you. Extreme shifts in temperature can cause condensation on lenses. The TG-5 prevents this with dual-pane protective glass, meaning you can keep shooting regardless. Capture even more of the action. Making great moves look amazing means capturing every detail at just the right moment. The TG-5s cutting-edge image technology makes that easier than ever. Its high-speed VIII processor allows you to record in incredible 4K resolution and create full-HD sized, 120fps slow-motion movies. Relive the moment in full. Capture wonderful experiences in 4K and slow motion video, along with tracking info and share them with ease. Import field sensor data like compass, manometer and temperature and images taken on the camera to a smartphone via the TG-5s built-in Wi-Fi and OI. Share capability, then link them to create videos with a tracking data overlay in the free Olympus Image Track (OI. Track) app. Waterproof 15m The TG-5s superb waterproof performance down to depths of up to 15 meters not only enables you to shoot in heavy rain or white water rapids, but even while snorkelling. Shockproof 2.1m To protect the bright 1:2.0 high-speed lens, the TG-5 is built with Olympus unique and outstanding shock-absorption technology, making it robust enough to withstand a drop test from a height of 2.1 metres. Freeze proof -10C Every part in this camera, including the electronic components, is designed to withstand the harsh conditions of winter sports, with operation guaranteed down to minus 10C. Crushproof (100kg) The interior protective structure of the camera is built to withstand a load of 100 kg, so you will not have to worry about accidentally sitting on your camera when carrying it in your back pocket. 12 Megapixel The newly developed image sensor used in the TG-5 delivers high-speed performance and superb high-sensitivity. It gives better image quality than before with less noise and improved image detail and delivers natural-looking, high-resolution movies. VIII The TG-5 features the latest Truepic VIII image processor taken from the Olympus Pro flagship system camera OM-D E-M1 Mark II. Its improved image processing algorithm is even more powerful to deliver higher image resolution in low-contrast areas especially when shooting at low ISO sensitivity. Maximum ISO12800 Even better quality with high ISO sensitivity. The newly developed image sensor and high-speed image processor reduce noise in your images when using high ISO sensitivity. 4x Zoom Lens Whether for birds-eye view shots of scenic vistas at wide-angle settings (35mm equivalent: 25mm) or zoomed-in shots of faraway objects at telephoto settings (35mm equivalent: 100mm) the 4x zoom lens delivers photos that match your intentions. Pro Capture Mode When out in the wild and you want to capture precise moments, sometimes you need a little help. The TG-5 is equipped with a class-exclusive Pro Capture Mode that captures a series of shots before and after you fire the shutter to help you get the exact shot you want, with ease. Art Filter Art Filters let you give your photos a choice of classic effects. Explore your creativity using 14 popular options. Art Filters provide an expanded range of photo expressions for even more photo fun. Live Composite Whether you shoot star trails, fireworks or fireflies with stationary subjects in the same image, Live Composite combines only those areas of multiple images that contain new light without over-exposure that occurs in normal bulb shooting. RAW Recording With the TG-5 you can create the ideal image in post-production. Even when you are out and about, you can edit images in-camera. Save your images in the RAW format and use the included Olympus Viewer 3 software to fine tune parameters such as exposure, contrast, white balance and colour balance.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nTG-5 Camera, Strap, Li-92 Lithium Ion Battery, F-5AC USB/AC Adapter, CB-USB12 UB Cable",
