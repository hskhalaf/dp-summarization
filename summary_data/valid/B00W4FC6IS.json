      "text": "This safe is very nice. I really like the combination lock. However I was doing research and seen that it came from a safe company in S.C. So I ordered it thinking it was American made. When it was delivered, right on the box it say's made in China. My final thought on it is that is was a great buy, with little hassle because they delivered it to my front door! But it is not American made!",

I'm not going to say that it is impossible to break into provided that you had time and the right equipment but this safe is 100 times better than the box store crap that is being sold for nearly the same cost. The customer service from order to delivery and even after purchase (they returned my call for a question after hours within 10 minutes) was top notch by Steelwater.",
