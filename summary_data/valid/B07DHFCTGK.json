      "text": "The remote app doesn't work on droid. If you want to use the amp as an interface for the cubase recording software that comes with the amp you need to do a few things. Once you select which type of track you want to record ( eg: distorted guitar and vocals) you need to go into studio-studio setup-vst audio system, and from there go to asio driver and select spider v. Then you can back out select the amp as your input an/or output. Also know, this software is very buggy, problematic and not worth one dollar. At least this garbageware is free.",

I have an 8-string (Ibanez RG8) and this amp brings out the deeper tones in a way that portable amps cannot. Effect presets work like a charm. I expected a TS (1/4\") output jack, but there's only a standard headphone jack (3.5mm). No aux in, either. Not a problem per se, but not what I expected. On the whole, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.",
