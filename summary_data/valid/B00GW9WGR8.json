Zep had no effect on that problem and when we had our septic service provider out to address the problem he advised us that Zep's was of no value at best and could be harmful. He found the problem (a leak in the pipe adjacent to the tank) and fixed it. He also told us that our system was working well and didn't need what Zep promised to do. When I tried to return several boxes of the expensive product they refused my request. That stinks.",
