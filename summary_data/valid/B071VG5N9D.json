      "text": "This is a roomy roller suitcase for a good price. But you get what you pay for. The collapsible handle is SUPER flimsy and has a GIANT wobble when partially or fully extended. It just \"feels\" cheap, and I doubt it will last with repeated use. One trip out of town and the hard exterior had a massive gouge and black mark. While I can at least chalk part of this up to bag handlers being rough, I feel like this suitcase didn't even put up much of a fight and that it will quickly and heavily wear with repeat use",

There are certainly cheaper options and there are more expensive options , but this set is the right value for me. They are well designed and made with quality material and seem fairly sturdy and spacious. Overall they fit both my needs and budget.",

It is standard carry on size for most airlines unless you board a small commuter transport. There is plenty of room for a 5 day trip. The lining on the inside is durable and has enough pockets for the necessities. I would buy this again. Actually I might buy the blue one for my husband.",

On both, the telescoping handle has started giving a lot of trouble in collapsing back down. You either have to open the suitcase and does the buttons that snap it into the up position or pull up the handle only part way to avoid it getting locked in the first place. In either case, wire a pain to deal with. I travel a lot and spend more on luggage believing you get what you post for and was proven right again on this",

There is no way this can fit in a Spirit test size bin and pass the test, but if you can make it on the plane with this, it will fit in the overhead storage on a Spirit plane.
