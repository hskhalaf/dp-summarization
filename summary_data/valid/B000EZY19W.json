This does them all - and superbly! Since our computer has Win 7 on it, I located the newer drivers and installed them; I didn't even bother with the disc that came with the scanner. I simply \"Twain\" from Photoshop (using the Import command) and get absolutely wonderful scans of photos, negatives and slides. I even checked out using this on some of our old Ambrotype photos (glass plate positives) with excellent results. I can't say enough good things about this scanner!",

The Epson, Silverlight and Abbyy OCR software - all of which are included - are impressive. Both the Epson and Silverlight take a little tweaking - I have not yet fully fathomed all they may be capable of. I love this scanner.",

My digital imaging software recognizes the formats and even allows manipulation of the image if needed. Excellent product, great scans, Only dig I have is that there is very little info in the manual about xrays, but if all uses of this scanner were to be fully discussed in the manual, the thng would be 1000 pages long.

It is very helpful that you can scan not only 35mm and 120 film but medium format as well. I would recommend this scanner to anyone that scans film as a professional photographer, for print. This is not an item that would be worth the investment in though, if you are just scanning old high school photos for your 10 year reunion.",

The free Silverfast scanning app work fine until it crashed during a cancelled scan. For unknown reason after the crash, it won't accept registration again. Which is fine...I can live with out it. I gave this scanner a four star because this kind of quality used to cost over $1000 in semi-pro range for professional usage. Granted it's no drum scan, but that would be a total overkill.",
