      "pros": [
        "Microsoft's slickly designed Xbox Live Vision for Xbox 360 is a relatively inexpensive, USB Web-cam-style video camera that allows you to video-chat online with other Xbox Live gamers",
        "You can also use the camera to add still images to your text messages and your gamertag picture, not to mention that some upcoming games will allow you to map your face to your in-game player using the camera",
        "We also like the shimmering water effect the camera puts on the background of the Xbox Live menu system, not to mention that when you're in music mode on your Xbox 360, you can play with the visualization with hand gestures",
        "Lastly, the Xbox Live Vision camera can double as a Web cam on your PC or Mac"

Note-- it will NOT work on USB 1 ports! You need USB 2 ports (i have a PowerMac G4 and i added usb 2 ports via pci expansion cards) The video quality is pretty good. You could twist the front lens for sharpness or softness of image. Works well with photobooth. Works well as a low end security cam too with EvoCam software (shareware sold separately; can be found on macupdate.com) This is a pretty good webcam for the price (under $15).",

I frequently use the camera to video conference with family on the west coast. However, as any photographer knows. lighting is critical. If you use this camera with only backlighting, there will be some quality issues. Overhead lighting or frontal lighting mitigates or eliminates all issues. Whatever you do, avoid open and bright sunlit windows behind you when using the camera (or any camera for that matter). Even if you just place a small lamp next to or in front of the subject, your video will be greatly improved.",

It is a \"no-frills\" camera that is a true \"plug-and-play\" for the Xbox 360 and serves its purpose well . . . for our 12-year-old son to \"see\" his friends while playing on Xbox Live. An added benefit is that it also allows us (his parents) to \"see\" who our son is gaming with. Comes with an extra-long USB connection cord, has both auto-focus and manual focus adjustment, adjusts well to minimal background lighting, and allows for snap-shot pictures which can be used as a personal avatar and even inserted into some Xbox games as an overlay for the characters. I would recommend this product",

You can even have your face scanned and have your image on a character in \"Rainbow Six: Las Vegas\" when your on XBOX Live. You can even hook it up to your computer (after downloading the appropriate drivers) and look at your self there. Other than that it's pretty useless. Here's hoping that Microsoft expands on this idea, soon. I gave it 3 stars because it works but there are not many uses for this thing as of now.",

      "text": "After misplacing my first vision camera I finally decided to purchase a new one after a couple years. This package was just what I needed too. My Xbox LIVE gold membership was out and I had no working headset at the time. Although, the Vision camera package I received was clearly not in any acceptable condition. The camera itself had a sticky substance along the focusing ring. The codes for both the 1 month subscription and UNO game had already been used. The wired headset was also missing.",
