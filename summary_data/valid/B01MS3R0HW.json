Look to other reviewers for comments on that. These bongos simply strike me as extremely well made, and have proven lots of good fun. --Not so seriously: my wife can't keep a beat. I may have to kill her soon: she loves to, dare I say, bang on di drums all day! ... at least at parties. Oh, and I love my wife. Don't buy these for your wife if you hate her, or if she hates you.

We saw her grab a set of bongos during a concert and knew she needed her own. She was blown away when she opened her gift and spent the rest of the day playing. My husband, who plays the electric guitar, said I \"chose wisely'! Beautiful construction, loved the wood selection, great sound - couldn't ask for better .... so I guess I going with Pyle's reputation was a wise choice.",
