I cleaned the wall really well and let it dry. I used the construction adhesive and followed those directions. I held it in place for 30 min. Pain in the ass, but I haven\u2019t had any issues since. Just make sure to follow the directions about getting the bottles to work correctly. Other than that (having to buy different adhesive) it\u2019s amazing! It has decreased the clutter in my shower and I can have everything on or in it. Definitely a good investment for me.",

Nothing comes out no matter how much I pump. Here's a tip that will quickly resolve the issue: 1. Push down on the pump button and hold it. 2. Use your other hand to block the nozzle so air cannot be sucked in when you release the pump button. 3. Release pump button while your other finger firmly holds the nozzle to prevent air leak. 4. Release nozzle and repeat step 1~3. It will start to flow after 3 or 4 times.",

My shower is now organized with the stuff I need all in one place and no more bottles all over!! It truly is a sturdy dependable unit and stays put. No worries there. Mom and Dad have never had any problems with the pumps on theirs so I look forward to the same performance.",

I liked this product because it was very neat and organized and it seemed more durable than all of the previous shower organizers I have purchased in the past. For some reason, they only last a year or so in my household before they start to slide off the shower head or break. So far it works wonderfully. I would purchase again. It is easy to install and the hold seems very tight. Excellent product!",
