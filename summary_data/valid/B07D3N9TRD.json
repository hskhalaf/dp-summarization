Sound : Very good, but the gunshots in Destiny 2 seem tinny compared to my old headset (Turtle Beach XO One Amplified Stereo Gaming Headset). Comfort: 4/5 - since after a while, you'll need to take them off if only to give your ears some relief from the tight fit (that really muffles exterior noises eg the wifey/TV blah, blah, blah, :D). A word of warning, you cannot connect this directly to the XB1 controller without the audio connector (* purchase separately *).",

What I've found is a sleak looking headset, not overly comfortable, far too much bass (great if you're intending on jamming out) and one that fails miserably in helping you determine the direction of your enemy (which the x12's did masterfully). Generally, you would assume a brand gets better with age; but, I'm not so sure with Turtle Beach and would have serious reservations about ever buying from them again.",

Polymer plastic finished in mat black and extra padding alround. They feel really good. The sound is good, three modes for all different types of entertainment, gaming, movies or music.

Second set arrived, and less than a month later here we are again - in exactly the same position with exactly the same defect. Clearly a floored product with no longevity in mind.

You'd think that the battery life would be reasonable, but it only lasts for a couple of hours after a full night's charge. The mic is poor quality, but that is to be expected at this price. The cable to connect to your device, however, is unbelievably short. I have to crane my neck when I plug them into my desktop speaker next to the monitor. This makes for incredibly tedious and uncomfortable gaming. Speaking of comfort, these headphones are incredibly tight on the head, and the earpads are too small. The controls on the headphones are small and fiddly. The sound quality is fine, I guess.",

However, within a couple of weeks of the new one coming, he experienced similar issues, only this time it was purely when he was using his Xbox.

      "text": "Great Headset... for about 4/5 weeks. Bought as a gift for my youngest brother so he could talk to his friends on his xbox. Now the headset wire is faulty and makes a terrible buzzing sound. Cant afford to buy another as its pretty expensive. So not only have I wasted money but now my little brother cant communicate with his friends and he feels left out again.",
