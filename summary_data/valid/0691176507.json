It has many photos with important field marks identified. Other information such as range maps, abundance, habitat, broods, is provided very efficiently using codes and color schemes so that a great deal of information is available on every page. The book is well thought out, carefully organized and clearly presented. I think this is a significant advance in field guide presentation and if the casual observer wanted to have one field guide to cover the important information, this would be the best choice.",
