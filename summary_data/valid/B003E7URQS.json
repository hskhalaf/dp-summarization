Overall this shovel was a good choice for the money and will likely serve me for years to come.",

Actually I thought it was a simple aluminum shovel with a steel tip, it is in fact 1/8 inch steel, all steel and can shovel ice as well as snow. The handle is sturdy and I almost look forward to using it... almost. It should last a lot longer than any plastic or aluminum shovel. I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to shovel snow or ice. I've owned probably a dozen plastic and aluminum shovels and this may be the last one I buy.",

The big width not only limits slide-off to the sides, but also makes a smoother \"ride\" over rough surfaces. One complaint: the rear doesn't curve in quite enough. Unlike a snowplow, even moderate amounts of snow just roll over the top. Still extremely useful, though, and highly recommended.",

My only additional comment would be to strongly recommend the D handle on any shovel you purchase. Even though this is listed as a snow pusher, there are many times when you will want to lift the load at the end of the push to get the snow off the drive. The D handle makes this easier as it helps control any twisting from an imbalanced load. Great product that will last the average homeowner a lifetime. Literally.",

The big width not only limits slide-off to the sides, but also makes a smoother \"ride\" over rough surfaces. One complaint: the rear doesn't curve in quite enough. Unlike a snowplow, even moderate amounts of snow just roll over the top. Still extremely useful, though, and highly recommended.",

Don't think you are going to actually shovel with it though, it is a pusher only, the snow slides off of it because the metal surface is slick.

Unfortunately for my husband, he had to come out and shovel the edges for me with a different shovel, but it was still quicker using this pusher. Great for a smooth surface, like asphalt, probably wouldn't want to use this on gravel.",

Use of a lubricant like silicon spray helps keep the snow from building up and sticking to the shovel, otherwise it is a back breaker to pick up the shovel at the end of a sweep. The 30\" wide blade is efficient for clearing a lot of area but is not good for those tight places. Very pleased with the purchase. Shovel should last a long long time which will make the shovel's expense seem like a good buy in years to come.",

It's fine for quick clearing of a very light skift of snow, but when there is any depth, it makes lifting the snow too hard ... the blade tips too easily to one side or the other, dumping snow where you may not want it.
