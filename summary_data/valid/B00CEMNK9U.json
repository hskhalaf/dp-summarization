Probably not any fault of the manufacturer, but just be aware these are not easy to install. I had to buy a tire changer kit from harbor freight to change out the old ones, couldn't do it with normal hand tools. Once the tire was on the rim I could not get it to inflate. Tied a come along around the outside and cranked it down, still no luck. Ended up returning and buying wheel and tires already mounted from the hardware store for just a bit more $",
