Sending back ASAP and going back to my first love, even though it's more $, the DeLonghi Cool Touch-now that's a quality deep fryer!! See ya, Hamilton Beach!!!",

Frying needs to be done at 375\u00b0. So you need an oil that will not smoke and burn (and be harmful). I am using EXTRA LIGHT Olive Oil (NOT Extra Virgin). It's smoke temp is about 450\u00b0, so you can cook safely at 375\u00b0 and oil will stay healthy and use many times. It is a perfect size cooked for 1-2 people, too small for families. If you are single or just a couple like we are, it's great. Happy Cooking (and eating)!!! Tim",

However, when we received the fryer and put it together to our dismay we realized the lid would not close because the closing mechanism was broken. The closing mechanism relies on a tiny, fragile piece of plastic to latch onto, and it had snapped off in the box at some point, so we had to return the whole thing. Comparing it to our old fryer, which was also a budget-friendly model, it's inexcusably cheaply made. We'll be trying a different product instead.",

I measured the min max markings on the inside of the pot with the element attached and the minimum is 8 cups and the maximum is 10 cups. This is a large discrepancy. Should I go by the markings or what the manual states?",

I\u2019d never suggest it for meal prep and it takes up too much space as a snack maker.",
