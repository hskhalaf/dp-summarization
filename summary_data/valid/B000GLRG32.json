The tension you need to actually put them in is the problem. I'm highly upset because I was really excited for this product. UPDATE I was able to get the stripped screws in other means. I would not recommend using the giving Allen wrench if you have stright screw drive style Allen keys would be better especially for the first 2 screws. After the first tow everything else was fine and was able to huild without issues. the final product when finish is actually pretty nice for the money.",

I might have to sand the inside of the drawer for a looser fit, but that's okay because no one will see from that angle. I am very impressed with the quality and I highly recommend it!",

Here\u2019s a hint - if a piece is missing holes the instructions say should be there, do not power drill those holes in (whoops). 2- my Italian 18 oz wine glasses do not fit in the wine glass holders because the bases are not completely flat, which was a little frustrating, but my smaller 14 oz glasses fit fine.",

Also, the wine rack holders- they don't hold your traditional 750ml bottle of wine. Had to buy self seal pipe insulation to make the rods larger so that it makes the gaps smaller. Not ideal, but I'm certainly not trying to break this all down and send back. A little disappointing",

I didn't return it since i knew i wouldn't move it a lot so it will be fine. I'm happy with it.",
