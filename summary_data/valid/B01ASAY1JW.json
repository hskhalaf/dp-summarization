The zipper on top side pocket (picture 1) broke and separated from bag within the first month of use. Pocket now open and not usable. Followed by the deteriation of fabric below the lift pocket (picture 2)on the bag bottom. Cannot use lift pocket without further damage to underlying fabric. Picture shows bag that looks new, but I've documented the lack of durability!! I hope to exchange or return this bag. Very disappointed!!",

I have yet to figure out a good way to strap it onto the cart. It will stay on but I have to cinch it down tightly to the point it can hamper replacing clubs into the outside compartments. Otherwise it's functional and I like it, just wish the design had been completed.",

I have downgraded my rating from a 4 star to 2 because although the cloth sleeves go all the way down, clubs constantly get hung up. I even put addtional plastic sleeves in and they still hang up.
