These were supposed to be delivered Monday, and that was the night I needed them. They actually ended up being delivered the Saturday before. These candles however floated much better than the ones I bought from the store! I will definitely buy this brand again when I need floating candles.",

When I received them I did a test run on one floating in a mason jar to see how long they would burn. 7 hours later, I blew it out and the candle was only about 1/3 used. I had 48 of them burning the night of the event which lasted about 4 hours and saved them because I can use them again for at least 4-8 more hours. Best candles I've ever seen in almost 60 years. Love, love, love them! Thanks for such a great product.",

The ones that were nearly done burning after over 6 hours were placed three per vessel in water. I imagine the extra heat of the other candles or a draft in the area caused them to burn faster. Just an FYI. Honestly, 6 hours is really good for such small candles! Others placed singularly were less than half burned after 6 hours. I saved them for personal use later!",
