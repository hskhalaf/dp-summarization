The packaging and style was faultless, what you'd expect from Apple and I was quite excited! However when I compared the audio to my old headphones I wasn't blwon away. I played music on the beats for a few days to bed them in but they were lacking for me. It's obviously a personal choice and other users will disagree but the beats will be going back I'm afraid. I continue the search to replace the headphones, will now look towards the Sony headphones.",

Sound quality is very good. Build quality is premium and the noise cancellation is very good indeed.",
