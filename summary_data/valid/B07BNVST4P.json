It's almost impossible to pedal unless you're on a flat surface, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort to get it going.It has a fixed chain, so no changing gears. It's great for what it is. It rides well and I'm very happy with it overall, but not being able to use it if the battery dies is a big design flaw.",

Maybe I just got a lemon, but for $500 I expect all of them to work properly. I don't have an alternate to suggest, but if you choose this one be sure it's on Prime.

However, I gave it to my GF (5'2\", 135 lbs) and she loves it. She even rode it to work 14.2 mi each way and the battery lasted with charge up while shes at work. So all in all it's a good bike if you're on the shorter side. Bought the rack for back and can place a bag on there to transport lock, charger, water etc.",
