I purchased the additional upgrade to be able to cut directly from Illustrator and not mess with their software system. Unfortunately, the plugin breaks every time Adobe updates Illustrator. Silhouette is unresponsive to getting the plugin fixed and just offers to sell their Designer edition of their software which can import and cut vector files. It would be one thing if it was a free plugin, but it's not, and as a paid, premium product, I expect better service from companies I do business with.",

I'm done with this. I was trying to invest in a new tool to help add a little something to my furniture/decor jobs, but low and behold, I received a dud.",

I like the touch screen feature and the option to cut slightly wider pieces. I have been disappointed with the automatic blade so far. My vinyl was not cutting correctly so I switched back to the normal blade and no longer had issues. I will try buying another automatic blade to see if maybe it was just an issue with the one that came with my machine or if the machine itself is not adjusting correctly. I am happy with my purchase and Amazon certainly had the best price online.",
