They are not broken just looks like they were never put on the post. Not sure how much longer it will hold her weight. Not sure what to do about it at this point I bought it in Feb. She is too little to jump in it so again I just think it was not fully assembled right at the factory.",

I liked the canopy with the animals that kept her attention and the vibration really helped to keep her asleep. The pockets were convenient for storage. I didn't really use the changing table part much because while I'm only 5'7\", it felt too low.",
