The consistency is pretty thick and can be hard to blend, so i put it it over my spots and before i try and blend it I soray my Mario Badescu facial spray. This just helps get it a little bit more wet to blend, you could use any kind of facial spray.",

Good color match for my skin tone I use this product first, then Bare Minerals foundation powder to even out the edges of the concealer and to absorb oil and prevent blemishes. I find very sparing use of this concealer to be sufficient for my needs. I use it for both blemishes and ingrown hairs. My face hates my facial hair, so I'm constantly battling ingrown hairs, but this concealer definitely helps me to hide the negative effects upon my face. I've used this concealer since junior high, so about 20 years now, and I keep coming back because it does the job.",
