Much to my surprise, the bags seem larger than the ones I've used for years, are strong, fit the can perfectly. The can is designed to hold the bag in place. It's easy to clean, amd the swing top keeps fruit flies and other insects out. I'm in Hawaii, where food, even the tiniest bit, will attract insects out of nowhere. This can exceeded my expectations.",

I really like the lid because it fits on very securely, and the part that moves when you put trash in it is well balanced ensuring that it will return to the \"closed\" position. This size is great even if using 13 gal bags because they fit perfectly, and the larger aspect of can allows them fill completely, instead of 3/4 capacity like a 13gal garbagecan causes. I haven't tried 16 gal bags yet. What else can I say? It works as advertised!",

I've tried larger bags but then the bag gathers up at the top and looks sloppy. I would recommend this trash can 100% for the quality, attractiveness and price.",

Top snaps right on and swings free. The can is good looking, well made, and comes with a 5 year warranty. I am using this for my beverage container recycling and the bottle bags (similar in size to 13 gallon trash bags) fit fine without any bottom support. I am a simple human being who has become a simplehuman fan for life. These products are more than a purchase they are an investment.",
