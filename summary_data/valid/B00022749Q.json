With these straps, all the weight of what you are lifting is lifted by the major muscle groups of your legs and then your arms are free to help navigate the item.

Right now I'm still neutral about this one and hence the 3 stars. I will definitely know for sure with more use and with different people.

They are easy to use, if you follow directions. And they do help tremendously with proper lifting and lifting posture. Your height makes no difference; like with other moving straps, as these adjust to the individual, and can be adjusted to meet the proper height conditions for the item being moved, rather than just the individuals lifting it. They do not gouge into your shoulder, as the harness distributes the weight over your entire upper body. Great product and highly recommend for moving difficult and awkward items.",

Would have been perfect if it had 2 cross straps instead of one strap that you have to balance the furniture on. Would recommend to get a different brand if you plan on carrying a large mattress. Would probably be more useful for people who work as movers. We don't move heavy objects too often and hence became useless after our move.",

I had a Samsung Double Wall Oven that was delivered before it was ready to put into an enclosure I was building. With this strap, my wife (5'4) and I were able to easily move the oven and lift it high enough to fit into it's enclosure. Samsung lists the weight of the oven as 270 lbs. It's a real back saver. All you have to do is balance it which is fairly easy.",

Even though you wear these on your shoulders, they allow you to keep your back straight and lift with your legs, especially since you don't bend down much. Instead of putting your hands underneath something to lift it, you put the strap underneath and your hands stay up top to steady it. Allows much safer lifting.",

    "title": "Shoulder Dolly Moving Straps - Lifting Strap for 2 Movers - Move, Lift, Carry, And Secure Furniture, Appliances, Heavy, Bulky Objects Safely, Efficiently, More Easily Like The Pros - Essential Moving Supplies - LD1000",
    "description": "Make moving feel effortless with the Shoulder Dolly 2-Person Lifting and Moving System. By using the ergonomic shoulder harnesses, movers and lifters can lift without worry by lifting and securing items better than ever. Not only will appliances, TVs, furniture, and all other heavy, bulky items be more secure when using the Shoulder Dolly, but back pain and strain will be avoided by putting the work on the body's strongest muscles and using proper lifting techniques. \n\nWhether you are a professional mover, delivery team, or simply moving residences, you can move large objects while keeping your hands free to maneuver doors, manage stairs, and stabilize items even better without putting the lifting strain on your arms. The adjustability of the strap will allow not only unlimited range of motion for the movers but will also allow for moving and lifting nearly any possible item, up to 800 lbs heavy and 10 feet long. This 2-person system was designed by a professional mover to ease the burden of lifting heavy and bulky objects. The kit contains two harnesses and one 12' long x 5\" wide lifting strap.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe ShoulderDolly gives you a hand in moving the heavy stuff--and reduces back, arm, and hand strain. This 2-person system was designed by a professional mover to ease the burden of lifting heavy and bulky objects. The kit contains two harnesses and one 12' long x 5\" wide lifting strap. To lift an object, both people will slip the harness over their head, place the lifting strap under the object, squat to adjust the webbing for differences in their heights and the weight of the object, then stand up! The ShoulderDolly encourages safe lifting techniques and reduces the risk of injury. Eliminates damage caused by hand trucks and traditional dollies--no more marring walls, floors, doors, or furniture.The ShoulderDolly lifting system makes lifting big/bulky/heavy items easier! By using natural leverage, the ShoulderDolly Lifting System allows two people to maintain proper upright posture while lifting any heavy object. The ShoulderDolly works in conjunction with the muscle groups in your legs and shoulders. The sturdy harness fits comfortably over your shoulders and by using your legs, the ShoulderDolly significantly decreases strain and the risk of injury to your lower back, hands, biceps and forearms. It\u2019s a proven way to move big bulky items, safely, easily and more efficiently than a moving dolly. The recommended carrying capacity is up to 800 lbs, however, that is subject to the lifters ability. Each set weighs 4 lbs. One ShoulderDolly set includes everything you need for two people.",
