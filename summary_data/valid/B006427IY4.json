After getting it set up, I find if I am reading and writing a bunch (say converting video from and to the NAS device), I lose connection (device crashes) after an hour or so. But that is ok, it's a NAS not a local storage device. But the big issue (why I didn't choose 5 stars) is because I cannot seem to stream videos/movies to my TV reliable. The movies start, get 1-6 minutes in and stop.",
