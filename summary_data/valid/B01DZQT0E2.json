When I use this travel mug, the top does not screw on to the mug to where the drink opening lines up properly with the handle. In order to drink from this mug, I cannot hold the mug by the handle since it does not line up properly. If I buy another one, I will go back to Wal-mart and make sure that it lines up properly before purchasing it. I guess the seller got these at a discount as they were definitely factory seconds or rejects.",

Much to my dismay, I found that the top leaked a lot. However, I kept using it because of the navy blue color and it did keep my coffee fairly hot. When rinsing the cup/top out the other day, the rubber gasket (which was pretty disgustingly dirty) popped out and I cannot get it to go back in so that it somewhat seals the top. I am unfortunately way past the return item date, so now just have a useless travel mug. Thermos should redesign the top....",

All that smear left a dull finish on that front part of the mug. I tried baby oil, alcohol, hot soapy water and goo gone and nothing got that sticky off. I used it once. What a waste.",

The sliver lip part is so smooth and the seal is so tight that I (late 20's male) have a tough time opening it for my mom which kind of defeats the purpose of giving to someone with weak hands.

Even after daily soaking and careful scrubbing, I could still smell my coffee creamer. You knew that mold wasn't far away. It was just too much work...and then the threads on the tiny screw plastic part that operated the open/close mechanism stripped. After that, it wouldn't completely close or open. The mug just has too many plastic pieces that don't last. Thermos should be able to come up with something simpler.",

The shiny metal ring you see on the top now spins and you can't unscrew the top. If I could get it off then I would be afraid to tighten it good enough to seal it so it doesn't drip down my shirt.

    "description": "Color:Stainless SteelAn ideal choice for people on the go, the THERMOS Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Travel Mug is built to last and loaded with features to make for a more enjoyable drinking experience. THERMOS vacuum insulation technology virtually eliminates temperature change within the beverage container by creating an airless space between two stainless steel walls. The result is a superior insulated container you can depend on to keep your beverages hotter, colder, fresher, longer. This travel mug keeps beverages hot for 5 hours or cold for 9, making it a great choice for long days out and about or in the office. Constructed with double wall stainless steel, this 16 ounce travel mug is virtually durable, yet its sleek design is both eye-catching and functional. The contoured body shape is easy to grip and fits most automobile cup holders and is single serve compatible. For tea drinkers, a built-in tea hook is just the ticket to brew tea on the go. The tea hook can also accommodate most loose leaf infusers. The Stainless King Travel Mug comes equipped with a lid which operates simply by pushing the lever 45 degrees right or left to open and close. Because of the double wall insulation, the stainless steel body stays cool to the touch with hot beverages and condensation-free with cold beverages. In order to maximize the incredible insulation technology, it is recommended to either pre-chill or pre-heat the travel mug just prior to use. This can be accomplished by filling the mug with cold or hot tap water, attaching the lid and letting it rest for a few minutes. Before you are ready to use, simply empty the water and fill with your favorite beverage. The Stainless King Vacuum Insulated Travel Mug is made of BPA-free materials and is backed by a five-year limited warranty.",
