If you need help you'll never be able to obtain. I provided my product delivery notice and they seemingly accused me of forging the paperwork. Why would I want sensors for a product I didn't own. Last time we communicated, was told sensors were back ordered. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT",

The obvious complaint would be that it operates slowly- if that is a problem to you. It is not from my perspective., so I give it 5 stars. Had it installed about 3 months now, no complaints or problems.",

Although not the fastest opener, it still meets our needs, and best of all, it comes with a lifetime warranty. Customer service is great too. make sure you read the instructions thoroughly since there has been a design change.",

I can't recommend it enough. It is slower than some doors, and the opener doesn't seem to have quite the range of some, but the peace and quiet more than make up for it. Installation can be a little tricky, and it takes a while, but we managed just fine.",

Setup and installation was pretty simple as well once i found the correct set of instructions (it comes with several sets in different languages). After going through the \"learning\" cycles and synching the remotes, this opener performs as well/if not better than i hoped it would!",

Installation is pretty straightforward if you are switching this in to replace an existing garage door opener. The only thing to be aware of is that this may need some additional length of steel strap to install vs most other garage door openers due to the way the straps attach to the sides of the rail bracket instead of to the head end. You'll only really notice this during a retrofit if the original strap is too short, during a new install you'll be cutting it to the correct length anyway. Once in place, it stays quiet and just does the job.",
