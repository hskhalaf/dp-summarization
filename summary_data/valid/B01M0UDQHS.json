      "text": "These are pretty good. My dogs are not fans of any clothing (they are basically nudists) but they don't mind these. They keep most of the pups dry and they have these cool collars that kinda make them look like vampires. Also what I missed with these was that they have a little hole for the collar to connect to the leash, pretty smart idea. My only issue is that on one of my pups, the front comes undone quite a bit, but I think that it's my fault and I should have got him a larger size because it doesn't happen with the other pup. Overall, really good item, well made and easy to throw in the washer.",

Great for the rain so the stay dry allowing them to stay warmer. Thin lining so if you have a small dog or one that isn't a coated breed you may want a sweat shirt underneath for the really cold days. Our mini has a hoody on under it and it fits great",

I also like that it has a collar instead of a hood so keeps his neck warm too, without blocking his vision like some hooded dog raincoats have (i usually fold that style back) So its a nice added detail to the coat. Def would purchase again.",

I'm sure some people may find this jacket fine, but I live where it rains most of the year and only wanted it for light rain. I wouldn't go with it.",
