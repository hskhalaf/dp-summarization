The shovel is rusted and has scrapes all over it. It\u2019s also not as curved as I thought it would be... The bag the snips came in was completely ripped, and the folding scissors were hazardous to fold and unfold. Going to have to keep looking. Could be cute, I guess, if you get a new set!",

They're very easy to use, the shears are very sharp (watch out!), and the size is perfect for terrariums and small projects. All told they're about the length from the base of my palm to the tips of my fingers. Great price, and it came early which is always a fun surprise!",
