It is light weight, blocks out the sun rays, wears great in the ocean, dries fast, machine washable, still looks like brand new after wearing all summer long. My husband also wears this while out fishing. This shirt is true to size. I would recommend this to friends and family. If this review was at all helpful, please let me know by clicking on helpful.

They did not stick to much when I got out of the water and they dry quickly and we're comfortable. They did not itch or cause any rashes. I would buy them again",

It has not been through a washing machine or dryer, just rinsed with freshwater and hung to dry after each day. The photo shows the back of the shirt, near the neck, and you can clearly see the fabric is fraying. I can't figure out what could cause this, as all it has been exposed to is intense tropical sun, water (salt and fresh), and air. I can't recommend this shirt, as I've had other rash guards that have stood up to years of abuse without showing such signs of wear.",

Getting onto river tubes was a big harder though as the material has a rough grip feel when on rubber so rolling over in the tube was very difficult.

Tight.) **edit** After doing some more research, it does seem these 'rashguard' shirts are supposed to run tight. So if that's the intent, it does it well. It's not body-suit tight but certainly tighter than a t-shirt of the same size. I have since ordered the loose-fit version, let's hope that fits more like I'm hoping.",

      "text": "My husband gets sunburned very easily and I wanted to get him something that would protect him on our cruise. He wore this shirt while we sat out in the sun and during our beach excursions and did not burn at all during our week long cruise. It was the first time ever that he did not burn during a summer vacation trip. I will be buying him more shirts in the future.",
