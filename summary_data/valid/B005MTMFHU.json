Does macro at least as well as than the G6 and G8, out shines all the prior models in less than ideal light, and the output is rich in color and detail at all focal lengths. I think it competes well with many much more expensive cameras.",

With that in mind the \"anti-shake\" feature built in does it's job in spades. I'll never need to buy another camera since this one does it all including hi-def movies.",

It has a very fast shutter speed which is great for action shots. Nature shots are clear and the colors are accurate. I can't say enough how good this camera is. I got it when Amazon was having a sale which saved me quite a bit of money. If interested, check daily. The prices always fluctuate, and maybe you can get a good deal like I did.",

The Canon HS SYSTEM boosts low-light performance with the new Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor and a high-sensitivity 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor. This advanced Canon technology delivers stunning image quality with reduced noise and blur. Colors are more vibrant and white balance is true-to-life. The 35x Optical Zoom offers incredible reach and range, allowing you to shoot any scene, near or far. The Optical Image Stabilizer helps images come out steady and clear, and a 24mm ultra Wide-Angle lens makes it easy to take pictures of large groups of people, tall buildings, expansive landscapes and much more. The camera also features a 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD for great shooting flexibility. Packed with an array of powerful technologies, the PowerShot SX40 HS is a convenient digital camera capable of brilliant image capture. \n\nExtreme 35x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom and 24mm Lens\n\nThe PowerShot SX40 HS is equipped with a Genuine Canon 35x Zoom lens that provides the telephoto power to bring your distant subjects incredibly close. It also features a useful zoom range that begins at 24mm wide-angle and extends to 840mm telephoto (35mm equivalent). The 24mm ultra Wide-Angle allows you to create shots with dramatic perspective and makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. This superb lens delivers outstanding optical performance throughout its zoom range. It\u2019s advanced design employs UD glass, double-sided aspherical glass-molded and ultra-high-refraction-index glass lens elements to effectively suppress chromatic aberration while maintaining a remarkably compact size. The camera uses a VCM (Voice Coil Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control.\n\nOptical Image Stabilizer\n\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nCanon DIGIC 5 Image Processor\n\n\n\nThe latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. \nImproved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results. \nThe faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background. \nNoise Reduction\nConventional Image Processor\nWhite Balance\nWith DIGIC 5 Image Processor\n\n\nCanon HS SYSTEM\n\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot SX40 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The new DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur. \n\n\n\nMemorable Moments in Spectacular Full HD\nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot SX40 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. The PowerShot SX40 HS shoots Full HD video at 24* frames per second, ensuring clear lifelike motion images with a beautiful cinematic quality. It also shoots beautifully detailed 720p HD video at 30 fps.**\n*Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps.\n**Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\n\n Dedicated Movie Button, Wind Filter and Optical Zoom While Shooting\n\n\nIt\u2019s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX40 HS has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot SX40 HS also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot SX40 HS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you\u2019re shooting a video.\n\n\n\n HDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot SX40 HS. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable (not included). And because the PowerShot SX40 HS supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u2019ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u2019s remote control. (CEC \u2013 Consumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n\n\niFrame Movie Support \nWith the PowerShot SX40 HS, you can also shoot video in the Apple\u2122 iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions. \n\n\n\n\nVari-Angle LCD\n\nThe PowerShot SX40 HS features a convenient and highly useful 2.7-inch Vari-Angle LCD screen that swivels out almost a full 180 degrees. It also rotates through approximately 270 degrees, letting you tilt it up or down to shoot at low or high angles. You can compose freely even when shooting from difficult vantage points and use the full range of angle adjustment even when the camera is mounted on a tripod. You can even rotate the LCD facing forward to capture perfectly framed self-portraits and to join group shots. The PureColor System LCD screen has 230,000 dots, giving you a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. \n\n\nA Steady Image is a Beautiful Image\n\nIntelligent IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\n\n\n\nNormal\nCorrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning\nPanning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid\nCorrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic\nEffective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered\nCompensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod\nWhen tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \n\nModes/Special Scene Modes Custom Define and store your own settings to achieve the effects you prefer.\nManual\nYou have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually.\nAperture-Priority\nYou set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. Shutter-Priority You select the shutter speed to stop or blur action, and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system activates to ensure low image noise.\nProgram Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.\nSmart AUTO\nThe camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.\nMovie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into a video.
