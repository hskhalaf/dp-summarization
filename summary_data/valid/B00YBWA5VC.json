It was fairly easy and straight forward but I must admit that I was a little nervous since I didn't feel like there were adequate instructions for installing all the components. But there are plenty of people on youtube that have done their own DIY ebike conversions..and I would highly recommend watching them before you begin. The front hub motor makes a humming noise when power is applied to the hub motor. I live in San Francisco where we have lots of hills which makes riding a bike challenging..but NOT any more!. The 1000 watt motor is perfect for this city.",
