I set points at corners and get a route distance and have amassed at least 30 run or bike routes of varying length. If I could only make it do elevation I'd be thrilled but then it would cost [more money].",

I have also noticed that some points of interest are missing as well. This brings up another point, no update service, even for only a year, available. It does have road construction updates though.

    "description": "AMAZON.COM\nCan't fold a map to save your life? No time to make sense of the seemingly endless online map sources, or don't know which ones you can trust? Fear not, road warrior: Microsoft Streets & Trips 2002 does the dirty work. \n\n Installing Streets & Trips is simple, and working from its database of locations and maps is speedy. The package offers more than 800,000 points of interest. Note that this number includes ATMs, gas stations, hotels, rest areas, colleges, and golf courses, as well as restaurants, museums, and galleries. And while the maps extend to worldwide proportions, you're most likely to find the 6.4 million miles of road in the U.S. and Canada the most useful. \n\n One of the newer and more attractive features of the Streets & Trips package is its GPS (global positioning system) capabilities. This requires a GPS device (such as your handheld, a palmtop computer, or a straight GPS device) that supports NMEA 2.0 or higher. A free download from the Microsoft site will have you ready to store all your trip data in your GPS device of choice. \n\n Getting started is fairly straightforward: simply enter your starting address and your final destination. Adding side trips and stops along the way is easy, as is reordering your stops. After you've charted your course, you have five options for printing, including a zoomable map, point-by-point directions, and, of course, mileage between exits. You can also opt for Web output and allow your friends and family to chart your course as you progress. \n\n Our favorite feature in this package is the customization capability. To get Streets & Trips to suggest when to stop for gas or a stretch break, simply tell it your preferences. By entering your car's average miles per gallon (in both city and highway) and your preferred driving speed, you can elect to include gas breaks on your itinerary. \n\n Overall, Microsoft Streets & Trips is a good value; we found its directions reliable and concise. Now if Microsoft only made something to occupy the kids in the backseat. --Emilie Herbst",
