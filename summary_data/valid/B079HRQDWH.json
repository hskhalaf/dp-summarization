      "text": "When I decided to make fresh pasta at home, I looked for the best, most innovative product designs available at a fair price. Your Pasta Drying Rack fit my requirements perfectly. Originally, I bought a wooden drying rack, but found it to be cheap and clumsy. I returned it and bought your because of its compacts, clean look and operation. Having everything fit together in one design is ingenious. I highly recommend it. Thank you!",

      "text": "Let me first say that this product is probably significantly larger than you imagine! Being cased in metal, the tube is actually quite heavy, and about as awkward as a rolling pin to store. However, the size also means that it can hold a lot of pasta, which is great, because my baker-slash-pasta-maker partner always makes big batches. The rack holds up well to the weight of a good deal of wet noodles, and the arms do not come down or break when in use. Other than that, it's a pretty straightforward product. I chose this one over the wooden racks for ease of cleaning and for durability. I am pleased with my choice.",

The drying rack is necessary, but the traditional racks are taking up a large place... I bought this creative item at once after I read the introduction. It is really easy to store and easy to clean with the detachable design. Never worry the rack will fall or scratch counter while using, its silicone feet can keep it steady and protective. I have recommended this creative item to all my cooking course classmates!!!A definite \u201cmust buy\u201d if you make your own pasta!!!",

Be VERY careful when holding it in it's tube shape, because if it is tipped one way the slightest bit the guts will fall all over the floor and smash to pieces. It's disappointing because this was a present for my wife, and now I look like the jerk for buying cheap junk.",
