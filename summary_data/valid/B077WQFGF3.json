The stretch is also comfortable. The leg is definitely skinny, almost like a legging.

They have just the right amount of stretch, are the perfect length (no ankle showing), and the waist is high enough that there's no muffin top problem. The rear is very flattering, since I'm pretty straight - no boots at all. These probably wouldn't be good for curvy girls. The only thing I would change would be the back pocket placement... make them a bit smaller and higher, but that's pretty standard for Levis. Highly recommend for those who want a slim fit through the rear, hips and thighs!",

If you're on the fence like me consider spending the couple extra bucks for pants that are worth it and will last much longer than Old Navy.",
