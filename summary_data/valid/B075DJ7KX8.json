I don't have many problems with those, but nonetheless, the other benefits I get from this product make it worth using. It smooths the skin and brings out the natural color as opposed to a tired \"gray\" when the skin looks tired. With the blackhead removing tools, I feel they are a bonus when coming up against a particularly stubborn blackhead.",
