      "text": "Great blender! We tried much more expensive brands and this one beats them all. Acceptable noise level where others were like jet engines. One caveat: be sure to notice that the two blades are NOT interchangeable. The gray blade is for the smoothie cup and the black blade is for the jug. I used the smoothie blade on the jug and it was stuck on so tight I could not remove the assembly. Operator error so unfortunately Braun customer service couldn't do a free replacement. We ended up just buying a whole new unit at a little more than what it would have cost to buy replacement parts (jug, smoothie blade, etc.).",

      "text": "I've tried many different brands over the years and currently regularly use a Ninja that can also blend either a full pitcher or a to-go cup. There are benefits to this Braun - specifically the cup, that doesn't leak, verses the Ninja, that makes no attempt to seal - and the power is excellent. If I didn't already love the Ninja, I would seriously consider this one for two reasons: 1) it does almost exactly what the Ninja does, and 2) it's like half the price.",

The JB7001 stirs, liquifies, and crushes quickly and efficiently, and makes the best smoothies ever. It comes with a measuring cap that makes mixing ingredients as you go a snap. The PureMix will be especially appreciated if you have a smaller kitchen because it is quite compact and doesn't take up as much counter space as a regular blender.",

Although it has half the horsepower as my big Vitamix, it actually has similar performance. You do have to make sure the container is positioned correctly or it won't turn on. The buttons are sealed, which makes cleaning easier. All in all a good product, as I would expect from Braun.",

For whatever reason, the piece that secures the blade in the cup tightens as you blend it, leaving it impossible to take off. 3 times now I have not been able to drink the smoothie I\u2019ve made because I can\u2019t get the blade out. And if I use the pitcher, it doesn\u2019t blend well at all and makes a mess when you pour from it.",
