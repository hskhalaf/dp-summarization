Also the description states that they range from 1 3/4\" - 3 3/4\" when they actually range from 2\" - 5 1/4\". Only the smallest two are usable for what I bought then for , if I could even use them, which I cannot risk having celiac disease. The outside of the package also had crumbs that came off when handling it, so now my kitchen counter is possibly contaminated with gluten. Thanks a lot! Seriously not happy!!!!!",
