      "text": "As an tech geek, this is one of my favorite tools. It charged phones and other gadgets faster than anything else. The universal DC input is very convenient. My favorite feature is the adjustable DC output though. As an electrical engineer, it acts as a handy reasonably-accurate portable DC power supply. I've pushed it beyond it's specs powering devices I probably shouldn't be (drones), and even with voltage spikes or overcurrent, it just shuts off the output with no damage. At first I thought the integrated fan was overkill - it's not. It's necessary for delivering high power DC, even with great conversion efficiency. Everything about the Omnicharge is well designed, well thought-out, and highly practical.",

Of course smaller appliances charge a few times over. I could wait for the UBS-C version, so I had to buy an adapter for my new Dell, but it works fine. Overall, a great package.",
