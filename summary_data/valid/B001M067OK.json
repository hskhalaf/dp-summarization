Toasty Tush warms the toilet seat with an electrically heated pad (plugged into a wall outlet) that adheres to the inside of the toilet lid. When the lid is closed the seat is heating. When one sits, the seat is hot enough to seem sanitary, not just warm, as if someone else had recently been there. I like Toasty Tush. It's easy to wipe clean and has an unexpectedly comforting effect.",
