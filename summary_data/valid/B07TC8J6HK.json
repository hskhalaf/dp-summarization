Thick padding isolates outside noise and has a nice tight grip, I have a rather \"thin\" head, so headphones are typically too large, but these fit nice and snug. The audio was through the mic was clear and everyone in my party had 0 complaints. The remote clip is a great touch and allows users to position it and reduce the weight when moving your head around, though the remote is very light. The RGB Lights are a cool effect, but not necessary IMO. I would recommend this headset to everyone looking for a USB headset!",

Website on manual for 7.1 EQ software is permanently down and is actually at driver.jeeco.com No matter how close I tuned the EQ to my Cloud X2's there was still random distortion and muffling that couldn't be tuned out and still ended up sounding like I was listening through a Party cup. Most reviews are from parents who buy the headset for kids or adults who don't know what a good headset sounds like. I wouldn't even use these in an emergency. It felt like punishment listening through them. I'd rather go without sound. For real. I think the review videos were paid off.",

I previously had been buying what I thought were decent headsets (think Logitech) but they were only lasting a year. After my fourth headset, I decided to splurge a bit and purchased this one based on its high reviews and the fact that the video showed it is easily used with a PC, whereas others were showing with gaming consoles. I was completely blown away by the noise-canceling quality and the incredible stereo sound! I gave these the \"Bowie test\" and was very pleased to clearly hear both tracks of \"Space Oddity\" beautifully! I highly recommend this headset for any sound based use you may have!",

I downloaded the software and there are very few options included. Voice monitoring certainly was not one. You can set any headphones in windows to play your voice through the headset but there is a slight delay and it is absolutely aggravating. A headset with true voice monitoring does not have that issue. While the sound itself was nice, the sound was also bleeding into my external mic for recording and that won't do for my purposes. I also have a small head and these were even a bit tight for me. Had to return these.",

They were the best set of headphones I'd had, and I planned on keeping them for a long while. Well, this was shortlived because I drop it one foot and one of the sides break off. For about 2 weeks I had to play with one headphone (right side) dangling by the wire, and no matter how much tape or glue I put, nothing could fix it sadly. Soon the right ear no longer worked, and I bought another headset but it could never match this one :(",

THIS ONE FITS GREAT. overall sound quality is decent. Noise cancellation I\u2019m not really sure about. I wouldn\u2019t say it 100% cancels out all noise. But it does for a fact cover my ears so things are muffled around me. Honest for the price and the look I would say it\u2019s a great head set.",
