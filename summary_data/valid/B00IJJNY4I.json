I end up taking the whole cap and pump mechanism out and use the tube to scrape out the last of the product. If the bottle worked with the product, I'd give it 5 stars.",

      "text": "I have highly sensitive skin and rarely can find a product that my face will tolerate time over time. I use this product as a primer as well as overall coverage. I am 45 - I need some coverage, however I cannot handle any type of foundation. This is the perfect product to smooth things over and provide some coverage that evens out my skin. I use it after I apply my face cream and put nothing on top.",
