      "text": "We bought this chair right after having twins. It's the perfect rocking chair for our nursery; easy for us both to sit in it with a baby on our laps, or comfy for one of us to sit on with the girls on either side. Great for nursing too! It's soft; was easy to assemble; and rocks nicely on the hard wood and the rug we have it on. I would buy this chair again in a heartbeat. In addition, it's plain beautiful and classy! By the way, the picture makes the chair look short, but while sitting, I can lean my head back and it rests nicely on the seatback. (I'm 5'8)",

It's pretty snug to sit side by side with 2 adults for longer then a brief moment. It's hard to rock. The bow legs stick out pretty far in the back so I'm worry somebody will get foot under it. It's not super comfortable, little hard, armrests are minimal. It's more of single wide accent chair, for the price you can get something better.",

I also love that the rocking legs can be removed, so once it has finished its purpose for the babies, it can become a stylish living chair.",

My husband built it...he is particular & was impressed, especially considering the price! One thing we are wondering is if they got the Intended Maximum Weight wrong? The manual states 225 lbs, when he assembled it, he said he would guess more like 500 lbs. Wondering if you mean 225 kg as max weight? Our combined weight is 290lbs, we sat, rocked, so comfortable and all seems fine! Highly recommend this wonderful little rocker and we think the intended weight is probably in kg, not lbs as published?",

Rocking isnt really smooth but it will get the job done and you have to continuously push to keep it rocking. Both me and my husband are over 6 feet tall and the back is high enough. The weight max was a little concerning so we will just use it one at a time. The chair itself is comfortable and from the first time I sat on it I could feel myself falling asleep so i was clearly comfortable. Lol.",

      "text": "We ordered this for our toddler daughter\u2019s room, as the two of us could no longer fit comfortably in her old glider chair. It was relatively easy to put together and took about 30 minutes. Some of the predrilled holes did not line up perfectly, but these just required a little more muscle to secure. The chair looks very nice in the space and is comfortable. However, as others have mentioned, it is very difficult to rock more than a few inches back and forth. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re used to the ease of a glider or maybe it\u2019s simply because the chair is so large, but we are disappointed that it barely rocks, even with a lot of force.",

Some reviewers commented on the short back...Im 5'3\" and my head hits the back of the chair if I lean back. Truly wish I had purchased sooner. It was easy to sssemble, and will transition to a side chair nicely when my son outgrows it in hos bedroom.",

I also find myself feeling off balance when getting up from the chair while holding an infant due to how it is designed. The chair swings back heavily after getting up and hits the wall if it inched it's way back as I rocked. Investing in a high quality glider or genuine rocking chair is worth it.

Does not come with ottoman (separate purchase). I can't return so I'm actually giving the chair away for free because I don't want to charge anyone for such an uncomfortable chair. Save your money and your back- listen to bad reviews.",

An easy cheap solution if you have it in a place you can't see the back of it is to attach heavy ankle weights to the back of rocking legs. It's definitely helped.",

I bought this after being so frustrated with a stork craft glider that was too narrow and arm rests too high to be comfortable for adjusting a breast feeding baby. This is perfect, A little stiff and the rock is pretty slight but it is perfect for nursing and reading books at night. Low arm rests and high back make it comfy, as for width easily fits grown adult and child",
