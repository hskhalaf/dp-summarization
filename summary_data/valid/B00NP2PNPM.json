Part 920-005510 is an earlier version of this keyboard/cover that lacks the hinge that changes the iPad viewing angle and is generally less sturdy due to lack of the plastic ridge that protects the keyboard and separates the keyboard from the iPad. Also, being a discontinued part that is 3 years older, you should also be concerned about the battery. It may be depleted or may not function properly due to disuse. Grand O's is one of the partners working with Amazon to sell the old stock part.",

Magnetic catch for closing the keyboard with the iPad is slick design. I had previously used a Logitech folio sans keyboard to protect my iPad so was a little nervous that there is no back protection. I paired this combo with an Ncase sleeve for travel. Only negative I have is that sometimes I forget that the iPad is simply sitting in a notch on the keyboard and if I move too aggressively the iPad can fall out of the keyboard. Otherwise, perfect combo.",

      "text": "Almost perfect. However, the magnetic clip is not strong enough and it does not cause the ipad to autosleep. In addition would have been much better if the keyboard allowed portrait usage as well as landscape. other than that, very ergonomic, amazing battery life and in general, if you just use your computer for surfing, basic word processing etc. with this keyboard, you can say good bye to your laptop.",
