An overwhelming amount of features and options. Fantastic reading experience and writing/drawing with the stylus exceeded all expectations for me. Yes it costs more than the regular Kindles, but it's the same price as a fully loaded Oasis 2 with so many more features.",

Your MacBook adapter can't charge this, nor your iPad, switch, or any regular USB-C adapter. This is just a Mirco-USB speed inside a USB-C head. Why don't they just stick to Mirco-USB? It is at least easier to find a type-A to mirco-USB cable, than finding type-A to usb-C cable around.",

Even once you figure it out, its still a pain to figure out how to make the apps run well, the settings menus are super unclear, confusing, and inconsistent. The writing features are laggy and just not as good as something like an ipad, I'd prefer a better device for handwriting (and that could help cut the cost of this thing down, which would make it a better value...) All in all, this thing tries to do too much, and fails at all of it.",

It is no different than a 2-3 year old Android tablet but with an e-ink screen (Android 6.0). I ended up selling the tablet and bought a recent Samsung tablet for a fraction of this tablet's price even with more features (S-Pen).",

It kept refreshing with a visual lag every few minutes, even with all the app settings changed that others recommended. The Kindle page turns were unreliable and often took me to a page overview. Adjusting the backlight was clumsy, requiring you to leave the app and go back to the home screen. At the end of the day, since I was only using it as an e-reader, it just didn\u2019t do the job...it got returned.",
