      "text": "I purchased this router for 2 things. First It had an MTU setting that a lot of routers don't. Why is this so important? If you use a VPN with l2tp or pptp and experience a lot of disconnects and failed downloads you can reduce this to greatly improve connection. My Asus does not have this feature. On the other hand the 2.4GHz range is less than my asus (6-10 db less) and the 5GHz is slightly more. Maybe the Asus has better beamforming or something. I also had the same weak signals with the 800mW Amped wireless. I am keeping this though since the VPN performance is excellent. However it does not support openvpn so bear that in mind.",

We have a 3000 sq ft. 2-story house, and we've gone through many routers over the years, and even though they've been placed in the center of the house, have had troubles of one sort or another (range, connectivity, etc.) -- range has never been what has been advertised. However, with this TP-Link, range is definitely better. It's not perfect - every once in a while we have a connectivity issue- but definitely having issues *much less* frequently. Our experience is that it's definitely the best router we've come across. Pretty happy with it, and I think there's a good chance others would be happy with it, too.",
