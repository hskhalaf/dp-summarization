They are durable, colors are long lasting, no weird stench, pleasantly devoid of \"taste\" or a bare minimum at best, and most of all, the baby loves them. We have no problem cleaning them. Our grandbaby doesn't use pacifiers (we call them BBs or Binky) constantly. Your results will vary to ours. She uses them at times and for brief periods at that. I trust the brand and our grandbaby's \"word.\"",

      "text": "Both of nieces have been sent home from the hospital with pacifiers similar to these if not the exact same and were very picky about what kind they would accept after that, both of them took to these instantly. The holes in the pacifier allow you to attach a clip to minimize losing them. The pacifier itself is latex free, can be placed in boiling water to sanitize and is one solid piece so no worries about a baby managing to chew off the nipple, handle or other small design pieces that other pacifiers often have.",

You can stick your finger inside the hole facing you, so they can grip it better. there\u2019s two holes towards the edge so you can still use those clip-ons that help you from losing the pacifier. Also when your baby starts teething, you can throw them in the freezer for soothing.",

Ever since i was told that it truly made sense and i felt that it did make it easy for transitioning from nursing to bottle feeding. I would recommend these nipples to anyone who has infants.",
