We\u2019re ordering several more as these will make excellent gifts for our wine loving friends! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

      "text": "I had the Vacu Vin wine saver pump before, but the tops kept splitting at the seam and not holding the vacuum. This seems to be a little different system, but works much better. I doesn't click so it took a while for us to figure out just how many pumps it takes to create a good vacuum, but we got the hang of it; a few pumps usually do the trick. The stoppers fit the wine bottles better than the Vacu Vin and I think this pump creates a much better vacuum; I also think the wine keeps longer with this pump. I'm so glad I decided to buy this wine saver!",

It maintains a vacuum with no slow leaks which are a problem with some of my old stoppers. This vac also works great on other stoppers so if you have a big wine party, you can plug several bottles with this.",

Who knew there were so many? I did not. I settled on this one due to it being a vacuum seal and it comes with 2 \"corks\" and it was cost effective too. I recommend this wine stopper for anyone that loves wine as much as I do and wants to keep it longer than just a few days.",
