      "text": "I love this projector! I travel every week for business and require a portable projector to use in case the client/office doesn't have one. Often times we end up using this one over their fancy built in projectors even if they do have one! It is extremely bright! It is so awkward when your clients cant read/see your presentations...I never have to worry about that here. It is a little bigger than most travel projectors, but the quality is totally worth it. I would recommend this to any person/business looking for a quality projector to make their hard work and presentations look awesome in front of the client!",

I highly recommend both of these but you should use these in a somewhat dark room.",

    "title": "Optoma ML1000P WXGA 1000 Lumen LED Projector (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Style:1000 Lumens\n\nOPTOMA ML1000P, WXGA, 1000 LED LUMENS, 3D-READY MOBILE PROJECTOR\nView Larger POWERFUL, PORTABLE, UNSURPASSED LED PERFORMANCE\nThe Optoma ML1000P is designed for mobile professionals seeking a light, compact, fully-featured ultra portable LED projector that is powerful enough to use in the most demanding environments. Its industry leading LED light source delivers 1000 lumens of brightness and a stunning 15,000:1 contrast ratio to produce the richest, most vibrant colors in this product category. The ML1000P provides full comprehensive connectivity so you can use it with all of your existing gear. It also includes an SD card port that allows you to deliver PowerPoint presentations, view PDF documents, display pictures, movies and more without the need of a computer or external device. An innovative touch pad design allows you to easily control the projector and maximize ease of use.\n\nView Larger FEATURES:\n * Perfect for traveling presenters\n * Intuitive touchpad control for ease of operation\n * LED light source lasts for the life of the product\n * HDMI connectivity for maximum compatibility\n * 3D Ready for the most amazing, immersive viewing experience\n\nINCREDIBLE POWER, EFFICIENCY, AND DURABILITY IN A SINGLE SOLUTION\nThe Optoma ML1000P provides a compact design and vivid LED performance. Designed by the leader in LED-based projection, the ML1000P sets a new standard for brightness at 1000 ANSI Lumens. LED brightness cannot be easily compared to lamp-based brightness. LED brightness lets users create larger images in rooms with more light while still allowing for easy viewing. With a wider color gamut than standard lamp projectors, the ML1000P delivers more vivid colors. Delivering Native WXGA resolution, this projector creates crisp, clear widescreen images of up to 100 inches on most surfaces. This DLP Pico projector allows users to share detailed presentations (with 15,000:1 contrast ratio) without being hooked up to a computer.\n\nWeighing in at just 3 pounds and measuring a compact 10.6 x 1.9 x 6.7, the ML1000P supports the following video signals: HDTV (up to 1080p) NTSC, and PAL. Computer compatibility includes resolutions up to WXGA (1280 x 800) through VGA and HD (1920 x 1080) through HDMI.\n\nLED DESIGN ADVANTAGE\nThe ML1000P's LED technology delivers low power consumption that creates 100\" images with less than half the power a typical 42-inch LCD television uses. The same LED technology provides vivid color, durability and long life that make it attractive to price-sensitive small business and consumer users.\n\nThe LED light source has an estimated lifetime of more than 20,000 hours (equivalent to using the projector four hours every day for over thirteen years). LED is incredibly cost effective compared to lamp-based projectors. For example, users with a lamp-based projector would have to replace the lamp in the projector at least four times over 20,000 hours of usage-at a cost of over $800, compared to the completely maintenance-free LED lamp.\n\nThe LED-based design, in addition to having low power usage and eliminating use of mercury and other hazardous materials, allows for cool operation which in turn allows for the compact size.\n\nSTATE-OF-THE-ART DLP TECHNOLOGY\nProjectors with Texas Instrument's DLP with BrilliantColor technology feature multi-color processing to produce accurate and vibrant colors on the screen. The Optoma ML1000P multi-color processing system features an RGB LED light engine with a wide color gamut to achieve superb color saturation and accuracy for extraordinary image quality. In addition, incredibly high native contrast ratios ensure clean and crisp black and white to ensure that text and charts are easy to read.\n\nView Larger GREEN BY DESIGN\nThe ML1000P has been designed and manufactured to:\n\n * Use less than one-watt power consumption in standby mode-Up to 75 percent savings compared to regular standby mode\n * Limit energy use, with automatic shut down and remote management and control\n * Employ long-life materials and components\n * Use components that are lead-free on all printed circuit boards\n * Use no polystyrene foam in the packing materials\n * Comply with RoHS standards to phase out the use of hazardous materials\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nThis package includes the Optoma ML1000P, WXGA, 1000 LED Lumens Mobile Projector, AC Power Cord, VGA-to-VGA Cable, Carrying Case, Remote Control, Battery for Remote and Quick Start Card.\n\nHOW IS THE ML1000P BETTER THAN ITS PREDECESSOR?\nModel \nML800 \nML1000P\nCurrently Selected Brightness 800 LED Lumens 1000 LED Lumens Native Resolution WXGA (1280 x 800) WXGA (1280 x 800) Contrast Ratio 13,000:1 (full on/full off) 15,000:1 (full on/full off) Lamp Life and Type 20,000+ hours, LED 20,000+ hours, LED Projection Distance 1.7'-9.8' (0.52-3 m) 1.7'-9.8' (0.52-3 m) Image Size (Diagonal) 17\"-100\" (5.2-30.5 m) 17\"-100\" (5.2-30.5 m) Aspect Ratio 16:10 Native; 16:9 and 4:3 compatible 16:10 Native, 16:9 and 4:3 compatible Displayable Colors 1.07 Billion 1.07 Billion Display Technology Single 0.45\" DMD DLP Technology by Texas Instruments Single 0.45\" DMD DLP Technology by Texas Instruments I/O Connection Ports HDMI, VGA-in, composite video, audio-in, audio-out, USB-A (reader/wireless), USB-A (Re-charging Port), Micro-USB, SD Card HDMI, VGA-in, composite video, audio-in, audio-out, USB-A (reader/wireless), USB-A (Re-charging Port), Micro-USB, SD Card 3D Compatibility 120Hz frame sequential 3D for resolutions up to 720p, 60Hz field sequential 3D for resolutions up to 480i. 3D glasses are needed and sold separately. 120Hz frame sequential 3D for resolutions up to 720p, 60Hz field sequential 3D for resolutions up to 480i. 3D glasses are needed and sold separately.
