Those lesser saws are a pain every time you use them. This one comes with a decent blade, cuts straight, brakes quickly, has a substantial base that is square to the blade, and despite what some of the reviewers indicate has a good sized case with room for several extra blades. I would buy it again, but I expect that the only reason I would need to is theft.",

The electric break was worth the extra money. I always liked the handle placement of Makita saws over other brands. It is a workhorse. I love the LED light that illuminates the way. All levers and knobs are sized and positioned in a way that makes adjustments easy. Sure there are cheaper saws out there. This one will last me a lifetime. Also, the box for storage is great.

The only complaint is in regards to the case that comes with the saw. You'd think they would have thought to form some sort of grip or handle in the case's plastic mold in order to grasp or LIFT THE TOP LID of the case. There is nothing to grasp onto to lift the lid. And since the lid is angled AND smooth on all sides, it's even difficult to open using two hands. But once you do open the lid, the saw itself is great. LOL!",

      "text": "This is just a all around great circular saw. Starts relatively smooth, the ergonomics of the handles and levers are top tier, and the LED light/saw dust blower do a really good job of keeping you on the cut line. Adjustments are easy. The inclusion of the rip guide is a nice touch (other saws like some DeWalts expect you to pay extra for them). Very pleased w/ this purchase.",

      "text": "I like this saw. it is very solid and stable. when i cut upper cabinet for sometime, i felt it was heavy. i like this better than hypoid saw. Hypoid is 4 lb heavier and blade is on left side. i am right handed and used to step on a piece of 2x4 by my left leg and cut 2x4 with the saw on the right. i could sit this saw on the 2x4. i could not do the same for hypoid. i use it occasionally at home, so my opinion does not apply for those who use saw daily. my 2 cents.",

It is almost too powerful...Getting older (and weaker) I was surprised with the power of this saw when it kicked back while cutting on a sheet of plywood. Hold on tight...I'm pretty big and was caught off guard (even after I had read another post stating same thing)! I am not a professional and do not intend to use it for anything more than home repairs. The saw will work great for my needs...I'll just remember to hang on tightly!",

The saw has a large cutting capacity (2-1/2 inches at 90\u00b0) with a maximum bevel capacity of 56\u00b0 and positive stops at 22.5\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 for quick back-and-forth changes. The 5007MGA includes an electric brake to stop the blade quickly for maximum productivity.Ergonomic and Ease-of-Use\nFeatures Magnesium components allowed Makita to engineer a saw with less weight (10.1 pounds) that is well-balanced and jobsite tough. Additional design details include greater clearance between the rear handle and the blade case to provide a better grip for larger hands or for users with gloves, as well as a wider space between the blade and housing for a clearer view of the blade and measurement scale. The saw features twin L.E.D. lights for better illumination, as well as ducting designed to blow dust away from the line of cut. Makita also engineered ergonomics and ease-of-use into the saw, including clearly visible depth and bevel markings and ergonomic hand grips to improve overall control while minimizing operator fatigue. The large rubberized levers provide quick, one-handed adjustments for more efficient work.\n\nIncludes Ultra-Coated Framing Blade\nThe 5007MGA includes a Makita 7-1/4-Inch Premium Ultra-Coated Framing Blade with Advance Tooth Design. The \"M\" shaped tooth design features a two-pointed tip and two 10\u00b0 bevel faces to maximize cutting performance for a faster, cleaner and longer lasting cut. The carbide tips are specifically set to withstand the harshest conditions such as plowing through nail-embedded wood. The blade is also ultra-coated to reduce heat and pitch build-up for faster, smoother cutting, with special Makita heat vents strategically set to dissipate heat and increase performance. The 5007MGA also include a blade wrench attached to the saw for fast and convenient blade changing.\n\nEngineered for a Range of Applications\nThe 5007MGA is built for framing walls, floors and roofs using a range of dimensional lumber and dense engineered lumber, including LVL, PSL and I-Joists, headers, and microlams; as well as ripping panels such as plywood, OSB, particle board, and dense structural panels. Other applications include plunge and bevel cutting, as well as masonry and metal cutting. The 5007MGA is just another example of Makita's commitment to innovative technology and best-in-class engineering.\n\nAbout Makita's Magnesium Series\nMagnesium components are stronger and lighter than conventional materials, resulting in saws that weigh less with improved ergonomic features.
