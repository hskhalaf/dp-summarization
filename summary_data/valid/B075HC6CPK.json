      "text": "Love this mask! Packaging is great, product works really well. The mask itself felt really nice and cooling, almost a little tingly, on my skin. With almost every face mask I've ever tried, my skin's redness is never calmed and that's the main issue for my skin in particular. However, when I removed this mask, the redness was instantly calmed, which was super impressive and really surprising. My skin wasn't really left the softest, though. I applied a moisturizer afterwards so that my skin would feel nice and smooth. I would definitely recommend this mask to people with red problem areas, inflammation of the skin, and those with large pores!",

      "text": "Got this on an $8 Amazon deal. I have been using this since I got it and I love the way it feels on my skin. It does not dry on the skin and when I wash it off, my skin feels very soft. It's not the easiest to wash off, so I used a silicone scrubber to help out. We shall see what happens in the next week or two if there are any drastic changes with my acne scars and discoloration.",

I do not notice many of things on my skin that people seemed to have noticed in some reviews (i.e., burning.) I have face masks that burn a little, and this one does not. I feel like my skin feels much better after using it too. The only problem I have with this mask is that I feel like it will get used up a lot quicker than some of the other masks I have because it is a bit on the thinner side. Love this mask, though!",
