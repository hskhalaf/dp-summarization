      "text": "Very powerful unit that's built to the CAT quality you'd expect. Clear instructions and the warranty is sufficient. Upon inspection of engine and various parts, there was no machine oil or markings. Everything was very clean and seemed put together with care. The unit started on its first attempt and runs smoothly under the power of my 240v plasma cutter and high-end air compressor under simutanious load. While the price is steep it is well worth the purchase if you have the money. I have yet to come across a better portable generator.",

This is how you can conserve power to run your central unit. It runs virtually the entire house and a/c. I start it monthly for 30 mins---and it starts within 3 turns of the electric start. It is a good feeling to own something you can count on--especially in a hurricane state like ours.",

One issue that was a concern when we ran it for the first few times was the amount of smoke coming off the engine. Checked it over several times and all was good just seemed to burn off excess fluids from outside components used in the manufacturing of the unit.",

Nobody will work on them and there is no warranty. The name Caterpillar is deceiving. They private labeled this garbage and don't stand behind their product. Amazon turns their heads like the manufacturer when issues arise. The motor stops working. The wheels have fallen off. The breakers trip non stop. That's just a small taste of the issues we've had. Good luck in your search but don't buy this junk.",

When its not in the repair shop, we keep it at our shop as an emergency only backup to my other 4 generators (Generac's). Save yourself some grief and buy another brand.",
