      "text": "I bought this tool belt for general home use. It is comfortable and has useful pockets for hauling hand tools. It's easy to add a drill holster or move pockets as all of the pockets are sleeved and slide freely on the belt. The only ding against this otherwise functional belt is that I wish it had an organizer panel for small items like a nail punch, drill bits, carpenter's pencils, etc.",

Only down side was when removing belt with tools still inside the pouches would slide, some sort of lock for the pouches would've been perfect but other then that it does its job.",
