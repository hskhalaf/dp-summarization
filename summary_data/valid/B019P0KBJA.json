It\u2019s got a lower fat content in it so I\u2019m using more of the other flavor to help with weight gain.",

Even tried mixing bee pollen powder with the other foods to make it \"sweeter\" and more enticing to the gecko (per local breeder's recommendation). No go. THEN found this stuff, and he LOVES it. After talking to a couple of other breeders, I found out that this is ALL they use. I guess Repashy and some others have started causing infertility and impaction to gecks recently. After using this for a few months, he looks healthier and seems to be more energetic. This is all I use now (have found a local supplier)",
