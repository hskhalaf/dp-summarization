We've tried so many different brands of dog food, but mostly they had to be grain free and include salmon. Purina Pro Plan Savor Grain-Free Shredded Blend (with beef and salmon) fits the bill for us! This dog food makes his coat and skin so soft & healthy! Riley has now been eating Pro Plan for about a year and still loves it. And I am excited that it now includes probiotics so I don't have to give him a separate pill for that anymore! Very satisfied customers!!",

After a month on this grain-free Savor her skin has healed up and her fur is growing back in. Her coat is looking nice and shiny too. My only complaint is the price -- $2.37/lb is ridiculous. The Pro Plan Focus was only $1.60/lb for a 30lb bag. Otherwise it's a good product.",
