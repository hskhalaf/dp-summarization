I'm a total bike-snob, used to high-end rides, and while this isn't a premium product, it's very solidly made. They spent the money where it matters. If it can handle my old fat butt jumping it off my porch, it should stand up to a couple years of abuse by a kid. It also looks great. Your kid will dig it.",
