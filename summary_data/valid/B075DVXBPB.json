If you plan to use this in populated areas where cellular data is abundant, then you should have no problem. However for us that was not the case.",

I have several camera apps downloaded on my phone. This blue-tooth hooks up with each and every one of them. And it hooks up IMMEDIATELY! Also, I like that the blue-tooth button recharges via a USB port rather than a battery. Love this new toy!!!!",

Tripod is a little flimsy, especially when extended, but will hold well on most hard and level surfaces. Detatchable remote feature is awesome! The only glitch I had was that when I wanted to power down and save the battery life, it wouldn't shut off. Even then, however, one full charge got me through each day (12-14 hrs no problem). I used it with an iphone 7plus, with a silicone case, for reference.",

My only complaint would be that there is a a slight delay from when you press the remote exposure button until when the actual exposure is taken on your phone.

Remote charge seems to last a long time. Remote works with native camera app and 3rd party apps. Lag is the usual bluetooth lag for the time it takes the app to register pressing the remote button. Which is fast. Phone clamp is strong, rotates, and holds position excellent. Tripod function is handy but as it is small, be careful to balance it well with a large heavy phone and only on a hard flat surface like a desk or table. Excellent compact selfie stick!",

Has a high quality feel to it of something three times this price. Bluetooth works great. Holds an iPhone X in place with ease (and thats a heavy phone). Tripod feature is sturdy and easy to use.

The product seems to be extremely durable and will more than likely last for a few years. The remote is rechargeable and does not require the purchase of batteries, score. I hope to use this soon so I can provide functional feedback. I hope this information assist in your decision-making process, thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.",

Works great for a tripod for group photos, and as a selfie stick. Love it!!",

One major flaw that makes this unusable for me is the fact that when I flip the phone horizontally (from upright/vertical position) unless the phone clamp is positioned on the middle of the phone, it tilts. There\u2019s no adjusting or stabilizing the clamp to keep it from tilting. It is worse when you add any lens on the phone. I feel this makes the whole process time consuming when you have to constantly adjust the phone in order to keep the mount from tilting with or without the additional lens on the phone.",
