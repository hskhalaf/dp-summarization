I have Samsung TVs, Watches, security cameras, Smart Home automation technology, and now this tablet. I can tell you that all of the products that I have purchased from them are simply amazing! This tablet is no exception. I love it! It's super thin and light. I turned it on and logged into my Samsung and Google accounts and all of my applications were installed onto the tablet automatically. I was up and going within 10 minutes of turning it on. I am so glad that I purchased this tablet!",

Basically this does everything I need to do and more. I was little hesitant on getting a 9.7 inch screen because it seemed so big on my average male hands. But it's so light you soon forget it's so large. My only advise is that be patient and wait for the price to drop . Two and a half year review. It's still amazing. No issue.",

Have a kindle paper-white but got this to increase letter size and the amount of text on the screen. Very expensive but got to occasionally splurge. Originally I got the new Fire 10.1 which cost much less but hated it, returned it and bought Tab S2 with one of my kidneys. Screen size much better then the longer 16:9 format. Can root it and strip out all the Junk on it, install a custom rom. Don't put a case around it, a case weighs as much or more then the Tab S2. You bought it for thin/lite so go bare. .",

The tablet turns on when the case is opened & works flawlessly. I also bought the SPARIN tempered glass screen protector which fits perfectly. This is a great unit. I would recommend it to anyone.",

Now I do not worry about running out of space for my applications. I do not take many pictures/videos with the tablet, so I don't have to use the external memory slot. Plus I use Spotify+Soundcloud as my music library. I went with the Gold 9.7\" model because I use a stylus to write/draw on my tablet, so the extra space is nice. The gold is not flashy either, which gives it a sleek look. And I use this to relax and play Hearthstone wherever Wi-Fi allows me to. Overall great product.",

Hopefully I do not have to open it again. Other than that, this is a beautiful tablet and have received many compliments on it.",
