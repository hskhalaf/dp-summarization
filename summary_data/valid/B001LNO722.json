But this was not the case with these. The small tree shaped ones were perfect. Sound all depends on how they are fit in your ear. If its just a little loose. or a little the wrong way. They sound horrid. But there is this sweet spot that is amazing once you find it",

Excellent fit (interchangable rubber tips make it easy), excellent sound quality -- what more do you need? these are quite the bargain. People who have listened through them are telling me they think they got ripped off paying $300 and more for their earbuds because miine actually sound just as good or BETTER! You can tell just from the packaging that Monster cares about quality through-and-through. They do offer pricier earbuds, but personally I am very pleased with these. What a great deal!",

These have VERY thin conductor wiring -- so much so that my model, at least, had a bad connection in the molded plug area. I have the turbine pro model, too, and I'm happy with them (admittedly, the cable there is also thinner than, say my shure E4Cs). I'd bought these for my daughter. The sound quality is not bad, though not great. We could have lived with that, if not for the construction problems. Going back.",

I listen to all different kinds of music from classical to barbershop chorus, and they all sound more rich, full of clarity and pure without distortion.

For an earbud of this price, I would expect higher quality materials. They sounded good when I could get the right earbud working, but I do not want a cheap defective product.",

They came with two nice carrying cases, the extra can be used as a change purse. Overall an excellent product, and I've tried many earphones.

The first time, the left earbud split in two where it's assembled. I used some JBWeld to seal it back together and all was well. However recently, the earbuds have all but died, giving muted music. While they worked they sounded great and came at a fair price point of around $100 when I bought them through Amazon. 2 stars for that. Minus 3 stars for average quality and poor durability. $100 earbuds should not break after 3 years with light use.",

They are a bit heavy, and the wire feels thin, so I can't speak about durability. Time will tell. Given that I had got a great deal on these ($58 I think), I am very satisfied.",

Love the variety of ear pieces they send so you can get the perfect fit for your ear. And the package they were sent in was simply elegant. Only small drawback is the bass could be a little fuller but other than that was definitely a worthwhile investment that I am sure to enjoy for some time. If the cheaper version of these earphones sound as great as they do, wonder what the more expensive ones sound like???",

I usually use these when I work out and found that they would sometimes become loose in my ear, which gets annoying to push them back in my ear but the sound quality is definitely worth it.",

Naturally, I was surprised. With a price tag like this and a brand name like Monster, I expected more. I contacted Monster's customer support via email 5 days ago outlining the problem, and have yet to receive a response. Needless to say I am hesitant to recommend this product to others.",

Sherwin, ElectronicHouse.com \"How do they sound? In a word, fantastic.\" --Aric Annear, End User \"At last, killer ear buds!\" --Tommy Shaw, Styx \"When paired with any of my portable devices (or non-portable ones for that matter) the Turbines sounded great. As promised, they deliver better bass than almost any other product at the price level, balanced out by solid mids and pretty clear highs. If volume is an issue for you, don\u2019t worry, the Turbines can get quite loud without distortion, a feat that many in-ear headphones cannot accomplish.\" --- Sal Cangeloso, geek.com\"... let\u2019s do talk about sound. It\u2019s stellar. Monster calls these \u201cin-ear speakers\u201d instead of \u201cin-ear headphones\u201d because they feel the sound is that good, and it\u2019s not far from that. The audio is clear and full with impressive (but not muddy) bass for both music and games; sometimes annoyingly so, but that\u2019s my own fault. Remember when you thought a 128 kbps bit rate was fine for your MP3s? You\u2019re going to be paying for that with these headphones, because you\u2019ll definitely hear all of the imperfections. It\u2019s a fair trade-off, though, because you\u2019ll also hear bits of your music that are lost on cheaper headphones.\"- Kirk Hiner, appletell.comThe Turbine Pros are surely the best ear-bud-type headphones I've heard and ones I could be happy with for years to come. The Turbines are stylish, perform strongly across the board, are comfortable and built to last.- Todd Whitesel, Audio Video Revolution\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nLife is Too Short to Listen to Bad Headphones. These days, we spend a lot of time listening to music with headphones. Every minute you spend enjoying your music should be the best it can be, but ordinary headphones can't deliver the rich dynamics, full range, and emotional impact of your favorite music.Sound So Incredible, We Had to Call Them In-Ear Speakers Monster Turbines truly deliver the big sound, power, and clarity that you'd expect from full size high-end speakers. That's why we had to call them speakers, not headphones.Bass So Deep, it Sounds Like There's a Subwoofer Unlike other headphones that can't reproduce deep bass, Monster Turbines accurately reproduce even the lowest bass notes without distortion. You'll hear thunderous low-end for incredible sound with every kind of music,from the thumping bass beats of hip hop tracks to the deepest pipe organ notes in classical compositions. Less Noise, More Music. We live in a noisy world that can interfere with your listening. Monster Turbines include multiple sound isolating ear-tips to give you a perfect fit that seals out unwanted noise for a pure listening experience.Secure, Comfortable Fit for Active Lifestyles In-ear headphones give you total freedom to move for life on-the-go. But they don't always stay where they are or even in your ear, especially if you're working out. Monster's ear hooks keep your headphones firmly in place. They're lightweight, easy to wear and remove, and easily bend to fit your ear's shape.",
