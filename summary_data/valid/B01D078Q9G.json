Im also super picky about the toys I give my kiddos. I try to avoid plastics but I trust Green Toys. The red barn is adorable, it has a handle at the top to be carried and a few doors to open and close. The farmers are cute little cows wearing hats and overalls and they fit in the tractor. You can fit everything in the barn for storage. I have no complaints, my little loves this just as much as I do! Entertained my big kids for quite a while too!",

I took the farmers off the set, and had more animals from another brand. I don't really like the fact that the farmers are animals too, I would have prefer a little boy and a little girl for example.",

The \"plastic\" is thick, durable, and has a smooth texture that is perfect for my grandson. My 4 granbabies ranging in age from 1-6 all enjoyed playing with it and it survived! The faces on the farmer cows, the sheep, & pigs are cutely detailed. The barn has 2 floors and multiple doors. The truck is very sturdy just like my other green toys are. I will definitely buy Green Toys for Christmas!",

    "description": "It's a busy day on the Green Toys Farm! Inspiring cooperative play and communication, this playset includes a barn, pick-up truck, farmer cow characters, sheep, pigs, fences, and a hog shed for endless imaginative play. As little ones help the farmer cows open and close the barn doors, corral the pigs, and load the sheep in the back of the pick-up truck, they also develop fine motor skills and coordination. All pieces fit inside the barn, so clean-up and storage is a breeze, and the built-in handle makes it easy to take all the fun on-the-go. Made in the USA from 100% recycled plastic with no BPA, phthalates, or PVC. Dishwasher safe. Packaged with recycled and recyclable materials printed with soy inks.",
