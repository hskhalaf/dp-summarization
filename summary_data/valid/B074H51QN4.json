It's hard to find an almond butter with the only ingredient being almonds. The price is right & it tastes great. The oil separates but it's not too difficult to mix before use. After the 1st mix subsequent uses don't require as much effort to mix. Perfect for keto friendly recipes and those allergic to peanut butter! Highly recommend!",

I am very disappointed as I was hoping to use this as an alternative to peanut butter, but this product is such a rip-off.
