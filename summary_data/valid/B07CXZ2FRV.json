Also the major glaring flaw is that the surface of the laptop is made terribly. It gets horrible smudges and marks all over which are still there after washing. It comes in a fancy box like it's a luxury item, yet the outside surface is cheap. It constantly looks dirty. If your only concerned about function, it functions well.",

And it is probably the slimmest and lightest model I have ever had these years. The hinge design is not only unique but practical as well. Keyboard and touch panel feel good but nothing fancy. Despite and pros, the battery life is a serious problem. You can imagine how fast one charge will wear out with a 4k design and an i7 processor. It does get better after I switch into 1080p resolution tho. But the display quality also got sacrificed. The only reason why I returned it is that I found a better price elsewhere.",

The bad: Do you want crisp blacks? You will not get them. Want the screen to be brighter? Not happening. Don't want to use the quiet fan because you are going to use some extra processing power and want to keep it cooler? Don't bother, it will shut the computer down by overheating it. Overall, it isn't worth the price. It is a nice computer, but I should have went with Razer again.",

It smudges easily, so something to be aware of (see picture). Overall, it's a worthwhile investment and strongly recommended.",

This thing has 1 small fan and no where to dissipate heat. temperatures of 60-70C are normal for basic applications and if you happen to get a windows update or something that uses >20% cpu it will be an inferno on your lap/bed/wherever you use this thing.
