I got tired of wearing a concealer then using a powder afterwards so I thought I'd give this product a try and I'm very glad I did. It provides remarkable coverage on its own. The photos speak for themselves. I have not doctored these pictures in any way, other than cut and put them in a collage. Top pictures are of before and bottom, after. I would recommend that you get a lighter (or darker) shade to give it some contoured look. Highly recommended.",

Description was accurate for olive skin. It matches my skin exactly. I would say that it lightly evens skin tone. Don't expect it to have a heavy cover up. I prefer that type of makeup. I have it applied over a lotion base with nothing else. I choose to lightly roll a buki brush on the compact to apply because it will last much longer. Costs significantly less than in my local coop.",

I'm still very happy with the ingredients, and the texture as well. It does have a slight fragrance, but nothing too bothersome. All in all, I would recommend!",

I recommend this product to anyone that's looking for good coverage without feeling like you are wearing a foundation.",
