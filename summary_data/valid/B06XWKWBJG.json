      "text": "My wife bought these for use on her Peloton (stationary exercise bike) and loves them. Originally she was worried she wouldn't like how they wrap around the back of the neck so tightly because she has long hair, but it doesn't interfere. Most importantly, the ear parts stay in place very well. Just a warning, for anyone with glasses these will most likely interfere with them since they go over your ears like glasses earpieces. Also, these are excellent quality, but if you have sticker-shock from the price, there are cheaper, lesser namebrand versions out there that are almost identical to these in appearance (don't know about the sound quality).",

I thought the buttons were easy to reach on the back of the head and the cord didn\u2019t bounce. Unfortunately, function and performance didn\u2019t match form. I wore them first on a five Mile run. The Bluetooth connection kept skipping out every few seconds with the phone in my pocket. Then, 3 miles in, the battery died after being charged fully prior. Despite me wanting them to be better, I returned these defective headphones for a refund.",

They're super comfortable once you figure out how to get them in the ears properly. My primary use so far is using them in the gym and for practicing yoga and they word perfect for both these activities.",

It was worse while running/moving and worse still if I held my cell phone by the edges. Next on the list of flaws are the controls, which are very small buttons spaced very close together. No matter which one I wanted to press, I always hit the power button. Very frustrating.",

Got around to using them again a couple months ago. Two days ago the same problem came up, power button will no longer turn them on.

The deal breaker for me: even paired with my phone in my arm-band, less than a foot away, there are continual skips and drops in connection, resulting an a lousy experience. It seems to correlate with 1. outdoor running in an urban environment and 2. sudden head-turns (a necessity when running on busy streets). I can use them easily in gym, but not out for a run.

On top of being DOA, the just so-so fit and finish as well as the flimsy construction that belies its high price made me decide to send it back for a full refund rather than a replacement.",
