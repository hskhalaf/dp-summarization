It took me about 20 minutes with some trial and error. Just so maybe no one else will have this problem I\u2019ve put together a group of photos during each step. Hopefully someone will find them helpful. Just be careful when you go to insert the screws it\u2019s a little hard to see if you have the holes lined up properly if it doesn\u2019t go in smoothly don\u2019t force it. Good Luck",

Has a nice textured rubber grip. 4 stars because the mount for the gopro did not tighten, making the camera flop back and forth. Company is going to send a replacement but I purchased a tripod mount from another vendor who also makes solid products. Hoping the replacement will work as its supposed to. But the pole, exceptional product which is used on a daily basis for travel. *update. Changed to 5 stars. Received a replacement mount and camera is now secure without any back or forward movements unless I position it.",

The handle is solid and well built, with a very nice rubber grip. That said, the joint and other accompanying parts feel like cheap-ish plastic. I worry about them breaking with extended use, but as of now, I'm very pleased. As mentioned previously, the unit is light on documentation, but it was simple enough to put together. Coupled with a wide-angle lens this will come in handy shooting realty home walkthroughs!",
