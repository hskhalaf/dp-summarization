There are a bunch of others on Amazon too but they all had fixed feet. if your shower was made properly unless you have one of those nifty euro perimeter drain showers, it's going to have some pitch to it and without adjustment your shelf is going to rock more than a sailing ship in a maelstrom. Ours leveled out easily and holds our various shower stuffs well.",

It's in the corner of my shower, under the shower head, so it doesn't have direct water all the time. It holds so much! We were able to place all our shampoo and soap/etc on the shelf with plenty room to spare. The leveling legs are perfect for a shower stall that may have sloping sides. Very sturdy. We are planning to purchase another piece, a smaller piece, for towel storage in the future.",

The adjustable feet are absolutely necessary and I'm glad that they thought to use them. The product looks great, smells great, and seems very high quality. I would definitely recommend and will probably be buying more aqua teak products in the future. PS i am not being paid by aqua teak! ;)",
