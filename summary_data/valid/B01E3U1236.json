I dreamed of having real hands alas this outfit has flappy fake arms - they don\u2019t even pick up your tuna! - the humans chuckled. Hat is mega yet flimsy. Human seemed pleased enough with the pictures.",

But that doesn't mean he/she is a size small for all the clothes. Different designers and manufacturers use their own size charts. So the measurements given in a size SMALL by manufacturer \"A\" will be a size XS in manufacturer B's size chart. Don't buy a particular size because that is what you always buy in a pet shop or online store. Always look at the size chart for chest girth and length and confirm the size before you commit to buy. \n\n3.If any of the measurements are 'between' two sizes, choose the larger size. \n\n4.If your pet dog is growing up,you can order a bigger size \n\n5.Take each measurement a bit loosely. \n\nTake each measurement a bit loosely, so there will be room for your dog to move and breathe, but not too loose. \n\nPlease measure carefully before buying and email us if you have any questions about fit before you bid or make a purchase.",
