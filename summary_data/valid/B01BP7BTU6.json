After freezing the bowl overnight, I made ice cream the next day. Absolutely the BEST ice cream I have ever had. I have used it almost everyday. My neighbors love me!!! I have not used the sorbet paddles but if it is half as good as the ice cream, it will be wonderful.",

It\u2019s easy to use and clean I bought a second tub to keep in the freezer so it\u2019s ready to go any time.

      "text": "I thought that the bowl might not fit in my bottom freezer drawer, but it was very compact, didn't take up too much freezer space and was short enough to easily fit on the top drawer of the freezer. In fact it is small enough to just leave it in there in the event you have a craving for ice cream. Recipes are easy, but the prep time is by far the longest part of the process.",
