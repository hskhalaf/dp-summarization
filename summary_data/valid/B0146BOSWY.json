It is incredibly flexible and can be adjusted in a reamrkable range of angles that will accommodate more body types than any other chair on the market. I have been using the Pisces Dolphin II for a long time - a terrific chair in its own right - but I find that the Ergo Pro II is much easier to use, easier to adjust and to fit the client in. There is also a major difference in price between these 2 chairs - so with the Ergo II there is more bang for the buck.",

I have only used it for 4 gigs but the design appears to be very \"strong.\" Not sure it is so \"lite\" though but not much heavier then my previous one. I prefer that it is built strong and lasting rather then light. My one complaint that may not seem to be a big issue for some but has been for me. The arm rest is right at crotch level so I need to be extra cautious or avoid working in front of the client. I wish this was adjustable but other then that I am satisfied.",

Not sure if they were loose & fell out or were not there to begin with. It is also super squeaky, even with my smallest clients, it squeaks.
