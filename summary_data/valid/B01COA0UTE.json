      "text": "Great inverter, however the cables that come with it are way undersized. I tested it with a 12V 100AH battery and my meter showed me a constant load of around 20 Amp (240 Watt) on the input side. The cables got so hot after a while that you couldn't touch them any longer. I assume the inverter will run well with a full load, but I would advise against using the included cables and order a some higher gauge ones. After all I like the inverter, but will most likely ditch it for a 24V one as I could use less Amp's to have the same result and therefore make it more efficient.",

Powering the fridge during those rare outages is the main reason I purchased this item so I am pleased with it.",

      "text": "I bought it to power up my RV's 110V appliances including 1500W microwave. At first it looked good, solidly built and seriously looking. It worked great powering laptops, tablets and all the low power stuff until I tried to plug in a microwave and then it tripped. So it is not providing 1500W as stated and unfortunately I still need to start my generator for 3 minutes if I need to heat up something in a microwave. In a couple of days I will try to plug in 1000W Instant pot, I hope it will provide at least 1kW. I'd say it is good inverter if you do not plan to use near 1500W of power.",

      "text": "Just put into use in a RV and testing it\u2019s capabilities. Has run a small bar/countertop fridge well and the 700w microwave will be the highest drawing appliance I use. Not tested yet but it draws 1100w on high so that will tell the tale. My oscillating fan runs quiet now with pure sine. Always had a weird buzz on a modified sine wave inverter. Not good for the motor I\u2019m sure. Even though they are more expensive pure sine is the best for inverter use. Worth it.",
