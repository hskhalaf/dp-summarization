The double trailer we were really happy with, but the cloth seat and drink pouches split at the seams after about 4 months/few hundred miles of use with just one child riding in it, so we contacted Allen customer service via their website. Really prompt reply from customer service and they replaced the double wagon after we emailed pics of the damage and receipt- thus the fourth star. Very impressed with their attentiveness and replacing whole unit.",

Not heavy at all to pull. Love the storage in the back. Great for our groceries and diaper bag. Even holds a gallon of milk, no prob. Will definitely recommend for other beginners who are like me and take the kids when they can to ride to the store and park.",

The quality and the metal frame really gives you peace of mind of having your baby on board of this. It could fit up to two children, it has compartments to place your wallet, water or anything else that you want to bring for cycling. What I like the most was how easy was to folded to either take it out for a run or store it. Wheels are easy to remove as well and best is that are an actual bicycle tire not a plastic one.",

We put a pillow under the \"seat\", to make a continuous, cushioned platform instead of the seat/footwell as designed. The stroller to trailer conversion is what we were after, it works pretty well although one with a front wheel that stays attached would be easier to use. The stroller handle attachment is a bit clunky but it gets the job done. Check the bolts for tightness - one fell off while in the car, fortunately we found it and re-attached.

You wouldn't think the bigger tires would make a difference, but any ride longer than 5 miles with this in tow will double your effort as a rider. If you're taking your kids around the block, less than a mile or so.... sure.... but if you're riding 10+ miles on a dedicated bike trail... you will regret not just renting a nice one from the store on the side of the bike trail.",

There\u2019s also a pretty awesome flap for when it may surprise rain or sprinkle during your ride. Plenty of room for two toddlers and all their needs (diaper bag, snacks, drinks, towels, etc.) amazing quality time and fun for the price",

The storage bin below is not separated from the floor with the kids put their feet, FYI... and I feel like you can use it without the rain fly / air cover and be OK.

It's built very solid with ample storage space in the rear. Bike connector is 360, I think that's what it's called, so that trailer remains upright even when bike is laid down. The only one criticism I have is its collapsability. You'll need to remove all the beefy safety pins which are quite hard to do by hand, and pretty much disassemble to collapse it. We have a van so I just stuff it in the back without collapsing it. Overall, very nicely and solidly built and you can't beat the cost.",

Only downsides are that the kids are a bit cramped width-wise and the angle of the backrest makes it a bit awkward when the riders have helmets on - the steep angle and height of the back pushes their necks forward because there is no room for their helmets. All around though, it's worked out great. Good value for the money",

Mesh screen offers ventilation and the plastic overlapped screen offers protection from rain. Comes with an adapter to easily connect the trailer to the bike.",

Spoked wheels and a canvas seat that can move somewhat make for a pretty comfy ride. No issues setting this up and storage is quick and easy. The trailer also appears very safe and will not fall over even if you drop your bike (no idea about falling at speed).",
