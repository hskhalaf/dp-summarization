      "text": "updated 12 Jan 2014 Great for gaming! Use it for world of tanks, Arma II, Arma III. On the high end graphics games, you'll hear the graphics card fan kick in, but not 'that' loud. However, my experience wasn't that great as far as the hardware. Could just be a coincidence and I'm one out of a hundred. My first m17 was dead on arrival. 2nd laptop lasted 9 months. I have gone through two on site tech visits and one depot repair with the second m17 and no luck getting it repaired Dell has since exchanged the M17x R4 with an Alienware 18 (so far so good!). You must take care of your warranty!!!!",
