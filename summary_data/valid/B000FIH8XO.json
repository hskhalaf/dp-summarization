This EJ \"bowl\" is classy looking, but the cooking bowl is way more effective at getting up a good lather; it's just ergonomically easier to use when lathering up the cream. This EJ \"bowl\" is really just a flared cup with a handle. If you just like product identification, then the EJ bowl (silver colored) would probably work best, but I went for the \"cool\" looking black \"bowl\". Still a big fan of EJ, but just not this product.",

I also like the large diameter of the lip of the mug. This is a huge improvement over the soap bowl I was using.",
