I\u2019ve purchased other swim shirts that were thicker and retained their shape/fit a lot better when wet. That was the only issue, otherwise it was a good purchase. The color matched his swim trunks perfectly.",

My son is a little bit insecure about a small amount of extra weight he carries through the middle and these shirts are perfect for him because they are just loose enough to camouflage his midsection but tight enough to look like a swim shirt and not an everyday shirt.",
