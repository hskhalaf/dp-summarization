      "text": "This is the real deal. Unless you are working for Terex, this tool should be your favorite everyday wrench. It's solid, light, comfortable, quiet, and powerful. It gets the job done, even on a smaller compressor. I've been using a pneumatic impact for 25 years, and this is my pick at this price. I especially appreciate the low impact option for F, just enough torque to install but light enough so you can still put the torque wrench on. Enjoy this baby.",

Don't wast your money on other name brands, this one is the best I've seen in a factory setting or working on cars.",

But I do own one and it's SICK can't wait to get into it. this is nicer fit and better sounding than the IR but I do like both.

It is quite quiet for the power. The packaging it comes in makes you feel like the company stands behind its products 110% percent. Plus this is cheaper than other air impacts with similar or less power. Cons: brushed metal tip scratches easy. So be sure to get a cover for it. Bulky, so don't expect to use this in tight areas. Heavy, but I'm sure this is to be expected. Really hope this stands up to IR for the long term.",
