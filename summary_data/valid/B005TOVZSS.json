I can't bring myself to puting a cover on it because it feels so good. It is a warmer blanket so will have to use a sheet in summer. But perfect for all of the other seasons. I tend to be a hot sleeper, so may be perfect for majority of people. Cannot say enough of how happy I am with this purchase!! It is always a gamble ordering online,I am so glad that I took a chance on this one. Now time for some new pillowcases!",

It is lightweight, but personally I prefer something a bit heavier. Hope it will wash well. I definitely cannot wash it in my home machine,",

      "text": "We needed a warm, but not too warm king sized blanket. Real goose down feathers can be too much for our allergies and noses so based on the reviews, I purchased this down alternative. It is super cozy and warm. The fabric covering is great, though we still need to put this through the washer to see how it holds up. We've put this comforter into an IKEA duvet cover and it looks great. The thickness of it works great and as it plummets down to 20 degrees in NYC, I add an extra fleece blanket under for some warmth. I can see how this will work great though through \"all seasons\", particularly in cooler temperatures.",

I love this comforter because it is heavier than others 5.9 Lbs. Before, I ordered a comforter which was 3.8 Lbs. but that was too light for me and I returned it. I need a warm comforter for winter and this weight feels very good especially when you put a duvet cover on. The only thing that is missing are hooks in the 4 corners to hook to the duvet, but it is not a problem, I will sew them myself.",

Does not make annoying \"crunchy\" sounds when turning over as you sleep, and the weight of the blanket was surprisingly heavy for a down alternative comforter, but it made it that much nicer, especially in cold weather like we have in my state. Besides coming on time, this blanket was AWESOME!! Highly recommend.",

Even better is the microfiber filling. This filling is a perfect density, I think that it's 100oz, and evenly distributed. It really reminds me of some wonderful times in good bed and breakfasts!
