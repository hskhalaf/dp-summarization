The image quality is kinda grainy, but again I think its just that I am used to such a high resolution camera. I will say, it tends to take better pictures outside than inside. Good for the prices I guess, just don't expect to blow up any of the pictures to anything larger than a standard 4x6 print.",

I like the fast transfer. It only takes about 30 sec to transfer your photos to your computer and it makes it's own folder with the date of transfer or you can name it yourself while transferring.",
