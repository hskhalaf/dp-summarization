He plays with it for up to 15 minutes many times a day. I never get sick of the songs. Like another reviewer said, it's the perfect size for the baby to use as a counter balance while learning to sit up. Every baby/parent needs this toy. If they came out with another cube with new songs/insterments I would buy it in a hearbeat! Munchkin, of your reading this please come out with one that has a Souzaphone! Babys dad plays the souzaphone! Or one with a banjo that has bluegrass music!",

I had the old model and after 3 years it broke and I immediately bought this one for baby #2 to keep playing with it. It's the only toy my 3 year old plays with that she has been playing with since a baby. She jumps and dances to it and we've made up games to play with the buttons.

Well I just got the replacement and the new one has deep scratches all over it. I'm going to return and purchase from Target. They also have fast and free shipping (over $35, but who doesn't spend that much anytime they order form Target?). Super disappointed in Amazon's suppliers, and have been for awhile. Hope they can turn things around. Until then I'll be doing my shopping at Target online.",

Note he was not strong enough to push the buttons until six or seven months of age but once he was strong enough this was a toy he went back to over and over again.

The Mozart tunes are nicely played with each \" instrument\" having a part. Then when two or more sides are pushed, each \"instrument\" plays with resulting harmony until there is a whole orchestral sound with all buttons pushed. I certainly recommend it .",

I'm so disappointed because it was my 17 month old's favorite toy. We owned a previous version of this and it stopped working after a while and the on/off button was finicky. This is a major improvement. They added two volume options and the shape allows it to roll when thrown, which makes so much more sense for a baby toy. It feels more sturdy, we'll see how it holds up.",

If my memory serves me correctly, and I think it does, besides the color being different in the older version, more importantly, so was the instrumentation. The older version used real instruments for its sounds. This newer version uses a cheap sounding synthesizer for every instrument. Mozart's eight titles (including Non Piu Andrai and Der Vogelfanger) of music which allows a child to arrange instrumentation is a great toy. But if you love Mozart's music and/or classical instruments, then you will be very disappointed or at least very annoyed.",

As a parent it's also nice to have a toy with sound that doesn't give you a headache within two minutes.

I would say its a bit more of an educational toy that will make parents happy, rather than being an absolute kid magnet.

It works about as well as the previous, I prefer the previous more square design. It seems as though two of the instruments are reversed on ours, but so far it's not irritating enough to replace! This is by far our favorite baby toy and has been much loved by all four of our children. It is my go to baby gift, the music is not irritating!",
