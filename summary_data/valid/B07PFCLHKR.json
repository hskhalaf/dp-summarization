Screaming and biting (from the dog). I\u2019ve tried other nail grinders and she was terrified of them. I came across this one and thought I\u2019d give it a try. It took only 5 minutes to do ALL FOUR paws! She held perfectly still and didn\u2019t fight me a single bit!! She even wagged her tail when we were done!! Hallelujah I think we found the tool for us!!!",

THIS ONE, however, is much quieter PLUS it gave helpful hints to get pets accustomed to having their nails done. I tried it as suggested; with a handful of treats on the counter right next to the grinder, which was turned on. After a few minutes of feeding her treats next to the grinder, I simply picked up her paw and began using it on her nails. She turned her head away a bit, but kept on eating her treats while I was filing her nails! HORRAY!!",

I'll keep trying & will update the review if it goes better in the future, but for now it just doesn't work for me. If your dog is super calm or not sensitive to sound (or better yet old or deaf) it'd probably be great b/c the cost was decent and seems like it would work. Fingers crossed for better results.",

It does have 2 settings/speeds, but both are pretty noisy/loud. Battery life has held up (haven't had to recharge yet even after daily \"use\" Overall, if your pup is used to having his nails done, this seems nice. If your pup isn't used to nail trims, find something quieter to start out with.",

I can get some peanut butter on a spoon and they will lick that while I trim their nails. The sound still startles them, so make sure you get them acclimated to the sound of it/the smell. I normally turn mine on for a minute or so before i actually use it, so they know the sound and don't get as scared. It's definitely helpful, especially since one of my dogs is a big boy and holding him down to clip nails is ROUGH. This is definitely worth it, and it's very easy to use.",

I must say that I am completely satisfied with this nail grinder. The noise level is very low, no noticeable vibrations, easy to hold, not too big for a cat's finer (and sharper!) nails, and the grinder bit was perfect in size and adjustable power. Using this tool made a difficult task easier.",

It does a great, fast job, is very easy to hold and is the quietest of all the grinders. None of the dogs are bothered by it whereas, they are very bothered by some of the others. I will be selling the rest of my nail grinders on ebay or to other dog folk. Thank you Casfuy for such a superior product.",
