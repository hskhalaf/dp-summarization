Note 9 just came out and it's overpriced, so I went for Note 8 which is a very nice device! I still prefer the flat screen and will definitely miss the possibility to change my battery, however Note 8 is a big step forward and I am happy with the upgrade. I don't mind needing to charge it more often, it charges in a heartbeat anyway. Note 9 is not worth the price difference (I saved \u00a3360 choosing the Note 8) for what this last year's beast is able to do.",

I have bought from Samsung: 2 tablets, 1 television, 4 Galaxy Notes, and a few other various items I can't remember. But I'm not buying another Samsung item if they don't honour their warranty.",

The Note 8 is not perfect: the fingerprint sensor is too pernickety to be relied on, the face recognition can be fooled by showing it your photograph, and the wraparound screen means your grip hand can accidentally touch the scroll bars. But the camera is unbelievably good, the wi-fi management is much improved and the processor speed is excellent. I wouldn't pay the just-released price, but now is an excellent time to by.",

As cons(for me), you can't fit a protective screen if you also want to use a tough armour protective case, also the new rounded glassy smartphone design(that looks really good) is not as sturdy, I find it more fragile and really have to be carefull not dropping it. Also HATE the headphones, they have that jellyfish design that has to go all the way inside your ears. Keeping in mind I have been intensively using a Samsung Note 4 for the last 4 years, I am very happy with the Note 8 as a replacement! The battery lasts very well.",
