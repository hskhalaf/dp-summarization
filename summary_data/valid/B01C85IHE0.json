The Ocean Digital tuner is an excellent value for the money, and adding the extended warranty for 4 years is well worth the investment. Living in a rural area this tuner allows us to listen to some of the best Classical Music stations. Waking up to Classical music sure beats the old buzzer alarm.",

(I've had battery failures and screen failures, mainly from overheating. ) This dedicated little interface (no bells and whistles; just functionality) is likely to last me a long time. Complete \"internet radios\" are an option, but then the sound quality is also 'compact'. Now I still have the fidelity of the stereo system (or the home theater system) already present. Great, so far. Thanks!",

My only complaint is the small 2.5\" screen on a unit that screams out for, and will easily accommodate, a 5\" screen. 2.5\" is fine if you're using it on your desk but, for an audio system shelf, 5\" is a must. I hope Ocean Digital will correct this in the future.",
