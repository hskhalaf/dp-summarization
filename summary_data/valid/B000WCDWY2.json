Pay careful attention to the measurements on the description, because I assumed it was the same size as similar sets I'd seen in retail stores. This is the perfect set for side dishes and small servings, but isn't adequate for large portions to feed an entire family. Otherwise, great set and I'm glad I purchased it. Maybe it will help me scale down my portion sizes!",
