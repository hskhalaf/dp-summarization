KUDOS to men who like to spoil their wives with little treats like this! I hope someone picks up on this and treats their special someone to Cinnabon coffee in bed - it's nice!",

When setting the Keurig to 10oz, I would describe the coffee as light in body with a subtle cinnamon flavor. If you want the cinnamon to be more apparent, set your cup setting down. This kcup wasn't as potent as I thought but it still satisfied the seasonal (and year round) cinnamon bun urge. I have also mixed it with a dark roast to give the coffee some more umph while enhancing it with a slight cinnamon flavor. Overall, its a pleasant cup of smooth coffee and better option than downing a six pack of cinnamon rolls (but maybe not as fun).",
