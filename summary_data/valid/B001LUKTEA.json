That said, the first thing I noticed upon opening the package was a STRONG scent of men's cologne. Like, really strong obviously cologne, as though it were stored with cologne for a long time. I gave it a quick light washing with a lightly damp sponge which helped some. However, my cat seems to love the scent... go figure. I mean, he will not let this bunny go for even a second. He's in love - so I'm happy regardless of the odd scent.",
