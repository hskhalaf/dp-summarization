Usually I need a lot of product to wash my hair (3 to 4 squeezes). I was impressed that only with 1 big squeeze, all my hair was frothy. It also came out easy, so that it did not feel sticky afterwards. If it smells this good, I am considering buying other products from this brand. Let's see how this product behaves in the long run.",
