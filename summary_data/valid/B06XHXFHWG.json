I bought it to clean my shower and it works fabulous to blast off mineral deposits and other junk that hides around shower doors and faucets. No cleaning products needed and I love the safety valve that keeps it locked until it\u2019s cooled down and it heats up very quickly. Thank you for making a great product!!",

      "text": "I did 3 tests on grout (all with some scrubbing): cleaned with (i) steam only, (ii) chemicals, (iii) steam-chemicals-steam. Steam only was as effective as the other 2 ways. Water resevoir seemed small, which led to frequent refillings; but the tradeoff would be a heavier device. Had no trouble getting the cap off; just need to release pressure and let it cool a little. Had no trouble with the instructions. I have not yet used any of the attachments.",

With there being so much heat being emitted the bristles melted however the brush does help tremendously on tougher spots. I also looked at a compatible product however I decided to go with this brand beings there are more reviews. I'm very glad I went with this brand instead. I would definitely purchase as a gift for someone.",

If using the cleaner intermittently and for spot cleaning it will hold adequate pressure and obviously last a much longer time. I see people thinking the water reservoir cap is unable to come off after first use. I ran into the same problem before realizing that if you do not release the pressure after turning off the cleaner/heating element the pressure will stay contained keeping the safety mechanism from allowing the cap to open.

      "text": "This is an amazing product. I had a a bed bug infestation and I have used this steamer to go over the couches from top to bottom with great results along with a spray to prevent those pesky bugs in the future. I also had some stains in the car that have been Attempted to remove with carpet cleaning and have not come out with other chemicals. So, I use the steamer that blasted right through the stains and really made it look virtually new. It gives out nice steady steam. The tools are great and really give this product a lot of versatility. Great price for a great product!!",

With RugDoctors out of commission due to the pandemic, I thought i\u2019d Try it, but how can a steamer that doesn\u2019t extract really clean? Let me tell you. My living room no longer smells like dog and my furniture looks nearly brand new. Even the spots that were flattened from sitting on them. I did spray some pet odor neutralizer on it first, and had to refill the tank numerous times, but they were gross.",

The only draw back that I can see to this machine is that it runs out of steam pretty fast and you have to fill it up and wait again to get hot, also you can\u2019t open the fill lid until it cools a bit, so it\u2019s a bit time consuming, but they may all be that way, this is the first one that I\u2019ve owned,",
