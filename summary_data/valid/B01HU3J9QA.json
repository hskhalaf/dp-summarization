Without getting into software limitations it works pretty well. A bit of light leakage is the only physical gripe. Hardware wise, the cooling fan thing is annoying but an easy fix. Overall I'm pretty satisfied given the price and limitations.",

It took quite a long time for the initial start up apps to fully load, but once they did - it was VR heaven. I really like it, plus there is plenty of \"free-ware\" to make the VR enjoyable.
