I bought the plastic decloggers to snake down the drain myself to pull out anything I could and found half melted hair. What this Drano does is just attempted to chemically melt everything it touches in the pipes, but doesn't really do the job 100%. Eventually, it just builds back up and makes you keep buying and using the product. It's just a temporary fix and not a permanent one.",

After you've let a bunch of water go through so you can't get any blowback you can plunge which may bust through a partial clog weakened by the drano. Make sure you wait and let the water drain for a bit because drano splashing back is no fun.",

When it finally starts to boil, take the large pot of boiling water and pour it into the treated drain. Using the empty pot, turn on the hot spigot and catch the unheated water with the large pot while the boiled water is still draining. Once the water is running hot, remove the pot and let the hot water flush the drain. Basically the idea is, add the product to the drain..... Let it sit a while, then flush flush flush with HOT HOT water. Works great!",
