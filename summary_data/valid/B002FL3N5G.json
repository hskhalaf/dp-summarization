Then, after you attach the two 1\" duck foot brackets to the slides, for mounting to your desk, you are at 26.25\", 3\" over the width of your opening. What you need, with these slides and mounting brackets, is a 20\" tray. Also, with the mounting brackets in their lowest position, you will not be able to use a keyboard that is more than 1.25\" tall, so that might also be an issue.",

It meets my needs, but if you're using it daily for your keyboard, you may want to look elsewhere.
