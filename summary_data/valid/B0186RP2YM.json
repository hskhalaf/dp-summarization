Static reduced so I don\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to use wasteful dryer sheets unless I\u2019m looking for added scent. They are literally the size of a tennis ball. They don\u2019t thump around badly so don\u2019t worry about drum damage in the dryer. They ONLY complaint is that they do inevitably get tangled up so if you\u2019re doing multi loads you will have to go digging to keep them in with the next load. Second set could be on the horizon.

No more chemical filled dryer sheets. I\u2019m happy. The best part, adding my essential oil to one ball. All my clothes have a nice clean and subtle peppermint scent. Love it! Thank you!",

Anyway, throw away your chemical dryer sheets and pick yourself up some wool dryer balls. They're awesome and these are.......cute.",
