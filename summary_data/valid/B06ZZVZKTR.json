They even reset the phone back to factory setting, however, it was in vain. Cannot even find a way to contact the seller. No seller email or phone number appears at my order history. I have two other moto e4, and so far they work fine. It's just this one. It's a defective one.",

I get at least 1 day of moderate usage on a full charge - but not a power user or game player. Screen is bright for regular use, and sound is fairly decent. Bluetooth works awesome, and headphone port provides enough juice to listen to tunes or videos online, or my favorite items off my plex.tv server. Wireless is more than suitable for 99.9% of users. Only missing item I can tell is NFC support. But let's not expect miracles for the price.",

In top of that, the box seal was broken. Open box item must be sell as REFURBISHED not as NEW. I wouldn't use an pre-owned or seal-broken smart phone to keep my personal and financial information. It is too risky. I wonder how many hacked phones are out there stealing information from people. Just saying",
