      "text": "I use these nailers in a professional shop environment and for installation work on-site. This model was at one time a rock solid tool. The last two I\u2019ve purchased have had the same, fatal flaw: the spring-loaded mechanism inside the magazine that is supposed to hold the nails and push them towards the front does not stay tight against the wall of the chamber. This causes it to slip and bypass the nails, both jamming them inside the magazine, and jamming the magazine slide cover so tight that it is difficult to remove and clear. This gun might be fine for the DIY, but for someone who might be firing several hundred nails at a time, it just doesn\u2019t work.",

This one is as close as I've ever used (25 plus years as a Carpenter). It has plenty of power to drive brads through the harder woods like oak and maple. It has great balance and trigger control. It's not overly bulky and is able to fit into awkward places. Came with a nice durable case, safety glasses, 2 non-marring nose pads and pre-installed quick connect (universal) and adjustable exhaust port (on tool).",

      "text": "Bought to hang trim (baseboard and crown moulding) in a basement finish and after refinishing hardwood floor (removing the existing baseboard and re-installing). Used with 2\" DeWalt brand 18 gauge nails. Had only one jam, fired about 800 nails in total. Pretty consistent in depth, with maybe 10 nails left a little proud, most of them when nailing crown moulding into 50 year old joists in the basement. The main nit-pick is that the hole is often bigger than the nail. Sometimes it's just the nail's size, but more often it's an elongated depression. It's still pretty small, and I was painting the trim anyway, but for stain grade trim I would find it unacceptable.",

A few drops of lubricating oil into the air connector, before each use, and you are good for several hundred brads. The molded carrying case and included safety glasses are also nice bonus features, considering the price of this gun.",

The nib that gets pressed back when you place the gun against a piece of wood to start nailing hits the wood very hard and on any kind of softwood, it leaves a little mark under the nail hole. Just something else to apply caulking to later, if you're using this nailer on a softwood. Overall a decent product, just keep in mind the above points.",

Both compressor and nailer performed well as with 5/8 inch nails as with 2 inch on the framing window and paneling project. Nailer seems to be a very good quality and performed well. I'm happy with the choice on both items. and will recommend nailer and compressor.",

It has small indents intended to keep nails from sliding behind or in front of it, but they're not enough and nails slide pass the slide, jamming the nailer. I have found a cheap nailer from Harbor Freight costing $20 to be reliable and it also handles staples. I'm very disappointed with Hitachi.",
