I bought it for my kid, since he likes my Submariner (but i can't afford to buy a teenager that), expecting a decent watch for $80. It went above my expectations, it looks very nice, doesn't look cheap, the band is a bit in the heavier side compared to my watch, but he changed it to a Perlon NATO strap. Overall you can't go wrong with this, I'm even going to order an Invicta for myself!",

Came with the yellow colored rotor. If the movement isn't running on time, give it a couple of weeks off wear, it should stabilize. Can't beat the classy look of a sweeping second hand. Easy to adjust the size via link removal. Came with outer white box and OEM yellow Invicta box. All the original plastic protective coverings. Cyclops magnifier is right on center with the date window. Extremely beautiful watch for the price.",

I decided on the Pro Diver 40mm, and love it. Most Invictas are too large for me, but the 40mm is just right. Have worn pretty much every day for the last 3-4 weeks, and it keeps excellent time. Some of the negative reviews I think are from those not familiar with a watch with an automatic movement. If you don't wear every day, it will run down. It's early, but so far I am extremely happy with this purchase.",

I contacted the manufacturer letting them know what happened and they recommend me contacting amazon which won't let me, so I am going to leave it here. A watch plating should not dissipate after four months in an office environment. There must be a design defect and I would like this to be addressed.",

My opinion: junk mechanism. I returned this one too, and bought a Henry Jay quartz watch that looks almost identical, works perfectly, is more visible in the dark, and has a better quick release band, which is also the perfect size for my wrist.

This watch was purchased about a month ago and it has been worn 100% of the time. I have had many automatic watches, such as a Tissot, but never have I had these two problems.

The complaint about the length of time for service on the watches is about what one would expect for, especially a chronograph,(sometimes called \"self-winding\"). My Rolex was gone for two months for service and carried a $700.00 repair bill. I collect timepieces and I am totally pleased this watch. Quite eye catching.

Easily rivals automatics costing several times what this beauty cost! Highly recommended!!!",

It\u2019s also extremely easy to work on and would make a great starter piece for someone looking to get into watchmaking/customization. I plan on swapping the dial and hands out soon.",

Still, it was a good value for what I paid to have it last six years, and I figured I'd buy another (even after buying two other Invictas in between).",

    "description": "Invicta, Pro Diver, Men's Watch, Stainless Steel and Yellow Gold Plated Case, Stainless Steel and Yellow Gold Plated Bracelet, Mechanical Automatic (Self-Winding), 8928C\n\nClassic styling and high performance add up to an outstanding sport watch for your land or sea adventures. This two-tone automatic watch, from Invicta's Pro Diver series, places a large round stainless steel case on a robust steel bracelet with gold-plated center links. The electric blue dial is designed for quick and easy read-off, even in low light conditions. It offers three-hand function with luminous hands and markers and a magnified date display at the three o'clock position. The detailed hands, in Mercedes, sword, and breguet-style logo shapes, add a note of distinction. The dial is capped with a resilient mineral crystal and framed by a blue unidirectional rotating steel bezel with goldtone markings and coin edge detailing. This watch is driven by a Japanese automatic movement, which is visible through the see-through skeleton case back. It is rated water resistant to a full 200 meters. \n\n\n\nPro Diver Collection\n\nPlunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.\n\n\n\nAutomatic Watches\n\nAutomatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.\n\nAlso referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its most inspired creations yet, Invicta demonstrates its technical and design prowess, offering timepieces of style for extreme value.\n\n\"We have long held firm to the belief that supremely crafted timepieces can be offered for extremely modest sums. It is the founding principle of our flagship and the radical notion that still drives us today. By being true to our convictions, we will continue to turn the balance of power, and deliver true Swiss luxury to anyone who desires it. Let all those who possess our timepieces and pass through our doors witness the quality, value and care in every piece we create, and the spirit of never-ending possibilities in everything we do.\"\n\nThese are the words that greet visitors and motivate team members inside the Invicta Watch Group's new worldwide headquarters. Emblazoned in stainless steel, it has been the Invicta message since Day One.\n\n With each new timepiece, the company sends up a flare for those looking to be defined not by how much they spend, but how wisely they spend. With its strong collections, the gutsy Swiss brand is guaranteed to keep attracting followers. \n\nIt takes years of training and a great deal of pride to achieve glorious Swiss timepieces by hand. But it takes guts and the courage of your convictions to make those timepieces affordable for everyone who appreciates them.\n\n At our Swiss workshops, we mix time-honored traditions with a little bit of horse sense every single day to produce the greatest values in the watch-making world. \n\n\n\nSee more \n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n *  user guide [PDF ] User Manual Manual [PDF ] Sample Case Size Cutout [PDF 214kb] For additional assistance in setting the time or adjusting your watch, please download the Instruction Manual [PDF 425kb] \n * Is Discontinued By Manufacturer :No\n * Product Dimensions :0.59 x 0.59 x 0.59 inches; 8.82 Ounces\n * Item model number :8928OB\n * Department :Mens\n * Batteries :1 Lithium Metal batteries required.\n * Date First Available :March 22, 2004\n * Manufacturer :Invicta\n * ASIN :B000JQJS6M\n\n * .zg_hrsr_item {list-style : none};\n * Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #31,089 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry (See Top 100 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry)  *  #110 inMen's Wrist Watches \n    *  #7896 inMen's Shops \n   \n   \n\n * Customer Reviews:4.4 out of 5 stars6,725 ratings Invicta, Pro Diver, Men's Watch, Stainless Steel and Yellow Gold Plated Case, Stainless Steel and Yellow Gold Plated Bracelet, Mechanical Automatic (Self-Winding), 8928C\n\nClassic styling and high performance add up to an outstanding sport watch for your land or sea adventures.

The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.\n\nAlso referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its most inspired creations yet, Invicta demonstrates its technical and design prowess, offering timepieces of style for extreme value.\n\n\"We have long held firm to the belief that supremely crafted timepieces can be offered for extremely modest sums.
