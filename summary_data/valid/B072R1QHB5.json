I chose a fairly neutral blue to match much of my wardrobe. As previous reviewers have said, I agree that they are (oddly enough) very comfortable for quite a simplistic shoe. The first day I wore them, however, I did get red marks on the top of my foot (from the \u201ctriangle\u201d section), but I wore them again the next day and didn\u2019t. I figured I just needed to loosen them up a bit. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with my purchase. I wouldn\u2019t buy them full price, but I\u2019d wait for another deal.",

It's definitely the shoe. Additionally, I've worn these maybe 7 times and had them for just over a month and the material is already tearing. It'll be another couple of wears before they are complete trash. The seller should do the right thing and replace them.",

The attempt at matching the woven jute looking material with the plastic is also weird. It doesn't look good in person. It is a shame because I like the shade of pink / color it came in but it's not even wearable",

      "text": "Love my Toms! They do run a little small (I had to go up a size than what I usually wear), but I think it\u2019s just because of the material and shape. The toe box is a little tight at first, but stretches out with use and gets more comfortable. They are my go to shoes when going out and about; I love that they are fast and easy to slip on and I don\u2019t have to tie anything. Recommended!",
