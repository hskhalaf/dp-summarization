I highly recommend this unit and hoping it will last for a few years. Update March 8th 2018 over 5 months later and still working beautifully without any issues. I would buy it again... Update August 25th 2018 and nearly a year later and still going strong with no issues and would most certainly buy it again. It is a true extender...",

Once I got it powered up the signal strength as great, but I couldn't use it as I intended becaise the network I was repeating requires you login via a splash screen. This device won't repeat that signal allowing to me login from my computer. It wants to be logged into the network in order to repeat it.",
