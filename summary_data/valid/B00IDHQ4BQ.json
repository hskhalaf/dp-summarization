      "text": "Either they're terrible or mine were faulty. The unboxing experience was fine, it has plenty of different tips to choose from and the comfort is great. However mine sounded terrible. Like I was listening from inside a fish tank or something. The frequencies were all bleeding into each other and the clarity wasn't anything like I expected. I thought this could be due to the tip and tried to change them but they were seemingly impossible to get off and when trying to pull one off the casing of the iem actually split, So yeah a tad dissapointing.",

Some might say they lack in bass but they don't it's just neutral. If you're after bass look at the sennheiser ie80 but for all out detail and imaging these are faultless.",

      "text": "These really are great headphones. Highly recommend. The overall turning could be described as \"warm\", which is perfect for the vast majority of people. Lows are BA lows, so they are less powerful than dynamic but more precise and integrated. But I prefer that to dynamic lows. Bass still can be very decent - but just know a BA driver cannot produce dynamic base no matter how good it is, its just more of a preference. Mids and highs are great (to be expected) but what really stands out about these is how the whole package comes together. The soundstage and accuracy is just great. Get a headphone dac amp and some flac files and they sound even better.",

      "text": "I tried so, so many IEM\u2019s. Initially I wanted a wireless set, so started with the Jabra elite 65t\u2019s, the RHA True connects, and then the Sennheiser momentum true wireless. Non of them had what I needed, and I realised I could get a much better wired sounding pair for a similar price. Enter the AF180\u2019s. They\u2019re extraordinarily comfortable. They sound absolutely spectacular. The level of detail is astonishing. Often times, when IEM\u2019s have great detail, they do so by reducing the levels of bass. However, somehow, these IEM\u2019s produce microscopic levels of detail and clarity whilst maintaining solid levels of bass, so it never feels thin or aenemic. 100% recommend if you want a quality pair of IEM\u2019s.",

      "text": "On first listen I wasn't impressed having spent over \u00a3300. However, these have improved on each listen and they sound superb. They have accurate bass but are not for bass heads. Getting the isolation (tip fitting) right is crucial. Take the time to see which tips work for you. This is not a waste of time. They are what I would call a leisurely quality listen. I can listen for long periods whether on my Samsung Galaxy S8 (Spotify and Tidal) or my Astell & Kern Kann (Flac format and Tidal streaming). On the Kann I prefer using these to my Bowers & Wilkins PX. Money well spent.",
