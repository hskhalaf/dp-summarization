They care about being healthy, yet use Sucralose. They care about the future and serving to the masses, yet charge at a premium cost. My suggestion is, use 20% real sugar. If more sugar is needed, use organic stevia leaves. Lower the cost. Significantly lower the cost of the powder version. Sell multi serving bottles so less plastic is used. Only use recycled plastic. And, to think outside the box, sell glass bottles in some locations with a bottle filling service at similar cost.",

So I\u2019m not too concerned about that. But I still prefer non-GMO. Tried other flavors before but like this one the best.",

I would have expected it to have a strange flavor due to all the protein, vitamins, etc. contained within, but I am not getting that.

Even if the rest of my meals are less healthy, 20% of everything important is much better than none. My 3-yr-old daughter loves this stuff, but we usually give her the strawberry flavor as it is not as favored by the adults.",

I like that it's not too sweet, that it has a wide array of nutrients compared to common protein drinks, and seems to fit the bill as a genuine meal replacement. Great for busy days at work until I can finally eat something substantial (No, I won't be living off of Soylent alone).",

The ingredients list is so tiny on the bottles it is difficult to read. Sucralose is known to cause asthma flares in sensitive individuals. It would be nice to know what ingredients are genetically engineered. The cocoa flavor is palatable but not the most chocolate like flavor. It will help fill you up but wouldn't recommend to diabetics.",

They do taste much better the longer they are chilled. So, just some advise. But, overall it's a great way to get to work whilst passing McDonalds, etc and It pulls double duty fills you up a bit and gets rid of that thirsty feeling in the morning.",

That stated, even the coffee flavored one was acceptable to my taste buds. The vanilla and chai are close in how much I like them. That covers all three flavors in the variety pack.

These things really are irresistible. If you're trying to use them to lose weight, just be aware they are probably more tempting than the chocolate cake in the fridge.
