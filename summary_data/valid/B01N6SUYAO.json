Very comfortable, light weight, sized as expected. I am usually SUPER picky about buying shoes and wear them until they fall apart (and beyond). I have to admit, this was a lot better than going to the store and the shoes are all I expected (thank goodness).",

I own many Skechers, usually buying the Ultra's for comfort, but they no longer had any Ultra's in my size so I took a chance on a different Skechers shoe and I couldn't be happier with this one. They are as comfortable as my Skecher Ultra's at half the price. I normally buy size 11.5 but I had to get size 12 in these, so I would suggest ordering a half size up. You won't be disappointed in the comfort of these shoes.",

I've had shoes in the past where something didn't feel 100% right and so I gave them a chance to \"break in\" - sometimes it would settle and feel comfortable, sometimes not. These shoes are very comfortable and provide great heel cushioning for running/jogging. They're also stylish enough to wear to work.",

But wearing them for a good 12+ hours every day on a 2 week trip I had no problems whatsoever, very happy with my purchase. Be aware of climate though, they are breezy which is nice in warmer weather but cold toes when I was in colder areas.",

That's 18 months which I suppose isn't too bad. Still, I would call them a $25 shoe as opposed to $52. If I wore them normally, I am sure they wouldn't have made six months.
