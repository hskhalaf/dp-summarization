The display will flicker significantly when I go to open the laptop or tilt the screen in any way. Considering I bought the warranty through Amazon, I am thankful, but this is absolutely ridiculous a product I originally considered high quality is already failing after a couple of months of use.",

Demanding games seem to bow down to its processor and graphics card. My cons are few but must be known: the gamma sometimes appears darker than a desktop. The red glow, while very cool at first, becomes annoying, especially when trying to sleep. The sharp edges are indeed sharp and I'm at a loss as to why they did this. That being sad, it's an awesome budget laptop. I run Witcher 3 (a very demanding beast) on all high and it never loses frame rate. Very happy with this purchase.",

I have had 0 issues with it at all. The only complaint I see people having is it only has a 256 ssd which is enough for me just to play games on. It has a spot to add another drive although it does not come with mounting hardware. I believe i read somewhere you can order the mounting hardware directly for amazon to add another drive.",

The screen isn't the best quality, but it does well in low light conditions. The keyboard is a saving grace since it lights up. Should have a CD-drive and a HDD drive included to improve its selling value to \"older\" customers. Also, other laptops of similar price come with the HDD already installed. Pretty solid book though. design is nice and robust. I don't feel like I'm going to break the thing just by toting it around for daily use.",

      "text": "This laptop is getting very bad reviews mostly because Acer is not including the cable and HDD bracket to add a HDD (which is basically necessary if you want to play games with it). To add one, you can buy the cable ( and use another laptop bracket to hold the HDD in position (I used one from an older Asus but my guess is that almost any bracket would fit). I hope that the pictures are self-explanatory on how to do this. ***UPDATE*** Just installed the HDD in the new kit that Acer sent me. It now sits beautifully and securely. Thank you for great customer support and for listening to us. 6 stars!!",

Its hits all the points: Fast start-up, great graphics (I mean really, it ran Warframe at 250 fps the first time i opened it. Had to set a limit lol), reasonable battery life (because nobody needs more than 6 hours unplugged, and gaming should only be done near a power source so it works out such that you're not paying for needless battery life) and its powerful (I ran all my games at once to test it, and between Minecraft, Overwatch, Warframe and Killer Instinct and it only lagged very slightly). I'm so glad I put off my first gaming PC until now!",
