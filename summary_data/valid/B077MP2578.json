The first few are cut all the way through, even through the back of the adhesive, followed by about one row of properly cut stickers and they progressively become uncut as the page goes.

    "title": "Silhouette America Portrait 2 Vinyl Cutting Machine",
    "description": "The Silhouette Portrait is an electronic cutting machine for personal use. Like a home printer, it plugs into your PC or Mac with a simple USB cable. However, instead of printing, it uses a small blade to cut paper, cardstock, vinyl, fabric, and other material up to 8 inches wide and 10 feet long. The Silhouette Portrait 2 features Bluetooth technology (US, Canada, EU only) and is compatible with Silhouettes new AutoBlade. The machine also has the ability to register and cut printed materials and is PixScan compatible. The Silhouette Portrait 2 also has a higher 2 mm clearance, so it is compatible with the deep-cut blade.",
