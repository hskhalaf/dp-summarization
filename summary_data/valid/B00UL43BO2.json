Hinge screws promptly pulled out of the wood frame. It took a lot of WD40 and muscle to loosed the hinge and My husband re-drilled the hinge fitting. The wood of the frame appears very soft; screws went in way to easy. Bottom line we repaired the mirror, it is working right now, but how disappointing to give a defective present to your MOTHER IN LAW. Mirror has made in USA sticker; this is not a good endorsement for American craftsmanship and quality control. And, no, I would not recommend",

Handy that it has a mirror on the outside when closed. Great views from all angles when opened. Fairly easy to hang on the wall with the right tools (level, power drill/screwdriver, hammer). Will get Velcro strip to put on bottom back to keep mirror from moving when opening and closing. It comes with over the door hangers, but I did not use these.",

You will need a medium size Phillips screwdriver but the holes are pre-drilled so it's super easy. If you wanted to attach to wall, there's even an enclosed template to ensure accurate placement as well as anchors if you need them. Everything was very well packaged. The client's been very satisfied with this product. After reading reviews, I was concerned about the quality, especially regarding the hinges coming off. That has not happen with this one. Wondering if quality varies among the various colors/finishes? We ordered the white one. It is very sturdy. Highly recommend!",

The mirrors hang on the back of my bedroom door. Closing the door with any speed results in it coming off the door and then slamming back against it. I may move it to the less convenient but less used hall door. It's a great idea in concept but I wish I'd saved the money and just bought a single panel mirror.",

They put the wrong panel as the top panel, so when it is completely closed, (i.e. the three folding layers are closed on top of each other) it shows a black felt surface, rather than the fourth mirror. apparently no-one bothered to check it after assembly. it is pretty heavy and I cannot re-wrap and put back in the tight carton to send back.",
