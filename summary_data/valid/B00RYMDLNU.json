All three are excellent and no one would be disappointed with any of them, but for us the Carsons had an extra brightness and clarity to them that gave them the edge over the Monarchs. And of course the price will keep you smiling. I thought the \"BinoArmor Deluxe Carrying Case\" was an irritation at first, but I've grown to like the design and found it handy in the field.",

So, after using these the last month plus, I have to say the lens quality is excellent, great in low light, eye cups are easy to adjust and overall weight with case is very nice considering the package. I would recommend these to birders or any general use. Great value and quality.",

Since these aren't in local stores I purchased on Amazon and decided to pit them against others in Cabela's. I would have to say based on what I found focusing on various things in the store, these were better than Vortex Diamonback and Nikon Monarchs. The FOV is misleading because my 10X's were giving me more than most of the lower power binoculars. I also found close focus is much less than the MFG gives and measured it about 6'. I love everything they come with including the case/holder the way it's engineered. It's my opinion they really really shine in low light conditions.",

After researching several bird watching web sites I found that the Carson 3D series were highly rated in a price range I can afford. After receiving these binoculars in a very prompt fashion, they are far better than I anticipated and will be ordering another pair in the near future. Highly recommend these.",

      "text": "I did not even know this brand until I did some research in order to buy binoculars for hunting. Reviews always came up at or close to the top of their price range even when pitted against Nikon and Leupold. Mind you this is not a Swarovski or a Leica. However in the $250 to $400 range, it is an excellent product. One review stated that the price must have been artificially kept low vis-a-vis what you are getting in order to promote the name (again I had no idea who Carson was). I admit that they are incredibly clear. They are very rugged and very light . I would highly recommend them for hunting, nature viewing, bird watching, etc.",
