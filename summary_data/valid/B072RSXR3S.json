So, the search was on for a new spray to replace it.. and this one fit the bill. I got one bottle and used it - had no trouble with the cats, and it wasn't as strong as the cat litter deodorizing powders I was using from Arm & Hammer. Happy cats + not-so-smelly litterbox = happy cat parents. Now if they would have a solution for the bombs they drop in the litterbox...",

Most sprays have a fragrance that doesn't cover up the smell but \"combines with it\", so now it smells like lemony poop! This Simple Solution spray really cleans and gives the areas cleaned a pleasant \"clean\" smell, what a concept! Wish they had it in a gallon concentrated jug--I'd buy it!",

It's lightly scented, which is nice not being overly powerful and perfumed. You can spray it right on the clumping litter and it won't clump.",
