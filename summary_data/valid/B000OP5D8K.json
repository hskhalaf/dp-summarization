      "text": "Not sure how they classify this as a \"dry\" oil. It's primary ingredients by volume are all oils and it certainly feels like it. Other dry oils I have used either soak in more quickly or actually go on dryer. This is like taking olive oil and pouring it on your body. Felt greasy and wet even after having it on for a couple of hours. For those that are concerned by ingredients you should read the other reviews. On a positive note it does smell great.",
