      "text": "Started my puppy out on Purina Pro Plan after switching from what the breeder used. Puppy did great on Pro Plan, but I also wanted to try the Purina ONE Smartblend at this great price, even though the Amazon price for Pro Plan is still very good. So far, she loves the ONE and her poops are still good. Another bonus is that this is available at the local grocery store if I need some in a hurry. Only drawback initially is that she made a mess around her bowl trying to get to the chewy morsels! Will decide after this bag if we need to go back to Pro Plan.",

It also appears they require less to satisfy their appetites. I hope it's available when I need to order more!",
