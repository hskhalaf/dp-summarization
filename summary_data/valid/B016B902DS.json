Screen res is in the lower spectrum but it's good enough for a screen this size. Highly recommended if you can get it <200.",

Many apps work offline and anyway also win or Mac laptop without connection lost many features. Looking for a chromebook my decision was between acer r11, asus flip and Toshiba. Coming from a convertible my choice is acer for two simple things, like more than asus opening system and cause I read about asus wifi problem. 2 gb isn't a problem for now, chromeos run faster and smooth without lag. Great pad, great touchscreen and keyboard disabled when you're in tablet mode. Love this device. Sorry for my English",

Flips to a tablet mode sort-of which is really nice. Well built. Very negative: Seriously uderpowered. The 2GB of RAM is insufficient for serious tasks, and that makes me wonder what's going to happen when the Android apps come to the Chromebooks. How will this machine handle them? Yes, you can do basic stuff, but if you're planning to use it with 10 tabs open with serious multitasking, forget it. It's a nice toy for a secondary machine, but because of all the above I don't feel comfortable recommending it.",

As one of the few chrome books to get initial android apps supported, I am seriously concerned on how the R11 is going to cope. Just with a couple of tabs open, the 2GB RAM is maxed out, even with swap enabled, performance is poor at ALL times. Acer have 4GB ram versions of these R11 devices, but you have to import them from America.... It made me laugh when I compared the C720 to the R11, and found out that the C720 has much better specs and performance overall.... don't waste your money, avoid this device.",
