The first 2 new routers I tried use \"Mesh\" technology, which means that in order to configure them, you have to use a smartphone running Android 8.0 or above, which mine doesn't. Before I bought this one, I asked on Amazon Q&A if you could use a PC (Web browser) to configure this one for security, and 2 people said \"YES\". That was good enough for me!

Same deal, setup via a webpage or WPS. The Linksys took 5 minutes, TP-link more like 10. Uptime? I have to reset the TP-link multiple times a day, or the WiFi won't connect any client. Linksys?
