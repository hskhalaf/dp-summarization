He also replies if you use his name which is awesome. His facial movements make you feel like he's talking to you, which is kind of creepy. The only thing I can compare the way it talks to is that Dinosaur in the Natural Museum of History in London, just much smaller and less scary. Finally, I am forever grateful for the off switch. Thank you for giving this toy an off switch so I don't just have to pray he stops.",

As a added bonus it is a fun toy to mess with the dog with as it reacts when the dog barks. Cons:. It says on the box over 100 sounds, it has no where close, it's very repetitive. The voice volume is very low. It comes with batteries but mine were dead so had to immediately change them.",
