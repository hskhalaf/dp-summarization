I got this pole saw and a ladder and trimmed them with easy. The saw gets a bit warm but I give it a few minutes between fronds and I didn't have any issues. This saw has paid for itself in the first 10 min of use. I like that the blade articulates, makes cutting much easier.",

      "text": "Nothing super special about this device. It's a pole chain saw, maybe a bit underpowered, but it worked for a month or two. Then the mechanism that adjusts chain tension started to go and the chain started jumping. It was annoying to put the chain back on during every use, but I managed. Today the screw that adjusted tension came completely out and is somewhere in the brush next to my garage. It's a specialty part that I can't replace, so I'm going to end up replacing the entire unit with a different model/brand.",

I have a gas chainsaw also but this is great for limbing and small trees and other small jobs. Much lighter and easier to use than the heavy gas saw.",

It\u2019s easy to do with the supplied wrench/screwdriver. The new chain stretches and will jump off the motor. 2) Check the oil level frequently. It uses quite a bit of oil to lubricate the chain.

My old Remington had broken oil pump lid and the extension coupling knob which failed on 2nd year even I used it only 2-3 times for trimming my trees during the spring season. For the past 10 yrs I was tired of manually applying oil on chain. I also drilled multiple holes on pole to hold the extension until I could not stand with it anymore. I don't know whether the new Remington model has improved but this Sun Joe beats every feature of my old Remington such as a quick tight lock extension, adjustable saw head downward...",

The Remington would always get unplugged at the end of the pole where the saw disconnects so I\u2019d need to take it down several times to plug it in again, even though I taped it together. Also like the lever to make the pole longer, again much better than the Remington. 8 amp is the way to go. Lots of power.",
