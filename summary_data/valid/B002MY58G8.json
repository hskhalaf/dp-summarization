She\u2019s 65lbs and she fits well with the extra bed inside. So far I haven\u2019t used it as a bicycle trailer, but I bought the extra kit to convert it into a stroller as well. Took her for her first walk in it this weekend and she absolutely loved it. I am looking forward to using it a lot this spring/summer!",

I recommend a professional bicycle maintenance technician to install the hitch if you have repetitive stress injury or inflammation in your hands. It needs to be seated very well. Bicycles do have a tow weight limit so purchasers may not be able to tow large or multiple dogs, even when a trailer is rated higher.",

(45lb Husky/Shepard/Collie mix) It took a 5 minute 'introduction' ride when we first got it for her to understand what was going on. After that, we rode for about 4 hours with no issues. easy to maneuver and plenty of options for ventilation, storage. we loved it so much we bought the stroller attachment a month later. our dog is 12- and on long hikes in flat areas, it's nice to go out long, and if she gets tired, put her in the stroller for the return!",

Can't say that he loves it yet but he'll get there. We did a our first tandem rally and completed about 40 road miles totals for the weekend. Had absolutely no problems. We did buy a memory foam insert to absorb some of the bumps. He sits comfortably inside and unless we are climbing you hardly feel the extra weight. We haven't done much ridding with the screen open yet since he is new to the cart but the chin rest is going to work out really well for him.",

To place the dog(s) inside hook the leash the the HARNESS--NOT COLLAR- and off you go. am jut getting them used to it, but I see it working out very well. EXCELLENT QUALITY AND VERY STURDY.

You can read it at [...] I think for most people who want to take their dog up to the park, go for a ride around the block a few times, or other moderate to light usage that this trailer will work just fine. The build quality is decent and the price is right. It is, however, a bit on the heavy side, tends to tip your bicycle, makes your bicycle handle strangely, pretty much requires the 'optional' kickstand and isn't really suitable for any \"long\" rides (say, 20 miles or more).",

I'm very upset considering this was her 1 st ride in it and I was hoping the parts were made to handle a dog of her size as stated in the summary paragraph for this item. This happened within the 1st 20 minutes of her ride although I had her out the entire day we spent 3 hrs riding. Is there cost effective way to replace the carriage material???",

One safe way for a dog to be able to run alongside its bicycling owner is via the use of the Buddy hands free dog leash connector, which is a safe and simple way to connect one's dog to a bike.

Upon receiving it, simply remove it from the box, fold up both side walls, move the interior cross bar arm, which is located along the roof, into place and lock the crossbar with the included silver detent pin. \n\nNow all that is left is attaching the wheels. The side wheels are quick release wheels which will attach or release by simply pushing the center axle button and either pushing on to attach or pulling off to remove. Finally the tow bar arm is attached at the front by first removing the front locking pin, inserting the tow bar into the front reception tube, then passing the locking screw through the bottom set of holes, repositioning the nut on the opposite side, then finally flipping the silver lever back to secure the locking pin into place. \n\nThe small black bike hitch at the opposite end of the tow bar should be removed in order to be installed on the bike axle (or hitch adapter, if using the trailer with special bikes such as those with breezer dropout, internal hub gear, recumbent bikes, or others). Then the tow bar arm can be reconnected to the bike hitch.\n\nReady to use the trailer for another purpose, this time at home? The trailer easily converts to a crate for long car rides or home use by removing the wheels.\n\nThe overall product width of 30.5\" is wide enough to be roomy for your dog(s) but still narrow enough to fit through most standard doorways.\n\nUPGRADED FEATURES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:\nLarge rear pouch and pocket for storage * Lightweight aluminum alloy frame allows for easier towing\n * Padded headrest for your dog at the front opening\n * Large rear pouch and water bottle pocket\n * Stainless steel spokes and hubs\n * Reflective striping on front and sides\n * Removable rain screens for side windows\n * Quick release wheels\n * Side supports keep your dog from leaning into rotating wheels\n\nWHERE WILL YOU DOGGYRIDE TODAY?\n * Colors: Outdoors Green/Grey, Urban: Brick Red/Black\n * Dog size: maximum 26 in/65 cm shoulder height\n * Loading capacity: 110 lbs/45 kgs\n * Overall product weight: 30 lbs\n * Dimensions when folded flat: 31.5\" L x 21\" W x 4\" H\n * Tire size: 20\" quick release wheels\n * This product meets or exceeds ASTM safety standards\n * This trailer includes a safety flag and reflectors for added visibility and safety\n\nFold and store your Novel trailer when not in use",
