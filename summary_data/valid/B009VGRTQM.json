      "title": "Excellent Micro Shredder, Mediocre CD Destruction",
      "text": "This shredder does an excellent job at shredding paper products into oblivion. It runs tirelessly. The noise level is a little higher than I expected, but not terrible. As a bonus, it comes with a small supply of bags and a 12 oz. bottle of shredder oil. It arrived packaged very well in the original box (this thing is HEAVY). It does have a cardboard waste bin which is a little disappointing, but it does appear to be fairly sturdy. Use of the bags would be highly recommended. One small downside I see, is that this shredder does not completely destroy CDs. It merely cuts them into approximately 3/8\" wide slivers. All in all, a sturdy and powerful shredder.",

Seems to easily shred everything I throw at it, and never stops working -- at least, until the bag is full of confetti and you have to change it out. Don't waste your money on those cheaper units -- they're just cheaper, and they're not worth the money you're spending on them. This one is the one you want to buy, unless you need an even larger heavier-duty model.",

This is a superb shredder, and effortlessly completes heavy duty jobs including CDS and gift cards in a fraction of the time of conventional home shredders.
