It is extremely light, incredibly breathable, and quite supportive.However, depending on your foot shape, these basketball shoes can either be very comfortable to wear or quite painful to play in. Because of this, many are saying that these are terrible for basketball but good for casual use. All in all, the Sublite Pro Rise is still a nice alternative to Nike and Adidas shoes, especially for its price.",

I like them, but after some foot steps the pain in my little toe was developed and sustained a day or two. I saw similar reviews from others here too. I guess the shoes are made light in the expense of the comfortableness like made by leather textile. Maybe that's because they are not broke in, but I didn't have the same experience with previous Nike BB shoes.",

However, the material that makes the shoe light weight also made it less than durable. Blew the side of the shoe out within three months of playing ball five days a week. That said, for the price I was very satisfied with this shoe. Would definitely buy it again. Runs 1/2 size small though, so calculate that in when ordering proper size.",

I have purchased several different Reebok shoes over the years and all have fit well except this one. It seems too narrow around the arch which caused blisters when I played with them. No other Reebok basketball shoe has ever done that. I'll try to continue breaking them in and see if the blisters stop but if not then I'll just have to use them as a casual walking shoe.",
