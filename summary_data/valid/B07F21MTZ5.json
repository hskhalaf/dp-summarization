It does indeed have more airflow than traditional masks...however, the snorkel release button broke on the first use. I'm not sure if it's a defect or what, but I pushed it in and heard a snap. For spending this kind of money, I would expect better quality. The valve on the snorkel was a bit finicky as well. It tended to cut off the air supply when breathing even moderately heavy. Like many other model masks, this one also has the problem with the shutoff valve sticking. By briefly exhaling it corrects itself, but again, at this price point I would expect better.",

Tips include: don't over tighten, don't have lotion on your face, use a little vaseline if there are small leaks. It's the best way to go though because you can breath normally and still talk under water. Love it!! Customer service with Wildhorn is amazing. We own so many of these masks and they are always quick to respond and assist.",

Not disappointed in anything. My first snorkel on my cruise was planned. The guides were impressed. The second snorkel opportunity was unexpected and I hadn't brought my Seaview 180\u00b0.

This one stays out of the water much better and allows me to snorkel comfortably for hours! It's easy to assemble or disassemble to store in the convenient bag that is included! I would recommend this to anyone that likes to snorkel and hates breathing through their mouth in the old style snorkel. This is the way of the future!",

It functioned perfectly from the start because it was effectively designed to avoid common snorkeling problems.",

Quality of mask is very high as well and comes with a protective bag.",

      "text": "My husband and I went to Bora Bora for our honeymoon and used the V2s to snorkel. They were great, we didn't have any leakage, no fogging of the lens, it does take a minute to get used to breathing, but once we adjusted we forgot we had them on and enjoyed the view. The main point about snorkeling is you don't want to constantly be thinking about your equipment, you just want something simple, easy to use, so you can enjoy the sights, this did it for us.",

    "rating": 4.3,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "FLOWTECH ADVANCED AIR INTAKE SYSTEM- Breathe naturally and comfortably through your nose and mouth. Flowtech has two chambers and 4 intake valves to allow air to circulate in and out freely. Using one-way valves and a separate breathing chamber ensures fresh air is always circulating through the mask. Flowtech provides 50 percent easier work of breathing compared to other full face snorkeling masks on the market. This combined with safe levels of CO2 make this the best full face snorkel mask",
      "DESIGNED AND TESTED IN THE USA - The Seaview 180\u00b0 V2 snorkeling mask was created by our team of experienced product designers and engineers. Through meticulous iteration we improved the airflow, visibility, fit, camera mount and safety of the full face snorkeling mask experience. The Seaview V2 launched on Kickstarter in 2018 and was backed by thousands of people. We used 3rd party experts to measure the airflow and CO2 elements of the mask to ensure a safe user experience for all.",
      "IMPORTANT SIZING TIPS- Full face snorkel mask adult sizing is important to get right. Be sure to measure from the bridge of your nose (between your eyes) to the tip of your chin. Measure along the side of your nose, not over the top. Follow the sizing chart. If you are in between sizes, it's usually best to select the smaller size. For the best seal, you may need to tweak the placement of the mask on your face until you have the most comfortable fit. Be sure to test in a pool before your trip.",
      "ENHANCED FEATURES- The patent pending angled tube design allows for less restricted, two-way airflow. The angled snorkel tube stays above water more easily and gives your head more freedom of movement. The viewing area is 20 percent larger to give you more visibility. The camera mount now swivels and is located near the chin to stay under water more easily. The ergonomics and fit are much improved. Lastly, the additional one-way valves and separate breathing chamber help to reduce fogging.",
      "PROPER USE- Full face snorkel masks are designed for leisure surface snorkeling. Serious freediving is not recommended because you cannot equalize. Strenuous swimming while wearing any type of snorkel, including full face designs, is not recommended. A strenuous swim requires friction-less breathing. Be sure to take regular breaks while snorkeling. Also follow the buddy rule: never snorkel alone. Become familiar with your gear before you go. Try it in a pool and make sure it fits and seals."
