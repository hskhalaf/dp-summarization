That\u2019s sad because I really have no bone to pick or axe to grind with the moths but some casualties are necessary to get my pool back. Twice a week I dump the basket into my chicken coop.

I cleaned the trap today and there were thousands of mosquitos. The trap was halfway filled and it's only been about five days of use. This is really something. Easy to assemble and clean. Make sure you clean the trap away from anything you don't want to get contaminated. There were definitely some live bugs still flying around when I opened the trap. I was sad to see three ladybugs, but I got them out and onto nearby plants. I am really impressed by this. Highly recommended.",

Additionally, when trying to return this item, the \"ship to\" address provided by the seller did not match UPS address records. It made it very difficult to find the correct shipping address.
