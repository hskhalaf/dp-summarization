How is a nap mat that I bought yesterday after one wash look like this? How is it suppose to last an entire year? I am extremely unsatisfied and want a refund. Not worth the money.

I was afraid the color would fade so I use the gentle cycle to tumble dry and hang dry the still damp mat. I don\u2019t see fading yet. Be sure to remove the pillow before washing.",

The pattern is so cute, but the colors quickly faded on the mat which is disappointing. It fit nicely over his sleep cot, but I still sent in a fitted crib sheet for the cot. The nap mat laid nicely over top of the cot.",

I have to loosely roll it up so they will come closer to lining up. It is cheaper than the Hi Sprouts one that i like much better but you get what you pay for.",

Folding it is simple and so is washing it. After the first wash, theres little cotton balls all around it, thats the only downside. But thick and good quality. Well worth the money.",
