The second one arrived 4 days later and had all of the correct parts. However, upon building it the igniter mechanism seemed loose and not well placed. It turned on once and then stopped functioning.",

I do not recommend spending this amount of money based on the cheap regulator. Furthermore, Blackstone stated that they do not warrant their grills if bought from Amazon and I would need to get any refund or replacement from them. This is after he asked me if I registered the product!! Unbelievable! He was NO help all! Next steps are to call the better business bureau.",

Mine came with several dents and scratches which the manufacturer knows you're not going to go through the troubles to return it, but then again, you get what you pay for. The burners didn't work that well. I had to use a lighter to jump-start it. Any light winds will make it a challenge to start the burners.

The black coating on the cooking surface has partially disappeared, but does not interfere with it's cooking use. Nothing is \"peeling\", the black is just going away in places. Also, the grease hole is too small, and the drip pan does not hold enough for the amount of drippings I have, so I attached a galvanized Steel Mud Pan that drywallers use for their spackling mud.

There is about a 3-4\" gap between the propane burners and the heat diffuser underneath the griddle. There is about a 1\" gap between the griddle and the frame. This leads to dramatic heat loss. Any slight breeze causes a significant drop in temperature. The design is extremely poor. The griddle does not heat up to an appropriate level. It will cook a 1/4\" thick burger in about 40 minutes. There are also numerous cold spots on the griddle. Even on the center of the cooking surface there are areas that will not get hot. I would avoid this product.",

That means I have to move the tank seperately from the grill; which is on casters. The cooking surface is supposed to be \"pre-seasoned\" but I didn't trust it so I re-seasoned it before using it. It's getting there but just take it easy and treat it like any other steel (or cast iron) cooking surface (skillet). Also, watch out for discolorization (rust) in humid areas of the country and keep it both oiled and covered when not cooking.",

Unfortunately when I opened it up yesterday I noticed parts were missing. The box didn\u2019t look to have been tampered with but once I payed everything out I was missing 2 wheels and other items. It looks like maybe those wheels and other items should have been in a separate box inside the large box but the only other box had the drip tray. Very disappointed as this weekend I couldn\u2019t wait to cookout with my family. Not sure what to do now.",

Only downside is the cleanup, but invest in some bar mop towels. That will save you on paper towels. I use one towel to cleanup and another dedicated to oil when done. Get a dome to cover food while cooking. Also get foil drip pans. I bought several dollar store lasagna foil pans to put cooked food in and sit right on grill to stop direct heat. I use cookie sheet to hold my tools to keep grease cleanup minimal.",

The people at Blackstone must have listened because they redesigned the cook-top with the grease is now being diverted towards the back of the grill, and straight into a grease catcher. I haven't tested it yet,but it looks like it will be a big improvement over the previous model. See pictures. Happy grilling!.",

We then launched the 36\u201d BLACKSTONE griddle that is still popular for backyard cooking and which brings families and friends together for fun and food. Our spectrum of gas griddles and gas grills are popular for backyard living, a BBQ, recreational cooking or commercial grade cooking. Since then, the company has expanded dramatically and created a brand new look as well as a large new line of durable rugged innovative and portable cooking innovations including an outdoor pizza oven and the ever so easy to transport and set-up DASH \u2013 and our products will last a lifetime. By using the latest technologies available and complementing them with our own innovations, we feel we have the leading edge on the market in our categories. Our products are designed and engineered in the USA by people who are avid users and live to entertain outside \u2013 at home, in the tailgater parking lot or just about anywhere.
