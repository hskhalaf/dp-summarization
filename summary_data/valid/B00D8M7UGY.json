Any time you hold you mat not by the straps, the straps will adjust on you and sometimes fall off. When they do fall off, the loop that was created to go around your mat has now collapsed and depending on what's in your hands, it's hard to open back up again to go around your mat.

The ratings were strong and I'm happy with my Manduka Pro mat and my Manduka yoga strap. Compared to other straps - this one does not stay closed tightly. It's not that it falls apart immediately, but more that it doesn't stay secure as you pick up and put down the mat. (or perhaps, put it in your car or set it down in your office) Other straps stay together tighter and won't come loose on you. Manduka really dropped the ball (or the mat, as you will probably drop your mat with this strap.)",

If the mat tilts while on your shoulder, it'll likely slip out of the loop and you drop your mat in the mud...like I did. Just something to be aware of, but like all Manduka products, it's great quality and I'll continue to use it.",
