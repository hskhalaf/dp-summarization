This happens without taking it on or off, just sitting there. The Camco warranty says 2 years, but only the first year is 100% the second year is pro-rated based on full MSRP. So the warranty is essentially worthless after the first year, which amazingly they have perfected the product to survive at least that long. I live in California where the sun is rather intense, so your mileage may vary.",

I'm losing faith in Amazon and will never buy anything from Camco. They appear to be plain dishonest",

The cover seems well made though I think it's a little over sized for what they tell you. I bought the 30-32 foot cover for a 30 foot motor home and there is about four extra feet of length. The tie downs seem good...kind of a funky system and they should have included nylon cinch fittings for the sides. Probably the best thing I could say about it is that my wife and I installed it in about 40 minutes...start to finish. No sniping. No yelling.

I sent my review, and expressed my dissatisfaction directly to Camco via their \"Contact\" page on the Camco web site. I never got any response from them. So clearly, they do not care !

The only problem I really see is after reading reviews it seemed that the cover ran a little small so I bought the 32-34' for my 32' and it was actually big. The side material is thin as allot commented but if you don't get rough with it I think you'll be fine",

You tie the elatisized straps to the cover itself then bend the felt covered metal end to \"hook\" onto the bottom. Mine is flat under so \"hooking\" is harder. It has mesh panels under the flap.

Which required me to pull the cover down from time to time, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It was inexpensive, but not really built to last from my experience.",

Make sure you cover up any corners that can rub against the cover from the wind because it will cause a hole. I did not put enough padding on a corner and I have a 1\" by1\" worn spot, no big deal I'll just gate a patch. The cover took a good beating from the wind and snow.",

Ours looks like a three year old did it. We had to gather all the excess material and use bungee straps to hold it. All in all the quality appears to be as described.",

Anyone who can't figure this system out should not be allowed to walk and chew gum at the same time. The bottom connection to the trailer is a fabric wrapped metal strap that is very bendable. You simply bend into a fish hook profile and hook around the bottom part of your trailer. Ours held tight through the entire UP MI winter with several high wind episodes. This spring it looks brand new still. Highly recommend.",
