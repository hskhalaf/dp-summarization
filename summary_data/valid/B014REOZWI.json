I wasn\u2019t sure at first what was going on and what product what\u2019s causing this benefit. I researched Holy Basil and grey/white hair. I found that one benefit is that it helps restore an enzyme in the hair follicle that helps neutralize white and Grey hair. It has to do with Hydrogen peroxide being neutralized in the hair follicle to keep from bleaching. I have noticed this benefit very strongly. Very cool!",
