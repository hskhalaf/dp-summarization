I need to eat certain products due to digestive problems, food allergies, etc. I have finally found a wonderful winner in this Trader Joe's Sunflower Seed Butter. It's better than peanut butter (that's a given since peanut butter can irritate even those without a peanut allergy) but I was shocked at how much more easily I digested this Trader Joe's Sunflower Seed Butter than almond butter. For anyone out there with gastroparesis, colon transit issues, reflux, celiac, etc. I'd say give it a try. I've searched forever plus it spreads very easily so a little goes a long way!",
