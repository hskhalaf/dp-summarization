I haven't used it in the daytime, but one absolutely could without feeling overly sticky or greasy. Have not noticed any fading with this. My skin is in pretty good shape, but I have been battling one small, light spot of hyperpigmentation for a while that OTC hydroquinones, kojic acid, alpha arbutin, or even Rx tretinoin cream has not faded.",

Now I dont know what to do with this brand new tube. So yeah, for those with sensitive skin, I'd think twice about this. Non-returnable products are just not worth the money or the risk.",

I have extremely sensitive skin (mainly to fragrance) and this is not irritating at all. Im a Flight attendant and wear this in crew rest on long haul flts.",
