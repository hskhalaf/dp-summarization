You\u2019ll end up with a boot loop on the following message: SteamOS is attempting to recover from a fatal error If that happens you may try the following steps. The goal is to launch the Steam client manually from a desktop session and let it repair itself. 1. At early boot press Esc repeatedly to reach boot menu; 2. Choose Advanced options, and then the first (recovery mode) entry available; At this stage you should be in front of a root prompt like root@steamos:~# 3.If not done already, create a password for desktop user: passwd desktop and enter the password twice. 4. Disable automatic login for login manager lightdm: sed -i -e \"s/^autologin-user=/#\\0/\" /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/20_steamos.conf 5. Reboot and login as desktop user with the previously set password. Note: If you get an error right after login, see this 6. Open a terminal and launch Steam as steam user: sudo su -c \"steam\" steam Then let the Steam client fix itself. 7. When done, exit Steam and restore automatic login for lightdm: sed -i -e \"s/^#\\(autologin-user=\\)/\\1/\" /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/20_steam",
