I CAUTION THAT PYLE TENDS TO THROW WATTAGE NUMBERS AROUND AND BUMP THEM UP IN EVERYTHING THEY MANUFACTURE, SO DO NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBERS. I DOUBT THIS SUB CAN TAKE 1000 WATTS RMS WITHOUT EXPLODING, BUT FEED IT 200 CLEAN WATTS AND THE BASS IS GOOD. IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET, THIS SUB WILL ADD THE MISSING BASS YOU NEED IN YOUR SOUND SYSTEM. Update 7/10/15...finally put it into service...it was popping and could not handle power...removed it from the car and going with another brand of sub.",

It's weak when it comes to low bass. The center plastic is what ruins the subwoofer. It makes a nasty rattle sound when it is hitting. It's not the wires behind the sub nor the box. Get a sub other than Pyle cause these subs aren't that great.",

One of my subwoofers was broken, the back wasnt eaven attached to the sub. The other one i bought was dented beyond abel to put it in a subwoofer box. And if your orders broke they cant replace it because it was apart of a deal. Its prolbly cheaper for me to try to fix it myself.",

I can't believe how it THUMPS and how good the quality of sound is. My Ram 1500 quad cab is booming. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good quality sound or for those who just want hard hitting (thumping) bass. I can't wait till I get another one. I can only imagine what two of them will sound like. TWO THUMBS UP!!!",
