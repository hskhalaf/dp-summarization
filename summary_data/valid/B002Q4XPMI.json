It removes every brand of mascara, eye liner and shadow I've worn without having to rub my eye lids raw. Waterproof mascara is more difficult, but I don't usually wear it because it's harsh on lashes. I also wear soft contact lenses and I don't have any issues with this gentle, non-irritating formula. There aren't enough words to describe how much I love this product. I'm never without it. There are no substitutes. I won't use anything else.",
