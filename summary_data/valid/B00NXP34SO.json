No setup required for volume adjustment or sound selection. Just plug and play. I also would like to point out that the three receivers were sync'd in perfect time so that if you have multiple receivers within earshot, the chimes sound at the exact same time and sound as one. I placed one upstairs, one downstairs and one in my woodworking shop (an 80ft distance). The tone easily cuts through my shop power tool noises and loudly played music.
