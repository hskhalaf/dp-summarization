I have yet to really use the block yet, but the cd that comes with this kit is awesome. I use it about twice a week. I use the one for daily use, which lasts 20 minutes. Every time I use it I FEEL AMAZING. Within the first 5 minutes my back pops and feels so much better. I am becoming more flexible and don't feel intimidated at all by the workout. I recommend to anyone starting out that doesn't feel confident in trying yoga.",

I have a background in dance and know the importance of correct posture and position while stretching. I also found the block and straps helpful for using them to increase flexibility. The only star I did not give for sturdiness is that the mat has to be carefully rolled up and stored or the end of the mat might start bend a little of out shape.",

It\u2019s still possible to do yoga (and i use it daily), but you have to be very careful in some poses not to injure yourself. It also had quite a strong smell when it arrived, but its fine now. Not the best, but works for my 2 months trip where I didn\u2019t have my yoga equipment. :)",

He mostly told you what to do by naming the poses, which didn't help me at all. There was no real discussion as to how the pose should feel so I knew whether I had myself positioned correctly.

It has lines printed on it for alignment, I think, but one of the four prints have crooked lines so it defeats the purpose LOL. The others are fine though. Great, vibrant colour.

The block and strap that complement the mat aren't made of cheaper material, so you save A LOT of money by buying the kit as opposed to individual pieces. The DVD is alright. I'll probably replace it with a different one but for now it does exactly what I want it to- get me into doing some basic yoga! Not to mention that you get a pretty good workout/stretch from it. My arms/legs felt like jello after doing the daily routine for the first time. Overall GREAT BUY.",
