Update: it's officially fallen apart apart and cracked all the way through after nine weeks of gentle usage. I never stretched them past the point of the width of my head. If somebody said something to me I slid them forward instead of pulling them outwards to be able to listen. Very very disappointed. Will never purchase a product from this company again",

Everything range is clear in this set: highs, lows, and mid ranges. I listen to a wide range of music styles - from classical to rap and it all sounds good in this set. The only bad thing I can say about this set is that the sound is not so well insulated. If I'm listening to music in bed next to my wife as she sleeps, the sound is loud enough outside of the set to disturb her.",

I like bass but I don't like when headphones muddy the rest of the sound and these don't seem to do that. The build quality feels better than some reviews let on. One word of advice, I had a hard time pairing these with my phone. It wouldn't show up when scanning for Bluetooth devices. You need to turn the headphones on, then press Volume Up and Down at the same time to clear the last pairing from memory (which was done in the factory to test the headphones). After that they worked perfectly.",

Anyway the BH-21\u2019s are definitely better than the BH-20\u2019s from a sound quality point of view so if you don\u2019t need them to swivel I\u2019d recommend skipping the BH-20 and going straight for the 21\u2019s.",

If you're looking for something in the same price range that sound better, consider any Jlab Bluetooth headphones. But if course, for the best quality, you'll have to spend a lot more.",

      "text": "I was skeptical of the sound quality because of the price and the material feels a little cheap but these sound about as good as my sony monitor headphone. Great bang for buck, love that they have the option to connect an aux cord incase you run out of battery. These might not impress an audiophile but for the majority of people they are great.",
