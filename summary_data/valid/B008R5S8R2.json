This is exactly what I needed for the cold nights since he doesn't sleep with a blanket. It a bit baggy on this mattress but the elastic is so secure I don't see it moving anywhere. I may buy a memory foam topper to fill in the extra material. All in all very excited for my little guy to habe a great night's sleep on this sheet!",

This feels great in the winter and you know your child is comfortable which is reassuring. It washes very well and always comes out looking as new. I have the gray color and it has not faded in the 6 months it has been in use. I wish they had more colors. At first I ordered Ecru which is supposed to be a brownish/cream color, but it was more of a yellow/cream so I sent it back and ordered the gray which works, but I wish they had a lighter solid gray.",

My only issue with the sheet is that it doesn't stretch large enough to securely go around the mattress. I imagine when he becomes more mobile, it will come out from around the mattress with his movement.",

      "text": "I really like this product. My baby was suffering from severely red cheeks from rubbing his face on regular cotton sheets. I got sheets to hopefully fix that problem. These sheets are extremely soft, almost velvet like. They have fixed my baby\u2019s red cheeks problem. My only complaint is that due to the velvet like material it holds onto moisture. If you have a baby that drools a lot you may run into issues with there being wet spots on the sheets. Overall though- good purchase.",
