I am very happy to support this company's mission in creating products that are both sustainable, made locally and eco-conscious. I just made my first batch of almond milk today and I must say that I yield so much more nut milk with this bag than I ever did with nylon bags!",

First, it is so much larger than the average ones. I mean REALLY larger! And the quality was noticeable from the moment I took it out of the packaging. When you really care about a product being sourced from 100% Organic materials, especially when it is touching the food you eat, you want what is being claimed. This one is truly the best nut milk bag I've ever purchased. Highly recommend for like-minded individuals.",

    "description": "Item Package Quantity:1| Size:12\" x13\"Hi, I'm Lena Mumma, a single mother & CEO of Eco Peaceful, LLC\nAfter watching several plastic documentaries, I was shocked at how plastic affects wildlife & humans. I decided to change my lifestyle. I started growing my own food to reduce plastic packaging & started a zero-waste organic, plastic-free business in 2012. My first product was a reusable organic nut milk bag since I could not find any bag that was without synthetics, even GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified bags are sewn with polyester threads. So, I had to learn sewing & how to run a business. We offer the best organic bags:\n\u2714\ufe0f ALL 100% ORGANIC: fabric, stitches, loop & drawstring made from 100% certified organic cotton, undyed & unbleached\n\u2714\ufe0f FDA & LFGB FOOD GRADE SILICONE BAND CLOSURE\n\u2714\ufe0f SEWN IN THE USA FROM ALL GOTS MATERIALS\n\u2714\ufe0f LARGE SIZE: 12\"x13\"\n\u2714\ufe0f ROUND CORNERS: for easier straining & cleaning\n\u2714\ufe0f PLASTIC-FREE PACKAGING:\nUSE FOR MAKING: hot or ice cold brewing coffee, loose tea, nut milks (almond milk, coconut milk...) celery juice, nut cheese, tofu, vegetable bouillon.
