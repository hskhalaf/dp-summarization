The package arrived promptly, I like that I was emailed to see how the product was doing for us and to let them know if we needed them. I removed one star because occasionally it doesn't grab properly and you have to shake it. This isn't often at all its happened like 4 or 5 times in a month of constant use.

Having a free hand while carrying helps immensely. Just watch for cross-winds if outside. It appears very well made. The only caveat for drywall is to make sure the tool surfaces are flat against the sheet before lifting. If the back plate is tilted, it will bite off the drywall. Other than that, this is an excellent hand tool.",
