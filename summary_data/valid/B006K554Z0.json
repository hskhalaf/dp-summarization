The battery life seems great as I just got back from a week long vacation and after snapping over 150 photos I still have almost a full battery. I am also very impressed with how great my pictures turned out, vivid colors and great contrast.",

It has Carl Zeiss lens and that makes a difference. I have a friend with almost the same camera but with Sony lens and I can notice how colors and details are shaper in this camera. Also, because of its reduce size and weight, it's perfect for travelers (even if you have to be careful not to let it fall). However, I've had that accident a couple of times, and the camera is strong enough to survive just with some scratches.",

The case is really nicely padded and even with the case the camera is still thin enough to fit in my dad's pocket.",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W650 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Camera OnlyThe Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W650 Digital Camera (Black) is ready for anything--its 16.1MP resolution guarantees excellent image quality and the sharp Carl Zeiss 5x wide-angle optical 25-125mm (equivalent in 35mm format) lens gives you a true wide-angle-to-telephoto range that's great for landscapes, parties, kids, portraits, etc. This little gem will always be there when you're ready to take a picture--it only weighs 3.8 oz (107.7 g) and fits in a shirt pocket (3.75 x 2.25 x 0.75\").The 3\" LCD monitor makes it easy to compose and view photographs, or the superb 1280 x 720 HD video. A Sweep Panorama mode makes it a snap to produce a truly impressive ultra wide-angle 360Deg. panoramic photo, even without a tripod and SteadyShot image stabilization plus sensitivity up to 3200 ISO means you can wave good-bye to blurry pictures, even in dim lighting situations.Friends and family will love the way they look in your photos when you're using the Smile Shutter (captures a smile the moment it appears on your subject's face), Anti-Blink (waits until eyes are open to take the picture) and Soft Skin (removes blemishes and wrinkles from faces in your pictures) modes. And, best of all, the W650 will do it all automatically--just press the shutter button in iAuto mode. Great pictures and videos, no stress or strain for you.\n\nWhats In The Box: \n\n\n\n * Battery (NP-BN)\n * Battery Charger\n * Multi USB Cable\n * Wrist Strap\n * Instruction Manual\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\nSONY CYBER-SHOT DSC-W650 16.1 MP DIGITAL STILL CAMERA \n\n * 720p HD movie mode\n   \n * \n * Sweep Panorama mode (up to 360\u00b0)\n   \n * \n * 16.1 megapixel plus a 3.0-inch LCD screen for easy viewing\n * Optical SteadyShot image stablization reduces blur\n * Picture Effect for more expressive photos\n   \n * \n * \n * iAuto mode automatically optimizes camera settings\n * Face Detection and Smile Shutter technologies\n * Anti-blink, Face Priority and Red-eye Reduction functions\n * Soft Skin mode reduces visible blemishes and wrinkles\n * iSCN detects 8 scene conditions and adjusts camera settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture brilliant HD video and 360 degree pictures. With a 16.1 megapixel sensor and 3.0-inch LCD, it\u2019s easy to view dazzling images. Optical Steady Shot Image stabilization reduces blur, while iAuto and Picture Effect modes allow you to get more creative with your photos. \n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n720P MP4 HD MOVIE MODE\n\nIn 720p MP4 movie mode the camera shoots 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps, a standard format when working with a PC. Users will create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac computer*. Once transferred to your computer and connected to the internet, you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube.\n\n\n\n\nSWEEP PANORAMA MODE (UP TO 360\u00b0) \n\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360\u00b0 full circle, the camera can take a variety of panoramic shots. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.\n\n\n16.1 MEGAPIXEL SUPER HAD CCD IMAGE SENSOR\n\nA powerful 16.1 megapixel 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 16.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19 inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots.\n\n\n3.0-INCH (230K DOTS) CLEAR PHOTO LCD DISPLAY\n\nGenerous 3.0-inch (230K dots) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp and natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight. \n\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT IMAGE STABILIZATION\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\n\n\nPICTURE EFFECT FOR MORE EXPRESSIVE PHOTOS\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects.\n\nINTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\n\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent AutoMode (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjust settings resulting in clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground, landscape shots, a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode.\n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY\n\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\n\nANTI-BLINK FUNCTION\n\nThe Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\n\nSOFTSKIN MODE\nSoftSkin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION (ISCN) MODE\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects seven different types of scenes and within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape and macro. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a signle shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light), immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\nNATURAL FLASH\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more life-like images.\n\nDYNAMIC RANGE OPTIMIZER\n\nStandard and Plus Dynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) uses a sophisticated algorithm to help recover shadows and highlights. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic constrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greateer optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing.\n\nSELF-PORTRAIT TIMER\nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self-portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture. \n\n*Movie Recording is limited to (29 min. segments)\n * \n * \n\n\nNP-FG1 InfoLITHIUM\u00ae G Type Rechargeable Battery\n3.6V typ. 3.4Wh (960mAh)\n\nNP-BN1 LITHIUM Ion N Type Rechargeable Battery \n3.6V typ. 2.3Wh (630mAh)\n\nNP-BX1 LITHIUM Ion X Type Rechargeable Battery \n3.6V typ. 4.5Wh (1240mAh)\n\nNP-FV50 InfoLITHIUM H-Series Rechargeable Battery \n6.8V typ. 6.1Wh (900mAh)\n\nNP-FG1 NP-BN1 NP-BX1 NP-FV100 DSC-HX200V DSC-HX30V DSC-HX20V DSC-HX10V DSC-H90 DSC-TX200V DSC-TX66 DSC-TX20 DSC-WX150 DSC-W690 DSC-WX70 DSC-WX50 DSC-W670 DSC-W650 DSC-W630 DSC-W620 DSC-W610 DSC-RX100 DSC-RX1",
