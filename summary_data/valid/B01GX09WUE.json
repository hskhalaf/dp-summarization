The smell of the leather is heavenly. I used some Wilson Pro Stock glove conditioner on this (three applications) and left it tied up around a ball for a couple of weeks. This broke it in further. I got the all brown version and the fur around the adjustment strap is so comfy. I\u2019m glad I spent a little bit extra and got a good quality glove. Don\u2019t hesitate. I\u2019d highly recommend this glove.",

      "text": "There's a lot to love about this glove. the leather is thick yet supple, and the glove is well padded. The velcro strap is also comfortable. There is however one (fatal?) flaw in the design; inside the thumb area there is a piece of leather that crosses just under the pad of my thumb. It's thick and it's a little irritating and uncomfortable. I'm not sure if this is something that will go away when it's \"broken in\" but I don't think it will; that peice of leather isn't going to get thinner or softer for a long, long time. I'm not sure if I'll be keeping this glove as a result of this problem.",

THE INSIDE of the glove is CHEAP VINYL! The place where you need natural breathable leather the most they used very cheap vinyl which means, 1. your hand is gonna start slipping around in sweaty slime and 2. the material will eventually breakdown and start to disintegrate. It's really a shame because it's truly a decent looking glove that works pretty well for quick plays. I really wanted to keep it but I know for sure the interior material is a big problem on hot days.",

However it has a big pocket so you shouldn\u2019t be catching on the palm. The toe is thinner (\u201cLiteToe\u201d) but I don\u2019t think it makes a huge difference.",

The first day the glove was very comfortable and relatively usable. I plan on oiling it and beating it with a 5/lb hammer a while, and I think it will get even better.
