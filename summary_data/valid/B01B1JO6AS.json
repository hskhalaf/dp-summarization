      "text": "My 2 year old asked for \"bad guy toys\" for Christmas so I chose several super villain figurines from the imaginext collection and they were a big hit! Doomsday is big and scary and superman's cape is actually fabric so it flys behind him. I actually planned to give this toy only 4 stars when it arrived because I was less than impressed with its \"punching\" action and awkward placement of the standing pad on his back, but my sons' (ages 2 and 4) immense enjoyment bumped it back up to a 5. Bottom line: It's sturdy and fun. If they're happy, I'm happy!",
