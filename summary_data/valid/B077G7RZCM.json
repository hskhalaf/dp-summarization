The base is actual wood, not some crappy wood substitute, and the top is quite heavy and solid. After screwing the pieces tightly, it doesn\u2019t wobble at all. My mom came over and asked where I got it and she was very surprised that it was so cheap. Other reviewers said you NEED two people to assemble, but I\u2019m a regular lady and I managed by myself. So don\u2019t be intimidated at the thought that it\u2019s extremely heavy or complicated.",

I know it's a dining room table...really smaller...a dinette. Amazon's inexpensive 4 drawer cabinet makes a perfect combination. Total $380, including computer table in \"L\" configuration - it's whole new office. Going to work is fun again.",
