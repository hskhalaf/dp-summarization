      "text": "I ordered this bike for Christmas for my very handsome husband and I to take rides around the neighborhood. It was a snap to put together, but that is because my highly intelligent husband put it together while I sat on the couch. Our first ride was fantastic, mostly because my highly capable husband was on the front doing all the work of steering and pedaling while I was sitting enjoying the view. We have taken it out about a dozen times and we love it. Very sturdy. Very good deal.",
