      "text": "this is my second monoprice select mini printer. my first one broke randomly stopped heating up the bed and nozzle. There wasnt any info online really especially for my issue, so be aware. Also monoprice refused to repair my first printer because it was past warranty. I even offered to pay for the repair service and they said they do not do repairs under any circumstances. Be aware that if you get this and it breaks you will not find anyone to fix it for you, so learn electronics! besides that the print quality is pretty decent actually for a cheap printer, just expect to replace it at minimum every year.",

Also, the filament started leaking out the extruder on all sides of the heating box. Ive ordered replacement parts, ill have to replace the heating element since the wire broke from the ceramic filling, and the heat shield since filament caked on the original and was torn off the box.",
