They reeked of whatever toxic goo they're coated with so badly, I had to put all the pieces outside as soon as I opened the cartons. I was hoping by now they'd have off-gassed whatever it is that smells like a toxic waste dump, but three weeks on and they're still terrible. Going to put these right into the garbage can. Even without the wretched odor, I get the impression these things wouldn't last long. Legs are made of compressed paper.",

We've been leaving the table outside for several days in the sun to attempt to cook off the paint smell. After three days outside, we brought it inside... and when we returned from work, the house smelled like toxic paint fumes again. Next place we put this table is the garbage.",

There are no pilot holes for the screws where you screw them into the shelves, so if you don't have a power screwdriver, I hope you have a power drill to (carefully) create them. The tables are sturdy enough for my purposes (table lamps and small items), though I would not put anything heavy on them. The black finish is quite glossy, so it shows fingerprints.",

We had none of the dings or scratches that others have mentioned, and packing was perfect. Assembly was a cinch and very easy. They are a simple design, but aesthetically pleasing as well as functional. I would buy again if the need arose. Recommended at this great price!",

Parents of small children: please note that the edges are quite sharp, and I am taking off one star because I got two splinters as I dusted off the unit with a paper towel.",

I placed it diagonally to support two corners (see photo) and then used a regular Phillips screwdriver with a reasonable amount of pressure to put in the screws. Then I moved the box to support the other two corners and finished. No pre-drilling needed.",
