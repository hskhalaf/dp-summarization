It takes a little while to learn how to blend it in and you have to work quick because it will set fast. A little bit goes a long way. I occasionally get deep, cystic acne pimples along my jawline that are almost always red and inflamed, and Dermaflage can completely conceal my blemishes and it looks so natural! I\u2019m a nurse and Dermaflage outlasts my 12+ hour shifts at the hospital! Definitely worth the money!!",

Way over priced for low quality concealer. The people that have left good reviews have obviously not tried other concealers to know better. This is the worst make up product I have ever bought period. Do not waste your time and money!",
