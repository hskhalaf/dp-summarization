I'm not sure about the memory part, but two days in, I feel great when I get up, my mood is better, and it almost felt as if everything is more crisp and clear. I'm going to try a few other ones before I re-purchase due to the price.",

I don't know why but it caused insomnia, even when I took it in the morning. A friend of mine says it really enhances dreams, and he dreams almost all night every night - and that it was an amazing product. I personally, totally hate the stuff, but other people swear by it. Might be better to go ahead and borrow some before you waste much money on it.",

I have also taken this with piracetam and they team up nicely. It's unfortunate but my body only seems to be able to take any sort of supplement for a couple days with positive results before it starts losing effect.",

I decided to try to buy the ingredients listed in it and see if the result would be the same. Well i am here to report that it is then same. I take it every other night and have the most awesome dreams that I can remember. I got this choline. I tried the Huperzine A but it gave me a headache. So i am just taking this with the choline and getting great REM sleep. You should try it.",

In the brain and other neural tissues, Alpha GPC becomes a constituent of cell membranes.* Clinical studies have demonstrated that supplementation with Alpha GPC can support the brain's synthesis of acetyl-choline.* In this way, it helps to promote normal cognitive function and mental acuity.* Natural color variation may occur in this product.",
