With this brand she eats the entire thing. Not only is the price great, but the product is great.",

The only downside is that she will push it out of the bowl sometimes to find the goodies, but if I make sure it is mixed well with the goodies well dispersed, this is tolerable. I'd only eat the best parts too if I was a fat, happy Guinea pig with a good life. :) This is the only food she will not excessively pick through and push out of her bowl. She does push some out, but if I make sure to not top off the bowl, I can add a little fresh mix which makes her eat it better.",
