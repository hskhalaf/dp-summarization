My 3 daughters who all have long hair were all able to use it to towel dry their hair much faster than using their regular beach towels. They all asked me to buy more so they could have their own. After using this towel, I definitely will be!",

I have used traditional towels (get stinky in humid climates), sarongs (dry quickly but not absorbent), and heavy duty travel towels from the outdoors store (held all the sand and debris!). This will be the last travel towel I buy. At first I thought the xl was a little long, but it was actually perfect. Since it was bigger I could use it as a blanket at the airport when our flight was delayed, or put it down to lay on at the beach. Sand never stuck to it, and it dried really quickly every time.",

I was worried they would not dry you off because they are so lightweight, but they do. They dry quickly and you can brush the sand right off them, it doesn't stick at all. They worked well on the beach and as a blanket on the plane on the way home. I recommend them to everyone and will be giving them as Christmas presents this year!",
