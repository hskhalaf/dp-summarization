Not enough sun to power it in the winter so I chlorinate. But man, when this thing is in use its amazing. its so great to swim in crystal clear freshwater with no chemicals all summer long. I constantly get conpliments. Relitvely easily to use for the average pool owner just by following the directions. Highly, highly recommended.",

Keep in mind that it is important to clean the electrode on a regular basis. I do it once a week, and actually enjoy doing it. I use a high pressure hose attachment; it take me 10 minutes tops to get it clean enough. (You'll also know it's working: you will see the green residue on the electrode.)",
