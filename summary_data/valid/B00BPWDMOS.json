This chair has a large dip in the seat area and it traps you in it a bit. This cause the front part of the seat to dig into the legs a bit. I also found the back a bit too upright. For short outtings and for a kid it might be alright. Oh, also the cover bag is permeable so it will let in rain it covered with it.",
