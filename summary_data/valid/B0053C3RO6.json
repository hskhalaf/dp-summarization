But then I was very disappointed to hear a 'rip' as I lifted the bag for the first time... The stitching on the horizontal handles came apart. I was able to finish the workout but c'mon, these bags are supposed to be made for rough use - multiple rough use. It should not even be remotely possible that it might rip on the first use. Anyway, I've ordered an exchange. Let's see what the next bag is like. Stay tuned...",

After reading the reviews I decided zip lock sand was the way to go. The thing is the zip lock bag is dimensioned differently than the sandbag after a few minutes I gave up. The better idea I had was to take Gorilla tape around each 10 lbs bag in two directions. This should provide enough additional reinforcement at the seams. Time will tell. Additionally, I don't plan to slam the bag on the ground.",

The individual sand bags are a convenient way to easily increase or decrease weight for each exercise depending on your endurance level. The velcro fastening on the sand bags do allow fine sand to sift out so simply fill the bags until they weigh 10 lbs, then use duct tape to seal them. Done. All 4 bags fit nicely in the strong canvas shell. A great product at a great price! It can also be used on vacation: bring empty, fill with sand on the beach, then empty and use as a shoe bag or carry-on luggage for your flight back home.",
