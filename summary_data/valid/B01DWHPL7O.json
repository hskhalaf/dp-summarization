This thing moves around a lot & bounces right off you when you run. Some weight to it would help keep it in place - as well as a silicone or rubber cover to grip you. The battery isnt really 5 hours. More like 2-3. But still pretty good. The connection is strange in that you will lose connection if you bend over. Its like it needs to stay horizontal. Not a big issue, but you notice it when you reach down or stoop to tie your shoes.",

However!!, I ordered this product new and the box came taped back together and there is some slight wearing on the volume control buttons. This leads me to believe this set was not new but a return. Works great, don\u2019t need to return but was annoyed nonetheless.",

Read some online forums, and sure enough this is common for these specific earbuds. Have put in a claim with Skullcandy...cross my fingers they replace. Would probably still buy Skullcandy, but not these.",
