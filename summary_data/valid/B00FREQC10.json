Granted I was trying to move semi-wet leaves but still it could only move small amounts at a time. So as a test I popped of the concentrator tip tip and boy did this thing wake up. Good air flow into the intake and now it moves even wet leaves with ease. I'll let the leaves dry out some more and then try the vacuum out.",

We were tracking so much grass throughout the house after mowing and this used as a blower doesn't leave a piece of grass on the drive or walkway. Definitely worth 60 points bucks.

Wet and dry leaves, and smaller pods (from Willow tree). Works best to blow into a pile, then vacuum. The thing I don't like is the mulch flying out of the joint of the vacuum. It's not bad for the yard; I'm just unfortunately allergic to my yard, so this part isn't good. But it is good for lessening my time working. For those with the mesquite trees, I discovered there's a such thing as a rubber broom. Works great!",

Second they offer a B&D Leaf Collection System. It attaches from your blower to a trash can via a cloth top. For regular size trash cans. You apparently haul the trash can with you. Another system than mulching system. Don't waste your money getting both like I did.",

I find that I have to leave the bag dragging on the ground in order to use the vacuum comfortably. The other problem is that when you want to empty the bag, you need to lift the entire unit as well because the attachment is too short. Ideally the bag needs to be attached to the main unit via a flexible hose.",
