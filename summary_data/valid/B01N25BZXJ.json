Legit, my lips were blue, my teeth were blue, and my tongue was blue. I looked like I just walked out of Charley's Chocolate factory. Ridiculous. I under stand these companies add flavor and coloring. I have used many different brands over the years and have never had this issue. It was the first time I used C4, so not sure if I had a overloaded batch or what.",
