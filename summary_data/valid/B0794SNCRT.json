Other than that, Luci Lights are great and I highly recommend them for any outdoor activities, specially camping.",

And although the light is mellow it illuminates & husband and I read by it. BTW: we're keeping the cheaper one by another manufacturer, because it charges much faster (also loses its charge at the same speed). Between the 2 of them we feel that aspect of zero electricity is taken care of. Highly recommend.",

It said the light needed to have more than 1 bar of juice for the USB to work. I left the light out for a full day in the sun and by nightfall, it had 3 bars. That said, the USB would not connect to anything. I tried 2 different cables and 2 different phones. Lame.",
