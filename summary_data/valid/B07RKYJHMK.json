Previously I was using a pair of trainers that were older than my kids (one is 14...) while I did the Couch to 5K during The Great British Lockdown Of 2020. These made such a difference! Lightweight, comfy, not falling apart. For a while, running actually became fun. No issues at all. Feet felt protected, and yet unencumbered (because they're so light). Fit was good. Even just typing this, I feel like I need to get back into the running again. When I've worn the current pair out, I shall buy another set of these.",

      "text": "I bought these shoes and expected them to be comfortable for walking in but the inside of the shoes (size 5.5 in the photo) is very hard and there is little comfort. Although the outer sole of the shoe does provide support, I do not like wearing the shoes when walking long distances, especially outside. The shoes look great but the practical issue of being comfortable is not achieved. I think that they may be acceptable for occasional use but not for daily use when walking. The comfort has been increased a bit by inserting shoe stretchers with socks on them and also by putting them into hot water to widen them.",

It\u2019s a shame that these are not sturdier as I hate having to throw away shoes. I will be looking for something much more durable in the future and would not recommend these trainers to anybody who plans on using them frequently for exercise as they\u2019re clearly not made to withstand it.",
