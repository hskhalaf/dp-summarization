The Windows Phone OS is fantastic, it's different from iOS and Android, but in almost every way better. It feels like It's designed to \"do\" stuff, not just launch apps. And the most common stuff I do I don't need an \"app\" to do it's just built in and does it well.",

The Lumia seems to have designed a new kind of casing, it has a light feeling, but seems very sturdy and robust. Best of both worlds: it's not flimsy and it's not heavy. I recommend the phone - at these prices it's a no brainer.",

The screen is bigger which helps with not straining my eyes and the Windows phone OS is actually very snappy and faster than the iphone. Only thing is it would be nice to have more apps on the Windows phone, but that's okay because they have Yelp, Opentable, and all the main ones that I like to use. Overall, it's a great phone with nice looking hardware. (got it in blue and the color really pops :D)",

The AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) technology increases the refresh rate of the screen and enhances the contrast ratio while reducing energy consumption to increase battery life. The ClearBlack Display (CBD) feature blocks incoming light reflections through a polarized layer to improve screen visibility under direct sunlight. This smartphone does not shy away from technology to enrich the user experience.\n\nNote: AT&T's 4G mobile broadband coverage is not available in all areas. 4G speeds delivered by HSPA+ with enhanced backhaul; availability increasing with ongoing backhaul deployment.\n\nIn addition to the beautiful display features, the Lumia 900 utilizes its 1.4 GHz Qualcomm single-core processor to run the Windows 7.5 operating system, which has been designed to keep phone tasks simple and easy for the everyday user. If you are an avid photographer, you will be happy to know the 8 megapixel camera features Carl Zeiss optics, auto-focus, and a dual LED flash to enhance dim lighting situations. In addition to the still camera, the Lumia has 720p video capabilities and extra memory storage available via the SkyDrive cloud to ensure you can save all your files.\n\nWith AT&T's 4G HSPA+ network, you'll enjoy mobile broadband speeds up to 4x faster than AT&T's already fast mobile broadband network (learn more below). You also get the AT&T Mobile Hotspot service built right into the smartphone--enabling you to connect additional Wi-Fi-enabled devices to the phone's mobile broadband signal (requires appropriate data plan). This GPS-enabled phone can also access the AT&T Navigator service for turn-by-turn directions.\n\nVITAL STATISTICS\nThe Nokia Lumia weighs 5.6 ounces and measures 5.0 x 2.7 x 0.45 inches. Its 1830mAh lithium-ion battery is rated at up to 7 hours of talk time, and up to 300 hours (12.5 days) of standby time. It runs on AT&T's UMTS Tri-band (850/1900/2100 MHz), GSM Quad-band (850/900/1800/1900 MHz), and LTE (700/AWS MHz).\n\nWhat's in the Box\nNokia Lumia device, non-removable battery, USB charger, connectivity cable, SIM tray tool, quick start\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE POWER OF WINDOWS PHONE 7.5\nThe Windows Phone 7.5 operating system has been designed to help you do more in fewer steps, and keep you updated on the things that are most important to you.\n\nYou can customize the Live Tiles on your Start Screen with what you care about--from people to web sites--and they'll continuously scan the web to keep you updated about your world at a glance.\n\n\n\nImproved Live Tiles. \n\nHistory view. Windows Phone 7.5 also brings together the things you use most on your phone in six Hubs: People, Pictures, Office, Games, Music + Video, and Marketplace. Grouping them in Hubs like this lets you get to what you need, quicker, because you don't have to jump from apps to the web to contact lists.\n\nThe latest release of Windows Phone--version 7.5, codenamed \"Mango\"--has hundreds of improvements and new features. Here's just a sample:\n\n Multitasking: Now you can keep your place in a game while reading e-mail or listen to music apps while texting. Many apps can run in the background, so you don't need to shut one down to use another--plus you can switch between open apps in a flash. \n\nImproved Live Tiles: The Live Tiles on Start dish up more (and quicker) updates on your apps, and they're also a whole lot of fun--the Pictures Tile animates with a slideshow of your favorite snapshots and Group Tiles flash your friends' latest updates.\n\nThreads: Start with a text, and finish in Facebook or Messenger chat (or vice versa). The whole conversation stays in one thread, and all it takes to switch back and forth is a tap.\n\nSend a text with your voice: With Speech, you can text, search the web, and lots more, totally hands- (and sometimes eyes-) free. Your phone can even read you an incoming text, and then you can use Speech to dictate and send your reply.\n\n\n\nFind nearby restaurants, shops, and things to do with Local Scout. Local Scout: Powered by Bing, Local Scout teams up search and mapping to show you nearby restaurants, shopping, and activities in a single tap.\n\nDriving directions: Your Windows Phone can get you where you're going by showing you on the map or giving you directions from where you are.\n\nMore social networks: Twitter and LinkedIn are now built into Windows Phone, so practically everything you do on your social networks is a tap away. Windows 7.5 also includes new ways to filter all those new contacts and their social updates.\n\nPersistent camera settings: Now if you change camera settings--for instance, photo resolution, brightness, or another option your phone manufacturer might have included--you can save them for the next time you use the camera.\n\nHistory view: Contact cards now show the history of your recent calls, e-mails, texts, and chats with the person. Just tap in the list to return the call or go to the thread.\n\nVisual voice-mail: See your voice-mails in a list, then listen to them on your phone.\n\nSync with SkyDrive: You can sync your Office docs between SkyDrive and your phone, so you can edit them on your phone now, then edit some more on your computer later.\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T 4G NETWORK\nWHAT IS 4G?\n4G is a wireless technology term meaning \"Fourth Generation.\" 4G follows 3G as the latest addition to AT&T's mobile broadband network. When combined with enhanced backhaul, 4G means faster speeds, where data transfers take less time to complete. AT&T has upgraded the software of its nationwide mobile broadband network with HSPA+ which, with enhanced backhaul, enables speeds up to 4x faster than AT&T's already fast mobile broadband speeds. And now, AT&T is evolving to even faster 4G speeds with the launch of AT&T's 4G LTE technology in select markets. \n\nBackhaul is one of the major pieces of a telecommunications network. Think of it as the limbs connecting AT&T's cell towers with AT&T's backbone network that provides access to the Internet.\n\nHOW DOES AT&T 4G DIFFER FROM OTHER 4G NETWORKS?\nAT&T is the only network offering two layers of 4G technology: HSPA+ with enhanced backhaul and LTE, both capable of delivering 4G speeds. Customers will have access to fast speeds as they move in and out of 4G LTE areas. Customers of competitors who do not have HSPA+ with enhanced backhaul are likely to see a steep drop-off in speeds when they move out of LTE areas. \n\nIn areas where either AT&T's 3G or 4G network is not available, you'll continue to receive service on the AT&T EDGE network, which offers availability in more than 13,000 US cities and along some 40,000 miles of major highways.\n\nOPTIONAL AT&T SERVICES\nAT&T Navigator: This premium GPS navigation application includes audible turn-by-turn directions, real-time traffic updates and re-routing options, and 3D moving maps (additional charges applicable). AT&T Navigator offers several other features to make your commute more enjoyable and reliable, including mobile access to Yellowpages.com. You'll be able to find the closes ATM, restaurant, gas station, Wi-Fi hotspot and more with over 10 million business listings.\n\nAT&T FamilyMap: Locate any phone indoors or outdoors on the AT&T Network. FamilyMap provides peace of mind by being able to conveniently locate a family member from your wireless phone or PC and know that your family's information is secure and private. Want to verify that your child arrives home from school each day?
