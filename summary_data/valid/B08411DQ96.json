      "text": "I bought my first Polar HRM over 25 years ago and have stuck with the brand ever since. I recently upgraded to the H9 and dear me Polar what's going on? I'm not sure if I have a faulty device or if Polar have substantuially dropped the reliebilty of data transmission. The heart rate reading frequently freezes and \"flat lines\" at whatever it stuck on for ten minutes or more, then it suddenly comes back to life, sometimes it looks like the reading will be accurate, sometimes it's up and down all over the place with no correlation to my exercise intensity. Very dissapointed.",
