This leaves me watching movies on my small phone when travelling in a plane while my Chromebook with the much larger screen sits in my backpack. About half of my home automation apps also do not work. It works well for internet browsing and e-mail but I was hoping for much more. I also hate the square rather than rounded edges. This makes it uncomfortable holding it in tablet mode.",

      "text": "So far I absolutely love it. I thought the transition from regular computer to Chromebook would be difficult, but not at all! Love how fast it is, love that it can do everything i've asked it to do so far in the two weeks I've owned it, and I love how compact and easy it is to carry around. And omg, the 5 seconds it takes to turn on and off? How easy and refreshing! I'm betting I'll never go back to a regular PC. Excellent buy for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone.",

I am a big Chromebook enthusiast, and this is by far the best Chromebook built to date. Asus hit all the right notes on this one. Great keyboard. Great display. Great build materials and quality. Excellent choice in processor, RAM, and storage. If you're in the market for a Chromebook, this is the one to get right now. The Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro are definite competitors, but they have both proven to have their issues. This one simply works, and will be the gold standard by which all other Chromebooks are judged for the foreseeable future.",

Not the best laptop out there, but if you buy it on sale, and don't expect too much out of it, such as hardcore gaming or super-crisp video, it will suit your needs.
