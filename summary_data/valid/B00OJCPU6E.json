      "PAINFUL, FLAT FEET? FALLEN arches? SKIP THE PRICEY $500 INSOLES: As a LEADING PODIATRIST (with flat feet!) I realize that MOST SHOE INSERTS have \u201cPROBLEMS\u201d. They require cutting or have rock-hard arch support that radiates pain up your legs. That\u2019s why I assembled a \"DREAM TEAM\" of INDUSTRY LEADERS to BIOMECHANICALLY ENGINEER Samurai Insoles! They OPTIMIZE the FUNCTION of your FEET & LEGS \u2013 COMBINING the BEST BENEFITS of an ARCH SUPPORT SHOE INSERT & CUSTOM ORTHOTICS, for 1/10th the investment!",
      "PODIATRIST DESIGNED, PROVEN BY 1,000+ REVIEWS \u2013 FIX FOOT PAIN AT THE ROOT: If you\u2019re tired of foot conditions limiting your mobility, then you\u2019ll love how Samurai Insoles GENTLY CORRECT the OVERPRONATION associated with LOW or FALLEN ARCHES and provide a CLOUD-LIKE PILLOW of SUPPORT for flat feet for QUICK RELIEF from plantar fasciitis and heel pain, especially if you're someone who can't tolerate rigid orthotic inserts for shoes or overly firm arch supports for flat feet.",
      "\u201cTHEY FIT!\u201d NO GUESSWORK, NO CUTTING, NO STUFFING: Let\u2019s be honest, most orthotics shoes and insoles are just plain ugly and make you want to hide your feet. Samurai Insoles' SLIM, LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN SUPPORTS YOUR CHOSEN FASHION. Know your shoes size? Great! Simply choose your STANDARD SHOE SIZE above, slide them in, and WEAR THEM IN YOUR FAVORITE FOOTWEAR \u2013 whether you love sneakers, boots, clogs, slippers, or flats.",
      "THE SECRET? LOOK INSIDE OUR insoles. While most ARCH SUPPORT SHOE INSERTS are nothing more than fancy colored foam, or unforgiving hard plastic, we snuck a SPRINGY, FLEXIBLE INNER CORE INSIDE the insert. What customers love most is how it PROVIDES AMPLE SUPPORT, BOUNCES BACK & MOLDS TO YOUR FEET as YOU MOVE - so you get ideal support in all the right places whether you\u2019re running, bicycling, jogging, water skiing, or jumping on the trampoline.",
      "INSTANT PAIN RELIEF, GUARANTEED? YES! AND CUSTOMERS AGREE, \u201cThey just work\u201d. Because we geek out about fixing foot pain, we could talk endlessly about WHY these are the best MEDICAL GRADE inserts we\u2019ve ever ENGINEERED for my patients, in a STATE-of-the-ART ORTHOTIC LABORATORY right here in the USA. But you want A SOLUTION, NOT A STORY so we\u2019ll just tell you to TRY THEM RISK FREE. Let us PROVE they\u2019ll RELIEVE YOUR PAIN and leave your FEET FEELING AMAZING. Or your money back."
