    "description": "Suturing is a fundamental medical skill, yet why are students made to practice on materials that only vaguely mimic real skin?\n\nFor all the advancements in the surgical field, suture practice is still outdated. Many medical students still poke at bananas, orange peels, and pig\u2019s feet. Besides being a waste of perfectly good fruit, none of the popular practice methods prepare students for the real feel and texture of live skin.\n\nLeave the fruits in the basket. Learn from the closest approximation of skin with Suture Skills\u2019 Suture Practice Tool Kit.\n\nSure, it\u2019s easy to claim a silicone suture pad as lifelike. But our suture pad is an original, designed by medical professionals for the medical community. Our pad feels as authentic as it gets without practicing on your buddy.\n\nA practice suture pad undergoes some serious trauma. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve inserted a mesh between the fat and skin layers to improve durability. The mesh layer is thin, but strong enough to prevent tearing and ripping for up to 100 uses.\n\nWe are genuinely dedicated to helping you improve your suture skills. That\u2019s why learning with us doesn\u2019t stop at the suture kit. We have online training videos, tutorial posts on Instagram (follow us at @sutureskills), and a guide.
