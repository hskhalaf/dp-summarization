It's going to go on a little trip across the pond soon in which it is going to be used as a phone and a mobile broadband device. I expect it will be fine - I'll post any unexpected results that we encounter. Finally, we'll see how well it holds up over a longer period, six months or a year. I'll post these results as well if they prove different than expected.",

I am let down by battery life when playing Vega conflict but regular reading and video playback are great on battery. Also given it is as popular as the other two brands I mentioned it lacks some good cases which sucks.",
