Now, most everything has wireless capabilities and 8 ports were way too much.

Also, all of the remote monitoring and configuration are gone in bridge mode. $300 dumb radio now. Same if you use it as wireless repeater. One radio, no special features.

I've only had it a few days and it was a breeze to set up. Haven't done much playing with it and not sure how the antennas are supposed to be aligned but I'll figure all that out later. for now I'm very happy with the purchase.",

I am very impressed by the faster speeds with this router and it's signal thrength throughout my two story house. Worth every penny to upgrade!",

Tomato, DDWRT, and many other open source firmware options made the WRT54GL so compelling, at right around $100. This $300 monstrosity is NOT the spiritual successor to the WRT54GL.",

You have to be nearly right next to it to get the faster performance. I wouldn't waste my money again. I can't return it now (15 days time limit - NOT on Amazon though). Save yourself the grief and the money and just buy a $50 router. It'll perform just as well, I'm sure of that.",

I ahve at present 17 Devices listed in the network map. the online Linksys Smart Wifi Website allows you to change the vast majority of settings anywhere in the world to you router. Personally I think this a great upgrade for anyone running 54g/n and look out for fuure deals on the product.",
