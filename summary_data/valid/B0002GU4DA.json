The Pixma runs about the same speed as the old i560 but the print quality is better, sharper. I have run several Canon 4 ink tank units well past their expected lifetime, (2) S400's, (2) S520's, (2) i560's. They are economical to run, they use the entire ink supply up before needing more ink, ink is cheap, the print heads last a long time, and the machine lasts a long time.",

Especially the ability to do hands-free double-sided printing (the machine prints once side, pulls it back in, turns it over, and prints the other side. Like most printers, the unit itself is low-priced and they make their money on ink sales. I haven't tried it with \"refill\" ink because I lost an Epson printer to that habit (clogged the emitters), but then that Epson was very fussy about ink (by design?). When I needed another printer for my wife's computer, I bought another Canon (that one with a flatbed scanner on top).",

Compare the two (iP3000 and iP4000), iP4000 has better black color on photo(same setting and same photos). Much darker and more saturated because of the extra black (3e)color cartridge for photo printing. 3e gives the photo more saturation and more of the professional photo developing look. Most people probably will be satisfy with iP3000. It probably save you more money in long term with iP3000. However, if you want better photo quality, then go for iP4000.",

      "text": "As the owner of two HP printers (deskjet 932 and all-in-one 4215) I was blown away by the Pixma 3000. I needed a \"cheap\" printer with \"cheap\" inks so I bought the Pixma. I was astounded by the speed and print quality (photo and document) which surpasses my HP printers. The Pixma is a little big, but I like the design. I have not tried the direct print feature yet. My last two Canon purchases (this printer and the SD200 camera) have been fantastic and exceeded my expectations. Thanks Canon.",

    "description": "Box contents include: PIXMA iP3000 Photo Printer, Print Head, Ink Tanks(black, cyan, magenta, yellow), 4\" x 6\" glossy photo paper sample pack, power cord, documentation kit and User Guide CD-ROM The Canon PIXMA iP3000 Color Photo Printer delivers high-performance printing with flexible paper handling. It offers high speed printing at up to 22 ppm in black and up to 15 ppm in color. Four individual ink tanks help reduce waste and can save you money, while printing your color photos. The iP3000 can print borderless 4\" x 6\" photgraphs in about 36 seconds at a maximum 4800 x 1200 color dpi, with droplets as small as 2 picoliters. This means high-intensity, high-resolution photos and graphics, with the look and feel of traditional photographs. Direct photo printing from PictBridge compatible digital cameras & DV camcorders Dual paper path with built-in 2 sided printing Paper sizes accepted - Letter, Legal, 4 x 6, 5 x 7 & U.S. #10 envelopes Ink Compatibility - BCI-3e black, BCI-6C cyan, BCI-6M magenta, BCI-6Y yellow tanks Droplet Size - 2-5 picoliters Connects with Windows(98 and up) or Mac OS (9.x and up) machines through USB or printer port (cable not incl.) Software includes printer drivers, Easy-PhotoPrint, Easy-WebPrint, PhotoRecord, Electronic User's Guide, Photo Application Guide & Electronic Registration Physical Dimensions(WxDxH) - 16.5 x 10.8 x 6.8 Weight - 11.0 lbs.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description High speed, sharp resolution, and economical ink refills: Could you ask for more in a home printer? The Canon PIXMA ip3000 is designed with 1,600 nozzles that produce tiny 2-picoliter droplets, resulting in finely detailed images that are worthy of saving in your family photo albums. Pigment-based inks insure colors will stay true, and the prints are resistant to water, fading, and smudges. \n\n Precision Color Distribution Technology\nUnlike other systems, nozzle configuration in Bubble Jet printers is simple, so it is easier to make them smaller and more dense. Using its superior semiconductor manufacturing technology, Canon has succeeded in developing an ultrahigh-precision, multinozzle print head. The problem of color inconsistency has been solved by positioning a mirror-image line of 128 nozzles (600 dpi pitch for each color) at a half-pitch offset from the existing line. This configuration also provides the added advantage of enabling high-resolution printing at 1,200 dpi. \n\n Easy-PhotoPrint v3.0\nWhile most photo-editing software applications will brighten the entire image, Easy-PhotoPrint 3.0 accurately detects the subject's face and adjusts the skin to the optimum tone. Brighten dark faces caused by bright backgrounds. Choose from one-click automatic to correct the entire image all at once, or manual to correct just a selected area. \n\n \n\nBefore\nAfter\n Easy-PhotoPrint 3.0 also lets you select and print any image on your PC, perfectly trim images, correct images using lab-quality retouching features, correct red-eye, smooth facial lines and skin tone, sharpen faces, remove blemishes, and print in a variety of sizes and layouts. \n\n Exif Print Technology\nExif 2.2 is the worldwide printer independent standard for digital image processing. Under Exif 2.2, the digital still camera can record data tags for specific camera settings and functions such as whether the flash was on or off, if the camera was in landscape, portrait or night scene mode, etc. Referencing some or all of this information, an Exif Print compatible application can process digital camera images intelligently based on specific camera settings and the shooting environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n With resolution up to 600 x 600 dpi black and 4,800 x 1,200 dpi color, your office documents or school reports will look as good as your photos. Built-in two-sided printing reduces your paper costs and allows you truly professional design options. \n\n \n\n\nThis printer can connect directly to select digital cameras. Learn more about PictBridge. Top speeds of 22 ppm black and 15 ppm color (draft mode) will have your pages in hand in just a few seconds; a borderless 4-by-6-inch photo can take as little as 36 seconds--as fast as those old instant cameras, but with much better quality. Thanks to the PictBridge-compatible direct print port, you can connect your digital camera and churn out photos while bypassing your computer system.  The ip3000 is compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems, and requires only a USB cable to get it up and running (cable not included). Canon provides a one-year warranty covering parts and service.\n\n What's in the Box\nPIXMA iP3000 photo printer, PIXMA iP3000 print head, BCI-3eBk black ink tank, BCI-6C cyan ink tank, BCI-6M magenta ink tank, BCI-6Y yellow ink tank, Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy 4x6 sample pack, power cord, documentation kit, setup software and user's guide on CD-ROM; printer cable not included",
