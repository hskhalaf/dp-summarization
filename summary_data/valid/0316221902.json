And as a mom to two young boys, I don't have time mess around with Veganomicon style meals (let's be for real, there were some intense cooking times with those recipes.)

The cookbook also has a lot of pictures, which I am so thankful for because I believe no cookbook should be without beautiful photographs to entice you.

Also made them the black bean burger recipe, and the husband was floored!. I had checked it out at the library before purchasing so I could test the recipes myself, and making the purchase was the smartest thing I did! Can't wait for her next book!",
