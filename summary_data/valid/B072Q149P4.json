First of the brush is very soft, it has a black bristles on the bottom that are short. Then, a longer one with a plastic ball on the end for a massaging action. First trying it I could feel and see the results instantly. I brushed all the way through my dry, thick, frizzy, wavy hair with ease. Very comfortable on my scalp. The results say it all. The brush itself is very comfortable in my medium sized hand. Also, it is a very pretty golden bronze color.",
