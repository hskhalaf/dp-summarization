This cleanser removes residual makeup left after using a makeup removing wipe, gently exfoliates my skin, and doesn't strip it of natural oils. I still have slightly oily skin (most people in my family do) but this cleanser has significantly reduced redness, inflammation, and eliminated the dryness I experienced when using acne products.",

      "text": "If your skin tends to develop those awful white, under the skin, bumps / pustules with most washes and lotions, you know how frustrating the search for a non-irritating wash and lotion can be. I strayed from Alpha Hydrox (wash) and Oil of Olay (lotion) to try Cerave products and (unfortunately) have had terrible luck with them. My skin had some very large bumps within 6 hours and it has taken a week for them to finally go away. I know the reviews for both CeraVe products were so great...I was hoping both would work for me.",

I used only CeraVe products, and I use this cleanser with my Clarisonic to remove my makeup at night. I use the hydrating cleanser in the morning. My skin is happy! The product isn't drying at all, and doesn't foam so much to be annoying and messy over my pedestal sink. It does a superior job at removing eye makeup (even without using the Clarisonic), and definitely leaves my skin feeling both soft and clean at the end of the day. It is gentle as well!",
