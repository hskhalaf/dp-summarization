      "text": "I bought two of the black media cabinets (See picture). These are great for the price. Time will tell how long they will stand up to day to day wear and tear but I am happy with the final product. Putting them together was a pain in the butt, but, I'm not going to mark that against the manufacturer. The most difficult part was ensuring the doors were aligned. On one cabinet the doors are slightly off and no matter how many times I tried to adjust them I just couldn't get them to match but it's not very noticeable. If you aren't looking to spend a whole lot of money on media cabinets I would recommend these.",

      "text": "I bought four of these shelves for my DVD collection and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this DIY build. I have built a lot of furniture lately and these shelves are one of the sturdier builds I've purchased. There were some inconsistencies though. I bought two shelves first and they were both very quality items. I was so impressed I bought two more and they each had issues. Pros: quality materials and shipping. Shelves are beautiful. Solid build. Cons: issues with 2/4 shelves quality. Doors are a little tough to level. Veneer scratches easily.",

Be aware that the profile is narrow. The shelf is just a few millimeters short of 5\u201d deep. We bought to display glassware and ended up sunny it in the bathroom in place of the medicine cabinet. I use little plastic bins from Amazon and spray painted them all black for a stylish and uniform look. Very pleased with the versatility and price. Look for \u201cused\u201d to save even more. The box was heavily damaged, but the components were packaged so well there was zero damage to the unit.",

It's very light, even when filled but I wasn't expecting heavy for the price. I did,'t realize how many DVDs I had so I only have room for a couple of more but that's my fault. I gave it four stars because five would mean it was beyond my expectation.",

      "text": "The DVD Tower wasn't too hard to assemble though some of the diagrams in the manual can be a bit deceptive if you're not paying close attention to details. It was in fact smaller than I thought but that's a good thing because it doesn't take up too much space and still stores all my games and DVD's. It's worth more around $70 IMO not the $84 I paid, but hey, I've gotten some great deals from Amazon in the past so I can't complain.",

A tall piece of furniture it is not, but it's WELL MADE AND EASY TO ASSEMBLE. I am happy overall with my purchase.",
