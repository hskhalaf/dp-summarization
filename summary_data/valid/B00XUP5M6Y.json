Not happy with GoPro customer service - they should have been able to service their own product at a nominal cost, especially since it is within the warranty period and NOT ABUSED. Customer retention or loyalty doesn't seem like a priority......and there are a lot of competitive products out there that are much less expensive. Seems like this fad will fade",

The one area that was lacking was the audio capabilities; this specific model lacks most (if not all) compatibility with audio recording accessories. This is unfortunate, as you are limited to the units built-in recording hardware, which lacks ambient filtering and noise reduction. Other than that, the Hero+ LCD is perfect for capturing action, motion and time-lapse, while also having great battery life. Note that the unit will get hot if shooting for extended periods of time, but was better when using the open backdoor. I am pleased with my purchase and would buy again.",

The photos have the right amount of coloring, however the lens is a wide angle lens that very noticeably stretches the photos horizontally near the edges. For the size and ability to abuse this moderately, it's a good price, but some of the photos were nearly not useable because of the stretching.",

      "text": "Used this for the first time on a dive trip to Guadalupe Island off the coast of Mexico. Spent several days taping great white sharks and the Hero + LCD performed perfectly. Having an LCD screen for diving is mandatory if one wants good results. The instant on feature with the shutter is also also invaluable. Highly recommended for all except those who want the ultimate in resolution.",
