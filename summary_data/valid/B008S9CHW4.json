The helmet also prevented me from looking like Quasimodo when I hit a pile of rocks after I slide off the road. Before the accident I loved the helmet because of the look, comfort, and I was able to use my peripheral vision. And now, I\u2019m totally grateful and thank God for the helmet for allowing me to keep my brain, teeth, and face intact instead of being all over the road. Buying this helmet was among the best things I\u2019ve done.",

I crashed face first at 40ish mph and the only thing that happened was my nasal passage, a fragile bone, fractured. I would post pictures, but the helmet is splattered with blood from the nosebleed that came during the crash. I'm just happy to be here.

I am a 5'4, 110 pound female with a head circumference of 22 1\u20442 inches and had bought a large based on other reviews. The large was too loose, when I turned my head the helmet would bobble around and move to obscure my vision so I exchanged for the medium which was perfectly snug and stable.

Cons: top air vents are cheap & fall off easily. Fogs up fast (recommend lifting the face shield an inch). A lot of noise riding 65mph & up. Would definitely recommend saving up for a $100 -$199 helmet. Overall thought, buy this helmet for a backup or if you need something temporarily ..such as passing your motorcycle riding test.",

The ear cushions inside keep it from rolling and make the helmet secure, but it makes wearing any kind of headset or earbuds impossible, as it pushes them deeper into your ear or pulls them out when you slide the helmet on. The vents don't seem to do anything at all and the visor fogs up in anything under 60 degree weather.
