It still needs a little supervising as it can get stuck under furniture and my kitty comes to find me when it happens (quite often) It stops working after several minutes. Not sure if it is a safety thing or just a problem. If I turn it off, after a few minutes it works again. Considering the abuse it gets from my kitten, I find this perfectly acceptable. I just hope it won't break quickly. As you can see from the video, my kitty loves it.",

They scoot across the hard floors by themselves, turning and making their way around as if they had a mind of their own. They are very well made and durable. The cats haven't been able to tear these apart like they do so many other harder-plastic-ish toys. When they get turned upside down or on their side, they will right themselves. HOWEVER, if your batteries are weak, they do not have enough power to do that. I won't waste a half good battery, so our cats are forced to endure playtime with them until the batteries are dead before I change them.",

Also, vacuum your floor before putting these things down because they'll pick up every piece of dust, fur, and hair they encounter, and you'll need to clean them out at the end of the play session. Otherwise, like I said, the cats like them and that's all that matters. They're weird little things, kind of freaky, like they have a mind of their own.",

This is so much fun. It only works on hard surfaces and you have to keep an eye on it so that it doesn't get stuck under the sofa so, in fact, both of us are focused on this silly thing. I am totally pleased with this. I turned it off and put it away and the cat is still trying to figure out what just happened. Great fun.",
