I'll only buy this for my dog now because it's way cheaper than dog shampoo. I highly recommend (but definitely buy a pump for it for easy dispensing unless you're buying it to refill a current bottle).",

Since it is no longer carried by the grocery stores that I used to purchase it in, I was thrilled to find it online, especially in a gallon size (now I don't have to worry about running out of the shampoo anytime soon). I received it in a few days (faster than I expected).",
