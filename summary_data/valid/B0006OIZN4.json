      "text": "I got this unit today, placed it in my kitchen for an hour and it cleaned out 14 flies. But I was blindsided by the ongoing costs. The glue boards are the killers. The instructions say that a glue board will hold about 100 flies. The boards are sold in boxes of 10 for $15. That's 1,000 flies for $15 or $.02 per fly. It doesn't make sense to pay $30+ for the unit and 1.50 for each board thereafter. A zapper unit would be much cheaper in the long run.",

As a note, if you want to catch moths, moths are drawn to it. A couple of moths got into the house and we quickly drawn to the light and stuck in the trap. However, the \"moth dust\" from their wings got all over the trap and quickly coated all of the sticky stuff so the trap is done now.",

It caught three within minutes. Even with otherwise bright daylight 90W LED bulbs in a light fixture above; they head right for the lamp. At night it catches the few remaining stragglers and in the morning those who emerge for the day. The only slight difficulty is the tube starter can be a bit slow to kick over when cold.

This fly trap often gets them before we even notice they're in the house!

I might add it's somewhat emotionally satisfying seeing the little irritants stuck there. Highly recommended!",

Don't know if it's my perpetual use of lip balm (usually fruit flavored) but it drove me nuts. This wasn't cheap, but it had good reviews, so I decided to give it a go. I just placed it for a day or two in whatever room I found fruit flies (there were one or two in the home office and bedroom, too), and soon enough I'd find their little bodies stuck to the film. Within a week, no more flying pests of any kind upstairs or down.",

Cooking and eating on the deck almost everyday is great, but a lot of bugs get in the house. In the summertime I replace the sticky insert every few days because it is literally covered in bugs. They also make great nightlights. The photo is of a two-day old strip from the upstairs hallway light.",

My only complaints are that it is rather large and I thought I had ordered a white trap but ended up with a gray/beige color, which I don't care for as much. Finally, it emits a blue light, which was so bright in my tiny house. I had to move it to an area far from the entrance to my bedroom to avoid nighttime light pollution.",
