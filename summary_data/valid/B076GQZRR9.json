Apple support that nothing can be done to remove them from the phone without the password for those accounts - clearly that is never going to happen. So I am now going to have to take this gift back and send it back to Amazon. Hardly Christmas. Completely unacceptable.",

Yes - you do get a lot of tech with this. And I find that even though some other phones are technically superior the iPhone seems to run better HOWEVER this is nearly one thousand pounds. That is a big investment - more than a laptop. If you can afford it, it won't disappoint but it's defiantly not that much better than the older versions which are 2/3 of the price.",

The screen and battery life are much better, facial recognition works real well and the camera is great - I love the profile setting which blurs our the background. The new headphone jack is a bit annoying, you have to use the apple headphones or Bluetooth ones, and you can\u2019t charge the phone at the same time as listening via the wired headphones as they use the same jack. It is expensive but overall I would recommend it!",
