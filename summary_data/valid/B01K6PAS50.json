The only one flaw to the case that I can say is that the outter rubberish part tends to stretch and not fit the plastic part after a while.

Despite hat. this one protects best and your phone will look as New Years hence, ( I do not own Androids but assume they make them and are as good. ).

Occasionally, I take the phone out to clean the case and the cracks and crevices and I\u2019m a little amazed at the feel of the phone itself. PROS: Unequaled protection and peace of mind that your phone will survive drops. Easy to install and remove from the case. CONS: Screen protector fits loosely and takes some getting used to over a traditional screen protector. Case is a bit bulky.",

Other than that, I would give it 4 stars on performance of protecting phone, overall look, and usage of buttons. Bulky in hand but what can you expect when it\u2019s a protectors case.",
