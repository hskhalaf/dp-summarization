The GPS feature allows your lights to turn on when you connect to your home wifi, no more coming into a dark home, also allows them to automatically shut off when you leave. Replaces any need for the older light timers peoe use when they go out of town or for xmas lights. There are times, maybe 5% of the time where they wont respond, normally just turn it off and on a d everything's back to normal",

Or, for that matter, why not have them in other colors as well, just like the Echo? The white is so conspicuous when most extension cords, power strips, etc. come in brown or black. I realize it's a small criticism. But, the other smart plugs that come in black all seem to be glitchy. Come on, Amazon, it's a simple thing, right?",
