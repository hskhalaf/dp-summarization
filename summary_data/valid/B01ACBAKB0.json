Perhaps they be metal?",

We just feel better knowing they have them on if they accidentally fall in. The only annoying thing is that it occasionally goes off when the dogs are playing and the big one mouths the smaller ones neck. On the other hand, it is good to know that such a small amount of moisture sets it off. Bite the bullet and spend the money. Better safe than sorry!",

If I was outside in my driveway and the dogs fell in the pool in the back yard, I wouldn't be able to hear the alarm going off in the house. But it's plenty loud if I'm in the house.",
