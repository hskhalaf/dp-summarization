The unit is compact but the switches on front will make it important to have a good case before it goes into a backpack. I was told by a technician that the saturation point was at its upper limit of 10,000 cpm and that recovery of the tube was nearly instant once removed from the radiation field. Other words, it would not handle high energy nuclear radiation (>1 R/hr).",

The switches protrude and I feel like I could break them off if I were to pack it in a bag without a case. There is an option for it to come with slide switches instead on their main site.",

Also, the external GM tube is a plus and I believe I can upgrade it to a scintillation unit later on to check food more carefully (namely fish caught off my coast). For now though, it's good enough to check things against the normal background radiation, which I've been observing since before Fukashima because of Diablo Canyon's proximity to me.",

    "description": "The GCA-07W is a handheld personal nuclear radiation detector. A proven track record for detecting nuclear radiation in school physics lab, industrial settings, transport containers, top soil, granite table tops, scrap metal, oil fields, objects and interior spaces.\n\nThe external wand makes it easier to search materials and surfaces for radioactivity. The GCA-07W detects Alpha, Beta, X-ray and Gamma radiation above 3 MeV, 50 KeV, and 7 KeV respectively.\n\nEasy to read LCD is a 2 line by 16 characters that provides a current count and radiation level readout. Simple front panel instrument controls make the GCA-07W easy to use. Toggle switches control all the front panel options. User can select a time period, type of measurements (Imperial or Metric). Measurements (counts per second) are converted into radiation levels (mR/hr or mSv/hr). Time selection switch allows Counts Per Second (CPS) or Counts Per Minute (CPM) mode. \n\nFactory calibrated using a NIST traceable source to ensure accurate measurements. Our NRC certification is available at additional cost from the manufacturer. The NRC certification certifies your Geiger counter has passed ANSI-STD N323A calibration using a NIST traceable source from an independent US licensed laboratory conforming to United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC regulations 10-CFR-34 and 10-CFR-35 standards (available at additional costs through the manufacturer). \n\nOptions: Jack for Headphones or External Speaker. External Power Supply included. 3.5mm Data Port for WIN PC and microcontroller interface. The WIN PC program requires optional 3.5mm to USB data cable. \n\n\nSecondary indicators; audio (clicks) and visual (LED) included. 9V battery (mobile operation) not included.",
