      "text": "The variety of colors available was great- I wanted a neutral gray, and the color is just as pictured. The silicone trivets are a great size- big enough to protect the counter, but do not take up all the counter space. They stay an place and do not slide around on the tile counter. I am surprised at how much I like them- no more hot pot/pan worries!",

      "text": "I purchased these due to the good reviews. Unfortunately, while lifting a cast iron pan from the oven to the stove top, I badly burnt my pointer finger. The oven was at 425 degrees, so it should have protected my hand. The burn had a nice circle from the design on the silicone, which makes me think that if the whole thing was thicker, it would have worked. These work well as a trivet but not as protection while lifting or carrying anything hot, especially if it is heavy.",
