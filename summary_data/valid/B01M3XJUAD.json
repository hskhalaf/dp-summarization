I used both switches in the kitchen to light up a 16\u201d and 32\u201d LED light made for a dimmer switch. Remember your light must be able to dim for the switch to work correctly. Everything works great, Alexa controls my kitchen lights and the two Pico remotes control the kitchen lights anywhere in the house. Great investment.",

On one switch experienced a current leak due to how the common was wired in the house, which resulted in a light not completely turning off with the Lutron on/off switch. I contacted Lutron support and told them the problem which is fixed by the installation of a capacitor between the load and common wires. Instead of sending just one for free (~$11 each on amazon) they sent 3 for no charge! Hence, great tech support in addition to a great product. Importantly, it is also Homekit compatible.",
