The link to register the product with the company didn't work, and an email to their support account never got returned. I'm worried that if there is an issue with the chair the advertised warranty will not matter. Again, chair is just fine, but i've gotten nowhere trying to resolve an issue with Ootori.",

Ridiculous - not a cheap chair so you\u2019d think it would go at least a year before breaking.",

So this gives me great concern that the product was not registered and I can\u2019t get in touch with anyone. Makes the 3 year warranty questionable. One thing about the chair. I had to cut a yoga mat and put where my back is on the chair because it was too hard on my back, even at the lowest intensity. The remote beeps forever when you turn it on which is annoying. Also wish it was a light up remote.",
