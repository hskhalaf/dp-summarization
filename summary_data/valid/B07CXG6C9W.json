If you leave the WiFi option on, it drains the battery life within 9-10 hours even if you are not using the device. If you disable the WiFi, the battery life lasts a bit longer (approx 3-days) using the device 2-3 hours a day. The low rating is because of the very low battery life and inability to keep WiFi on all the time. Otherwise, my Kindle is my best friend. I most likely will return it because of the lack of battery longevity.",

Amazon representatives contacted me after seeing my original one star review but have been unable to explain or solve the Bluetooth problem. Update: I just bought a good pair of Bluetooth headphones which connected immediately to my iPad etc but it has proved absolutely impossible to pair with my Paperwhite.
