There are sufficient cleaning accessories included, however only two can attach to the vacuum at the same time. I agree with other reviews that care should be taken not to tip the unit over as the vacuum is top heavy. Overall I recommend this vacuum as long as the buyer is aware of these shortcomings.",

It\u2019s got a heck of a lot of power, awesome pop out wand, simple attachments so even my husband can figure out how to use it without having a meltdown. On off brush roll, easy to keep clean and between two cans, one a Maine coon who gets litter trapped all the time, a dog, a nine year old, and a construction worker, I REALLY love this vacuum!!!!",

This vacumn works amazingly well at picking up pet hair, dust, dirt and \u201cstuff\u201d. Haven\u2019t used attachments yet, but seems to be very versatile. Well worth the money simply as floor vacumn and rest is a bonus.",

This Shark out performs my Dyson that had several holes in the cheap hose. Not only the holes in the hose, but a broken head and another broken piece. I don't foresee any issues with this Shark. The price was not even close to as high as the Dyson. I really love all the cool attachments and the suction adjustment feature. I have high pile carpet so the Dyson was about impossible to push. Buy a Shark!",

A total of 3 vacuums, all with the same piece of metal exposed to continuously shock me when i use it. Do NOT purchase this! Unless you enjoy being shocked...",

The first 2 cannisters were filled with hair my previous vacuum could not pick up apparently. The last cannister was filled with dirt my last vacuum could not pick up. It honestly left me a little disgusted at how much dirt had been sitting on my carpet. This is a great vacuum. A little heavy for stair use, but a great vacuum.",

Shark has chosen to control suction power rather than adjust brush height...perfect!! I have had a multitude of vacuums over the past 42 years...and this is the best, bar none.

We have loved our Shark hand vac and Ninja blender, so we were hoping this would be good as well. Fortunately, it is! The suction is great, it maneuvers as well as the Dyson Ball, and it is actually easier to empty the bin! The wand is also easier to use and the attachments work as they should.
