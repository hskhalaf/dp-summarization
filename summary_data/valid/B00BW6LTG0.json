The problem wasn't the battery. The battery wasn't making good contact in the camera. I cut a thin piece of cardboard ( I used a aspirin box) and placed it on the battery before I closed the lid. It worked for 3 years before my dog chewed up the camera.I have since bought another SX280 from amazon March 2017. It seems they have fixed the contact problem. I have had no problems with the camera and I have used it extensively.",

Haven't used it enough to tell you how it does at night or with rapid shots or in motion, but for a basic point and shoot, this thing is amongst the top. I would highly recommend a back up battery.

      "text": "Long ago I purchased a 35 millimeter camera and thought it couldn't get any better. Well, it has. Since their beginning Digital cameras have come a long way and the Canon PowerShot SX280 12.1MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Image is proof. I don't think, for the money, picture quality and functionality this camera can be beat. It's compact and can fit in your shirt pocket so you don't need a large clumsy camera bag to hoss it around. :-)",

However a major flaw with this camera was that the video function basically does not work. When you try to take a video it says that the battery is dieing, and then after a few seconds it dies... However, the battery is not actually dead because you can turn it back on to picture mode on the camera will have full battery life again!! It does not matter charged the battery is.. The camera will not take videos longer than a few seconds.",

It does not have rear facing\npicture capability.The camera's lens embodies the quality and legacy of Genuine Canon Optics with advantages that go far beyond making the camera slim enough to slip in your pocket and carry anywhere. With a range of 25\u2013500mm (35mm equivalent), the lens gives you the power to capture the full breadth of scenes, with details you've never captured before. Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nBEAUTIFUL IMAGES AND FAST PERFORMANCE START HERE\n12.1 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nThe PowerShot SX280 HS employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.\n\nCANON DIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe PowerShot SX280 HS is equipped with Canon's very latest proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor makes several important advancements, including improved sensitivity that allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions. Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. In addition, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor enables video recording in MP4 format. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM FOR EXCEPTIONAL LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE UP TO ISO 6400\nThe PowerShot SX280 HS gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon's latest-generation DIGIC 6 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you'll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400; beautiful low-light shots are possible with maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and videos.\n\nFULL HD VIDEO THAT'S BETTER THAN EVER\n1080P/60P FULL HD VIDEO\nWith the camera's advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor enabling MP4 format recording, the PowerShot SX280 HS lets you shoot video at a selectable frame rate of 60 fps or 30 fps. 1080p/60p Full HD video is extraordinarily smooth and rich in playback, ensuring that your important memories and creative film clips look their absolute best. Video recorded at 30 fps has also been improved through the combination of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor and Fine Movie Detail Processing, with reduced noise and high resolution.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nSMART AUTO\nSmart AUTO for the PowerShot SX280 HS has been significantly expanded, making it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images \u2013 and videos \u2013 you're looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as \"keeper\" shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX280 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.\n\nFACE ID\nFace ID on the PowerShot SX280 HS gives you an easy way to improve every shot of the people you love. Simply take a picture of up to 12 faces you would like the camera to register, then enter names and ages. Once a person is registered, the camera will pick him or her out of a group (even against a busy background) and adjust focus and exposure to his or her face, even recognizing faces in profile. Face ID is particularly great for shots of babies and children. The system can pick your baby out of a group of children, focus on your baby when pictured with an adult, and capture the best smile by taking three successive images when the smile is detected. The flash is even disabled so as not to startle the baby and interrupt the moment. Older children in motion are tracked, with focus and exposure continually adjusted with Servo AF; with one shutter press three successive images are captured so the best shot is never missed. And because you'll identify each face you register, Face ID makes it easy to search images by name.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nManual You have complete control of exposure, selecting both aperture and shutter speed manually. Aperture-priority You set the aperture, controlling depth-of-field. The camera automatically selects the shutter speed. Shutter-priority You select the shutter speed, and the camera automatically selects the appropriate aperture. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Live View Control Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls. Movie Digest & Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day's worth of clips are then combined into a single video. Smart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Sports The camera uses high shutter speeds to capture fast-moving subjects. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. High-Speed Burst HQ Captures fast-action shots at full resolution, providing continuous shooting when the shutter button is held down.

Movie Digest records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, any time you're shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this \"highlight reel\" is more beautiful than ever. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot SX280 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. THE IDEAL TRAVELING COMPANION\nGPS TECHNOLOGY\nThe PowerShot SX280 HS digital camera is equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)## technology. Now you can travel the world and let the camera automatically record the location and local time of your stills and videos. The camera can also use the GPS unit to automatically set the exact time. You can maximize the usefulness of the GPS feature by using the special bundled Map Utility software that makes it fun to share the memories of your world adventures. In addition to displaying all your photos' locations on a world map, the camera's GPS system can also track your route from photo to photo \u2013 a great way to visualize each trip! You can also create and share custom maps and personal mini-travel guides with friends and family members.\n\n## In certain countries and regions, the use of GPS may be restricted. Therefore, be sure to use GPS in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country or region. Be particularly careful when traveling outside your home country. As a signal is received from GPS satellites, take sufficient measures when using in locations where the use of electronics is regulated.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nECO MODE\nThe PowerShot SX280 HS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management.
