The apple magic keyboard very flat, has everything at the right place and looks good. I'm really excited because the keyboard now connects via lightening - USB cable to the desktop. Bluetooth only was for me always terrible, as the batteries would go out or shake and lose connection, or have multiple keyboards interfere with each other. One can now use the keyboard with or without bluetooth. I'm writing this on this keyboard on a linux desktop.",

It wasn't immediate for me but that's normal when adjusting to new keyboards. The Arrow Keys are different on this keyboard -- like the MacBook Pro's keyboard. Overall, I am pleased with the Apple Magic Keyboard (rechargeable) and look forward to years of use (as the previous model lasted).",

Maybe it is just my wrists or something, but this is one case where I feel thinner is not necessarily better.",
