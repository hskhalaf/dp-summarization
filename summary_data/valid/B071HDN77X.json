Front panel was dented, had to pry the bottom bracket 'straight' to make work, etc. Love the dishwasher itself, but to pay this much and be forced to install a damaged item I would expect a response at least...",

Also, the spray heads must not be long enough because the dishes in the corners remain dirty after the cycle. For a brand new dishwasher, I\u2019m not happy. Update 5/20/2020: I have figured out if I always run it on the \u201cheavy wash\u201d cycle instead of \u201cnormal\u201d, it does a decent job of getting the dishes clean (although not 100%).",
