That aside, anything that connects with the force of this hammer and your swing will be obliterated by the 20lb titan sized head. Bottom line is if you can pick up a 20lb sledge get this one with the 36 in handle because it\u2019s built like a tank durability wise and hits just as hard and the 20lb head will obliterate anything on the first hit.
