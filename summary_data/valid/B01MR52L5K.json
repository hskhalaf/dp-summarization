Unfortunately, I let my temper get the better of me and tossed it instead of returning it. You'd think something that could be so dangerous would be a bit more quality. I only gave it 2 stars because the trees are down and no one died.",

The \"come-along\" did the job, so I have it two stars, not one. The safety catch on the main hook fell off. The teeth to engage the gear around the take-up spool, had to be physically held to the gear while pulling the handle, or the spring pulled the teeth away and disengaged. Everything felt cheap. I would not attempt to pull anything close to 2,000 pounds with this device, let alone 4,000. I would not recommend this product.",

I haven't used it with a load yet, but I anticipate it will be a royal PITA to release the pawl. Plus there's no easy way to convert it to single pull. You're stuck with the pulley on the cable unless you want to deal with snap rings and lock washers.",

I pulled the tree upright-strait and used another winch to stretch some wire rope to anchor it against another tree. It did the job. I would have given it 5 stars if the directions for releasing the tension was a lot more clearer. The diagram was not clear at all. I never found out how to release the tension by the directions and the diagram. I had to cut the other side of the wire rope from the opposite side to get the winch back. Does anyone know where I can get better directions how to release?",
