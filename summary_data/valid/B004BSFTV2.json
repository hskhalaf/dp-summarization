As an independent administrator for a number of corps here in NYC, most of my clients in the past have relied on \"popular\" ink jet brands that are not only expensive to operate, but lack in image quality and are many times, unreliable when connecting to newer \"digital\" fax lines. This one vastly surpasses not only in the volume of pages provided as a laser printer, but offers an impressive image quality when used either as a fax or copier that's very close to an original. This Panasonic fax/copier, is an excellent price with a quality output that's hard to beat, even with the more expensive brands.",
