I adopted a little rat and fed him almost exclusively Kaytee pellets (aside from treats) and I believe he would have lived longer and been healthier had I known about Oxbow sooner. I would encourage heavy supplementing with fruits, veggies, and proteins or just going with Oxbow Adult rat formula. It's a little more expensive, but if you buy in bulk here on Amazon the price is very comparable.",

The mice tend to eat it more than the rats, but I offer it as a chewable option for tooth health and something else to do. I would not recommend it as a sole source of nutrition unless your animal has always been brought up on lab block only. Once they get a forage mix they'll never go back lol.",

Sice it does contain corn and molasses which are sugary, care should be taken when using it for Campbells's Russian Hamsters as they are prone to diabetes. All my hamsters prefer the taste to this brand over other brand blocks such as \"Mazuri\". This also seems to have better ingredients. I also supplement with higher fiber foods including \"Oxbow's Hamster Essentials\", fresh dandelion leaves and flowers, and broccoli. I trust the nutrition though and the protein level is correct if breeding your hamster.",
