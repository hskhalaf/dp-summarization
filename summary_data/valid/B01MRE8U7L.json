The containers they come packaged in is usually thin walled and breaks apart while riding in my service truck. I\u2019m sure glad I tried these out and then bought 2 more sets. They stack nicely in my truck bins and easy to see what\u2019s in them without having to label or pull lids off. Highly recommend this product.",

I wanted to return the product but it does not have free returns. Yes, these items were both my responsibility to figure out before I ordered them, that is why I will give 3 stars since the product is nice.",
