      "text": "As someone with all of my music in iTunes (and an Apple Music subscriber) Airplay speakers are a must.Much better than Bluetooth, since I can control with my phone, but the music is actually streaming from the computer. This way, my wife and I can each control things, and also come and go, or use our phones for other things without interfering with the music. Multiple speaker setups are supported as well. Now I just wish the Remote App would get an update to work better with Apple Music. We've never had any issues with the wireless connection. We routinely take the speaker up or down one flight from the router, or even out to the deck with no dropouts.",

I haven't used it yet, but I gave one of these to my son, and another to a good friend, and they both love it (as they should). I've heard it at my friend's house, and it sounds every bit as good as it did on the company's website demo video.",

Despite being a simple process, it can be very difficult to get this device to connect to a wireless network, often requiring multiple attempts. Once connected, the device doesn't always appear on my iPhone (it appears more often on iTunes on my MacBook). If I can get it to actually play music, there is a skip every 15 seconds or so. Many of the issues with this product might be due to AirPlay rather than anything Philips is responsible for. Still, the product itself is very frustrating to use.",
