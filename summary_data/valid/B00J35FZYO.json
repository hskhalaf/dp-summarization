Sturdy enough for shooting and goalie practice. Aluminum frame has withstood two seasons plus a Wisconsin winter in between (stored outside). Light enough to move around for mowing, etc. Cons: The included net is really not sized well. You're going to work to stretch it into place. Paint is fading in its 2nd year. This is minor when it comes down to it, but worth mentioning. I wouldn't recommend it for team or game use, but that's not what it's intended for in the first place.",

      "text": "Easy to assemble. After reading other reviews prior to purchasing where others reported issues with having not enough rope to attach the net to the frame, I opted to use zip ties from the start. If that's the way you go with your assembly, make sure you go heavy duty on the zip ties. I purchased and assembled this net in March. It has seen heavy, regular use for 7 months now not only from just my 3 boys, but their neighborhood friends as well. 2 of them are HS age so the net sees some pretty good, hard shots. No issues to speak of in that time period other than replacing zip ties that get blasted off.",

It was a little time consuming to string this goal but worth it, the net behaves more like a collegiate level goal. While lightweight and easy to move, it seems very sturdy. My son averages 75 mph on his shot from 20 ft out...3 weeks of use and it seems to be taking a good amount of strain from shots to the corners and on the pipes. No tears or signs of wear with 100s of shots already logged. Very pleased.",

You can move this goal around - it doesn't weigh a ton like other goal post. However, the only improvement I may suggest is to make this lacrosse goal collapsible. I would like to be able to take this to a park or somewhere to play. Also, replace the rope the manufacturer suggest to use to tie the netting to the goal post. Unfortunately, you may need to purchase a separate bungee cords for this if you do not want to use the ropes. Overall, I am very satisfied with purchase.",
