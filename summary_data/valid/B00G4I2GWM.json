Not sports-car level, but on a 2011 Explorer Limited, that's not what I was expecting. I've put 3k on them so far, and I'd have no problems buying them again. Edit - one year, and almost 28k miles on them, they're still as noisy, but holding up extremely well. Cornering is still great, wet traction is still great. I'd still have no problems buying another set if and when I need to.",

      "text": "Installed on a 2012 Ford Explorer Limited. They must have changed the tires since all the 'noisy' feedback*, I ended up checking other online resources and did not see the same sort of comments being left. I find them to be slightly louder than the Hankook tires they replaced, at little growl when braking and a little more thump when hitting buckles in the concrete at highway speed. A very minimal difference making them well worth the saving over putting Hankook tires back on. They performed very well during a heavy rain recently, better than the Hankook tires. *I think Hankook dealers are leaving all of the \"they're noisy\" comments. ;-)",
