It is beyond easy to use with minimal buttons, touch screen and automatic or custom setting that are easy to access. Battery life is so much better than my old camera that would easily open and run it's battery down doing nothing. The screen is large and though I haven't used the flip screen much it IS useful. This could not be an easier camera to use....glad I bought when I did cause the new price is higher!",

The only issue that I have is that this phone definitely takes a better outside photo than and inside photo, but that just takes a little adjustment to the settings if you know where to look.",

I like the pictures as well as far as I am concerened they are of good quality. Another thing that I enjoy about the camera is thyou can pause is that when I am filming I can pause instead of having to stop and make a new video.",
