They aren't white, but are labeled as such. When they're up, it's not a big deal unless something bright white is next to them. I choose these over other brands because for $9, you can't beat it. They were fairly easy to install too. Overall, I recommend these. I just ordered 2 more for my office. Eventually we will put quality wood blinds up, but these will do for now.",
