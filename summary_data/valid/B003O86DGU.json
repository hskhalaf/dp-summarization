I immediately upholstered clear vinyl over the seats during the assembly process prior to being bolted on. Disregarding the few pieces of grass that got under my vinyl, this made the seats more durable and waterproof.",

I was about to purchase this toy on another site for way more money and decided to check here first so I could get it sooner and to my surprise it was here for way less. It was super easy to put together and it's amazing quality. The seat is extra big and cushioned so smaller and less coordinated kids can ride it safely. It's designed to stay floating so if one kid jumps off it doesn't send the other crashing like it did when I was a kid. So impressed with this toy and was the best $85 ever spent. Our kids love it",

Of course, the younger kids really are having fun. This teeter totter is a little big for the toddler crowd, but in our world the bigger kids joined the little kids so all could ride.",

I have kids ages 2-5 and they need supervision using it. When one child is on it, it requires an adult to hold down the other side so the child can get on.

      "text": "We have had this for a little over a month and the seat has already cracked. It has not been used more than a half dozen times by 2 small children, not even heavy and one of the seats is cracking and the paint is chipping off too. It is a mess and I now feel a total waste of my money. I gave my first review as somewhat positive only because it was not good for our 3 year old, seemed dangerous the seat is large, but now I am furious at the short life of this toy and it is beyond the return time so we have no options.",
