      "text": "Nice boot. I really wanted to keep these because I like the look and the construction seems good. But for me they are way too narrow, even the 2EE. The toe box was very small and cramped my toes badly. while the heel section was loose. I went down a half size like recommended by Danner (I called them too). The Danner person suggested trying the version of this boot without Gor-tex which supposedly runs wider. I didnt do that so I'm not sure if this is true or not. I sent them back and got a pair of Merrell Wilderness. Extremely happy!",

This pair is the best looking, for sure. I HIGHLY recommend sizing down at least 1/2 of a size from what you typically wear. I wear a size 12 in every shoe/boot I own, but I had the chance to try on a pair at a local Danner store before buying. My feet were swimming in a size 12. I ended up buying a size 11 EE and they fit perfectly.",

The craftsmanship is second to none and will last a very long time. Also want to say thankyou to Amazon for shipping these awesome boots to Australia\ud83d\udc4d.

After conditioning, re-lacing and putting in inserts (from other boots) I immediately went on a 1hr urban walk over diverse terrain with my Dane. Zero hot spots, zero fatigue from the concrete, great grip (wet and hilly conditions), and no worry of street water stains. Highly recommended if looking for a high-end, great looking boot.",

Two sets of red laces come with this boot (flat and round) as well as a Danner Select leather tag story book.
