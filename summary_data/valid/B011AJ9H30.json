They were obviously worn more than a couple of times previously, which like I said, I thought I was buying a brand new pair of sandals. No where were these sandals advertised as \"used\". There is mudd stuck on the sole of both sandals. They smell like feet. The worst part is that the back strap on the right sandal is completely cut in half so I couldnt wear these if I wanted to.",

I wanted to love these so much but couldn't. The two positives of the shoes are the vibrant color straps and sturdiness of the sole. I bet these would be great for walking long distances if they were able to be broken in.",

I would recommend that if you are considering purchasing a pair, opt for the wide sizes unless you have truly skinny feet.",
