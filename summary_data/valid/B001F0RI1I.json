I rarely have any issues with paper or card stock jamming. I would say the color results are about the best I've seen in smaller color laser printers, especially on glossy paper. I do not print out photos, but use this to create DVD covers for weddings and plays, or for promotional material at our church. I always use it to print on card stock, even if black and white, because it handles the heavier stock perfectly.",

It had my CPU pegged for days, so I finally disabled from automatically starting. I'd give the printer four stars because of this issue, but I like the printer so much so far that I'll give it five.

We must have printed thousands and thousands of pages and this machine has never, ever jammed, it just works! The print quality is excellent too.
