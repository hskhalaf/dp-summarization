Other than the feeling of lots of weight and feeling like it would lean to the side, item is nicely made.",

Weird that they would have both models for sale, same price without emphasizing the differences. Forget this one: buy the adjustable one.",

I marched with her about 3 hours using this sling and the wide band was remarkably comfortable on my shoulder. It was VERY hot but this sling was breathable and didn't make me or Sierra overheat. Afterwards, the sling washed just fine in the washing machine and we line dried it. Thank You for the great comfortable sling!",

Then my husband and I can get out workout in. Its super soft, easy to clean. I have washed ten times and it is still brightly colored. My Yorkie snuggles down into it. Then when she wants to look out she pops out. It is big enough to hold her as she gets to full grown. I am super happy with this purchase.",

      "text": "I purchased this for a miniature dachshund wondering if it would be large enough to comfortably accommodate their longer bodies. My dachshund Is around 10 pounds and has plenty or room to curl up, sit up or hang one paw out while she is looking around. Nice thick padding along the length of the shoulder prevents shoulder and neck fatigue even after several hours. The Carrier is also great for taking with you when out for a walk in case your fur baby gets tired. Easily machine washes and comes out soft and looking great.",

It definitely shows it\u2019s wear but does the job! Some sort of cushion/prop was very necessary when he was 3-6pounds and he only recent grew big enough to sit in it comfortably (we live in a very warm climate so having him in with a blanket is not always ideal and limited the usage. Now that we\u2019re approaching cooler months it\u2019s not an issue)",

      "text": "This is my second Alfie (lost the first one) and I love them! My Pomeranian always has to be by my side or held when we are at the cabin or family events - this makes life so much easier - my Pom also loves sleeping in this, so I never have to worry about her not wanting to use it or hop out. I will repurchase if I ever need another one again!",

Even though she is only 6lbs, it put all the weight on my shoulder/neck and it bumped around like crazy on my hip as I walked. It's nice that it has a latch to hook the dog's leash to. Ultimately, it just didn't work out for me.",

I had it shipped same day because I planned on using it ASAP so I didn't wash it. Cotton whole body was blue from the material on the inside. It looked like I had dyed him.

He loves the attention, but sometimes there is no time. Him cuddled up in his alfie sling cuts way down on that. He wants to pop his head out he can, but it draws way less attention than holding him.
