Well, my Tough Cover arrived, and surprise, surprise, I don't need to bother with Honda, this is awesome. The cover is made of a very substantial fabric and covers my mower with room to spare. Very surprised to find such a high end item at such a reasonable price. Sure wish Tough Cover made snowblower covers, I would be first in line.",

This does require smoothing it out to prevent water pooling, and the drawstring is not necessary -- which is good as it is hard to draw. The storage bag is nice and most folk will find something else to do with it.",

I was initially pleased by the cover, but the amount of fading detracts from the appearance and is a little disconcerting after just four months. If it holds together being in the sun until November and then semi-protected from the snowy winter weather, I'll consider it a value for the price and update rating to 5 stars.",

    "description": "The walk-behind lawn mower cover by ToughCover has been designed with longevity in mind. Constructed of heavy-duty 600D marine-grade fabric with double-stitched seams and interior waterproof coating, our cover will protect your investment for years to come.\n\nTIPS FOR CHOOSING A HIGH-QUALITY MOWER COVER\n\nFABRIC TYPE: Fabric strength is determined by a \u201cDenier\u201d number. Denier (abbreviated D), is a unit of measure for the mass density of fibers. Simply put, the higher the denier number, the stronger the fabric. Many mower covers are made with 300D, 200D, or even 150D fabric, which is a much less durable material. Our 600D fabric is robust enough to withstand the harshest environment.\n\nCOVER WEIGHT: Compare the item weight when shopping for a new cover. A cover made with thin, flimsy material will be very light. At 2.5 lbs, the lawn mower cover by ToughCover is one of the heaviest, most durable covers on the market.\n\nWARRANTY: We stand behind our 12-month unconditional warranty and take pride in offering unparalleled customer service. If you ever have any issues or questions regarding your cover purchase, just contact us and we\u2019ll take care of it!\n\nProduct Features:\n600D marine grade fabric\nDouble stitched seams\nInterior waterproof coating\nUniversal fit\nBonus storage bag\n\nOur lawn mower cover can be used for popular models from brands such as Craftsman, Honda, Husqvarna, Toro, John Deere and more, as it provides enough room to store even the largest mowers currently on the market!",
