Stuffed to the max, no trouble as carry-on with American Airlines. - I did add a side pouch for drinks. One that easily detached as my \"personal item\" on flights. - for EDC, the 2 compression straps work okay-ish at reducing the profile but could be revamped to pull at 4 points without interfering with the side pockets.",

The pack comes with loops to attach hip strap and is highly recommended that you get one to accompany this pack (if you will be carrying a heavy load). Tons of storage and little organizers everywhere in the pack and mollying on outside allows for more. zippers are strong and durable (which is what fails on many other packs).",

      "text": "This bag functions well for both hiking and everyday use. On the average day I keep it filled with a few books, writing implements, a change of clothes, a laptop, a digital camera, and additional lenses. Everything is compartmentalized and easy to find, and the weight is disributed well so it is comfortable to wear. When used for hiking it has pockets for just about everything you could imagine, so nothing gets lost or takes a long time to search for.",

If you want quality, durability, and a backpack that is functional for being out in the woods, hiking, traveling or just for school, you won't be sorry. He loves it. There are plenty of compartment and built solid for years of use. They sent us a complimentary smaller 12 backpack which is smaller than this and it is superb, just smaller that can be used for daily trips out. My son uses the Day Rush for weekend swim meets. I'm an outdoorsman. The 1 Day Rush is on my wish list.",
