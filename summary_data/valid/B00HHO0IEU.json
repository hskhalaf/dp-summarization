      "text": "We are new to the PureSpa and so far, delighted! I was very hesitant about spending the money for this product. How good can an inflatable hot tub be?!.....AMAZING!! We live in Cincinnati where the weather is unpredictable. It was 55 when we set it up and it was 25 and snowing that night. It took 2 full days for the water temperature to get from 50 to 101. Once it did, it maintains pretty well. Set up was so easy and took less than an hour from start to finish. We\u2019ve always wanted a hot tub but couldn\u2019t afford one or the installation of one. This was a perfect option for us and it honestly does not disappoint!",

Our replacement has preformed well for over a month keeping temperature near 104 even with snow coming down but temperatures do fall faster when bubbles are engaged. We chose intex after purchasing a intex kayak couple years ago and a above ground intex pool last summer and a few pool toys they have all held up well.",

      "text": "We enjoyed the spa for the fall and spring. But when water starting squirting out of the control panel, we took it off and found the faulty part. After trying to find the replacement on the website and then calling and waiting on hold for hours, I found out that A. the warranty was voided because we reacted to water flying out of the panel by taking it apart and B. we can only replace the entire panel for $256. So, it was alright while it lasted but customer service is a joke and it is obviously considered a disposable product. Don't waste your money.",

So for about an $1.00 a day you can have a hot tub, if you use it everyday. 2 stars because it worked but did not last as long as I would have hoped for the price.

I've set a 104 degree temperature and it gets close. You lose heat quickly when you take off the cover -- primarily because of the six foot diameter size... lots of surface for the heat to escape.
