I can't imagine cooking anything these tools couldn't handle. All of the straps were intact and hold everything tight. I am pleased.",

All the pieces held up well outside, even during the winter here in Idaho, when we left them outside in the weather. We barbecue every weekend, and set still looks like it's brand new. Everything cleans up well in the dishwasher. The case is of good quality as well, and is good for our camping trips to the mountains.",
