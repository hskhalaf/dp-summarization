My favorite keyboard has always been the Microsoft 4000, However, the Microsoft usually runs approx. $50, so getting this one for $30 was too good to turn down. And I am glad I didn't turn it down. it is very comfortable to use as I can spend up to 10 hours at work!",

And fairly often I hit two keys in a row, but the first one hangs up and the letters are printed on the wrong order. I have not had this problem with prior keyboards. If you want an ergonomic keyboard, don't get this one. Go somewhere you can try out keyboards, so you don't get stuck with one like this.",

Does no one make a truly ergonomic keyboard that requires only a very light touch to depress the keys? I love the feel of my wife's Mac keyboard, but Apple doesn't seem to make an ergonomic keyboard.",
