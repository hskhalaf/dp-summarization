The internal speakers are ok for dialogue but not much else, but connection via a aux out to my Bose sound touch 30 makes movies come alive, you can also connect via blue tooth. Negatives: A slight curve on the screen when protecting 100\" and really not for viewing in the daytime, im sure there is a better picture from other ust projectors at this money, however for it connectivity, portability, true full hd, connected to a ps4 it's great.",

Hundred inch picture on the wall, headphone jack to an old Bose speaker - the best viewing experience I have had. Better than the cinema, as there are no distractions and you can be as close as you like to a massive image. I worried that I'd never use it, but I use it regularly - paired with a Fire TV stick.",

As I am only really using this for gaming it is not such an issue for me right now but I am sure I will be cheesed right off in the future if I wanted to properly use it for watching movies as I'll now need to fudge it to do that.",

It's a dumb decision by the reseller to take out webOS from this product in the UK. Having contacted LG support, they were surprised & blaming the reseller for the product not capable of doing what it says on their website regarding smart TV capabilities",

      "text": "The projector is straight out of the box plug in & play. The picture is brilliant but for a really large screen you need to place the projector down low. Mine is approximately 70cm away from the wall for a 120\u201d screen. 2.5m x 1.6 The only point to note is it works better in a darkened room so if you want the full cinema experience block out any light & it\u2019s amazing. As regards the sound I don\u2019t know as I am running it through an onkyo receiver, bowers & Wilkins setup. A complete bargain for \u00a3700 Photos added",

Use mainly for gaming and happy with the response time in game mode. Beats a traditional long throw projector. Not as bright as some of the competitors but found that the other brands were so bright it hurt my eyes this is just perfect for late evenings.",

Brightness is decent for the size, the 3D is amazing and flicker-free, there's no perceptible processing lag making it great for gaming. Ever played Rocket League on a 100in screen? No?
