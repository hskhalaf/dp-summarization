So I went to the UGG Australia website and had a live chat with customer service and they assure me they were legitimate.",

I don't have large calves (I wear a 30 jean) and have trouble getting the jean to look smooth getting the jean into the boot. I also find my toes getting cold in these much faster than my Emus. It could just be this pair; I have several pair of Uggs and this is my first issue. It's my first pair of talls, though. Needless to say I liked them enough to keep them, I just need some warmer days for my toes. :-)",

If you're looking for disposable boots, these are not ideal. But if you're looking for boots to invest a little $$ in that will stand up to winter weather (use good judgement - they're not that indestructible), you can't go wrong with Uggs classics. I highly - highly - highly recommend purchasing the protectant spray and cleaner. They come in a pre-packaged tin, I believe. Don't wear them until you've protected them. Just follow the directions - they're super easy - you can't go wrong. Enjoy!",

The price has changed dramatically, but when Hollywood decided they like something then I guess we all get stuck paying the higher prices. I live in Wisconsin and my boots usually last about three years, which isn't as great as my Sorels, but they are meant to be worn differently than Sorels. They are expensive but worth it if you have cold feet, because these keep you toasty warm. My shoe size is 8-1/2 and I wear an 8 in Uggs, which is a perfect fit.",

I understand that Amazon has to forward the order to the vendor but I have ordered several things over the past year that amazon did not stock directly and still had my order ship within no more than 48 hours. The boots are comfy but don't seem to be as nice as my black ones...half wondering if they are fake at this point but we'll see.",
