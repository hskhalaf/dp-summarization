    "description": "Color:Limited EditionThe classic functionality of Mr. Coffee's Simple Brew 5-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker helps you make rich-tasting, expertly brewed coffee without stress or mess. Enable the Delay Brew feature to schedule a brewing cycle first thing in the morning, so you can wake up to that invigorating aroma and start your day off right. Should you need a cup before the brew cycle is finished, Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause is a lifesaver. It stops brewing so you can pour freely, and then finishes the brewing cycle after you place the carafe back in position. The Simple Brew also features a removable basket filter that lifts out for quick and easy filling and cleaning. Whether you want a single cup or 5, this no-fuss automatic coffee maker will deliver the goods, time after time.",
