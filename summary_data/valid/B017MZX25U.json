      "verdict": "Brooks markets the Glycerin 14 as one of its flagship neutral and ultra-cushioned shoes. Although it does not match the truly max cushioned shoes of other brands, it does have a near pillowy cushioning and is substantially lighter than many of the competition. It offers excellent arch support, very supportive, and continues to deliver a flexible ride that belies the amount of cushioning. The shoe is quite light for 10Ks to mid-distance runs at moderate speed and packs enough cushioning for those who love to pile on the miles.",
      "pros": [
        "The sock-like fit and plush interior combine for an ultra-comfortable ride in the Glycerin 14, according to most of the reviews",
        "The highly-cushioned midsole muffles the force of impact",
        "It is almost an ounce lighter than the previous model",
        "The traction is great, based on the observations of several runners",
        "The arch support is exceptional for a neutral trainer, according to some",
        "It offers noticeable flexibility despite the heavy cushioning, as remarked by more than a handful",
        "The 14th edition of the Glycerin is extensively used by many for workouts as well",
        "A handful of runners really liked the shoe\u2019s capacity to accommodate orthotics",
        "The cushioning is adequately responsive, based on the experience of some runners",
        "A good number of runners were impressed by the Glycerin 14\u2019s durability"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Several Glycerin fans were disappointed with the tighter fit",
        "It runs a bit small, according to a few",
        "It is quite expensive",
        "A few users noted a squeaking sound when running in the latest version of the Glycerin",
        "The tongue is just too padded for a small group of runners"

Very comfortable- the only thing I don\u2019t like (hence 4 stars) is that the sole compound provides far less grip when the roads are damp / wet. Fine when it\u2019s dry.",
