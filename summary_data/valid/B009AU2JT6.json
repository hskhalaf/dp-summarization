Brand new after first configuration, it boots in no time, from power off to login screen...maybe 4 or 5 seconds !! My work sometimes involves some show off, so that`s why i will keep my Air... and the 12 hours battery with the Haswell new chip. I'm pretty sure in no time HP will release a haswell spectre...so, stay tuned... I think it will be difficult to find a prettier ultrabook out there ....",

The seller did not pay for shipping return on the defective product. This was disappointing. Also, the keyboard format was not US format, it was Canadian / French. I did not know this when purchasing the product, but the major concern was the defective battery.",

The keyboard is very smooth and the screen resolution is quite good, the RJ45 connector availability was the feature that made me choose the Spectre over the MacAir (and of course the price). However, the well known issue about the fan is real, it's noisy and you'll notice that from the begining. A good product for the price, best value for money in ultrabook category.",

There must be some trick to fixing this because I don't really want to send it back now that everything is installed as I want. But it's basically unusable without your second hand laying on the base.",
