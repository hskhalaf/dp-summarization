This dishwasher has only been installed and in-use for approximately 6 months. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.",

Having concerns about giving up so much cabinet space, our plumber suggested a smaller dishwasher, which I never knew existed. After reading all the reviews, and not finding any in stores, decided to order online. If you hire a plumber like we did, be sure to look it over beforehand for dents or damage in case you have to send it back. Ours had a small dent that I felt wouldn't really show. The installation went great. Cleans dishes beautifully and nice and quiet. Perfect for the two of us.",

A more serious problem is that a few months ago it stopped completely draining after wash cycles, leaving a pool of water in the base of the dishwasher. It does suck the remaining water out at the beginning of a new cycle, but clearly it's not supposed to leave a lake of standing water after a cycle. A technician is scheduled to come out next week for a warranty repair, so hopefully the problem can be resolved.",
