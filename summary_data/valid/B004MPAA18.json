Save your money and get an HHA or Spothogg.",

After that it was just all about fine tuning up to 50 yards. Now you can buy the HHA sight strips but I just use a sharpie just to mark 20, 30, 40, 50 yards. You can play around with it to use to your advantage, but this is without a doubt the best single pin sight I have bought for a decent price. The reason for the 4 stars was that it is not super smooth when sliding the yardage marker up and down.",
