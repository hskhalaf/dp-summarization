The only downside, and this would be true for any juicer, is that it takes a while to wash and juice the produce and then clean it all up.

I\u2019m loving the ability to juice at home instead of spending so much money at local shops. I looked at this for months before buying. It\u2019s easy to assemble and clean and so far no issues so speak of other than it not pulling out every single drop of juice I think it could. Such a big investment but I\u2019m saving money in the long run!",

It's well-designed, the motor is super quiet (I can juice while talking on the phone) and the parts are sturdy and durable. I may buy a few more of these as gifts... the juice has been delicious!",

My only complaint is the size of the feeder. It is tiny but I realize there is a reason for this and it helps to juice all ingredients perfectly.",

I bought this in November 2017, and have used it virtually every day since. I detox from time to time, but use for other vegetable juice combos and for fruit juices, including cantaloupe and apple. I juice apples as a base for my smoothies, especially since I cannot have any yogurt or dairy products. This is a breeze to clean; I always clean it immediately after use, so nothing every dries on it. You will not regret this purchase. It's truly been life-changing for me.",

You do have to prep larger veggies/fruits to be able to feed them through the chute, but clean up is a breeze, and there is a lot less moisture in the pulp as compared to other juicers I have tried.

This is not only a juicer, but also a pasta extruder and a food processor---so it has a multitude of purposes. The Omega J8006 is built very well and sturdily with stainless steel versus plastic. It's worth every single cent. Some of my favorite juices: My \"Green\" Juice, spiked with Cayenne Pepper; Watermelon Mint; Apple-Cinnamon; Carrot Ginger.",

This juicer has exceeded my expectations thus far. Will update my review in a few months with a more appropriate durability review.",

Freeze it into ice cubes dont let it set over night in fridge! It breaks down in the fridge! So make some ice cubes! When your ready for another shot just drop ice cubes into a blender and add some fresh juice choice! Lots you can do with the ice cubes!",

Aside from this, I am happy with the juicer, but it cannot be continuously run for any extended period of time, even when juicing something as soft as grapes.

Yes you need to slice and dice everything smaller, but we juice every day and now I make enough for 2 days, so don't have to do it every morning.

Try frozen bananas, frozen cherries cocoa nibs, almonds, vanilla and yogurt. Haven't made pasta yet, but I've heard it works well. The best juicer for greens con's: Slow (smaller opening, slower to process produce). You can't process soft fruit without extra thought (freeze them, or follow them with something firmer that will push the juice out)",
