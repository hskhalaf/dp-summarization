We've been using it on our glass shower doors since we have hard water and want to avoid spots. I checked the edge, to see if there was any mineral build up, but found the product is breaking down.

The current model works poorly.....takes multiple passes to get all of the water off. Examining the new model reveals that the squeegee edge material is much thinner than the old model. Looks like another example of a cost reduction which degrades the performance of the product. Very disappointed to see OXO do this, as generally OXO sells superior quality products.",

It is lightweight, ergonomic, and the handle hangs over the shower head, and lays flatly against the wall, so you mostly don't even notice it.

Fortunately it's cheap enough that I just keep ordering new ones. I suppose I could try to epoxy the hook in, but at this price point I don't care that much.",

      "text": "This is pretty nice, basic squeegee. Soft supple silicone blade with solid sturdy no slip handle. But the hook intended to attach to a shower shead/caddies/towel bar is not wide enough. Though the hook is flexible, it Seems like it will snap off when rotating and attaching to a shower head. If there were other colors and wider hook, I would give a higher rating.",
