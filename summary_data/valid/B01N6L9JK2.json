It is an 11 inch lazy Susan. My dad was able to attach the pieces together. We had to grind off the center part in the bottom of the craft holder. It came out really well though. I think spinning makes this a little bit nicer because you can see all the contents easily.",

I was specifically looking for a lazy susan types of storage with compartments to keep markers and pens organized for easy access when I found this. Mistakenly thought it spun, but it doesn't. Will have to purchase a separate lazy susan to compensate. Sad. It seems intuitive that you would want a spinning feature. Otherwise, I personally like the compartment sizes and the fact that each one can be removed from the tray. Those features will work for what I need -- just needs spinning to make it perfect.

I consider it a must-have item, and can't recommend it enough! Just buy it; you won't regret it! Edit: As many have pointed out, it doesn't spin/have Lazy-Susan featured.

      "text": "This product provides ample room to store many often used school supplies. It makes it easy to keep a workspace clean and organized, and my children can quickly spot what they need. The one drawback is that the Lazy Susan function on mine is next to useless. Rather than easily spin at a small touch, you have to grab hold of at least two compartments and exert a great deal of force to push the units around. More often than not, something on the other side will end up pushing off of the stand. That\u2019s why I am deducting one star.",
