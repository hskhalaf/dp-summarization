Aesthetics aside, my favorite feature is the wrist strap's fitment range and ease of adjustment. Being one with smaller than average wrists, I'm pleased to find that this watch is capable of fitting to my comfort.",

Google \"How to adjust Casio Calculator Watch Strap\". The watch feels a bit cheap in my opinion and that it could break easily (at least the band). Really the only thing I would change is make the band thicker and heavier. Note: The watch face is plastic. Based on researched this watch is sold in Asia markets but imported I believe.",
