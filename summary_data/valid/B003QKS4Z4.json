      "text": "I bought this in August 2016 and it worked great for months, it was responsive to motion from a good distance and I was very happy with it. I would have rated it 5 stars after a month of use. However, in the past two months the sensor aspect seems to have gotten worse and literally now I have to wave my hands very near the sensor for the light to go on.This is not what I paid $20.00 for and this should not be happening after 8 months of use. I am very disappointed and at this point would not recommend this product unless you don't mind getting inches from it and waving your hands.",

The product worked as intended from a motion detection turning on lights standpoint, but using two of them in my garage caused our RF garage opener to stop working intermittently. After researching the problem learned the sockets might be causing interference so I removed the sockets and presto the garage opener works 100% of the time. Started wondering if new static we getting sometimes on our Panasonic wireless portable phones was related; removed the other two sockets from hallway ceiling fixtures and presto the phone line static has gone away. Don't use this product if you have concerns about possible radio frequency interference.",

Now I keep my light switches always turned on in the garage and anytime someone walks in, it lights up the 3 LED light bulbs, automatically shutting them off after a few minutes of no motion. This is the splitter product I used:  And these are the LED bulbs I chose:  In 2020, I upgraded the light bulbs to some Barrina T5 LED tubes. You can link up to six per light socket. I used a little adaptor that turned the bottom of this motion sensor into a light socket. Loving this setup even more. The sensors have been flawless.",

Would like to give zero stars but can't. Update the motion on part of this device now works by placing in a different light bulb, however, the light is dim. I am going to try different lightbulbs over the next few weeks and will update, upgrading to 3 stars.",

That one has been installed above my children play area in the basement. That has also worked well so far. Just waiting to see if the products are durable or not. Some comments say the product will stop working after a month or so. I'll come update this review if that happens to me.",
