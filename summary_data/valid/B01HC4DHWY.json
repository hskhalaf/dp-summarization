I turned it off and took it outside and black smoke came out of it. I have contacted Amazon, who told me to contact Hurom. I have contacted Hurom USA three times and had no reply. I have contacted Hurom NZ who told me they can\u2019t help because I bought it from Amazon USA (we don\u2019t have a NZ Amazon). This juicer was extremely expensive and I can\u2019t use it, yet it is still within the warranty period???????",

The juicer comes with two filters and other accessories for making sorbets and tofu. The sorbets are really good (so far I've tried frozen bananas + strawberries + kiwi). As far as vegetables I have made some drinks using spinach, kale, broccoli, carrots, and apples - very delicious. Overall I am very happy with this juicer.",

The juicer cleans pretty easy and it easily taken apart and put back together. It is also of very good quality and of course it should be for that price. I was surprised of the motor running so quietly, you can barely hear it and he rose gold color is beautiful, I love this Juicer and I highly recommend it.",

I juiced mangos, strawberries , and pineapples. The pulp was so mushy. I can tell there was still a lot of juice that could have been extracted from it. I feel like I could have gotten more yield for what I put in.... i contacted them company. Hopefully they get back to me.",
