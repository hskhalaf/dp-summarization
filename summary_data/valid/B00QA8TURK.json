It seems to be well made considering the rep that the Chinese have for poor quality (I have had no real big issues on that account yet)., I would say, at this point, that the purchase is a good option for those wishing plyometric resistance equipment. The main drawback is that you cannot purchase bands alone. In that regard, look to compatibility elsewhere.",
