I didn't notice a smell to the mattress when i first opened it. I love the removable cover, soft. If i was to buy another one, I would choose a 10\"/12\" instead of an 8\", only because I prefer my bed up higher, (like on risers, high). The 8\" does what i needed so badly, to relieve my pain and get a great night's rest. 5*****star",

Firmness is entirely subjective so don\u2019t let my 4 stars distract you. It could easily be 5 stars to someone else. It arrived in perfect condition despite how rough shipping can be on products, especially something large and heavy\u2019ish like this. I highly recommend it!",
