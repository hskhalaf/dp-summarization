My only complaint would be that the box it came in was long enough to hold two of these end to end with room to spare. Needlessly oversized packaging!",

It's like having a weirdly long arm! IDEA FOR IMPROVEMENT; a cutout in the handle to loop a cord thru, so it could hang off my walker. Or on a hook.. I ended up tying something around the handle, which isn't as nice, but works. Great product, otherwise!",
