Finally, there's the price. At half the price there is no question that this is the tablet to buy.",

The supplied browser has a few quirks, as does the optional Firefox, but on the whole the applications work well. Screen resolution and color rendition are excellent, and the built-in camera produces good pictures and video.",

Still havent gotten chance to explorie all the functionalities, like hooking up to my samsung smart tv and stuff. Definitely worth the amazing price i got it for. Only complaint is that the cable for the charger is whey too short. But that is a minor issue. Great Tablet regardless.",

Not only does it give her some games to play but coupled with a Bluetooth keyboard she has found it works very well for her email and web browsing.

      "text": "I have had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for a little over a month now and I am very satisfied with it so far. I got this tablet after an extensive research on the different tabs on the market. This one seems to work just fine for what I need it for. I got it to use along with my laptop, the price was a good deal also. It takes good pictures, better than my wife's tablet. The wife likes this tablet so I may be buying her one to replace the one she has.",
