      "text": "I used the small K&H Manufacturing Lectro-Soft Outdoor Heated Bed in a home-made outdoor cat shelter all of last winter. I've left it outside in the shelter for a year now and it is still working perfectly. I removed the cover and instead covered the bed and bottom of the shelter with straw. This year I've replaced the straw with 100% polyester fleece blankets cut into strips. The fleece retains its warmth even when wet and is not dusty like the straw. This is a well-made product. The neighborhood stray cats certainly seem to love it during the cold winter.",

I tried putting in in the kitties' bed, and they weren't interested in it. I tried setting them on it and petting them for several minutes until they relaxed so the pad would heat up to their body temperature, but as soon as I left, they got up and went elsewhere. I left it there for a few more days hoping they would try it on their own, but they refused. It is just not any warmer than a regular blanket. Very disappointed. Will be returning.",

In addition, the soft cover is not held into place at all by anything and easily comes off when you try to move it or if it is stepped on. Poor lazy design. The could have something to secure it onto the plastic part. That\u2019s super annoying as you constantly have to affix the soft cover onto the plastic part repeatedly.",

Last winter, four orphan kittens survived through the coldest days by snuggling together in a shelter with one of these pads. The cats are mostly house pets that have been abandoned by their owners, or strayed. We provide shelters, food, and water, and when we can catch them, spaying and neutering and shots.",

All the feral's are gone now but one, and I built her a much smaller house, but the heater was too big for it. I bought this one because it was small. Wow, is it nice. My old heater was hard plastic, this one is soft. The cat absolutely loves the thing. It uses very little electricity but heats up nicely. Highly recommend this heater for a one cat house.",
