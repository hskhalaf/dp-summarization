Totally my fault for not checking out the pic better. I gave it to my 9 month old teething baby and he almost ruined the screen within minutes. It has a very thin plastic screen the can easily be dented by new sharp teeth. It is overall about one inch thick also and has a bit of weight to it. I can't wait to give it back to him when it's older. It has cool like dog graphics and helps them learn to count with visuals and how to answer a phone properly.",

She got years of \u2018regular play\u2019 out of it, though.. at least til age 4. Just bought one for my little niece, who turned one and she loves it too! I like the improvements they\u2019ve made, since buying my daughter\u2019s (light up screen, added pink coloring, & a bit more streamlined body). Very cute!

Still , I'd give this 99 out of 100. If the manufacturer wanted 101 out of 100 they'd paint it black and give it a silicone or bite-able case because that;s what kids do. Bite cellphones.

He enjoys pushing the different buttons. I like that it's not overwhelmingly loud when he holds it up to his eat. He hasn't figured out the volume switch yet though.",

Don't get me wrong, they still do. But this phone quickly replaces those things, since they love it so much. They think they are interacting with the screen when they touch it, and each button causes the dog to do something different. We HAD to order another one to stop the fighting around here. Thankfully it's not very expensive and prime shipping had it arrive in 2 days!!",

      "text": "Bought this for my 17 month son for Christmas. He LOVEs it, maybe even too much. He carries it around everywhere and if he leaves it somewhere you'll hear him looking for it \"phone? phone?..\" The functionality is pretty good. LCD display is basic, but functional, which probably helps make it sturdy. This has been dropped, thrown, kicked, etc and so far it held up (2 months). We're still on the first set of batteries, which is good. Press the buttons and there's both an audio response and video response.",

We have the stuffed Scout dog at home and he loves him...this thing is super cute as it counts with him and sings to him with Scout's voice. He presses the little buttons and it's wonderful for car rides that he would normally cry through. I'm considering purchasing another one so we can keep one is each car. Cute, would recommend, keeps the little guy entertained. Good purchase!",
