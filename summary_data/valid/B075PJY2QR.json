The organizer stays in place without strapping it down and though I haven't used it long, it appears efficient and will last me a long time. After using it awhile it is roomy enough for groceries for one person, but one thing I do not care for is how poorly the zippered cooler works. I like that I can lift it out and take it by the handle inside the house, but the zipper sticks and would prefer a lift-off cover for the cooler.",

It holds as much as I need it to and while it takes up a good portion of the trunk it can be folded for storage although I rarely do that.",
