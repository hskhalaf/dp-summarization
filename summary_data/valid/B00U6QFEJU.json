There was definitely a horrible fragrance from this soap. It was so bad, I was unable to get the smell off my face until I had kept rinsing it. I threw it straight into the garbage. I don't know if it would have moisturized my face or not. I did not give it a chance to find out. UGH. if I could have given it no stars I would have!",

This is the only thing I have tried... and I've tried sooo many things... that has worked for me. I love this bar. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and clean without that squeaky yucky feeling that comes with soaps stripping your natural oils and leaving soap residue. Using this with their moisturizer right after the shower before toweling off has transformed my usually very dry skin and my KP. I'm never using another brand again. Finally found my ride or die.",

One benefit is it seems to clear up my pimples because it dries them out, that's why I feel it's not moisturizing.",
