It pops in and out easy and is super easy to charge and pop back in. Easy to connect to my phone. The 2 problems I have are it doesn't get super loud and I have multiple shower heads so it gets drown out sometimes. Also it does this thing where it isn't playing certain instruments and sounds from certain bands and songs. Like it's pulling solely from a left or right and missing the other. Otherwise a pretty great product. I'll be excited for a beefed up version.",
