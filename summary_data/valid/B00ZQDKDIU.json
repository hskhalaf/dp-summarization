I see someone answered a question that its ok to use on dogs. No it is not so please be careful. Dogs have gotten sick from inhaling it. Aside from that, I am happy with my purchase.",

This is def a high concentration of tea tree oil, which is great for health purposes, but be prepared for the smell. So all-in-all I am glad I bought this one online instead of stopping by Trader Joe's like I originally intended.",
