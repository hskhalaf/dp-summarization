      "text": "This TV will automatically dim the screen if you display majority white (such as fullscreen web browsing during page loads) or bright scenes in movies/films where the majority of the screen becomes bright. This creates a sense of flickering or uneven display, and there are no options to disable the behavior. While this may be acceptable or even possible to ignore in a less expensive TV, uneven or uncontrollable picture quality issues are unacceptable in a TV this expensive. If you're looking to spend this much on a TV, buy something else. And if this problem doesn't sound like an issue, find something less expensive.",

The solution I found online is to power off the TV, unplug everything and wait 30 minutes. I have concerns that this might become permanent and who knows how long until they all stop working.
