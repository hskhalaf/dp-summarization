Never could get it to recognize tivo so really i am using the tivo universal remote which does everything i want for less dollars. sigh 2. Difficulty charging. There seems to be some usb the charger does not like. Other reviewers have had similar issues. 3. The ergonomics and intuitive nature of the design could be better. I don't think i will buy another logitech remote. To be fair, i am not sure there are any exceptional ones out there if this was one of the highest rated.",

You don't have to go back to the original remotes to changes settings, etc. Highly recommend this remote!

After three years, I figured it was time to replace it anyway. Then this one, after less than 4 months of use, started to have the exact same problem.

The primary advantage as I can see for the Model 700 over the 650 is this one comes with rechargeable batteries. And, it is black instead of silver colored. Logitech has many other more sophisticated models but this technology works well for the family and didn't want to have to learn our way around new remote controllers.",

I love Logitech and have been buying their products for ages, but I am not a fan of their design choices as of late. If this is the way things are going to be from now on, this will probably be the last harmony remote I buy.",

So I bought the relatively new 700 model and I have to say that I am thrilled with it. The ergonomics are much better than the 880, and the batteries are standard, over the counter AA NiMh rechargeable. I was able to use the same software setup from my 880, and five minutes after connecting the remote to my computer, it was operational. Battery life is over one week on a single charge (with fairly heavy use, 4-5 hours a day).",

Cons: If it doesn't function properly through the easy setup... it can take time to get all the tweeks right so it works as intended. Overall, it's great. Battery life is excellent (I think we charge ours about every other month). While the time to tweek it and make it work properly can be a bit long, the fact you CAN tweek it - is a huge plus. I'd definitely look at another Harmony remote in the future.",

The plastic sheet that covers the buttons is subject to wear and allowing the light to leak around the icons of the button. This happened to me after only two months.
