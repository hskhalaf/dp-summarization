The single axle front (lockable) makes steering much easier than strollers with two wheels in front. The only downside is that while the stroller folds down surprisingly flat, it is still quite heavy. If you don't need to lug it around, than it won't be an issue. The basket underneath is well-designed and roomy. The stroller as a whole feels high quality and durable. I would definitely recommend this stroller.",

Seems to follow all the necessary safety guidelines. Handle is comfortable to hold onto. Plenty of pocket space! No problems getting child in and out of harness. No problems getting it folded up quickly. Easy to wipe off canvas areas. Simply spray off tires with a hose for quick cleaning. Great design.",
