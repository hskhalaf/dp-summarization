I will say for heavy waterproof mascara, liner, or long lasting foundation, you may need a couple rinses, but I promise it will all come off and your skin won't feel like paper! :)",

It also does a pretty good job of removing any makeup I have on at the end of the day too, no need for additional makeup remover :)",

I used to always get dry cracked skin on the corners of my mouth, and this face wash has completely soothed those spots! The only con is that I feel like I have to use a bit more product than I usually would because it doesn\u2019t lather very much (that\u2019s only because it\u2019s organic). So it\u2019s worth it to me! I will definitely be purchasing this product again.",
