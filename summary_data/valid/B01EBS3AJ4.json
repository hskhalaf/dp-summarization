The cell phone attachment to take photos takes some effort to get everything set right to take photos and the reason I did not give 5 stars. But when it's right it works fine and will probably improve with some experience on my part. I will include a couple photos and I recommend the Gosky scope for watching wildlife from a stationary position on a tripod. Tonight I'm going to try to watch the ISS fly over.",
