They are about the size of the large kong which I was not expecting (I didn't really check the size, so my fault). They have some rubber prongs at the larger opening which I imagine is designed to hold onto a solid treat, although as they are rubber, not sure how effective that would really be. My pups are little (7, 11 and 13 lbs) so I wish these came in a smaller size. They also have a very distinct smell which I find a bit offputting. We will see what a run through the dishwasher does.",

We generally fill the squirrel with kibble, then cover the hole with peanut butter and she spends a happy session snacking. The little prongs are a huge improvement over the wide openings in kongs and other similar toys. Rubber is very durable, although because we use it with food, Ojai doesn't really chew it when it's not full. Highly recommended.",

They are very similar to a Kong toy but they have prongs in the round opening that helps keep the treats from coming out too easily. It takes my dog awhile to get all the treats (apples, carrots, cheese...) out once you stuff them in there! I used to buy them at Petsmart, but they quit selling them. Then I found them at another Pet store and they stopped selling them. Finally I found them on here and I bought 4 of them to make sure I had them for a while. Highly recommend if you have a dog that is good with puzzle toys!",

Each lasts at least a month or so for us, and we're glad to have a few spares ready for when one does need replacing after such regular and intense use. We look forward to continuing this for many years to come, and are very thankful for these fun busy buddies that definitely live up to their name.",
