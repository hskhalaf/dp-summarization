Seven and a half inches front to back isn't going to offer space for many tools unless you lay them length-wise, so forget about lining them up across the drawer left to right. Nonetheless, it is a decently made box, and I appreciate the ball bearing drawers. I've decided to use this box for odds and ends of screws, plugs, and various mechanical parts. I have a bigger Craftsman chest for tools, though it's not as well made as the Homak.",

I found the handle to be very weak and not a safe way to carry this box once filled with my tools. The two front latch does cannot handle the weigh and will buckle with very little stuff inside. I would consider a different box if you are a mobile person and require frequent moves. If you just need it in the garage then this might work for you. Instead I went with this one from sears which seems more reliable and sturdier. The Craftsman 26 in. Power Latch Tool Box",

The name \"Homak\" was coined after a sign that Sigmund saw on a hat store. Originally a manufacturer of steel kitchen cabinets, Homak Expanded its product offerings in the 1960s to included a separate line of hardware products such as toolboxes, tool cabinets, and other accessories. Homak's hardware line remained strong and was accepted in many major retail businesses of its time. Following Sigmund's death in 1979, his wife, Gertrude, ran the company for 25 years. Under Gertrude's guidance, Homak extended its product line with automotive, hospital, and sporting goods. In January of 2005 Homak was acquired by JVA and moved its office to western Pennsylvania. Its facility now resides in the Wampum Underground Commerce Center. Today, Homak emphasizes tool storage and gun cabinet security. The full product line consists of hand-carry toolboxes, tool bags, parts organizers, tool storage cabinets, workbenches, garage furniture, safety cabinets, spill containment systems, P.B & E. products, steel lockers, gun cabinets, fire-resistant safes, ammo storage boxes and accessories.
