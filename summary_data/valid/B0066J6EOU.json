      "text": "Others have said it more eloquently than I could, but I want to reiterate that this lens is completely amazing. The super-telephoto reach lets you grab those far off shots that would normally be missed, and it's also great for nature/flower photography. The slow aperture is not a big deal when shooting outdoors in decent light. The only negative is that the focusing is slow and with AF it can miss focus a lot, but I can't fault the lens for that when it costs $100!! I'll just let some recent photos I took speak for themselves. (Camera used: Olympus EM5 Mark II)",

It lets you get close up on action and wildlife. I'm using my lens with an Olympus E-PL5 and my pictures are with no filters or attachments. It does a great job with high speed sporting photography and it is even pretty decent at closeup macro photography. Update: I used this lens to capture the 2017 Total solar Eclipse. I was able to capture solar flares during totality. I'm really impressed with this lens for the price.",

I also have the Olympus 12-40mm PRO lens, and while that gives obviously superior images (I tested the same shot with both at 40mm), the gap isn't nearly as big as the price difference might indicate. Yes, this doesn't open particularly wide, so it's not suited to indoor or dimly lit shots... but if you just want a cheap, compact telephoto, I can't think of anything better. One final note: even though it's entirely plastic, the build quality feels surprisingly solid.",

I shoot a lot of debates and it's nice to be able to get good shots from a distance, without getting in anyone's way. However, getting enough light is a challenge at the higher end of the focal length. Stabilization is fairly solid but tracking and shooting is best done sitting or on a tripod. Thing is, it's light and gets the job done. And it's cheap. It won't be the fastest or the cleanest but it's given me options I didn't have before. Definitely will be using this a lot.",

It shoots best between f5.6 and F11 so it's not exactly a fast lens, but it focuses quickly (at least on my E-PL3) and is really sharp with great color. Is it a \"Pro\" lens? No, not really but mostly because it's kinda slow and isn't waterproofed. I can't imagine there's anything else out there that shoots as good and isn't at least 3x more expensive.",

Normally I use the 40-150 pro, which is much bigger and heavier and has some of the best image quality of any lens in the system. Don't expect that kind of performance and you'll be fine. It's got decent plastic construction, not the best Olympus does but not too bad, nicely damped focus ring, and a fairly smooth zoom ring that could be a little better.",

      "text": "This lens is an anniversary gift to my wife, a pro/am photographer. She is using it for nature photography, birds, trees, outdoor stuff. As such, the aperture is perfect. She really appreciates the light weight on her little Oly camera. She has also used it to capture tripod shots of 4th of July fireworks. She feels more \"pro than am\" now that she has a longer lens. Great price, nice lens, super service and delivery. Totally satisfied with Amazon and their sales fulfillment partners as usual.",

The Lumix doesn't have great auto focus and I rarely use it anyway but when I do it gets you close enough to switch over to manual focus and get it nice and dialed it. I dropped this with my camera off the top of a friends van and it still works! I was rather upset for a second then realized everything was fine! I would recommend this lens to anyone with a micro 4/3 camera!",

My 3000+ slide project became manageable again. Then I began using it for walks along the river in the evening when the deer come out, and it has worked great. An excellent lens, and even better when you can get it at a good price.",

I could not pass up on a lens that gives such exceptional performance for the price and it fits my infrequent need for a telephoto lens very well. I've been pleased with the optical performance. The build quality is certainly more than adequate for my occasional use and very good considering the modest cost. Great value for money.",

At 150 mm its a little less sharp but still respectable performance. Its lightweight plastic construction may limit its durability but at this price you can buy another when it wears out!
