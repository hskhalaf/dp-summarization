One straight and the other at a slight angle. The angle position works great for me. The bottom of the dust bin is flat and straight and seals nicely against the floor so all the dust goes in the pan and there are no annoying 'crumbs' left on the floor. I was worried when I first saw the broom that it would not sweep 'fine' dust, but it does very well. Bottom line, this works for me!",

To make matters worse, despite only using it periodically for less than a month, all the bristles began sticking out.",

Instead, it is heavy in the metal stick and handle, this hinders the ability to sweep well. Noticable difference in performance with wooden broomstick or plastic broomstick.",

It leaves dust under the bin each time and you end up chasing your tale trying to get the last of the dust. Other than that maddening game, it's fabulous.",
