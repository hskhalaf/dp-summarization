I had to wrap strips of duct tape around the plastic after they all broke apart so that would hold together. Great design and good promise - but cheap materials make this item a complete disaster. The metal will hold up and the front spreader is OK - but the most important part is in the back - and that is the weakest spot!! Dont waste your money on these trees until somebody makes the same design with better materials.....",
