I tried making almond milk with this maker once because the instructions said it can. It didn't turn out too well. I may have to re-read the instructions. Soy milk works just fine. I bought this maker for soymilk so I am not disappointed that my one attempt at almond milk failed. I would have bought this earlier if I had known this existed!!",

I have made more than 12 batches of soy milk and two of almond milk... and the left-over, high-fibre okara makes great omelets and can be used as a meat substitute. The soy milk can also be turned into \"flower tofu\" by adding a coagulant and some ginger syrup. It has been both a fun and educational purchase.",

It makes it easier to clean, seems to propel the main product OUT of the filter leaving less not more product in the filter zone. I like the idea that it has both a heating and a cold grind capability and that it literally could be used like a coffee pot for roasted beans (although that might affect the flavor of anything else you put in it).",

I use it to make cashew & almond milk at least a couple times a week (see youtube for instructions and how-to's) the taste is amazing and I know every ingredient that goes into our milks (very important as they are putting more and more into store bought milks these days!) plus, the cost effectiveness and availability of having milk on hand easily outweighs the one time output on the price of the unit. Great value and a great product.",
