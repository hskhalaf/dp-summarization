I had repeatedly tried covering the wheels with plastic held down by bungee cords, but they always managed to work free in a storm. This product is exactly as advertised, and after a few months exposure to the elements, there is no visible degradation from sun or water. The drawstring at the bottom keeps the cover on in 25+ mph winds. I wish it had a stiffener on top so that water doesn't collect and provide a breeding spot for mosquitoes, but I don't think it was designed for outdoor storage. Highly recommended.",

It\u2019s roomy but not too baggy at all and I\u2019ll be able to use it in the future if I ever switch to an SUV or truck. The material is thick but also pretty soft. Good quality zipper and a drawstring at the bottom. Came with a nice storage bag too. In my opinion this would still be a solid purchase at twice the price. I definitely recommend this cover for indoors. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intended for outdoors and probably wouldn\u2019t hold up to the elements.",

    "title": "Heininger 5392 Large GarageMate TireHide (Fits up to 30\" Tires)",
    "description": "Size:LargeYou're smart enough to know that your vehicle needs different tires for different types of fun-snow tires for winter, high-performance tires for track days, off-road tires when you're really headed, you know, off-road. But keeping that second (or third) set of tires from cluttering up your man-cave garage when they're not attached to your vehicle? Well, that's the trick. TireHide is designed to quickly and easily slide over a stacked cylinder of four tires, and it does more than just hide your tires. It keeps your tires (and your killer plus-3 chromes) clean, dust-free and protected from errant garage spills like brake fluid, paint thinner or liquids from 12-ounce cans. It helps keep mice from building cozy nests in your Pirellis. And it makes the chore of swapping out your hoops that much easier because they'll be clean and shiny when removed--provided, of course, they were clean and shiny when they went in. Because while TireHide comes in three sizes, is made of heavy-duty 150D polyster and features a drawstring base for a form-fitting fit, it's not, technically, magic. It is, however, the perfect accessory for the well-groomed garage. Available in three sizes: Small: for up to 20-inch tires - Item #5390, Medium: for up to 25-inch tires - Item #5391, Large: for up to 30-inch tires - Item #5392. Sizing tip: Measure your wheels from edge-to-edge, with the measuring tape running through the center axle point. Choose a size equal to, or larger than, your tire diameter.",
