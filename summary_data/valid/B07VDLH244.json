Also laces are difficult as he is disabled and struggles with slippers or trainers. Now he just pushes in his feet and he's ready to go. They look quite smart for simple casuals, soft enough comfortable wear for inside on the hard flooring or out. Good for people who drags their feet (after a stroke) as they will not slip off or come apart. At first they were a little difficult to put on as they were stiff being new but now, they're a part of his feet! Happy walking!",

The last vans I had like this one, I had to cut off the elastic from both sides to allow my foot to go in. This was about 3 years ago, this year I have bought another one and I can't believe that Vans did not fix this issue. Disappointed!",
