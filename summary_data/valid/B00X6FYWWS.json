However, it's possible to make it even better by loading a custom firmware called 'MD380Tools' which allows the entire DMR database to be loaded onto the radio (currently more than 52,000 calls). With the new firmware, the Talkgroup, station's ID, call sign, name and QTH are displayed (see screen display after mod attached).",

I don't see this as a viable option for the hobbiest only commercial applications and maybe people who have time to spend sorting through hours of frequencies and talk groups. My biggest complaint is that this radio is not able to transmit in my house. My cheap radio even works fine inside. This one just doesn't cut it.",

I've had nothing but compliments on my TX audio as well. My only criticism is that programming is very difficult if you don't have a code plug and there is a steep learning curve. Also, TYT doesn't seem to have any kind of official U.S. website whatsoever, so finding things like firmware updates is a tedious and somewhat treacherous endeavor as most of the update files are provided by random 3'rd party sites. Overall, however, this is a fantastic little UHF radio and I am very happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "Great solidly built radio. A great radio to dip your toe into DMR with. RX audio is great and does not sound 'too digital' I get great TX audio reports too. A bit of a learning curve to surmount with the programming software but if you are already familiar with DMR, it is pretty easy. This model has been discontinued I think but I would buy the replacement (MD-390) if I were in the market for a second one. 73 K5RHD /randy",

It works great when you figure out how to program it.",
