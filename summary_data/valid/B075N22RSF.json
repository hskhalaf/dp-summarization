Well I learned that in these cases the sensor at the top is probably just dirty. Also there is a power button on the bottom of the mirror that can use to reset it. All that being said I want everyone to know that THIS MiIRROR Is AWESOME, I love it ,love it ,love it!!!! Also you can adjust the light brightness.. if you have a problem, just call customer service it\u2019s most often an easy fix",
