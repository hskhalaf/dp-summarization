Very frustrating to use, but it did print with good quality and did last a long time.",

Good job Canon, you've tricked me into being your consumer whore. On the bright side, most prints and scan quality was good enough for me and it has held up for a number of years.

On the Windows machines, I ended up downloading files also, because the program on the disk kept crashing. Connection was fairly easy and straight forward. All machines can print anywhre in the house, and I can scan back via WIFI. Have not used the printer but a week, but work very well so far. Will report back after a month and update.",

I found this very odd. Even so, it's not that big of a con because I always purchase refurbished, cheaper ink packs here on amazon instead of purchasing them straight from canon.",

The large scale printers at work could learn a lot from this simple little machine.",

One concern - I was fiddling with holder on the lower paper tray and ended up with this little tiny spring! Can't figure out where it came from and hope it doesn't cause problems in the future!

No force is required! * Windows 7 has been out long enough for it to be mentioned in the manual. * The wireless passphrase, for some reason, is entered backwards. If your passphrase is abcd, you would enter dcba for it to appear correctly in the display. All minor things, I'm just trying to save others a few minutes of head scratching.",

I was worried that this printer would be more complex to use since it had more buttons that my last printer, but works pretty much the same. I've found little difference in the on screen menus. Using the printer without the computer seem fairly easy from what I've used it. The quality of the scans and the printouts are great. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it doesn't turn on automatically when the computer needs it as did my old printer, but that not a huge problem, just something to get use to.",

I will never ever buy a Canon product again!Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2019Verified Purchase I will never ever buy another product from Canon.\n\nI had a simple question. On the Canon printer, it all of a sudden says, \"Install the correct print head.\" What the heck does that mean? I called Canon three times at 1-800-OK-CANON (1-800-652-2666) only to get an automated voice saying, \"You need to register your phone number with us BEFORE we will talk to you.\"\n\nAgain, all I have is a simple question: What does it mean when your Canon printer all of a sudden says, \"Install the correct print head.\" Does it mean the printer is now basically useless? Do I need to find a new printer? (and it won't be Canon)\n\nI am so frustrated with the LACK OF CANON SUPPORT. recently, I also spent a lot of hard earned money to buy the Canon Ink for this Canon printer. A complete waste of money!Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Nick2.0 out of 5 stars Canon MP560Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2013Verified Purchase When you manage to get it to print, it does it well. Photos were surprisingly good. Straight from memory-card printing available. Fairly easy to use functions. 2-stars at least for that.\n\nNow the bad. I'm pretty computer savvy; I'm usually the person friends call to fix their computers. But I have lost count of the number of times that I nearly took a sledgehammer to this printer. First, networking. Sometimes it wants to play along, sometimes it doesn't. I routinely have to remove and reinstall the network drivers, sometimes more than once. At random times, even after successfully printing, it'll throw a \"communication error\" which is unresolvable unless you do the aforementioned.\n\nThen there's the ink. We all know it's a scam, but we hope that maybe our new printer will be different. Well not with the MP560. The inks are tiny and dry out whether you use them or not. Don't want them to dry out for lack of use, well according to Canon Customer Service, you have to cycle the printer on and off every day which will run them through a cleaning cycle -- which uses ink... \"Oh, I'll just print only in black-only grayscale\" you say? Nope. If one ink goes, for whatever reason it decides, it won't let you print anything. \"Well in that case, I'll use refurbished cartridges off of EBay\" you say? For a little while these do actually seem to work. You can get exponentially more ink for fractions of the cost. For me, they tended to work for several months before the printer started rejecting them at random, one at a time, it was pretty weird, almost as if it learned.... creepy. Also stock-piling bulk ink doesn't work either, they have an expiration date coded into them. Yeah, the amount of thought put into scamming the consumer on this stuff is pretty criminal. The MP560 and others like it and Exhibit A.\n\nEven if it did work as advertised and the ink thing didn't infuriate you and your wallet so much, it still prints very slow. Well, not the actual printing part, that seems about average, but the part before it prints: the \"warming up\" phase. Think you can just print your e-ticket quick as you head out the door... think again. Give it a few minutes to warm up and make a bunch of noise, then hopefully, if it doesn't declare an ink cartridge unfit for duty, doesn't throw a network error, or stays \"warming up\" forever (yeah, that happens too) it might decide to oblige.\n\nThis is the last inkjet printer for me, thank you very much. Seriously this time. Thanks Canon for ruining this relationship. Too many experiences just like this that end in a scene out of Office Space.Read more 9 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Nick5.0 out of 5 stars Nice printer, nice scanner, great for novice usersReviewed in the United States on October 22, 2009Verified Purchase This printer was purchased as a birthday present for my mother, who has been hampered by a Windows Vista computer and a malfunctioning HP Printer (it worked great with XP...). We purchased the Canon PIXMA MP560 printer for $85 (free shipping) on Amazon, and comparing the price to other retailers online (and the retail price), it was no contest.\n\nThis printer has some features that you may already know of via the product description page, but I'd like to elaborate on some of these features.\nThoughts out of the box:\n-The MP560 has a folding LCD screen that covers the function buttons. The screen is not too large, but it does seem to have large enough text (and a simple GUI) to work well for novice printer users. There are not too many buttons, and they're large, well-marked, and simple enough for anyone to recognize.\n-The printer has a lower paper tray (for regular inkjet/copier paper) and an upper vertical tray (for thicker photo paper and other things). The vertical tray has an automatic two-sided width adjustment/alignment, so any size paper is aligned to the proper position every time (and the thickness is adjustable from maximum printing width of the printer, down to only an inch or so).\n-The basic instruction manual is printed on paper, and easily guided me through the process of installation of the print head/ink, paper, software, and wireless network capability. This guide has simple words and illustrations, though it does not include every detail of the printer's operations (the more complex instruction/user manual is electronic, and is installed with the printer software). There is a Network Troubleshooting guide, as well, that seems to be rather detailed (though unnecessary in my case). The printer comes with a sample pack of 4\"x6\" photo paper, which we immediately tested (and it passed the test with flying colors). There's other throw-away junk included, but nothing that surprising.\n-The printer is clearly labeled so as to make it simple to place cartridges in the right location, once the print head is installed.\n-The fact that the MP560 has multiple single-color ink cartridges may seem expensive at first, but with tri-color cartridge printers, we would always seem to run out of a single color much faster than other colors... so we were wasting a good amount of ink each and every time we replaced a cartridge. This printer seems to have ink cartridges that would be easier to refill than some other cartridges, as well.\n\nAfter powering it on:\n-It was EFFORTLESS to set up the MP560 on our wireless network. It quickly detected the network (our router is on another floor in the house, on the other side of the house), and it still had a good quality signal, and it only took a few minutes (and only a couple pushes of a button... plus entering our internet security key) before the printer was connected. There is a rotating pad (similar to an IPod) on the printer that lets you select any security codes you may have (and navigate through the GUI)... so it may take awhile if one has an alphanumeric password, but it was rather quick for a numeric 8-key code. Heck, my mom is not too familiar with computers, and I have no doubts that she could have set up this printer with the network.\n-The printer comes with easy to use software (again, in Vista), though it does take a few minutes for the software to install itself on a PC. The basic instruction manual makes it rather easy to install everything, whether using Windows or Mac. Once installed, the printer is rather effortlessly found (remember to have attached the printer to the wireless network), and before you know it, you're ready to print.\n-The printer has a laser ink level meter for every cartridge, and it can be displayed on the computer and on the 2\" LCD screen on the printer (actually, pressing one button on the \"Home\" screen will allow you to see each ink level). So far, it does not appear as if this printer over-uses ink... in fact, printing on glossy photo paper seems to suggest there's less \"gunk\" on the paper than some other printers, perhaps due to the finer ink jets this printer allegedly uses.\n\nUsing the printer for the first time:\n-The printer and software actually WORK WELL with Windows Vista!\n-The printer does take a few seconds to warm up, but after the first print job, it seems to be much faster.\n-The MP560 didn't have a single problem feeding thicker photo paper.\n-The quality of printed pictures is very good, showing very tight pixels even on plain paper. Photo paper shows an excellent picture quality, and the software included with the printer makes it effortless to print photos with certain photo papers... no need to change printer settings manually.\n-The scanner/copier seems to produce quality pictures, although this isn't the fastest, nor the quietest, copier I've seen in a multi-use printer.\n-The Duplex printing feature is a great thing to have in a lower-cost home printer, as few documents are of an official, legal nature, hence there's no need for one-sided printing. It gets to be inconvenient to flip the pages by hand each and every time one wants to print on both sides of a piece of paper, so it is great to find a lower-cost printer that has this feature. This printer does not print internally, it prints on one side and extracts the page, then gathers the page back inside the printer and prints on the other side, so I don't know how well Duplex printing would work on thicker media such as fabrics.\n\nAll in all, this is a great printer so far. It beats anything I've ever owned, in terms of print quality and functionality, and I'd say it's a pretty good value to boot. Mom is certainly happy about this printer, and she's going to test it with some of her crafts... let's see how it stands up to the test of time when she puts it to use.Read more 389 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States \n\n\nCUSTOMERS WHO BOUGHT THIS ITEM ALSO BOUGHT\nPage 1 of 1 Start overPage 1 of 1 This shopping feature will continue to load items when the Enter key is pressed.
