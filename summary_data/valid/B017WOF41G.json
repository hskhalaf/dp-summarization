It comes with a small box insert that can be attached by velcro anywhere to the inside rim of the automan itself. It also holds a decent amount of weight, my 3 year old niece loves to use it as a mini-couch when she watches movies with me! Such a great product for such a great price, can\u2019t say enough!",

Takes all of about 30 seconds from unboxing to have this thing ready to go. Pretty solid construction and the fabric is of a nice quality (especially for the price). My ladyfriend and I have both sat on it at once and had no concern it would break down. LOTS of storage space inside. Definitely recommended!",

Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a discreet way to store extra stuff. You are getting so much more than what you are spending for this. I would buy more if I had the room.",

The label states that the item would pass for fire safety even without the added chemicals, so I'm not sure why they were added in the first place. I really wanted to get a second one for use in my living room to store our couch blankets, but I don't really want to take the risk of adding more chemicals into my house.",
