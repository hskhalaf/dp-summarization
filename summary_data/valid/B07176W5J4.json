Other highlights included its inexpensive price, durable build, trendy style, and lightweight nature. Despite the acclaim, the trainer had its own share of flaws.

These ones are probably the best longevity wise (I've had them for 2 months thus far). They are holding up really well, and are really comfortable. Maybe its just my perception, but it seems because of the \"Memory Tech sock liner\" (it has bumpy texture) the feet stay cooler throughout the day. Will definitely be getting another pair soon in different color pattern.",

I am currently using in location with a lot of gravel and paths and sometime I can fell larger rocks through the sole. I use to workout, have not run in them although I'm sure would be fine for short runs (5K). Shoe fit flat to surface, steady ankle makes it good for working out/crossfit. Not sure if it matter to some but the insole is not removable. I'm very happy with purchase",
