The main reason for the purchase was for hot weather. Any other golf shoes have felt like foot ovens in the summer. Honestly in 105*, my feet were no hotter than the rest of me after 18 holes. Take the average size of your street shoes to order. They felt slightly snug right out of the box, but wore in nicely. You don't want golf shoes to fit loose.",

The back has a low and firm to stiff feel that felt aggravating just above the heel. They are very nicely made shoes that are solid construction, comfortable except for the low heel portion, and my feet don't get hot in them. I ended returning them due to the heel issue and the size being to large and didn't feel like guessing what size to order next so I just ordered a pair of Adidas shoes instead that were the same as my previous pair.",

Stability is exactly what I was looking for, and fit is spot on, although a half-size smaller than what I wear in Nike. Pick these shoes up while you can, and if you can't find them, the new Ignites are also a great option, and might be even more comfortable, somehow.",
