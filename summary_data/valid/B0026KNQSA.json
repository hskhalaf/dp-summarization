My favorites were always the sour cream and onion ruffles. Decided to try these and they were delicious! Like, yum! And you can def taste that its pure potato. I also love that each bag is only 100 cals so no guilt. I now keep these in my office and bedroom for when I need a snack. I def plan on trying out their other flavors and these are now my go-to chips!",

LOVE HOW CRUNCHY these are, they satisfy crunchy salty cravings TASTE - I LOVE salt and vinegar chips. I love these more than REGULAR OR KETTLE SALT AND VINEGAR! VERSATILE - I crumble on top of things like quinoa, brown rice and lentils for some crunch. Great inside sandwiches for a satisfying mix of textures and the salt and vinegar give sandwiches a better taste. CONS: If there is a con, it's STOPPING at one bag!",

Sometimes you get other brands of chips and some have plenty of seasoning and some have barely any. That's not the case with these chips. I like that they are a healthy snack. I tend to snack too much and these have really helped me cut my calories and I've lost some weight too. Bonus!",

I have eaten the Special K Cracker Chips before and those are okay but these babies blow them out of the water!! I was most surprised by the texture. They are crispy, and crunchy like a chip but there is no weird aftertaste or anything. I guess I will probably be getting these on subscribe and save now.",
