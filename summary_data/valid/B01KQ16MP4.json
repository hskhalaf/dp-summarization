With only 6 months of use, this thing is impossible to get clean. It doesn\u2019t matter how long I try to scrub and pick at it there will always be food pieces left. Under the direction of customer service I put the cover in my washer. Not only was it hard to get off, I wasn\u2019t able to use the high chair for 2 days waiting for it to fully dry. Save yourself time and money down the road and pick a different high chair.",

My baby is a messy eater and the cover is almost impossible to remove and get back on.

We've even tried stuffing stuff behind him for support, but it's hit or miss. In either case, he usually motions to me to pick him up... So he often sits on my lap at meal time.

People are saying that the straps are tough to clean but heres the workaround: either dont strap the baby in while you're feeling him/her, which is easy to do since you're right there and falling out while they are not strapped in would be difficult. The other workaround is put the bib on the baby after you strap him/her in. That was the perfect solution for me! The bib covers the straps completely. The one thing I didnt like is that the foot rest is way too far below the babys feet, and you cannot adjust that. Otherwise, this highchair rocks!",

He loves it too and will try to climb up into the chair sometimes. The clear part of the tray is detachable making it easy to clean. My only complaint is that you have to completely remove the tray to fold the chair. Once the tray is off, you can almost fold it with one hand. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",

While it has 2 wheels in the back you have to tilt it backwards to roll across the room (obviously meant to do when baby is not it in) I just wish I could do this with baby in it. But I guess it\u2019s a safety precaution. Still a great buy.",

    "title": "JOOVY Nook High Chair, Charcoal",
    "description": "Color:Charcoal| Style:RegularSay hello to a new tradition in high chairs. High chair trays are hard to use. The Nook uses a swing-open tray to simplify mealtime. This fantastic high chair features a large swing-open tray that operates with one-hand. Without having to use two hands or line up cumbersome rails, mom or dad can easily hold their child while operating the tray. There is no need to remove dishes from the tray before taking the child out of the chair. Simply swing the tray open, unbuckle your child and off you go to the next task. This feature helps keep you kitchen counter clear. Folding and storing the high chair in the pantry or kitchen nook will make your kitchen feel more spacious. High chairs have gotten bulkier and less kitchen friendly. With the Nook's ability to fold like a beach chair, it opens up new opportunities for use at picnics, camping, friend's homes, and at grandparents. Bringing the baby to meals anywhere has never been easier. We know how important it is to parents to have tray adjustability. Keeping food on the tray and off the child's lap is essential. The new Nook has a tray with four depth adjustments to accommodate your child as they grow. Many high chairs lack a big enough seat. The Nook is a roomy, full-size high chair with an exceptional padded leatherette seat that accommodates a child up to 50 lbs. The leatherette material makes it is easy to wipe down. The Nook comes fully assembled and is ready to go, out of the box.",
