      "text": "Haven't seen this item available anywhere except online. Not sure why, since it seems like this items would sell like hotcakes at toy stores/pool supply stores. I'm not a football-throwing fan. However, this football is a blast! Essentially, it seems to be a neoprene-covered, football-shaped beach ball. This is perfect for a pool. Fun to toss back and forth in the pool, soft/light enough that if you get bapped by it (skipping it on the water), it will not hurt, especially for family members. Makes a good splash. Sometimes even more fun to throw short just to douse the catcher.",
