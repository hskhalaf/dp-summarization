I use an antenna and the 55\u201d let you save your favorite stations that would show up as soon you hit the home button. This one you get advertising when you hit the home button. Rent this, rent that, no more easy to get to saved stations. You can use the voice control but you have to allow Samsung to collect information about you. The picture is just as good, just bigger.",
