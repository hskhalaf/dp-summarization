My husband had to add some sort of \"tape\" to the inside of the screw that attaches to the toilet so that it stays extra tight. It is IMPORTANT to make sure you SHUT OFF the valve to the sprayer when not In use and to make sure you empty out all the water out of the hose when you are done. This will INCREASE the life of your sprayer!",

This sprayer takes care of even the worst spoiled diaper in a few seconds where other methods take much longer. It's also more effective, literally blasting off the poo, which makes washing easier and reduces smells until laundry time. The sprayer itself is very quick and easy topp install (takes less than 5 minutes) and seems to be very durable. The only issue we had was the holster being upside down on the hook (a simple mistake and quick fix).",

Just unfortunate that for a new item, it required an entire trip to the store for a part (and this was after 2 days of him fighting with it trying to figure out what was causing the leak). Oh well... now we will see how it works day to day.",

Initially, the hose was leaking at the connection to the nozzle. Luckily the company had sent me additional instructions (now I see why!) that the round end of the hose needs to be near the nozzle to allow for it to rest in the holder...or to not have it leak. Hopefully this will be changed soon so a ten minute installation can be had for all. Will update once I use it on diapers.",

      "title": "Poor Water Pressure",
      "text": "We are quite unhappy with this and will be returning it. Most importantly, it doesn't have sufficient water pressure to rinse a poopy diaper. Based on the reviews, I can only assume people have never had a \"good\" diaper sprayer, so assumed this one was adequate. In addition to poor pressure at the sprayer, the unit restricts flow to the toilet, causing it fill slowly. As well, the \"switch\" allows you to turn off water to the toilet, which is a very strange design. Previously we had a second hand plastic sprayer which delivered much better results. Stay clear of this one.",

You also need to pair up one of those plasic shields that go in the toilet and the diaper clips to it so that you don't make a mess when cleaning the diaper.",
