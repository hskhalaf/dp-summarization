After taking the mask off you feel that your lung capacity is much greater and each breath is no longer a struggle.

It's a bit difficult at first as you may feel like you are not getting enough air, but keep with it the payoff is in the end.

Initially, I trained for 3 weeks while wearing the mask and on the 4th week, I did a couple of workouts without it and was really amazed at the results.",

You can order a free strap to hold up the sleeve from the parent company, but then it tends to tear the neoprene sleeve by the ears.

This mask lets me use it while I bike run and use the elliptical. Once you get used to the highest settings. Your progress will become exponential, at-least for me.",
