Previously, all of my SmartThings buttons and sensors kept becoming \"Unavailable\" at random intervals. However, this issue ceased after I replaced all of my Cree bulbs.",

They can connect to the Hue app. The downsides are that they don't get as dim as the Hue bulbs (at its lowest, it's about equal to Hue at 25%). And something written in small text on the box, and NOT MENTIONED IN THE AMAZON DESCRIPTION, is that you can't put these bulbs on a dimmer switch. They can only be dimmed from a command from your phone, alexa, etc. When I put them on a dimmer switch, they flickered really badly at most settings between \"full on\" and \"fully dimmed\"",

I wish the on/off status was more reliable. Sometimes the bulb will get turned on by smartthings -- then someone flips a switch. The status never updates in smartthings. So if I'm out of the house, I think the bulb is still on. This is probably more of a zigby issue or smartthings issue than an issue with the bulb. Overall, this is a good price for a smart dimmable bulb that is fairly reliable.",
