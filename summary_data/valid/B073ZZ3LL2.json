I'm sure it doesn't have the same level of protection, but for the price I feel that it is a good option. It has a grip to it, but isn't sticky. It is not slick, so I won't worry about it falling out of my hands. The sides are well covered. Very happy with my purchase! And, as a plus...it actually fits the 6plus, and the camera works.",

The1 thing I don\u2019t like is how difficult it was to get on, I like to change the cases depending on what I will be doing, water/sand vacation etc....not looking forward to removing and putting it back on.

The fit is great and all the holes line up. It's hard to tell from the pictures, but there is a slight raised lip around the camera lens that raises it when laid flat on a surface, which is a nice feature.",
