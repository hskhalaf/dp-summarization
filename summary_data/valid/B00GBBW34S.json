You might be wondering why is my Mom not writing the review? That's because I wanted to rate something. So I don't know anything about this product. I do know that it gives you Vitamin E. My Mom rated everything 5 stars so I guess she recommends this product. Sorry if this was not helpful and you were probably wanting to know about this product. If you want to know about this product look at the other reviews. Sorry if this was not so helpful.",

They were a solid mass when I first opened the bottle. I added a silica gel capsule from another medication, and the gelcaps are separating day by day. GNC should add a drying capsule and raise the price by a penny. With the silica gel, it's easy to coax a pill out, even with my chubby fingers.",
