It works like magic. Also my skin was not irritated at all using this product, which happens with quick blue. Also, somehow this product fixed my fried hair from previous bleaches with quick blue (I bleached my black hair with quick blue 7 times to reach level 9, whereas blonde me lifts my hair to level 10 in one bleach). Strongly recommended for people who are going grey. Also, recommend using pravana silver as a magic combo for going grey.",

Left on for about 40 mins and went from a level 4 to a level 10 in one try. Also used the sand and steel blue toner with the 20 volume developer from this company and completely satisfied with the outcome. My hair did not have any artificial color so that probably helped with how quickly it lifted.",

Definitely use hair masks and condition to add moisture back but for the most part it doesn't even feel like I bleached my hair.",
