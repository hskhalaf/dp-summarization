So keep a watch on them and their skin while using this in case your cat has a sensitivity. Put the end piece you cut off in your vacuum bag for an extra bonus in flea protection.",

    "description": "Tell pesky parasites to \u2018bug off\u2019 with the Hartz UltraGuard Plus Flea & Tick Collar for Cats and Kittens. This collar kills and repels both fleas and ticks for 7 months and also prevents flea eggs from hatching for over half the year - stopping the flea life cycle and inhibiting reinfestation. The water resistant design remains effective even after getting caught in the rain. Also features a breakaway safety release. For continuous flea and tick protection from head to tail, replace the collar every 7 months. For use on kittens 12 weeks of age and older. Directions: Remove collar from package, unroll and stretch to activate insecticide generator. Do not use on kittens under 12 weeks of age. Do not unroll collar until ready to use. Place the collar around the cat\u2019s neck, adjust for proper fit and buckle in place. The collar must be worn loosely to allow for growth of the cat and to permit the collar to move about the neck. Generally, a properly fitted collar is one that, when fastened, will snugly slide over the cat\u2019s head. Leave 2 or 3 inches on the collar for extra adjustment and cut off and dispose of the extra length. Consult a veterinarian before using this product on debilitated, aged or medicated pets. Sensitivity may occur after using any pesticide product for pets. Some animals may become irritated by the collar if it is applied too tightly. If this occurs, loosen the collar. If irritation continues, remove the collar and bathe your cat with mild soap and rinse with large amount of water. If signs continue, consult a veterinarian immediately. Do not use this product on cats simultaneously or within 30 days before or after treatment of other flea and tick products. However, flea and tick collars may be replaced immediately.",
