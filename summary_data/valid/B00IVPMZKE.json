      "text": "As a European who moved to North America I was surprised how difficult it was to find infrared heat lamps. In Germany these lamps are very common and used to help with head colds and muscle pain. It took me some time to find a suitable product that was comparable to what I was used to. The Beurer IL 50 meets my expectations fully. The 300 Watts deliver pleasant heat, the product stands reliably and stable and the angle is easy to adjust. The timer is helpful as well.",

It ruined a $1200 leather chair and would have burned my house down if I hadn't caught it! Unbelievable that a product that generates so much heat doesn't failsafe to off when powered up, and all should be recalled.",

Overall, I would recommend this lamp.",

I don\u2019t like taking meds to help with my back pain so I always research alternative therapy. I researched red light therapy benefits and I\u2019m so glad I did!! Totally worth every penny! Timer function is perfect cause it has the auto shut off. Easy to use, just aim it where you want the pain relief and that\u2019s it!! Excellent investment in my health!!",

You can only do 30 min max each time because the unit will get very hot and the instructions state the unit needs to cool down after use. I also wish it is like other lamp style so I can adjust the angle better to face down Instead of facing forward (since I can't really look at it). Now the unit position is pretty fixed.",

    "description": "Natural Pain Management and Relief using Infrared Red Light Therapy.\nThe Beurer Infrared Heat Lamp is designed to deliver infrared heat to the human body. It can be used to provide warming relief to those with colds, muscle aches & tension. When the infrared heat hits the targeted area, the warmth opens up the capillaries, improves the circulation & aids to naturally get rid of toxins that are inside your body, encouraging the joints, muscles & damaged tissue to heal. When your muscles are warm, they automatically relax to reduce stiffness & loosen up to help your joints & increase flexibility.\nThe Infrared Heat Lamp is completely non-invasive & can be used to treat a variety of body parts - such as the back, chest, shoulders, arms & legs. The size of the treatment body area covered by the IL50 is 11.8 x 15.7 inches, making it ideal for use on larger parts of the body. All treatment areas should be kept a minimum distance of 12?16 inches between the lamp and the body. The red light surface measures 6.5 x 6 inches.\nThe Beurer IL50 Red Light Therapy can be used as a supportive treatment of bronchial congestion. The Infrared Lamp should be facing the chest area for 10-15 minutes at a time, several times daily - for maximum results to relieve the congestion.\nFor joint pain & muscle aches, the red light should face the part of the body that needs to be treated, directly. It features a powerful 300w infrared ceramic plate with a large surface area of 6.5 x 6 inches and 100% UV blocker. We have designed our unit with safety features, such as active ventilation, a digital timer that can be set from 1-15 mins, & an automatic safety switch-off when the set time elapses.\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nCeramic Glass Plate \n100% UV Blocker \nDigital Timer\nBody Treatment Area: 11.8\" x 15.7\"\nRed Light Surface: 6.5\" x 6\"\nSafety Switch-Off After 15 minutes\nActive Ventilation & Overheating Protection\nOur customer service is right here in the USA!
