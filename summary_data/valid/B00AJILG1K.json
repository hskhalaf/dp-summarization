It took some getting used to compared to the giant sized split keyboard but at least she can see the letters on the keys and the keystrokes are pretty quiet too. If there is a gripe it would be that you can only change the color on all of the keys. It would be helpful to be able to have say the number keys 1 color & the letters a different color but then again I didn't spend $150 for this keyboard either.",

You can change the color of the keyboard to any color in the spectrum. I like having my keyboard backlit white, but it looks somewhat yellow.. But that's beside the point. The main drawback for this keyboard is the fact that the multimedia keys do not light up. In the dark you will fumble to find the correct key for volume up/down, play/pause, etc. but that's a minor issue. For a non-mechanical gaming keyboard, it is very very good. I like it a lot.",

The keyboard itself is fairly quiet, having soft strokes instead of harsh mechanical ones, which I quite enjoy since I'm not a big fan of the mechanical sound. I've had it a while and it seems to be really durable so that is a plus. Everything is also really sleek and aesthetically pleasing. Besides the 5 base colors though, there's not really a differentiation between shades of colors, but that doesn't really matter much to me. Overall, definitely a recommended buy from me.",

For example, I turn on my computer and it starts with the Windows key mapping profile (I have the color blue for that). Then I launch Fallout 3 and the keyboard changes to green and the mapping automatically changes to my set up in the game! It's insane!
