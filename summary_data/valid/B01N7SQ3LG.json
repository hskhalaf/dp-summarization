I\u2019d recommend using some sort of ear protection if you have a larger project, just for your own comfort. Also, plan on wearing some sort of eye protection. I believe I read that in the instructions. Better safe than sorry, fine metal shavings will be flying. I\u2019d recommend writing what you want to etch in pencil first so you can concentrate on the edge and depth of your etched line. Overall, I\u2019m extremely happy with my purchase. The price was fair. It seems to be a quality machine. Had no issues what so ever.",

I do have one complaint about its ergonomic design - the on/off switch seems to be in an awkward position and won't allow quick easy access.

However, now - even with the absolute slightest amount of pressure when engraving, it just stops. The motor keeps going, but it won't engrave. I'm not a novice at this - there is a defect with this product where it can't sustain any pressure for any decent length of time without burning out.
