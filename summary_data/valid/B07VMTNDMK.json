It was easy to transfer the contents of my old HDD to this new one using the Xbox One and thus far the new drive is performing well. Overall the price is OK but I will be miffed if its dicounted in the near future. Currently the 8TB is better value but obviously smaller capacity in comparison.",

They're very light and hold securely with the strips, which makes keeping the cord out of the way much easier and more visually pleasing. Would buy again for my family if they needed them.",

The drive performs awesome for this. Never any lag. I plan on ordering another as this one is already almost full. Lots of things to watch out there, and with everyone having to stay home, the media server is a great solution. This drive is perfect.",

I can't even hear it when the PS4 is in rest mode and downloading a big update or a new game to the external HD. Write and read speeds are super quick. Noticeably faster than my old Passport HD. Overall, I'm very happy with it.",
