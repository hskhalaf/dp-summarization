Have not a single problem with the battery it also works without using the dongle which is a surprise. Good Buy! If it was the same price it was when I bought it I would purchase it again but now it's 700+ which is insane, not sure why the price is jacked. Maybe because this keyboard is not made anymore",

The only feature that I don't use is the 'touch pad' as I find the mouse more efficient. The volume control is a nice touch. (I do use it in a pinch if the mouse battery is being charged). The volume control is a convenient feature. The programmable 'hot keys' are great! PROS: - Fantastic feel and responsive keys. - Amazing battery life per charge. - Customizable 'hot keys' - Volume Control - Touch pad CONS: - Touch pad (too small for extended use)",

Click keys and the trackpad are frustrating. The specialty scroll only worked vertically. Design is pretty, Bluetooth is nice. But that just isn't even close to enough to justify the cost. Ergonomically: something is VERY wrong, my left hand is suffering from overuse of the left click button after two weeks. If you rarely need the mouse, it would be just peachy.",

      "text": "Compared to other wireless keyboards, this one rates a 5+ for its stable connectivity and range, integrated mouse pad, and programmable function keys. I initially discovered a few small quirks - 1. The software that came with the keyboard inverted the zoom keys. The new software downloaded from the Logitec website fixed that. Another thin that I've noticed is that I lose the zoom function when the computer comes out of hibernate. It requires a reboot to fix it. For those of you with a multimedia system and big screen, this is ideal for operating the system from your lazy-boy from across the room. (that's what I'm doing now) I love it. Buy it. There's currently a $30 rebate too.",

I called Logitech, and after giving them the codes off the bottom of the keyboard, they stated that this is a known defect.

I've used the Edge for about a month now, everday at the office. I still routinely hit the delete key when I really want enter, and vice versa. Perhaps one day I'll adapt, but for now it's annoying. The only other problem I've had is that on occasion the mouse pointer will stick momentarially. Other than that it's worked quite well.",

Logitech also has much better customer support then BTC (BTC's customer support was almost non-existent). Overall, if you're building a HTPC spend the money and get this keyboard (it will save you a lot of configuration headaches).",

Though a bit pricey, even with a rebate, the extra money I spent for this unit underscores the adage \"you get what you pay for.\" In this case you not only get solid construction, great key response, lots of handy extras, you also get pleasing styling and appearance. Installation went smoothly, no hitches. A top of the line keyboard.",

Various keys perform the PS3 button functions (Enter=X, ESC=O, F1=square, and F2=trangle, etc); but looking back, the PS3-specific wireless keyboard might have been a more liveable (and cheaper) option. The touchdisc works like a usual touchpad with some scrolling aids (which take a little patience). The keyboard can be operated just fine using two hands or on your lap.",

Among them the attempt to do away with the need for a mouse with a multifunctional keypad and a left click button on the left of the keyboard. BUT, it is not fully functional if you are using 64 bit Vista. Specifically, the scroll left/right function will not work, despite the up/down scroll being fine. A Logitech tech and I discovered this by testing on another keyboard. There may be other 64 bit glitches I have not found yet. But not enough to stop me from finding it to be a very nice keyboard. But all OEMs should make their equipment fully 64 bit compatible because the profile is mainstream now.",

The mouse pad works ok, but is not suitable for fine work or fast gaming. It is fine for basic operations. So, overall, I find this product very usable.",

The Integral pointer pad is not for every-day use and needs to be supplemented by a real lazer mouse, but is damn convenient when you have this puppy in your lap. Installation was a little strange until you figure out that you need to press the connect button on both the usb dongle and the keyboard to get them to link up. You also need your old keyboard until you get this one linked up. Nice Product !",
