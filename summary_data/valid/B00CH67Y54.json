Seems like determining the expansion percentage of the freezing gel would be pretty basic engineering, but I guess not.",

Well today another one that was ordered in July (as the replacement) did the same thing. I thought I could get a replacement, but no the 30 days is gone. This is a horrible policy. I expected 60-90 days. These are not cheap! I loved them but do not bother. We live in a northern climate and only take the glass out of the freezer for a glass of white wine in the evening. They must know these are flawed.",

They look like glass and it has a wide rubber band around it for a good grip so as not to slip out of your fingers and not cold to the touch. Just great!",

    "description": "It took a year of trial and error to perfect the exact \"ultrasonic welding\" geometry that joins the clear plastic parts together and allows this cup to mimic the elegant shape of an actual stemless wine glass. The plastic had to be engineered to handle expansion and contraction from the gel freezing as well as extreme cold and warm conditions.",

      "PERFECT FOR ALL WINES. Achieving the ideal serving temperature for every wine is possible with this set of stemless wine glasses. Each wine tumbler maintains wine\u2019s temperature better than a normal wine glass.",
      "INSULATED WALLS filled with proprietary cooling gel work as a wine chiller when frozen. Pop a tumbler in the freezer for white wines or cool in the fridge to keep red wines at cellar temp.",
      "BPA-FREE PLASTIC construction is sturdy and perfectly suited for outdoor use, An insulated silicone band makes for comfortable handling and ensures that this stemless wine glass set will be your favorite new wine accessories.",
      "SERVE YOUR WINE AT THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE. Generally, white wines should be served cold at 43 to 53 degrees Fahrenheit, and red should be served at just cooler than room temp, around 58 to 60 degrees.",
      "INNOVATIVE GIFT. These wine tumblers are perfect for any occasion or group event and make a great gift for wine lovers or mom on Mother\u2019s Day."
