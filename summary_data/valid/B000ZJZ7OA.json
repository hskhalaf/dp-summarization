I contacted Creative Labs and they said they don't sell individual parts, but they offered me a \"discount\" to buy a new pair, which was 5 dollars more than what I paid for the first pair. I can't say the experience left me with much confidence in the brand - I will not be buying their products anymore. There are plenty of other decent headphones in this price range - look elsewhere!",

Just don\u2019t throw them around without a case. Another small issue is that the cable is attached. Small gripe but I prefer to have options. These are very decent for gaming also which is a plus. Listening to music on these are great! Just read other reviews they are pretty much spot on.",

With that being said, the bass level is just nice, almost perfect. Comparing to another different hp which is the hifiman 560. CAL doesnt reveal as much detail as the hfm. However, one will get more enjoyment from the music since CAL does closer to speaker response. All being said, you have to be careful handling these thing since it's quite plasticky.",

I might try wrapping some of the plastic with tape to reinforce it a bit. Honestly these are the only comfortable closed back head phones I could find to use with my glasses so I think the trade off for the brittle build quality if worth it.

Overall I like the sound. They nicely complement my Denon AH-D2000 headphones. A steal for the price I paid, which was under $60. I forgot to mention why they get 4 stars instead of 5. The build quality is good, but not 5 star good. Be gentle with them and they'll last you, be rough and you'll be getting another set. Still, for what you get, they really ROCK!",

I've abused thetwo cords on a regular basis with feet, rolling desk chair, yanking, etc. Still in good shape, and I think both sound better than any combination headset I've tried.

I really dug these, especially for the comfort, I did find the sound to be too warm, almost syrupy. I like a more detailed uncolored sound. Most of you are probably not as picky as I am. (By the way, don't buy the Bose headphones that are similar. The Creatives are constructed better and sound better.) There aren't many portable heaphones out there that have this combination of comfort , light weight, and sound at this price point.",

The only real con I can add to these is that my ears do tend to get a bit warm after wearing them for a couple of hours, not as bad as I have had with other headphones but enough that I notice it. All in all, though, worth the money.",
