Then two days ago, I downloaded a required \"system update\" from Alcatel. Once the update was completed, the phone would no longer read the SIM card. I took it to T-Mobile and they installed a new SIM card and the phone would still not read it. The result is that it is no longer a functional phone. I emailed Alcatel about the issue, but have heard absolutely nothing back from them. I hold Alcatel responsible and will not purchase another product from them. I now have to purchase a brand new phone.",

I don't really know if I hit the screen too hard (which I don't think so) or the material is way too bad. I was pretty excited about this smartphone since it reminded me of my now old Moto G.

      "text": "I really like the size and weight of this phone. A friend has a Samsung Galaxy S6 and we both think it's too bulky. Personal preference... It's nice to have a micro SD to load up with photos and music. Music player is fun to mess with. If I could change one thing it would be dual SIM. Works great with US-Mobile. No complaints.",

      "text": "Had this phone for 1.5 years now. Still very happy with it. Small size, good performance in many countries on many systems. Good call quality, good data service, supports more LTE bands than others of its generation. Since the screen isn't Gorilla Glass, you definitely need a screen protector. You're not going to get the latest Android version on it, but if that doesn't matter, it's a good phone for a good price.",

      "text": "I've had this phone for about 7 months before I dropped it on its screen for the first time and it cracked. Usually with a cracked screen a phone is still functional.... that is not the case for the Idol 3. It was fine at first it has a really nice design and great display. The camera could be better, but I cant complain about that considering the price tag. The only thing other than the cracked screen problem was that the phone was oddly buggy? Certain apps I would use like Snapchat or Miitomo would just.... Stop Responding whenever I used them.",

I mean it as a gift for someone who doesn't know English, French, Spanish or German. I needed Russian but it was not there!!! So make sure you are getting a phone with a language options for setting commands /tools that you'd actually know",

Tapping the screen, made that area flash almost as if it were under a lot of pressure. Performance of the phone was good, but in the end I returned it before the display issue really panned out. Does not matter how inexpensive a product is, it should arrive in 100% working condition.",
