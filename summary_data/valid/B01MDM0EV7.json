      "title": "Seriously Nice Headphones!",
      "text": "These are seriously nice headphones. I use them for professional music mixing so I can hear what my mixes will sound like on consumer gear. There are 3 choices of amplification (off, on, and bass boost). Bass boost is particularly useful to hear what your music will sound like on \"hyped\" systems. The amped selections do have a bit of hiss but livable. A real nice feature is the headphones will automatically turn off when you take them off your head - saving the battery. They charge via USB. They are comfortable and seal out the rest of the room quite nicely.",

The switch was so poor quality that after a couple of weeks the headphones were unusable. There were supposed to be three power settings, but in reality there was only one location - in between clicks on the knob -where the headphones actually worked. Otherwise it was sound out of one side or no sound at all.",

      "text": "These are a fantastic deal, and sound amazing even with just using a PC's 3.5mm jack. The internal amp does a great job at amplifying the sound and adding a little extra bass when on the On+ setting. They are very clear and when listening to good quality files produce some great sound. They can get VERY loud, so be careful. Well worth the money! The reason for the 4 stars on the comfort, is they can get a little heavy over time and you notice they are there. It's not uncomfortable by any means, you just get more aware the longer you have them on",

Can't hear a darn thing outside these phones. Really wonder what the more expensive versions of these sound like. But 400 bucks is steep enough for me. Can't wait until these things break in, another 100 hours should get closer to the real sound. But out of box I really like these.",

Ironically, those devices have weak, noisy audio outputs that really aren\u2019t made for music. That inspired us to reimagine the modern headphone and design it around a built-in audiophile amplifier, which delivers dynamic, detailed and clear sound-no matter what you\u2019re plugged into. Sadie is the evolution of the ultimate listening experience first pioneered by Blue\u2019s groundbreaking Mo-Fi powered headphones. By further refining Blue\u2019s revolutionary fit and sonic soundstage, Sadie delivers even higher levels of performance to reveal new details in your favorite music. The result is a headphone that makes every device sound like a big home hi-fi system. You won\u2019t believe how much music you\u2019ve been missing.",
