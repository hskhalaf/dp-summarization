The navy color was exactly as pictured. The material seems like it will wash and wear well. It folds up nicely without getting mishapen. I am very happy with my purchase.",

Overall this is a great hat and a decent value. I would order this again if we needed another.",

With that adjustment, it helps the hat not push down on the ear line and makes the chin ties less irritable. Highly recommend! All 3 of my kiddos have one as we live this design!",

She is wearing 9 mo clothes and has a big head circumference besides. The toggle kept it nice and snug, even playing on the beach. It's a little extra floppy, but I liked getting the full wraparound protection, and even appreciated the extra cover it provided when I would nurse her at the pool. This was a great purchase!",

I was concerned these would be able to easily untie and remove hat but it wasnt touched and left it alone.

      "text": "Perfect for fun in the sun! Generously sized and easily adjusted to accommodate a growing baby/toddler. The material is very soft and dries fairly quickly. It ties under the chin and stays in place well. The ear and neck flaps offer great coverage and the small bill provides a nice level of shade for little ones who refuse to wear sunglasses. Absolutely worth buying! It seems this will fit for quite some time and should hold up for a couple seasons of use.",

Very light material, breathable and dries fast. On top, there's a variety of colors to choose from, so one can match the hat to swimsuit or else. Highly recommended!",

I like the hat but once he outgrows it I will be purchasing a Sunday Afternoon sun hat of similar style.",
