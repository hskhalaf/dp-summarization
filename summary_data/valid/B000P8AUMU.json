In my case, I needed to have more control of the depth of focus than the clear plastic piece would allow as I was looking into something. One of the taps broke on removal. One tip -- use this in a totally dark room and use the internal light or even more powerful spot LED lighting. It can get tricky when looking deep into cavities.",

Sidenote: for MMJ growers, the magnification is a little too much for looking at buds and difficult to get a good fix on the trichomes while holding the microscope. Better go for something more like 30x zoom just to make your life easier.",

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because of the adjustment difficulty.",

      "text": "Yet another example of getting what you pay for. If you're considering buying this \"microscope\", note that the supplied images are actually on the good side of what you'll be able to see. The LED light source produces a sickly blue light that catches reflective edges on nearly anything you look at, meaning that everything you see looks \"sparkly\". Also, the optics are such that it is nearly impossible to get a sharp plane of focus. While the promises of 60X to 100X magnification are compelling, I would recommend buying a 60X loupe instead that admits more light of a higher quality and probably has a much better lens.",

The only thing that I dislike is that the image is inverted, but that's supposed to be normal for a microscope. What a great stocking stuffer for Christmas these would be! Fantastic for the price!!!",

Conveniently, or not-so conveniently small, it's slightly larger than a bic lighter, making it a little tricky to use when trying to view a specific point. As for the LED light, it's blue white, so it distorts color slightly making objects bluish. And as with all magnification, brightness becomes an issue, so the LED should be brighter and whiter. This is a perfect example of technologies that are reaching the limits of human use due to size... any smaller and this magnifier would be unusable. However the size is why I chose this model over others.",

I give this device a 4.9 out of 5 rating. I took 1/10 a point off for the small eyehole, but it would be difficult to put a larger eyepiece on this little device. BUY IT.",

    "title": "Carson 60x-75x MicroMax LED Lighted Pocket Microscope (MM-200)",
    "description": "Style:Microscope| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingLightweight and portable, the Carson MM-200 MicroMax pocket microscope is ideal for on-the-go science. The MicroMax offers a powerful 60x to 75x magnification range, making it easy to examine blood samples, bugs, and anything else that's worthy of a closer look. The microscope also includes a built-in LED light that provides a bright, clear image, along with a rubberized eyepiece for comfortable viewing. Best of all, the MicroMax fits conveniently in a jacket pocket, so you can bring it along wherever you go--whether it's a school field trip or a visit to a friend's house.\n\nPlease note that users must hold this LED pocket microscope flat against the surface in order for the image to come in clear and in focus. It will be difficult to view objects with the microscope tilted at an angle due to the very high magnifications. CAUTION: If a user is viewing a shiny surface, sometimes the bright LED light will cause a glare which causes the image to become over exposed and unclear.\n\nSpecifications\n\nMagnification: 60x to 75x\nBatteries: 3 SG3 button cell (included)\nDimensions: 1.25 by 3.25 by 0.75 inches (W x H x D)\nWeight: 1.1 ounces\n\nWarranty\n\nAt Carson, we strive to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied with the quality of our products. We are so confident in our products that we back them with a Lifetime Limited Warranty! Carson will repair or replace your product if it is found to have manufacturing defects in materials or workmanship.
