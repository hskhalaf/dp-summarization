Hoping Microsoft will continue to make devices with this power and screen size.",

The phone was useless for text messaging, video viewing, gaming, and other tasks. I was only able to make calls properly since when the phone is placed on the ear, the screen goes black so it is not messing up. Further, the phone overheats quickly every time is used.",

It slips in my pockets fine (I'm a guy, and wear jeans/slacks a little loose) even with a bumper-style case, but handling it one-handed is definitely a challenge for all but the most basic tasks (and I'm 6' and have relatively large hands). Otherwise I love it. Great features (I love the glance screen and using Crotana's always on/listening capabilities) and the camera is quite good for a phone. It's quick (from clicking the camera button when the phone is locked and asleep to ready to shoot is about 1.5 seconds), and great for outdoor and good for indoor shots.",

Now I have a very sad wife. I am hoping that the seller can resolve this for me quickly?",
