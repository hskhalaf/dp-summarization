I usually wear like a sm or med hat size but medium was too small for me so I got a large. I also own an extra large of this headgear and because of the lace system it is pretty adjustable so I'd say the average teen/adult should get a large or extra-large and either can be adjusted to fit very well.",

Leather outer material, cloth inside so that it doesn't slip, buckle chin strap, tie back and top - this headgear is almost perfect. I say \"almost \" because the only improvement I could possibly suggest is that the cheek pads should extend out a little more to give the user's nose a little more protection. Contender does make a headgear similar to this one that has extended cheek pads, but this one is still better quality.",

I spar about 3-5 times a week. mostly light but also some heavy from time to time. Been using it for about the last 4 months and it's been great!

Furthermore, it offers the protection you need when you do get hit in the face. The view seems slightly restricted but makes up for it in protection which is your number one goal in sparring. Just learn to keep your hands up and you'll be alright.",
