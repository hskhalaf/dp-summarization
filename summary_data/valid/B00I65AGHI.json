Some people can get acne from biotin supplements. That is good to be aware of, so that if you experience it after starting this then you know to discontinue, or to lower your dose. I haven't had that issue, and put this on subscription. . I hope that this review is helpful to you. Do let me know, and happy shopping!",

After using this product for a month, my daily hair loss was back to healthy human quantities (as opposed to existential spiral quantities). Anecdotal evidence, but within the last two months people at yoga and school have commented on how long my hair has been getting. I already purchased again. Thanks!",
