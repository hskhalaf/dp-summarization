There\u2019s not a comfortable position. It\u2019s just plain old awkward. I had high hopes, perhaps foolish of me for the price tag being considered. Or maybe I\u2019m just fancy, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case though, all I want is something that looks nice and is comfortable as the same time; If only I had a lot of money. In the end, the couch just ain\u2019t right. You buy this thing and you\u2019re gonna be sayin the same, for real.",

      "text": "I've been looking for a small fold out couch for almost a year now for my small one bedroom apartment. Originally wanted storage/guest sleeping and found it for $600 at IKEA, a slightly too large sectional. I don't have AC in my bedroom so during summer I usually sleep on the couch, being in a hotter part of Los Angeles. This futon completely looks like a couch, very comfortable seated position and sturdier than I thought. Looking forward to sleeping on it. Was very comfy laying down on the regular couch without folding down. Great color, tough fabric. Very firm, but I do like that. So thrilled for the price, quality and speed in which it was shipped.",

I had to give my hands a break. I wish it used actual screws you turn with a screwdriver. I hate hex keys especially in tight spaces. Ok its finished looks pretty good. Not really comfortable but not awful. The material almost feels like denim. Satisfied so far. We will see how it holds up.",

One of the Allen wrenches were not the right size and the small wrench that was supposed to turn the nuts was way too big and didn't work at all but I have a large toolbox of my own with better quality tools so that was not a problem for me. After I put the couch together I sealed it with Scotch guard because linen is definitely not pet resistant which is also why the blanket is down in the picture. It took the scotch guard well. It looks wonderful in our living room and is my favorite piece of furniture.",

If it\u2019s just a spare room sofa/bed, then I think it\u2019d be fine... but we needed a temp sofa before we move and buy one for our next place and I\u2019m not sure this thing will hold up for 6 months.

Feel like the screws should be at least an inch longer for more support. Not easy to line up and screw together with one person, but I got it done.",
