I forgot his bath towel the other morning, and was able to walk to the door and get it without him tipping over, which I NEVER would have done in the other baby tub",

It is very sturdy, doesn't even float around when she isn't in it despite only using the back suction cup. Takes up less room that the standard reclining baby seats too.",

It also allows us to give him a little bit more water to play in versus him sitting in the tub without a seat. & we always keep eyes on him, but this seat gives us ease knowing he's safe!",
