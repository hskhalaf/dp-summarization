I'm not so colorblind that I see in black and white (and therefore I didn't weep in sublime ecstasy when I first put these on), but I can only see 20% of the numbers in a standard colorblindness test. With these on I see 85%. I keep taking them on and off and marveling at the difference. It's the fact that only certain colors are affected and so dramatically so that makes them seem so darned magical. How the hell do these things work anyway?",

He helped us pick a different pair of glasses that worked for him and even offered contacts as well as refund if they didn\u2019t work.

I later watched the highlights after I received the glasses, and I couldn't believe the difference in color between the uniforms -- I had no problem distinguishing between the teams! The glasses will definitely be useful for situations like those and for when I need to look at colored diagrams for work.",

I will primarily use them to identify colored strands on network wire. Some colors are clearer and more defined others are not. With these glasses I can identify clearly some wires and then look below them to identify the other wires. They will serve their purpose. I did pass a color blind test with them on but it took a lot longer than a normal vision would have. Without them no way. I rate their helpfulness with me about 70%. So I will keep them. They help me work.",

He was still ecstatic! He said the colors he couldn't see were still brighter. I asked him if he wanted to return them. No way he said. He kept putting them on, taking them off. He was just amazed that he could see colors at all. And the price at of $64 can't be beat. The quality of the glasses are very good also.",

He could see all the shades of brown and green in the grass and trees, the red combs on our chickens, the colors in our clothes. It was a huge moment!! These glasses are WAY more affordable than some other colorblind glasses and work for my husband. The reason I chose these was the fact that this company was honest with their description and offer an affordable product. I would recommend these to anyone.",
