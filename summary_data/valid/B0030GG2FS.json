Pre-marked un-drilled screw holes do not line up very well and the screw and plastic nuts are very cheap. You will need two people to attach these screws [one outside one inside].

      "text": "This is a good composter but was difficult to construct. It seems durable and allows turning for faster compost. But putting it together was a major chore even for a very handy person with all the tools. The mfr could do a better job of designing the kit such as pre-drilling holes. I like the size and function. If you are not handy I would choose another. Also the hinged access door swings too far back causing stress on the hinges. I put mine against a tree to stop it from swinging too far back.",

      "text": "This compost tumbler works great. It does require extensive assembly but well worth the labor. I bought this unit in mid summer and began filling it with kitchen scraps, dead leaves and some soil from my graded to get the process moving. I have been amazed at how fast organic material breaks down in this composer. I am excited to uses this fresh compost to get my spring garden into full production. I have read that some people feel the barrel gets to heavy and is hard to turn, but for me I view it as some needed exercise outside in the fresh air! Highly recommend this tumbler if you are looking for a low maintenance solution for composting!",
