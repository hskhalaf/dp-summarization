      "text": "My husband got these for me for karate class. I love the support in the arches, great for my plantar fasciitis. And that's the reason this got a 3. They run big for their size, so they are a little loose, but I can handle that. What upsets me is the fact that after the first use, the sole came off of one of the shoes.... And I was teaching the younger ones in class, not participating except to show how the moves were done. So, very poorly made.",
