      "text": "Make sure you get the actual size for your feet. No need to factor any half sizes or anything. I made the error of not doing this and it fits slightly loose. Despite this, the shoe is remarkable and striking in person. I have had many people compliment me on them and ask me what they are. Sleek and minimalistic modern design. Soft sole with enough bounce to make it pleasurable for regular walks and trots to and from place to place. Likely not a specialist running shoe but can still be used for this purpose just fine too. I wear them for their looks and wouldn't ruin them by running in them.",

I was wrong they slipped on easily and stayed firmly attached! I still don't particularly like the styling, but they are comfortable and what more do you want?",

I would recommend going a size down if you are going to buy these and that way they are more likely to fit better",

They are probably the sort of thing you'd get if you like the look, just be careful.",
