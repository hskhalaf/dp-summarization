      "text": "Absolutely love this. Previously the zest would fly about on the counter, but this keeps it all neatly contained. It will hold quite a bit of zest before I have to empty it. It works quite effortlessly and the squeegy makes it empty. It cleans up easily too. The only negative thing is that it can be a bit of a trick to get the plastic cover back into the groove after emptying the zest but it gets easier with practice. I would definitely recommend this, as it is the best zester I have ever used.",

The measurements printed on it are supper useful and eliminate the need to dirty a measuring spoon. It's so easy to use, with no stress on my hands. It washes up beautifully and the best part is it FITS IN MY DRAWER. The color makes it super easy to find in a junk drawer.",
