Sleep when computer is off and start up with no problems or delays. Headphone jack in front is very convenient. Great sounding speakers at a reasonable price.",

These are not suited for bass heads, albeit I considered myself one of them but due to the nature of living in the apartment I got too many complaints from neighbors with my 5.1 Logitech set up I move down to these bad boys. They sound loud enough to fill your living room. These sound even better when hook on my creative sound card which make everything sound live/crystal clear as if I\u2019m in the studio.",

      "text": "I have a Bose Companion Series II and wanted another pair for my second desktop. When I first got the NX-50, I was not that impressed with the sound. Yet when I compared NX-50 with the Bose, I immediately noticed the difference. The NX-50 sound feels much more \"accurate\" and even 3D. Bose is, like what others said, muddy and the left/right channels are not as separate as the NX-50. NX-50's other features - auto standby, power button separate from volume, and able to take 2 input sources, is another plus from the Bose. I highly recommend the NX-50 over the Bose.",

These go very loud also ... with the volume knob at 50% on the speaker and the computer volume at 40% they are quite loud.",
