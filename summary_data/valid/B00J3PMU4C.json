The outlet does protrude beyond the faceplate about 1/8\" but it doesn't bother me. The outlet that I replaced had 5 wires attached, 2 black, 2 white, and a ground (bare). On first glance it looked like this Leviton only had three screws (white, black, and ground), so for a couple minutes I was confused on how to wire this, but after reading up and looking at the wiring diagram, I saw that the white and black screw clamps on this Leviton accept two wires each.",

It took two savvy searches and a few clicks to order three of these. We now have use of all six outlets and added six USBs, too -- no adapters needed. They are attractive, modern and useful. And when we have company, everyone can plug in. Five stars!!",

      "text": "Works like a charm for charging multiple USB devices without having a wall adapter. I prefer the minimalist look of theses and the face sits only a about 2mm off the wall. Also, it's nice not having to worry about some cheap knock-off adapter my girlfriend has burning down my house. I would suggest that if you plan to purchase this outlet that you choose the receptacle AND wallplate option if you choose any color other than white. This will ensure you have a matching colored wallplate that is also sized for the receptacle itself.",

The density of outlets on this wall plate is nice compared with the competition. On the downside the unit is very deep so need to ensure the wall box is deep enough to take the device and wiring behind it. Also I think it is a bit overpriced compared to the competitors, but then sometimes it is worth paying a premium to ensure long term quality.",
