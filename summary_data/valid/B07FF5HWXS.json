      "verdict": "Adidas Terrex AX3 GTX (men\u2019s and women\u2019s)\u00a0 proves its worthiness on the trail through its performance. It is regarded as an excellent overall gear. Not to mention, it also received praises for its grippy sole, effective waterproofing, and lightness. However, its reported drawbacks may drive potential buyers away. In conclusion, the Terrex AX3 GTX can still be hiking companion in a not-so-demanding terrain\u2014 where one does not require much stability and support.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of owners who have worn the Adidas Terrex AX3 GTX hiking shoe mentions how comfortable it is to wear",

        "Its traction on wet surfaces pleases some online buyers",
        "Plenty of verified purchasers who have tested the shoe in boggy areas state that its waterproof liner is effective",

        "A small percentage of wearers say that this Adidas product lacks stability",

        "The Terrex AX3 GTX from Adidas is a bit stiff out of the box, according to some owners",

These fit poorly, some stitching or seamwork or whatever the hell it is dig into my feet at odd places, there's a ton of discomfort on either end of the toebox, and this all came crashing down a few hours into wearing, which of course is after you can return them. It's a shoddy shoe, and I wish I never bought them because I can't wear them comfortably.",
