I got these because I knew the Harbor Freight choices probably couldn't handle it. These ramps are just wide enough, I have an inch to both sides and with the tri fold, I dont have to worry about going off inside the ramps. The ratchet straps they come with are a must have for keeping this connected to your truck. I chose the 78 inch to have a little better angle. I will update if anything goes wrong with my use going forward. Hopefully you see no updates from me.",
