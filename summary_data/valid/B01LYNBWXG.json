I am one picky guy and this pillow is a home run! I used all three layers on the first night and it was perfect for me. On my back it cradled my neck and head perfectly. The real surprise came when sleeping on my side. This pillow supports both your chin and forehead yet puts no pressure on the mask...exactly what is needed. While the details are not important for this review, my mask fit and AHI number were surprisingly good...it works!",

This resulted in a lot of upper neck pain/tightness and occipital headaches / neuralgia. I bought this pillow and noticed a positive change right away as it allowed me to sleep with my neck in a neutral position. Woohoo! Can't believe I waited this long. My criticisms of the product are that the memory foam layer sleeps very warm and gets hard after a few minutes. I found it very uncomfortable. My solution was to remove the top and bottom layer and replace each layer with 1\" latex foam and the pillow is just about perfect.",

The cut outs are also perfectly sized for my average size head. You can use it in several different orientations to find your comfort zone. Love it.
