However, the light sensor doesn't work properly near street lights--2 of 3 lights installed near the street light would not come on automatically. The solution was to cover about 3% of the top panel with black electrical tape (luckily perfect color match) to cause the light to come on when it gets dark. This solves the auto on/off issue but also reduces the solar recharging of the batteries on partially cloudy days. This isn't a major problem for me in sunny Sothern California.",

Only caution is, if you plan to put in the ground, could be difficult as they are plastic. I wouldn't reccomend (find another way to display)",

They have been super reliable so we purchased a 3rd set of 4.",

By July, however, one was coming on during the day and a week later burned out completely. Now in August, a second tiki has fallen. I attached a photo from my cell phone where I tried to capture 2 that are flickering next to the 2 that have perished. Good news is that the tiki bar is still open, but I am interested to see how long the remaining 6 last. Update - the seller responded to my problem immediately and sent to new lights. They work great and I am pleased with the customer service",
