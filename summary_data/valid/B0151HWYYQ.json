It rolls inward and prevents the bag from sliding out easily. We tear the majority on the full bags that we take out of the can because they catch on the top rim. I also hate the size of the opening. The batteries and motor take up too much area so the size of the hole where the trash can be deposited is limited. The motion sensor works fine and the doors open fully and quickly so that's a plus.",
