      "text": "Received as early Christmas gift from my husband. Just used it for the first time and was very pleased with ease of use! After 'preheating' I brushed top and bottom plates with oil, dropped the first 2 dollops of batter just above center, closed the Maker, clipped the handles together, and listened. When the sizzling steam calmed, it was time to open the Maker and remove the treats. No issues with sticking or burning. Now for a cup of tea! Note: For clean-up, I simply closed the hot irons on a very wet cloth for a few short seconds then left it to cool.",

Take a look at my very first batch, even tried to make the bowl, which will take a little practice.

Differences? No lights. The two pizzelles have the identical design (they are reversed with the \"star\" up on one side and down on the other, so it took awhile to notice that. After 4 dozen pizzelle, I love it. It works perfectly. The handle is sturdier than on my old one, and the latch on the handle makes for a consistent and thin cookie. I used a timer and cooked for 30 seconds, which seemed perfect. Thank you, Palmer.",
