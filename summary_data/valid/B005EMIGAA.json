Once, you purchase them, do know that they'll be hard to find again due to the fact that many sellers are not carrying them anymore, so get them while you can.",

      "text": "I tired the glasses on at a Nordstrom and really fell in love with the look, feel, and weight of the sunglasses. I knew it was overpriced and came to Amazon and save over $100. When the sunglasses arrived it wasn't exactly the same fit as those in the store - the hinge, temple, and ear piece are slightly wider than expected so the sunglasses do not fit snugly on my face and have a tendency to slip when you tilt your head down. Other than that, these are what you expect - fashionable yet masculine with clean appearance.",

Despite that, it was fast delivery and a great product.",
