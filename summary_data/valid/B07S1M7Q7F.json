Once you poor some water in it and maybe through some ice cubes, the radiator soaks in the water and gets wet and the fan blows through it and makes the air cold plus it humidifies the room, so it is not too dry. It also has an option to use it with 4 AA batteries. 2 modes: slow and high and a timer.",

This is a hassle to have to work with Amazon in order to get refunded from this seller, hopefully I can. I have always been able to return products and I buy lots from Amazon with peace of mind. This unit leaks water at the bottom on the second day, not a slow leak. There are 2 fan speeds with not much difference (LL and HH), both are pretty weak. You need to place it within 4 feet to get any cooling effect.",
