I imagine for someone weighing less than 180 pounds this would be an ideal product, If you are my weight or over, this unit will not support your weight properly.",

      "text": "I like my Garden Hopper very much, but there is one real flaw. I often leave my Hopper outside in warm months, near where I need to work. I quickly learned that, when it rains, water collects in the cavity below the bench. No problem, I figured\u2014just flip it upside down when not in use. But then I discovered water somehow seeps inside the vacu-formed base and has no way to drain. Aargh! My very handy husband solved the problem by drilling 3 drain holes in the bottom of the unit (see photo). Problem solved! Still, it would be far preferable for the company to address this issue during the manufacturing process.",

If you're going to be on it for a while, I recommend a cushion because the hard plastic will make your butt hurt.

I use it when I'm tending my raised garden. The garden is 18\" high and the seat is the right height. I also carry it with me through our small vineyard and sit to tie up vines and check weeds and drip fittings. Because the top is NOT on a hinge to easily open and close, I find I keep my tools in pockets on my apron and not inside the seat.",

Also, the handy carrying slot on the seat lets water in, but the solid bottom of the cart doesn't let it out. I would like to suggest to the manufacturer to put a non-slip coating on the seat, and several drainage holes in the bottom. Then it would be perfect. If I were to recommend this product to a friend I would have to include those two caveats.",

The Garden Hopper features a molded-in seat handle for easy transport, a large storage shelf for tools and gloves and a beverage holder. The sturdy double-wall construction will last for years.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAs any gardener knows, even the best-laid plans for spending a day with the soil can be ruined by the necessity for repeated trips to the house or shed for the proper equipment. With the Step 2 Garden Hopper, however, it's possible to pack everything you need for a full day's gardening and take it all wherever you go. The Garden Hopper features an extremely sturdy seat that's just high enough to offer a comfortable perch yet low enough to keep you close to your garden. While a molded carrying handle is included within the seat itself, the Hopper's 7-inch wheels make it simple to scoot about without rising. With its sturdy double-wall construction, the Garden Hopper is strong enough to take a lot of rugged treatment. Beneath the seat is a large storage space, perfect for holding your gloves, tools, seeds, cellular phone, and other accessories you may need. In addition, this handy garden helper includes a built-in holder for a 12-ounce beverage, eliminating the need to run back into the house for refreshment. The Garden Hopper measures about 14 inches tall, 12.5 inches wide, and about 22 inches long. --Benjamin Reese",
