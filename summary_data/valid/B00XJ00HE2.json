This, coupled with my mechanic over-torquing the lug nuts, resulted in both a stripped lug and a stripped lug socket, not to mention a long and very frustrating Saturday night in the cold with a flat tire.",

Great as an emergency wrench to keep in your trunk since anyone who has ever had to use the factory kit provided with most vehicles knows how awful they are to use (especially on the side of a busy highway, at night). If you plan to use it a lot, I'd get a better one. The tolerances seem a bit looser than my Ken-Tool, which is probably the cause of the lug marring, but it's also 3-4 times the price.",
