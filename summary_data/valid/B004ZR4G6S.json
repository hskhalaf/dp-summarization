They take a little bit of an adjustment coming from what I had because they what so more efficiently than I was used to. If you heat them properly (see YouTube videos), add you oil/butter at the proper time, and then the food, nothing sticks to them and clean up is a snap. I wound up getting the saucier pans, the butter warmer, the big stockpot, and a the 8\u201d fry pan...basically the entire D3 collection. I won\u2019t ever buy another pot/pan again in my lifetime. Incredible value. I\u2019m inspired to cook again.",

I cooked eggs in the pan on the first day of owning them and the pan is totally ruined.

You get a pretty good idea about the quality of the product (which is the most expansive one in the market) when an unused pan is rusted. I guess just putting a \"made in America\" label does not guarantee the quality of the product. So disappointed.",
