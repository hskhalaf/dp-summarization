Looks like a pretty simple item to take apart and clean, the only thing I didn't like was it DID NOT COME WITH ANY INSTRUCTIONS! I mean, it is just a simple piece but some washing instructions would have been nice....like top rack dishwasher or bottom? can i put the spray nozzle in the dishwasher or wash by hand? how would i unclog it if it ever clogs? and so on.....I haven't used it yet.",
