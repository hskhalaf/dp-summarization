Pros: Looks adorable , sturdy, easy to move , canopy is great for blocking light Cons: the mattress has a huge split down the middle so I see why my infant hates laying in it , not comfortable looking at all. But the biggest flaw is the safety , my 3 week old infant cannot lay flat she winds up on her side or pressed against the sides. this is a HUGE safety problem . If this mattress was different it would be great but it\u2019s going back",
