The most useful pieces to me are the jig that can be used to hold the watch case, and the back pry-off tool. I probably won't use everything in the case. Manufacturing workmanship of the tools is adequate. I recommend this product. HINT: I'd look for a model-specific battery replacement video on YouTube before opening the watch case. I learned that the battery holding mechanisms vary from brand to brand and their workings are not always obvious. I replaced three watch batteries today with no casualties!",

There is a height-adjustable platform for the watch to rest on when you line up the pin for removal. The platform wouldn't go as high as I needed it to, which is why I gave it a 4-star rating vice 5.

I ran into one watch that had far too tight of pins and I bent some trying but that was the watches fault but they give you backups for the main pins. There was one pin that didn't have any backups unfortunately so I should have looked before attempting hammer the pin out. There's more than I should need in this kit and it has already saved me money.",

      "text": "I ordered this kit because I had quite a few watches which needed new batteries. This is a great kit! I used the tools necessary to change the batteries in several watches and it was easy to open the watches and switch out the old and new batteries. There are tools for removing links from watch straps also but I will do that at another time. Great value in my opinion!",

The only thing missing was a tool to close the back after opening it. I finally went on YouTube.com and found a video that taught me how to do it with the simple tools I had at home. The instruction booklet could have been more descriptive, but I can figure most things out. I also know how to go on the internet or YouTube.com and find the instructions I need, Was well worth the money. Thank you for a great product.",

I usually pay upwards of $15 for each watch battery replacement so it adds up quickly. I bought this kit and a new battery for one watch to start out with. My boyfriend changed it out for me within 5-10 minutes! That is amazing for someone that has never touched a watch repair kit--super easy to do! I haven't tried it yet but I know it'll be super easy to do! This kit will pay for itself on the next watch I do already!",

I surprised myself by doing the repair on my own after watching a YouTube how-to. I'm happy I got this kit, I'm wearing my watch today. I have also used it to repair another watch with a snap on cover. The second watch needed a battery replacement.",
