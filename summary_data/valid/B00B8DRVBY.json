I liked the way my skin felt but most of all I received compliments from others and also noticed my complexion looked better in pictures. So when I purchased the product, I didn't go back to the retail store because they wanted $50 more than Amazon for the same product, same size. Will continue to buy this product from Amazon.",

When this runs out, I may try a bee venom serum, with a stronger concentration,and pair that with a regular moisterizer. I think any benefit of the bee venom component should be more noticeable (or not) with that regimen.",
