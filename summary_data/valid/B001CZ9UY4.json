The axe has a much nicer feel to it now. Again, It is a light axe, you won't be chopping down trees with or spitting lager logs with it, just some work around the fire or some branch removal. I bought it for a little project and to take camping without the worry of something happening to it. I have nicer axes but sometimes you don't want to bring them to campgrounds where they may walk off. ..if something happens to this one..its not the end of the world.",

I will mostly use it for making kindling and light splitting, but I also bought a quality leather scabbard from the forestry supply so I can take it camping/backpacking where it will likely get pressed into general chopping and bushcraft. So far I am very happy with the axe and look forward to using it more.",

I did put a full- length fiberglass handle on this to give me more leverage/speed on my swings. All wooden axe handles loosen pretty quickly, so that is to be expected and I didn't deduct points for it. Try finding another deferentially hardened axe head for this price. Good luck. Back when axes were the preferred method for felling trees, this was about the size they were. This is the size they should be.",

So when the axe was in transit, the head must have gotten slightly damaged. I've tried to sharpen it, and i don't think it'll be an issue so I'm not returning it.",

It had no problems falling a couple of 5-8\" diameter hardwoods,or clearing up some deadfall. For the price,I highly recommend it. I DO wish it would have came with a sheath (even knowing this would raise the price a bit),but that's a nit that really isn't in the same cart to pick,so I digress :p",
