Our dryer is 1.5 years old and out of warranty with similar issues to many others. Samsung does not admit to knowledge of a systemic issue with fan relay quality and wants a service payment up front plus hourly rate and parts to come diagnose a faulty control board that just needs to be tapped on to get the relay to re-set. Very upsetting to have a manufacture continually sell faulty products and not stand behind their brand.",

It is wonderful, I just bout another for my daughter and she loves it, my son needs a dryer as well and looking to buy him one. I have never had any issues with it. I have the matching washer and loads are done so quick. I am sorry people have been having issues with theirs but I absolutely love mine.",

Not a clog or anything...just a piece of junk. Do Not buy this thing. Waste of money.",
