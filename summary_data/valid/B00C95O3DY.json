Don't waste the twenty-plus dollars, just get a decent small skillet if you really want to make breakfast sandwiches.",

Its a great idea but the egg section is really the issue, doesn't seal all the way and you can only cook 1 egg at a time and I'm sorry my child even eats 2 eggs on his sandwiches.

      "text": "This has been the best purchase for my 6 year old. He is obsessed with breakfast sandwiches but I never want to make them. Now he can do it himself and he wants to make it for everyone. It does take quite a bit of time to make more than one with just the single though. We\u2019ve learned to let the egg cook a few minutes before putting the top bread on or it will be soggy.",

Also, I don\u2019t care for eggs the way they picture them. I scramble the eggs thoroughly before adding to the sandwich maker. I also wait about 90 seconds into the cooking process before adding the top English muffin. Buy this thing. It\u2019s awesome.",

And clean up It's easy too. It's really small so it easily stashes away in a drawer. It's very simple which makes it great and worthwhile purchase that you will USE. I hate clutter so I tend to stay away from kitchen gadgets, but I really like this thing. It's fun to make breakfast sandwiches! The recipe book is pretty scarce, though, but you can easily make up recipes. Yesterday I made mini bagel, egg, mild green chilis, pepper Jack cheese and sirloin steak sandwiches!",
