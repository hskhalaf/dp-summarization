I took off a star because one of the panels backing the door came off but I actually think it looks better like that so took the panel off the other door. (There's a thin wood panel nailed in behind the door grid - if you take it out the grid become open instead of blocked.) Also, with the panels gone I didn't need to install the handles (since I can just grab the door) so left them off for a sleeker look).",

The front design is a wicker type of material to create the 'tyed' look. I am using as a furniture piece instead of a sofa table because I wanted something taller and it is perfect! (not as a buffet - which would be a small buffet). It attractive and classy looking and mixes well with transitional decor'!",

When it arrived it was packaged well and no pieces were damaged. Assembly was pretty easy, but we did have trouble getting a couple of the leg screws in since the holes were not perfectly aligned. It looks awesome assembled, just like the picture shown! I would totally recommend this piece to others.",
