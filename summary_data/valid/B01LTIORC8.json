I bought a fairly nice case and a screen protector and the iPad has held up. This is his 5th tablet (all kindles and androids prior) and this is by far the best. I can't imagine ever wanting to go back. Also battery life after 4 months has not degraded at all. I have to charge it maybe every 3 days with moderate use.",

It works fine if the charging cable is not plugged. I waited a month to see if it gets better and it didn't. And now of course there is no longer a return/exchange option through amazon.

Price-wise is also cheaper than the iPad air even if the New iPad 2017 has the latest powerful chip sensor A10 and now supports apple pencil. I bought the glass 9.7 protector for this that also fits iPad air.]",

Is it because of the advanced OS or something else. We can't do OS updates on hers at 9.3.5. It's just that old. Anyway, I'm thinking this is just a bad device... but I could be wrong.",

The charger cord itself is way too short if you are needing to charge & still continue to use the iPad at the same time. But that really is the only criticism I have for it. If you are wanting to buy an iPad, I totally recommend this model.",
