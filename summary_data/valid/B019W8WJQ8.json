      "text": "This is a high quality good stroller but God Almighty, this thing is huge. I underestimated how big it would be. If you are primarily using it from your front door, maybe it's okay. For us, it's always from the car and it's so big we don't even bring it most of the time due to space. It's hard to fit it in stores also. The big wheels are not as good outside as I had hoped, either. The reversible feature is great and the basket is huge, but we ended up getting a second stroller for travel because of this one's size so I wish I had a jogging stroller instead of this one plus my travel one.",

The sunshades provide amazing coverage and the seats are comfortable. My only complaint is that it is hard to configure for one seat to be reclined while the other is upright. The one hand controlled telescoping handle makes it easy for me and my husband to switch off pushing. The basket is large enough to hold scooters, helmets, and diaper bags for all of your adventures. The push is great and it handles all terrains really well.",

It's not as light as the other smaller models, but I was able to lift it in and out of our trunk within a few days of delivering our child. So happy we purchased this.",

I love the space at the bottom and the different position you can do with the seat. I love how the stroller can go \"off roading\" ive taken it on sand, gravel, dirt, grass and the usual concrete and it handles it fine. Even going up or down on curbs or going over bumps is fine.",
