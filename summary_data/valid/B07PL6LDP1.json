I also thought the actually sound bar sounded a little off. Maybe it would have gotten better if I allowed it to break in.

Be sure to use an HDMI ARC connection from your television if you are able -- it makes things much easier, because then the TV can control the volume of the soundbar. Pairing between the wireless subwoofer and the soundbar was very easy. Do be careful where you place the package after receiving it from UPS. The Sony packaging will have ink on the bottom of it that will easily transfer to other surfaces. I stupidly placed the box on the bedspread in the guest bedroom, and ink transferred to the bedspread. Took significant effort to recover the bedspread from that.",

One thing to remember is to turn off the actual tv speaker or you\u2019ll get an echo... after a few minutes of \u201cduh\u201d... it was AMAZING. The subwoofer and sound bar have separate volume controls so you can turn the subwoofer down or off completely. For those family movie nights and intense action movies it\u2019s crazy how loud the subwoofer really is... it can vibrate your chest with the right movie. A+ for Sony once again. Worth EVERY penny!
