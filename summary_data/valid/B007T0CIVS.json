Advice to non-indian folks - Indian cooking by far requires the heaviest amount of grinding, blending and other rough usages which any other cuisine does not require. In other words if this fits me it will fit your use for sure! This is extremely durable and can be used for anything (crush ice, margarita mix, salsa, avocado dips etc). I have been using this for last 2 years without a glitch in the heaviest of manner- highly recommend",

Preethi, on the other hand, can grind anything; black pepper, coffee beans, coriander seeds, dry red chillies, roasted dal--all turn into super-fine powder! Also, great for making batter of any kind. It changed my life. I am still getting over the trauma of that terrible Cuisinart. But Preethi makes cooking a joy. Another plus point is that it is not too loud (unlike Cuisinart!).",

I wanted to write this review for so long but wanted to use this mixer multiple times before i wanted to post the review. Even after using it only few times with medium grinding material , the Motor Coupler broke. I really did not have a clue as to why it broke so easily. I spent almost $100 for it and did not use it for more thn 10 times and its useless now.",
