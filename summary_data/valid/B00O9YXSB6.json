New Balance is extremely consistent in their sizing. They are a very supportive and sturdy shoe. My husband prefers Velcro straps for easy adjustment. His other preference is the bone color which wasn't an option this time. He settled for gray and seems to like them, too. We've purchased New Balance for many years and they have never left us down.",

I ordered these in 10.5 and am well pleased with them. I don't know if my feet grew or the NEW BALANCE shoes run small. I think they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I have diabetes and have had foot problems in the past.",
