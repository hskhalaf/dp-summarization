      "text": "There is a \"standard\" keyboard design for a reason. Whoever designed this keyboard should be terminated. Whoever approved this keyboard should be terminated. Where the right \"shift\" key should be, they put the up arrow. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you can keyboard without looking at the keyboard, you are constantly moving your curser up in whatever you are working on, versus getting a capital letter. It is maddening. This otherwise perfect laptop is ruined by this seemingly simple alteration. Again, there is a standard keyboard design for a reason. If this laptop weren't so expensive, I would have bashed it with a hammer.",

I have locked myself out of accounts because I keep hitting up arrow instead of shift key. I have sort of gotten use to it, but when I use other computers and then come back to this one same learning curve all over. Why would they move the shift key like that. Bad keyboard design.",

However, there is a hardware defect on its keyboard. Specifically, WER and UIO keys work intermittently. Can Lenovo has a little better quality control on their production line? Yes, I can use these keys under tablet mode, but it is annoying if I want to type a long document.",
