Will probably switch to rechargeable AA batteries once it's time to change, which I do with all my devices that I use a lot. I don't use for gaming so I can't speak to that, but the mouse is very responsive and the keyboard very comfortable.",

Well, it finally started to die on me. The mouse was still working pretty well, but some of the keyboard keys were acting sluggish and required multiple hits. So I ordered this new one. No learning curve at all for me - and it worked perfectly out of the box and so did the new mouse. I'll give the old one to GoodWill and they may be able to salvage it. So glad this model was still available. Best keyboard ever - at least in my opinion.",

I've never experienced this with another keyboard and I've used computers heavily for 25 years. If I miss dead center, the keys require a great amount of force to depress. The problem has gotten worse over time, to the point that I'm going to replace it. It won't be with another Logitech device. I'm a decent typist, but this keyboard is just too difficult to use for touch typing.",

The mouse has a control for speed of scrolling just below the scroll wheel on the top of the mouse. It is way to easy to touch that control and set the mouse flying across the screen without any advanced warning. Yet another problem with the MK710 combination. I would NOT recommend this product.",

No display, lag in response time and 10 key keyboards would not type certain numbers without consistent presses. Highly recommend avoiding this product",

      "text": "What an awful product. So disappointed in Logitech. Used them for years, but no more. All worked fine for about one week, then the space bar would very often not register. You can imagine the frustration of typing an email this way. The mouse is also very flimsy. The scroll wheel is so loose (no clickly scroll feel) and it very often registers an unwanted scroll at the slightest touch. The MX510 mouse if a far superior product. This whole package is going back. Highly disappointed. And this thing wasn't cheap either. BTW I experienced identical behavior with the USB reciever plugged into the docking station as well as the laptop directly.",

Additionally, the Keyboard has spindly flip up legs that collapse when the keyboard is slid around. Overall, the keyboard is good quality with these design problems. UPDATE: latest version of software allows disabling the side buttons on the M705 mouse",

If the company would spend a little bit more for reliable switches, they would have wonderful tools.
