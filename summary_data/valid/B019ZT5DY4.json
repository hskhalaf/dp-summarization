Also the Amcrest mobile app is very good to navigate I personally don\u2019t have any complaints for the mobile app. And the only reason why I stop using the Amcrest GPS device was simply because what I needed it for based on the information AM-GL300 was completed.",

      "text": "The device works fine, however, your support is terrible. This is my second AM-GL300 because the first would not charge. I requested an RMA and all I got was nothing but a run-around. After your support asks me to send a 3rd RMA it became very clear they had no intentions of replacing the device. Therefore, extremely frustrated I just bought another AM-GL300. If I have trouble with this device and your support, I will buy from another company and write a harsh comment to Amazon for all potential buyers to read.",
