      "text": "I love Viva chia seeds! The price for this amount of chia seeds is unbeatable. I use them so many ways, they're a great way to get protein and omegas if you eat minimal meat like me. My favorite ways to eat them: 1/4 c soaked overnight with 1/2 c almond milk and a splash of vanilla to make a delicious pudding that I top with strawberries for breakfast. In winter I add a bit of cinnamon & maple syrup and then soak them and top with apple pieces and walnuts. Blended with frozen fruit then soaked overnight to make a jam that's great on toast or in yogurt parfaits. I've even added them to muffin batter with delicious results.",

I noticed that the bag is made of layers of something metallic and something like paper and/or plastic- hi tech. But light comes through the bag where there are wrinkles, suggesting that it is not well sealed. So I moved the seeds to another container which also is much easier to pour from and re-seal.",

If you enjoy chia seeds, you've probably got a good idea as to how to incorporate them into your diet, and you probably know by now that they don't have a strong flavor on their own. The one thing I can say definitively is that these make an awesome chia pudding when combined with coconut milk and cocoa powder.",

I sprinkle the Chia seeds on my Greek yogurt with berries, on my cereal, salads, soup, just about anything. I also happen to enjoy the light crunch. Don't know if it makes a difference, but i store the package in my refrigerator.,O yes, another plus for me: No grinding necessary.",

It appears fresh and I like that it is in a heavy duty package with a ziplock top and a square bottom that stands upright which means I don't have to transfer the product to another container. Very convenient. It was a quick ship and a great seller. Will order again. Thank you",

    "description": "Size:2 Pound (Pack of 1)| Style:Seeds\n\nChia seeds were first harvested over 3,000 years ago by the ancient Mayan, Inca and Aztec empires. Warriors used this tiny superfood during times of conquest to improve stamina and endurance. Raw, gluten-free, organic, vegan, nut-free and grain-free, these seeds make the perfect addition to any modern-day diet.\n\nOmega 3\u2019s: Chia Seeds are naturally preserved by an omega-3 called cinnamic acid, preventing them from going rancid and extending their shelf-life. Studies indicate omega-3\u2019s help to reduce inflammation and improve cardiovascular health. Viva Naturals Organic Chia Seeds contain 2,440mg of omega-3\u2019s per serving.\n\nFiber: Fiber has been shown to promote regularity, maintain blood sugar and promote a satiety effect. Viva Naturals Organic Chia Seeds contain 4g of fiber per serving, making it an excellent all-natural thickener and binder in all of your favourite recipes.\n\nSuggested Uses: Chia seeds can be used as a binder in virtually any recipe because of its gel-forming ability, or can simply be sprinkled over your favourite smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt and salads. Add 1-2 tablespoons per day to amplify the nutritional integrity of your favourite dishes.\n\nThe Viva Naturals Difference: Chia seeds, derived from the purple flowers of the plant Salva hispanica, are sustainably grown in the mineral-rich soil regions of South America. Once the flowers have fully matured, they are thoroughly threshed and cleaned, yielding seeds of exquisite taste and nutritional substance. Viva Naturals selectively chooses prime quality chia seeds, supplying higher concentrations of inflammation-reducing omega-3. Viva Naturals Organic Chia Seeds are sourced directly from farmers in compliance with fair trade practices and are certified organic.",
