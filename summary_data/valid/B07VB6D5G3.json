The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the only fragrance feminine enough for my senses was \"Library of Prints\"(smells like florals and white tea). The other two scents enclosed with this Advent calendar both smelled very masculine and unappealing.",

But the product itself is lovely and the scents were really nice. A fun change in advent gifts (over the usual chocolates).",
