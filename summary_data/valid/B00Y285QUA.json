It was lightweight enough to load in cars and trams easily, but sturdy enough to carry two children and a backpack. The only cons are: the locking foot brake and the sun shade. You have to push up the brake to unlock it, which can be uncomfortable if you are wearing sandals. The sun shade is a little narrow, not a fully coverage canopy. Edit 6/2/20: Four more Disney trips later and this is STILL a fantastic stroller! It has held up great!!",

Other than that, we love the storage of numerous cup holders and a catch-all up top for the parents. Breaks work well. Folds easily. Smooth ride. Front seat reclines nearly flat allowing for naps. The older one can still ride standing up at that point, but not sitting. Fits through all doorways. Nice height handles with comfortable grip.",

Unless you're cruising on rubber floor mats, you're going to feel every single bump in the ground. Sidewalks offer a solid one-two punch, as the front wheels, then the back wheels, announce every crack, seam, and gap available. Not pleasant for anyone involved. Sleeping baby? Forget it.

Cons: Heavy (but I'm ok with that, because if it were light weight I doubt it would be as safe and sturdy). Wish there was more space between the seats so kids can't reach each other, but if it were bigger, it probably wouldn't fit into the boot of my car.",

Even with slightly smaller dimensions, it\u2019s still too heavy to carry with one hand and too bulky to store in the trunk of the car. The biggest design flaw (outside of the bench seat being uncomfortable) is the ability of the child to put their feet on the brakes and wheels. My 2.5yr old can stop our walk in an instant. I\u2019m hoping in time he\u2019ll learn the new rules, but it\u2019s awfully frustrating!

This one can take tight turns and be driven readily around the kitchen and living room (middle of winter, below zero & much snow here, so not strolling outside). My only critique is the compromise made to make this a two-fer. The canopy is narrow and always \"up\", either over infant or toddler side. It has no \"down\" position & it may not prove useful in the sun. The basket is also hard to access from any direction. The capacity is fine if you can figure out how to get your stuff in and out.",

It folds up quickly and easily and not too heavy to lift. It fits perfectly in my small suv. The only thing I dislike is the maneuverability in rougher terrain(grass, hills, etc) the wheels are just not built for terrain especially with 2 kids, much easier with just one kid in stroller but definitely not a deal breaker for me!",

Nice basket size fits a backpack, jackets. Cup holders/trays great for cups and snacks. I put on my canvas attachable pouch with additional pockets, and it eliminates need to carry a purse or fancy pack on outings.",

I do wish it were a bit of a smoother ride and a little easier to maneuver. The small storage holder between the cup holders on the handle isn't quite big enough for my iphone 6, so it is a little annoying while it rattles around. I wish it were a little longer and had a closed top for this storage. Overall, I'm happy!",

I don't have the car seat for this stroller, so I don't use that aspect, but it's still worth it. The only thing that I wish could change is the canopy. It doesn't cover both children when both are in sitting position.",
