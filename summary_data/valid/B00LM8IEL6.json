      "verdict": "When it comes to comfort, support, and fit, the Scarpa Moraine GTX goes all out. These qualities already make the shoe enticing to own, and yet it goes the extra mile by having remarkable water protection. Having said that, some people might find its break-in period rather disconcerting. To sum up, getting the Scarpa Moraine GTX for all its splendid features is a smart choice, especially if would-be owners can put up with its break-in time.",

      "title": "Comfortable, Great Quality, Compares Well to Older styles",
      "text": "My last pair of scarpa hiking shoes lasted 9 years and I used them a lot. I was very pleased to find this newer style felt just as comfortable (like VERY comfortable!) and is excellent in wet weather. I love how lightweight and environmentally friendly they are. My only worry at first was that the eyelets of my old scarpa were closer together when you pulled the laces closed, so I thought that the middle part wouldn't be so protected, but it's totally fine. They are a great shoe!!",
