      "text": "The Coolpix comes with a Cool-Station and several cables which are required to complete use of the camera. It is an example of how modern computer/miniaturization technology has bypassed electrical engineering design. The brick on the AC adaptor is larger than the camera and it is attached to a 5 ft cable to connect to the Cool-Station. To transfer image files to your computer, you need a separate card reader or (1) the 5 foot power input cable to the AC Adaptor, (2) the 5 ft. DC output cable, (3) the Cool-Station, and (4) the 5 ft. USB connector cable. I like the camera itself but really dislike the mess required to set up to download photos.",

I bought it new from Amazon. Poor return policy, and camera is JUNK.",

    "description": "Nikon Coolpix S1 5.1 MP Slim-Design Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Includes Dock)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Nikon Coolpix S1 offers 5.1 effective megapixels and a 3x optical zoom-Nikkor ED glass lens for beautiful 16 x 20inch prints. The incredible 2.5 inch LCD makes for easy viewing and image playback. This stunning camera has a compact metal body that's a mere 3/4 inch thick and is shirt pocket small.\n\n The included Coolstation dock makes it easy to download images, and Nikon's exclusive in-camera Red-Eye fix, automatically removes most typical instances of red-eye during the picture taking process. The D-Lighting feature automatically lightens overly dark images in playback mode. There's no guesswork, as on-screen help is available for all main menu functions.\n\n 5.1 Megapixel CCD and 3x Optical Zoom-Nikkor Lens\nThe Nikon Coolpix S1 combines a 3x optical zoom-Nikkor lens with a 5.1 effective megapixel CCD, which lets the user capture spectacular images at resolutions up to 2592 x 1944 (15MB file) and create amazing 16 x 20 inch prints. The 3x zoom-Nikkor lens offers a 35 to 105 millimeter zoom (35mm equivalent) and provides excellent image quality.\n\n Incredible, Bright 2.5 inch LCD\nThe oversized and easy-to-see 2.5 inch LCD makes composing your pictures easier, as well as making it more fun to share your pictures while they are still in the camera.\n\n Compact, Slim, Metal Body\nThe Coolpix S1 has a compact metal body that is a mere 3/4 inch thick. This shirt-pocket-small camera will come along everywhere you go! Its sleek and sexy styling is a delight to use and own.\n\n Nikon Exclusive Face Priority Autofocus\nThe S1 can distinguish when the subject is a human face and sets the focus accordingly. Now all your portraits will have tack-sharp focus on the subject's face (rather than the wall behind them!).\n\n Nikon Exclusive In-Camera Red-Eye Fix\nA hands-free solution for red-eye; this powerful software analyzes the image data and corrects most typical instances of red-eye in less than 3 seconds! The In-Camera Red-Eye Fix feature turns on automatically when the red-eye reduction flash mode is selected.\n\n Nikon Exclusive D-Lighting\nThe Coolpix S1 incorporates D-Lighting, which automatically compensates for under- and over-exposure due to insufficient flash or excessive back lighting in a picture.\n\n 17 Scene Modes, 4 with Scene Assist\nSelecting a scene mode automatically sets the camera for the optimum performance in most popular picture-taking situations. Scene assist further aids with composition, exposure and focus. Scene Modes: party/indoor, dawn/dusk, back light, beach/snow, sunset, night landscape, copy, fireworks, close up, panorama, museum, underwater and voice recording. Scene assist modes: night portrait, portrait, landscape, and sports.\n\n Adjustable GUI with Help Button\nChoose between the traditional menu item view or the all new ICON view. Press the help button and it will instantly display an explanation for all main menu functions on the LCD.\n\n What's in the Box:\nCool-Station MV-11, li-ion rechargeable battery, AC adapter, USB cable, strap, A/V cable, imaging software, including Nikon PictureProject. Optional accessories include SD cards, camera case, underwater case and more.",
