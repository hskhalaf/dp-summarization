The only thing - I'm not sure what kind of ice ax other people use, but damn, there is a LOT of slack on the leash. I had to cut just about half off in order to not have tons bunched up or hanging! The cinch I was initially worried as first, since it's thin metal, but it seems to hold up fine, and not move as much as I was expecting it to.",
