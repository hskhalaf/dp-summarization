It clamps on easily to the can, turns smoothly, opens the can quickly, and has comfortable grips and knob. Highly recommended, if you're willing to wash it by hand. {To be fair, a quick rinse of the cutter will usually suffice.} Review of:  :-)",

Shortly after this Farberware appeared on our kitchen counter, the Sabatier disappeared (I am pretty sure she disposed of it). I have to admit, this Farberware is much easier to use.",
