I was tested the sub with another 10\" mtx running parallel at around 2 ohms, and the amp only puts out around 600watts rms. Overall performs worse than my other subs that are only rated at 200watts rms. I would only recommend these to people who are going to put the time in to build a box for it bc I tried off the shelve sealed and ported boxes and still got ok-ish results.",

Sewn on surround, hard fiberglass dust cap, cast basket, and sewn in woven speaker leads. The only thing I can think negative about them was they put a ugly decal on the magnet and I tore them off to reveal the Chrome backplate.",
