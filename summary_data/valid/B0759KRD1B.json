By the sixth night, the foam in the corner (where the two side arms meet) had completely collapsed, and now provides less than a half inch of padding to the floor. While this is due to the fact that she curls up exclusively in that corner and the rest of the bed has retained its shape, I was really hoping the density would hold out longer than it did, even with constant pressure in one location.",

I have a sense of humor, but really? where is the quality control? I attempted to attach a picture of the image, however amazon will not post it as it is considered obscene. It would appear company can include unsolicited obscene graphics on the products they sell and not be flagged or held accountable.",

The item looks to be returned because it had no plastic covering or tag of any sort. Nothing on the item or inside the box as to what brand it even is. The bed is not orthopedic. The inside is a cheap hard piece of foam. The arms are all disfigured and the inside is all broken. I am seriously shocked that anyone would ship this to a customer. To say I'm very upset and disappointed is an understatement. I have added pics to this review.",

I have an 11 year old great dane who needs the comfort of a bed and when they don't last long, its upsetting.
