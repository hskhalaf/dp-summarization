      "text": "So I went with the white marble design, which looks terrific. And my iPad mini 2 fits into it like a charm. It's light but sturdy. The three ridges to keep the mini upright are nifty. All pertinent buttons are easily accessible. And the sleep feature works beautifully. But now for the bad news: it smells. I aired it out overnight and got rid of the cover odor. Alas, once I opened the case there was that chemical smell again--and airing it out for days on end has hardly diminished it. I guess I'll have to take the bad with the good.",

No one would know it's an iPad. When the seller contacted me via email to ask if I was satisfied with my purchase that made me feel as though my purchase was appreciated. It's hard to find good customer service these days, so for me, that took this purchase from 5 stars to the moon! Thank you.",

It does not snap closed, no pockets, no bells or whistles. After 2 months I haven't had it long enough to vouch for durability, but I gave it 5 stars anyway. This was a good value, even if it doesn't last forever. Note: my old cover was high quality leather, had pockets and a magnetic snap closure that this one does not, but it never fit perfectly, would not stand up correctly, always a hassle. So far I'm much happier with this one.",

The opening should be bigger to allow for easy access, and doing this won't make it less protective. All around I think the case is fine, but it is a bit 'clunky' around the iPad which is otherwise a sleek device. I like the color and the quality of the stitching, and the pen holder and front pocket are good additions to the case. So overall, I'd say it is 'fine'. Not great, not bad, but fine.",

It is too small for an index or thumb finger flat accesss with compatibility finger print feature. So to enhance my access to use the finger print unlock feature, I cut out the strip of leather at the home-bottom area on the case. As you can see in my photo it is easier to place my finger in that space.",
