      "verdict": "Simple, yet functional \u2014 possibly the most fitting description of the Adidas Ligra 6. This pair of volleyball shoes is crafted to support the dynamic movements of the sport. Jumping and running will not be an issue as the midsole attenuates shock during landing. To top it all off, the light and breathable upper facilitates comfort during long periods of play.",
      "pros": [
        "Almost all of the owners commend the underfoot comfort provided by the Adidas Ligra 6",
        "Based on the quality of the trainer, many shoppers find it to be reasonably priced",
        "The overall design of the footwear appeals to a lot of buyers",
        "Plenty of players have said that this model is suitable for various indoor sports because of its grippy outsole",
        "A good number of athletes claim that this Adidas volleyball shoe provided adequate lateral support while playing volleyball",
        "The lightweight nature of the shoe resonates well with multiple users",
        "Several folks like that the Ligra 6 accommodated the use of athletic ankle braces like the Active Ankles"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The top material is too stiff and needs to be broken in, ranted several people",
        "Some individuals dislike the collar because it did not fit the ankle well and made the shoe appear clunky",
        "The visible glue marks between the sole unit and the upper have made a few consumers doubt the footgear\u2019s durability"
