I am about to purchase a second one for my laptop. For the price it is exceptional.",

It definitely lives up to its excellent reputation. I love that the back light comes in so many colors. The power button on the keyboard is a definite sell factor as well. Even the rectangular shape makes it feel more ergonomically designed for larger hands. Nice matted finish as well. I would strongly recommend this mini wireless keyboard to anyone.",

Some of my other remotes would turn stuff off by just picking them up. The shape of this one makes it easy to hold, I did add some rubber tabs on the bottom to hold it more securely. The \"OK\" button is raised so you're not pressing an arrow button instead. This remote is great for the internet,Kodi or typing.",

Unlike most that have the Q, A, and Z all in one line, this one has correct QWERTY letter positions, features a power key, media keys, left and right mouse buttons, F keys, everything you need.

If you are never going to remove the dongle once you plug it in you'll probably like it. Otherwise, you should pick something else.",

Thus I have a keyboard paperweight. Will see how Amazon and Okela determine to fix the problem. *Really enjoy the ease with which the remote offers on my Amazon Fire Box. No more hunt and peck typing. Red, yellow, purple, and blue allow to better see the Function keys and symbols, but orange, light blue and lime green are my favorites. Touchpad works great and has various sensitivity settings.",
