I am beginning to feel like Belkin is forcing me to upgrade, due to their software updates seemingly making this product redundant. Again, worked great with Alexa/Google for about a year but the most recent iOs Wemo App update completely wrecked this device.",

I've spent hours trying to connect to my home network, spent > 2 hours on the phone with two Wemo techs--no luck.

I wish I could return the 3 plugs I purchased through Amazon, but I'm past the 30 day return period and wemo will not refund, only provide replacements. I ended up buying Potemics and they installed on my eero system and VPN in ~ 20 min. Lesson learned!",
