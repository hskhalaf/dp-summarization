The reason I gave 3 stars is because Alexa never shuts up with, \"If you want to follow us on facebook....\", or, \"For another dose of trivia...\" or, \"...to learn more about this skill, check out....\". After using my Echo/Alexa for so many years, along with basically the same skills throughout the same time, I'd like to see these superfluous (and mildly annoying) boilerplate responses either cut from the routine responses, or just give long-time users the option to disable these time-wasting statements.",

I don't have any Alexa-enabled devices so I may add some as I learn more about it.

Alexa still can't understand me half the time, doesn't wait long enough for me to talk, can't do basic things like tell me store hours or whether or not its raining outside. The speaker is louder than before, but not exactly better. And most annoyingly, every 7-10 days or so, it just forgets about my wifi and I have to set it up all over again. Super annoying. None of my gen1 Alexa devices have this problem. Overall, I'd rate this thing a meh with a capital M.",

Thanks for fixing the issue and now I love my new echo again!!! Original - I'm confused by the \"improved audio\" statement. We have 3 first generations of this model and they all sound so much better. It's disappointing because I was so excited for this and it isn't what I was expecting. I may return it.",

I've just began to use voice intelligence, which is very handy when wanting to quickly hear the news, or songs from my favorite artists. I keep it in the kitchen for now, and away from my bedrooms. I don't wish for it to pick-up personal conversations not meant for the ears of others. Again, this has to do with my overarching concern about artificial intelligence.",

      "text": "I ordered 2 Alexas: 1 for my family and 1 for my brother who lives 300 miles away. For the entire first 1.5 years we BOTH had limited capabilities because for some reason Amazon linked them so if I played music 300 miles away in my home, he would go to Alexa to ask something and Alexa would say sorry, can't do that. It was weird so finally I went on online and found directions to delink them. But then his would not work AT ALL! So frustrating! Why can't you buy an Alexa for a friend? There is no 800 # to call so his Alexa just sits there not being used. We don't know what to do?",

      "text": "My original gen 1 was still working but had become tempermental and decided it would not hold the wifi signal anymore-so I traded it in on prime day for this one-I sort of miss the volume ring but over all this model is smaller and works just as well-I think the sound is much improved-it is very responsive-the only thing I really want is an ALEX version-I don't like yelling at a woman especially when alexa cheats on games-it would be nice to have a change and a guys voice-I believe SIRI offers a choice now-I find it hard to NOT have an Alexa around being used to it now",

      "text": "Alexa and Echo really shine when you have more than one device in your house, you can use it as an intercom, you can have the same or different music playing in every room. If an alarm goes off in one room you can turn it off in another. I haven't had the opportunity to try the phone call feature yet, but I would imagine that is yet another benefit. There are literally hundreds of uses for the Echo I haven't even tried yet, like controlling the lights and thermostats. If you can find them on sale it's a bonus, but it is also well worth the regular retail price.",
