There is also a clip on each side for drawing paper and a place to put chalk/markers and erasers. Overall very pleased and will be purchasing another when my daughter is a little older!",

It's very very easy to wipe down, and I can keep supplies in a container on the tray in the center. The clips on top easily hold paper, if you wanted to paint. I don't use the foam letters, since my son tends to chew on foam, but I didn't buy it for the letters. Best easel I've looked at and I'm really happy I got it.",

We also have Melissa and Doug vehicle magnets that he sticks on the easel. We haven't used the chalkboard side yet nor have I tried writing or drawing on the whiteboard because he isn't too interested in art at the moment. The easel comes with foam magnet stickers, but they seem too thin and flimsy. We have large chunky plastic letters and numbers with magnet backs and it's easier for him to grasp those.",
