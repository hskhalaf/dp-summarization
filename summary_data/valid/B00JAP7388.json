I'm impressed and a little concerned. Research on O3 seems to strongly urge that you remove all living things from the area you're going to operate this thing. They're not kidding, I accidentally got a face full of O3 while the unit was on and my throat has had a bit of a tickle since (30 minutes ago, and it's fading fast, I'll be fine) but wow, this thing really pulls its weight. Use as directed, exercise caution and aim away from face.",

I'm not sure if the odor is trapped in the walls or the furniture. Febreeze and air fresheners have not helped. The room is, at this time, unusable. I returned this machine. DO NOT BUY!",

Once you use it, it leaves behind a certain smell, but that smell would be better described as a complete absence of any scent whatsoever. It turned the air in the room into a clean slate that you could easily turn into whatever sent you wanted. Burn a few sticks of incense after, pop open a Renuzit gel air freshener, and you\u2019ll smell nothing but that for months, this machine worked absolute wonders.",
