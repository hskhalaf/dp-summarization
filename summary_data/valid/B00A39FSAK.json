I believe I am using more water because of it trying to get the job done!

Before installing it, be sure that you have at least 2-inches of space behind the faucet's position and the splash board/wall, to allow the control arm to function freely.

Install was pretty straight forward and simple and video was a big help. Took longer to get out old rusted Moen. Works great hope to get years of use from it.",

My family and I think it's off and it's still running or dripping, and I'm guessing this faucet is now gonna cost me more because it sounds like a defective valve assembly.

I had to pay to install it, so to have to go and uninstall it to get another one is an expense and honestly a hassle. Pretty disappointed.",

I've installed faucets before and it only took me about an hour to remove the old faucet and install this one. However, I basically tossed the instructions in the trash as they are worthless. At least the supply lines are color coded (red for hot, and blue for cold). The faucet itself is fantastic. Operation is smooth and the flow is great. Nozzle stays in place when not in use and the handle operates nice and smooth. It looks great on our sink. The neck also sounds 360\u00b0, allowing you to install with the handle facing in any direction. Very happy.",

Installation was easy. You need a second person to help hold the faucet in place while you tighten from under the sink. Seems to be a well made product. We had issues with our other faucet (American standard) where the faucet wouldn\u2019t retract back all the way. This faucet seems to have a better design on that mechanism.",

I've now found that Delta supposedly will send you the part for free, but what good will that do after you already had it installed? Shame on Delta.",

You can get hot water, or you can get cold water.
