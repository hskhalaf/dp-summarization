The wrench spins up 3 to 4 seconds before it hits the bolt and 2 or 3 hits will tighten the nuts. It is better to do the final calibration with a torque wrench after tightening with this wrench.the pump is good. Labour saving and low noise. I would strongly suggest to read the user\u2019s manual before using this tool set. I feel peace of mind with it for roadside emergencies.",

The impact wrench worked well and the unit is pretty handy for cars and light trucks. The plastic carrying case was badly damaged due to very poor packing. I might have kept this unit for the Rav4 and the nice impact wrench but the load capacity and damage caused me to return it.",

You have to let it run for 1-2 seconds then it catches the bolts then tightens/ loosens them. It comes with LED light so you can use it even in the dark. It has an adaptor so you can connect it directly to the battery. The only thing I didn\u2019t like is that the light doesn\u2019t have an on/off button. As soon you it is plugged to a battery source, the light remains on constantly.",

It's very easy to handle and efficient. It takes only about 30 seconds to lift the vehicle and noise is tolerable especially it's for emergency road-side use. The cable is long enough for most sedans and SUVs. I'll say it's a good choice to have it in the trunk.",
