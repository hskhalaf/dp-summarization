Previously I used the Jaybird X3 but they were not very comfortable for my earshape. These earphones let in plenty of noise from your surroundings so if you were looking for noise isolation. These may not be for you. The battery life is amazing. Plus the little charging pouch is cool. If you are looking for good workout bluetooth earphones. I would strongly recommend these to anybody.",
