The previous case I had made it almost impossible to turn the Digital Crown. This one goes around the whole watch, where the other one snapped on. Turning the Digital Crown is a lot smoother with this one. Any case that works will beef up your watch a little but this one still looks good. The picture I took today after being in use since October. I would highly recommend this product.",

I also want to point out that the color for my iWatch is black, so it is a great fit, if you have another color like rose gold, you may not feel the same",
