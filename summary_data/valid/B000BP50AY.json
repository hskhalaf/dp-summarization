      "text": "Although the plastic cover, strap and ear buds gave out. the mp3 player is still going strong and it is very economical with battery usage. If all you want to do is listen to podcasts and FM radio you cannot do better than this unit. One thing about the FM radio though if you listen while walking along a road you will get static whenever a car passes, it is very sensitive. Inference is not a problen with podcasts though. Since the Sansa supports drag and drop file transfer updating weekly broadcasts is super easy using a computer pod catcher, just delete old, and drop new from podcast folder to sansa.",

On the Amazon.com website it indicated that the SanDisk Sansa M240 comes with case, armband, earphones, 1 AAA battery, CD and user guide. Least to say the user guide, CD and battery were missing. However, Amazon customer service was very prompt in responding to my query. Unfortunately, the player is being used outside of the US, so when my computer failed to recognise it I had to employ a computer expert in my own country to reconfigure the player. Thankfully it now works. Amazon should ensure that what they have stated on the website is what the customer actually gets.",

It is very easy to learn to use and offers excellent sound quality for the money, especially if you want a simple and basic player for everyday use. My only tip for improvement would be that if you want to use the player while exercising, the armband and case that come with it are not adequate (a flimsy clear vinyl pouch with a snap and an armband that chafed pretty badly); spring for the silicone case which has a sturdy clip that you can attach to your shorts or water carrier. Otherwise very pleased!",

I use it almost exclusively while running so I did not want to spend a lot in case I damaged it. It has held up very well with pretty heavy usage. It comes with a clear protective plastic case and an armband that fits comfortably. I'm not worried when I press the buttons with sweaty fingers. I've dropped it a few times and it's fine. Also, it's half the price and has much more features than the $89 dollar ipod. I definitely recommend this SanDisk Sansa.",

I have 2 5 plus hour books on it now and about 30 mp3s/wmas and it is less than a third full. It is pretty tough too.

I tested the \"delete\" function and this was easily done as well, either from the player itself or from the screen, deleting is NOT cumbersome. I also tested the radio and it seems to grasp the stations well also. So far, no problems. I love this product and I think I will buy some more as a gift to others!",

It utilizes either drag and drop, or Windows Media Player to get songs from the computer. My 9 and 11 year old kids find it easy to use, and I find the quality to be great.

I have had no problems at all and it is so easy to simply replace the AAA battery. Recommend this highly as a really good value.",

The buttons are easy to use and the menu system is fairly easy as well. The backlight doesn't stay on as long as I would like, but it isn't a show stopper. A really good player and a good price.",

Uses AAA battery, verses the ipod which charges when attached to your computer. What a pain it must be to have to charge the ipod by attaching it to the computer. Trust me a AAA battery is much easier, considering I usually put a bunch of songs on and then leave it in my purse, car, etc.",

Thus far the item has worked just fine. I loaded it up with the music she wanted (in mp3 format) and off she went with a smile on her face.
