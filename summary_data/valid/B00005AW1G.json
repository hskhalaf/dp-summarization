If you're into burning audio mix CDs Toast with Jam might be better for you. Has limited support for VCD. No support for SVCD, or VCD/SVCD menu authoring. No support for real DVD authoring. Bootable CD feature never works. No provision to print CD labels. The latest revision supports CDtext. With CDtext you'll finally be able to utilize a feature of many Sony players that most never knew existed. Latest revision supports a bit to bit copy mode. Without competition this software will never be cutting edge. Nero (MS only) is a much better choice.",

But witha little work, it was easy enough to update, and now everything works pretty much as advertised. It makes the superdrive more accesible than it would be otherwise, and enhances the value of my computer by more than the purchase price of the software. A good purchase for anyone who wants to get more out of the superdrive.",

This is especially great in education, where I use Mac, but three fourths of my students use Windows based platforms. We can do multi-media projects and they are accesible to almost anyone. I was worried that the Apple 'disc burner' software would put Toast out of business, but for anything but the most basic burn, Toast is still the best.",

You can master DVD's, VCD's, Hybrid PC-Mac discs, HFS+ hybrid, audio cd's, MP3 cd's, CD-i, ISO 9660, multi-track CD-ROM XA, device copy, disk images, enhanced music CD, mac os extended, the list goes on. Converts iMovies into VCDs to watch on your DVD player. Allow's the creation of disk images for those with only a burner that wish to duplicate disks. It allows amazing cross-platform compatibilty. Overall the greatest burning software ever made.",

It is a minor quibble 95% of users may not care about - but I do! So I hope roxio reads this!",

Neither of these are acceptable without some diagnostic information.",

    "title": "Roxio Toast 5 Titanium [OLD VERSION]",
    "description": "Complete CD Burning Software package for McIntosh, incl instruction manuals, CD with software bundle. connection cable.and more.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe days of the simple CD-burning utility are seemingly over, and in the case of Roxio's Toast 5 Titanium, it's a good thing. Lately we've been seeing CD-burning software that attempts to do everything but clean the kitchen sink, with varying levels of success. In the case of Toast 5, the proverbial sink is spotless. Plenty of useful features like CD labeling, audio extraction, and data storage provide meat-and-potatoes satiation. The ability to remove hiss and crackle from old LPs, and Toast's new OS X-influenced interface, is like the cherry on top of the dessert. And, of course, the bread-and-butter feature is Toast's delicious burning options.\n\n Roxio has kept the functionality of its drag-and-drop window intact from the previous version, only now the design is reminiscent of a funky '50s diner jukebox. The window is resizable, with simple buttons specifying the type of CD you wish to burn. Click audio, data, copy, or other, and the button turns blue. Pop a blank CD-R into your drive, drag your files into the window, hit that big red glowing record button in the corner, and you're cooking. Toast 5 continues to support all major CD formats (like the previous version), and additional formats including MP3, Mac/ISO hybrid, and VideoCD (playable on many DVD players). If that was all there is to this package, we'd be done right here, satisfied, and ready for a nap.\n\n But, as we've mentioned, Roxio has loaded plenty of goodies onto the Toast 5 CD-ROM, some of them frivolous and fattening, (isn't that what goodies are for?) some of them extremely useful sides. We particularly like iView Multimedia, which lets you catalog all your images, building a thumbnail library for easy organization and retrieval. Also cool is CD Spin Doctor. Although we love our vinyl here at Amazon.com, we've yet to see a device that will play records in the car. CD Spin Doctor is a simple application that will digitize and create a waveform of your old LPs and cassettes, then let you add simple filters to improve the audio. Remove hiss, clicks, and pops, and then burn the result to audio CD.\n\n There's plenty more on the table. Magic Mouse Discus is a basic labeling kit for your CDs. Or you can export included templates to Freehand 9, AppleWorks, or Quark for more complex graphic design for your labels. New in Toast 5 is the useful background burning capability, allowing you to work in other applications while Toast is cooking up your discs. Make sure you have plenty of RAM for this function. You even get folders filled with excellent digital photographs and free music from popular groups and musicians.\n\n We could go on listing savory features, yet will contain ourselves and simply admonish the Macintosh users among you: There's no reason not to buy Toast 5 Titanium. It's a well-balanced, nutritious software program that will slake your ravenous hunger. --John Bosch",
