Cons: Shooting from certain angles will get the gimbal into your shot, so be aware of that. If you use any lenses, this gimbal won\u2019t incorporate the weight to balance it, so you\u2019ll have to make or buy your own counterweight (I used washers). 9/14/2018 Update: I do not recommend the DJI app for filming. However, I highly recommend purchasing the app FilmicPro (well worth $14). Makes footage stunning.",

      "text": "People complain about the plastic as compared to the prior aluminum product. I didn't not have version 1, but at $125 this thing is a deal. The plastic is very heavy and the unit feels very professional. The software is first rate and allows for some pretty awesome shots. Don't panic when the thing take 24 hours to charge upon first charge. Hook it up to a power source, not a computer to charge via USB, hopefully this will charge faster than mine did. Apparently this thing runs forever on one charge. After you have one you will not doubt it. A great addition to my kit",

The only issues that I have encountered are the dimensions, which make it not so portable, the system to attach the smartphone is not that comfortable to attach/disattach, so you end up keeping it attached for the most of time. The built-in USB port to charge your device could be a smart feature but sometimes it's impossible to attach the charging cable to the smartphone. Otherwise it's a very good product and for around 100$ I can definitely recommend it.",
