I'm an ipsy member so I'm able to try all kinds of high end products before buying them....which is really helpful. I am SO glad that I got this in my bag & was able to try it. I've got huge pores & problem skin & this minimizes my pores & imperfections,plus evens out my skin. Thank you for making a product that actually works the way it says it will :)",
