But they fail after a few years because of lack of design quality; they are not built to last. These ones are not quite as comfortable, but they are still pretty comfortable. Their design quality, however, is top notch. I feel like these will last 20 years. And the sound quality is better than the Panasonic clip on ear phones as well. These are overall my new favorite headphones.",

I would never try to sleep with these on for fear of rolling on top of them.",

This set seems to me to be a cheap version of its predicessor, but it costs more.",

Somewhat heavy on the ear. I will stick with the earbuds that came with mp3 player since they sound much better than the Sonys do. Very dissapointed.",

The problem is that the extention cord has a very loose connection with the main cord. You have to be immobile all the time, to the point of holding your breath not to disconnect the cords. Good luck with the item. I could not return it, b/c the sellers stocking fee was high, and he included part of the price in shipping.",
