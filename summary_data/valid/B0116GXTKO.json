Now I am left to shop for another one before my company arrives. It does NOT look like the picture they show.",

It also appears that it will launder well. I heartily recommend this product!",

I really can't be bothered to take it off since my mattress weighs a ton so I am keeping it until I find a better quality and more structured material.",
