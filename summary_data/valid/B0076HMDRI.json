I thought I'd tell about our work around to the USB connection failing. 2 other purchases made the tablet work again in wireless mode. 1) Anker Charger  2) Wacom wireless kit  Since the USB is completely broken, the battery cannot be charged by connecting to USB port. But the Anker charger works to recharge the battery. So we spent 50$ rather than another 350 for a new tablet. I wish Wacom would make these with sturdier components.",

In less than 3 months it has worn down from it's \"Paper like\" surface to a glassy smooth in the center of the pad, This produces an inconsistent surface texture that is difficult to work with. I warranty replaced it once but the new one did the same thing. After 5 years my Graphire never wore out like this and it has a replaceable surface. The Intous doesn't have a replacable surface and wears out in a few months. Very disappointed.",

It's like drawing / sketching on a piece of paper. It offers so much versatility too. It did take me a couple of days to get used to it. The pen was sensitive and it felt different than holding a pencil. But once I got used to it, it made my work so much easier and faster. Best purchase I could have ever made as an illustrator.",

The company I purchased it from was responsive and all my 'problems' were solved within two days. While not used to tablets yet, this proves to be a major improvement when using graphic software. Do use the free software, especially the freehand painter as it is great tool to experimentation and training. Doing so with other more sophisticated program like GIMP is frustrating especially if you are not pro efficient with them. Note: You may want to spring for the wireless adapter to avoid one more wire... Changing the stylus tips is an interesting experience that involves using pliers!!! Just weird.",

The one down side is there are no cloning of presets from application to application; every new application starts with the 'all others' presets, which can get annoying if you're all others preset is designed for basic desktop usage like mine is. Other than that, though, I highly recommend this to all imaging professionals, one of their best designs yet.",

There is a noticeable difference in the fidelity of the drawings and the reduced strain on my hand after marathon scribble sessions. The only drawback is that I had to totally re-arrange my desk to accommodate this behemoth (srsly, it is way bigger than it looks)",

The touch ring is a nice addition and the buttons not having any opening where liquids could accidentally be spilt is also nice. The touch surface for multigesture is cool, and is easily able to be disabled which is nice. Overall I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in a good quality product with lots of functionality. Even with it being refurbished it works good as new. I personally prefer refurbished over new because of the inspection done and the lower price!",

I have already put hours of use on it in a short time and the lines I am making now are crisper and more responsive then the bamboo. I should have upgraded to this tablet a long time ago. It said the package was going to be delivered on Friday and I got it 3 days earlier then that which was quite a nice surprise. I highly recommend this tablet to any artists who are working in digital mediums.",
