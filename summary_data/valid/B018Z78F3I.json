When I received it, it was everything that was expected except that water got into the watch 2 months afterwards and it stopped working which led me to believe that probably it was opened up some time before!! This buy was truly disappointing. I will never buy a product that is not new again!! I contacted the seller who first told me to change the battery and then advised to send it back but when I informed them that I was out of the country and could only return it when I got back I received no more feedback from the seller!!!",

It becomes hard to read. Although it is cool and high tech looking, it is uncomfortable and I can not get accustomed to wearing it. The 1st time I had the battery replaced, I lost the illumination feature. I believe it is more suited to a younger person.",

Also, the strap was dark black when I got it. But after a few hours in saltwater, the black became very faded. It's not a bad watch, but I would look at other options.",

I like the way it looks and feels on my wrist, and the numbers are easily readable. I wore the watch occasionally then the light stopped working. That is a big pet peeve of mine. After a year with only occasional use, the light died. Im glad i didnt wear it too much or I really would have been disappointed. The band also started to unglue around the face of the watch about 1 week after I bought it. I will never stray from g shocks again.",
