I also love that they color-coordinated the corner straps with the bottom tarp as well as the base of the poles - the larger side of the tent where the poles with the 'kink' go is black, and the smaller side orange. It makes set-up really easy! I also really like the additional corner pockets inside to hold my phone, keys, etc. and they do have a net that hangs from the top, but unfortunately this could use some improvement as my phone and any items I would place up there continue to fall out.",

Tent was dry, dry, dry, No stretch either, so never had to readjust the guy lines. pockets in each of 4 corners were handy for holding glasses, kindle, flashlight, etc. Excellent ventilation, but probably too much for use in cold weather. Tent is a tad heavy, but worth the few extra ounces in my opinion. Three person tent was plenty big for two, 200+ lb. men. Looked at several of the more usual name brands, and decided on this one for features and lower price. Was well-rewarded! Good job ALPS.",

This tent is the easiest I've ever assembled and I did it solo. The tags on the corners (where you put in poles) are color-coded for each part, including the footprint! Great attention to detail.",
