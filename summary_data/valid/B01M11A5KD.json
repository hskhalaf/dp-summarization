      "text": "After knocking over and shattering the last of the stemmed wine glasses due to the usual clumsiness (and probably not helped by having drunk the wine in the glasses), we decided to try a different style. These are of a nice shape and size, hold about 15 ounces which means you can pour a decent portion of wine and not have to worry about it spilling off the top. Yeah, for cold wine, you don't get to hold the stem and not warm the contents; not a serious concern here - much of the wine we drink probably benefits from an ice cube in it. No problems at all with the order - glasses arrived on time and packed well.",

Mine were thicker at the lip than I prefer, and are almost uncomfortably wide at the base, making them hard to hold (and I'm an average-sized man). However, that also makes them less prone to tipping, a plus. At the price point they're being sold for, I wouldn't have expected much, and didn't get it. Overall, maybe a solid B-minus. These will probably become my patio/outdoor/picnic glasses and will work well for that purpose. But if you're looking for higher quality non-stemware :) look at something a little pricier.",

Honestly, based on the overall quality, the wobbly one was probably a fluke. I would definitely purchase from this company again. In general these glasses are nice. Not too thin, good size, good price. My only issue is that one glass is not flat on the bottom. A flat bottom is kind of an important feature in a glass. Three stars because of the unusable glass.",

I was looking for a solution that would both allow me to have my water or wine untouched by their curious noses, and keep them from being able to push the glasses around. These little glasses are perfect! They're sturdy, hold more liquid than they look like they would, and the tapered top keeps prying kitty faces out. Awesome purchase!",

It was a very peculiar break -- a rim (about an inch long) split from the rest of the glass. I thought these glasses were not strong enough for a dishwasher normal wash cycle, so I switched to hand washing them. Strangely enough, two more glasses developed similar cracks (not during the actual washing) while they were left to dry. I bought these based on the glorious reviews. But it is safe to say that I have never seen worse quality glasses. Hence the low rating!",

      "text": "3 of the 4 glasses wobble when set down. 1 doesn't, but it feels like I've spent quite a bit of money for a single wine glass that isn't fine chrystal, just a very heavy glass. There's some kind of adage about buying cheap and having to buy twice, something like that. In any case, I'll just not try to go cheap and I'll get some higher quality wineglasses. I'd never use these to serve to friends. Maybe I'll just buy some Bettas and use them as tiny aquariums?",
