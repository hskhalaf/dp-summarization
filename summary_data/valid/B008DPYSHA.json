Most of my sanding has been on exotic hard woods (zebrawood, bubinga, purple heart, etc.). The dust can be an issue since it pushes back up through the face plate if you do not have a vacuum connected (I have not used a vacuum), but it has not affected the use of the product. I have not had any issues with excessive heat. The spindle seems to run straight and true.",
