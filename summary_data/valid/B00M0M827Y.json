Very good option for a non-techie friend or relative, or someone who just uses online services. Great performance and 5-6 second boot-up time. Presumably there's a fan inside, but I've never heard it, even when playing HD video. Good selection of ports too. The biggest criticism I can lay against it is that I don't like the power button.",
