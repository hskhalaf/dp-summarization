      "text": "I purchased a Westinghouse 7871400 Contrempra fan. As all too usual Westinghouse shoves the candalebra light kit down your throat. OK, fine, I'll pony up for a light kit that supports a15/a19 bulbs. But, NO. Westinghouse's 3-LED light kit is 100% NOT compatible in any way with the Westinghouse fan. No warning of course. No, you can't tell from the picture because they cleverly hide the 2-screw system that will not fit into the 3-screw fan housing. Even if you get past that the light kit is precisely machined NOT to fit in the ceiling fan light kit housing. Fah. I hate you.",

      "text": "We bought a house with 12 ceiling fans! Most of them brushed brass, which we\u2019ll live with for the time being. Only one was lacking a light kit and they are hard to find in this finish. I laughed, but gave ease of installation 5 stars. Installation should have been very straightforward, but we ended up having to take the entire fan down because there was no power to the wiring for the light kit. This was not the fault of the light kit, but recommend anyone adding a light, rather than replacing, check for power so you don\u2019t have to do everything two or three times like we did.",

It uses a short threaded tube to connect it and run the wiring through to your existing cap",
