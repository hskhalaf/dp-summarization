      "text": "In the west, we can only get 91 octane gas. I wanted my car tuned for 93 octane fuel, so I add a full bottle for each fill-up and after our tune, this has worked really well. Each bottle is good for 30 points, which means +3 on the octane of the base fuel. When we dynoed the vehicle people were amazed at the power and torque we were getting from the improved coils, spark plugs, headers, and the tune optimizing these changes, along with dialing the engine in for 93 octane fuel. This is cost and power effective!",
