I use it with the factory default setting: 1hr on,, 3hrs off; direction: cw then ccw. My winder has been in use for six days, so far it is perfect. I highly recommend this product.",

Receiving a broken item is understandable but, it is not acceptable that no one responded. The item works but, with the broken door you have to be very careful ( nice item if it had been received in full)",
