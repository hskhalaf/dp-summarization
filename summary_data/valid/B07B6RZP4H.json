There are 7 house flies in it right now! I\u2019m so far pretty satisfied. Will leave it on overnight and see what else we get!",

You can use the unit without the glue board but I find that those tiny gnats don't seem to get caught as well without the glue trap at the bottom. I'm very disappointed as I could have sworn the glue traps were half the current price when I bought the unit just a few weeks ago! So 4 stars for working well and having good customer service... but minus one star for being pretty noisy on the high setting and cost of the replacement glue traps after initial purchase.",

Dust inevitably gets sucked in, and many of the parts are inaccessible and the design elements are so tightly spaced that you can't really clean it.

      "text": "My wife was getting attacked by a few indoor mosquitoes over the last few nights and was having a fairly bad reaction, so I needed to find something to eliminate the problem quickly. I was a little skeptical, but willing to try. So far, am happy with the results catching mosquitoes and gnats. There is some fan noise, but quiet enough to not be too disruptive at night. I did have an issue with a missing power adapter, but the Customer Support response was prompt, courteous the worked quickly to resolve the issue to my full satisfaction.",

The only caveat I could possibly add is that the cable connecting it to power is relatively short, but this isn\u2019t a problem at all in my specific case since it would have been positioned next to an outlet regardless of the cord length.",

It may not eliminate the problem immediately, but within a very short time numerous bugs became occasional bugs and we are now down to rarely seeing them at all. We do, however see dozens of their little corpses on the glue trap, which we replace regularly. Thank you, Katchy!",
