The plastic snap to hold the wrap around to close it is cheap and it pops open on its own at times. And when you open it be ready because it\u2019s like boom, ready! It startled me it was so powerful. I did give it 5 stars because the umbrella itself seems pretty solid. Plus it\u2019s just a fun way to make you smile when it\u2019s raining out. I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on it. It\u2019s very whimsical and I\u2019m certain I\u2019ll enjoy it for a long time.",
