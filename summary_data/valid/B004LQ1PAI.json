Thankfully he made a barrier of pillows and toys and just sleeps on the side closest to the wall. 2- the ladder steps make no sense. The last step is unnecessary 3- going off the ladder steps. There is nothing to help grip while your going down the ladder. Were going to buy step tape to put on it. To help with it some. Other than those this bed is great.",

The parts are all packaged well, they even include extra hardware and label them as extra so you don't panic about having leftovers. It was much easier than I thought, one person cannot it together easily, but it goes faster with two people. my husband came home halfway through bed 2 and helped with the slat bars and plastic spacers. They are a perfect height for elementary school aged kids. My daughter has turned her bed into a \"house\" for her baby dolls.",

The bed was pretty easy to set up; it only took her and my son an hour or a little more. I would recommend getting a ratcheting hex driver of some kind over the Allen wrench that they provide, it will just make the process a little nicer and quicker. The ladder rungs are round and a little small; I wish these were flat or at least flat on the tops and a little wider but they work okay.",

From other reviews: the ladder is a little tough on feet, but she does not linger on it so I have not needed to add pool noodle sections. My only complaint is the large safety sticker on the head of the bed, but I guess lawyers are going to lawyer. Overall an excellent value.",

Highly recommend 2 people to put it together. Not sure how I would do it alone. Its a great height for my 5yr old, he loves it! Only thing he complained about was the ladder bars hurt his feet. We plan to put some type of softness to help that. Its a huge space saver in our small apartment and has made more room than I thought!",
