Love the small foot-print (doesn't take up very much room) Easy to use, with a comprehensive (easy to understand) user's guide. I just wish it would clean the heads automatically like my husband's printer does (his is always ready to to the job, regardless how much time passes in-between uses). If you need a printer at least a few times a week (not heavy duty office use), I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit. Just didn't work out for my occassional need to print out a page or two a month.",

Lately it has been non-functional since I keep getting the message that the carriage can't move and that I should clear the obstruction. Of course there is no obstruction. The ink gauge is inaccurate but I have gotten use to it. I can get weeks or months of printing done after the low ink message comes on. The fax is temperamental at best. I guess I should be happy that it lasted 2 years. I am looking for a replacement .",

I was unable to find this printer/fax at any local stores. My last one was from Coscto, for $130. So, I was amazed at the omline price of 89.99 with no tax and no shipping, delivered to my door.

I contacted Amazon Customer Service and they sent a replacement machine in under 24 hours. (Have to love that about Amazon) That machine had the same problem and was also sent back. I went to Office Depot and bought a Brother Super G3. It works great and my faxes are no longer a mystery. So much for cheap fax machines",
