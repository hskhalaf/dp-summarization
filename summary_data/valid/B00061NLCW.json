I no longer use it, but I bought it to look like a very official substitute teacher, since I was only 21 and trying to make some extra cash on my days where I didn't have class. Was it overkill.. maybe it was.. but it was still fun to carry around and stored my laptop, day planner and books. The locks came in handy too since kids like to snoop through things. Yes, I really did buy this. My review can be taken lightly, but also very seriously when I say it is a great buy for the price!",

The latches are cast from cheap pot-metal and despite me being a person who cares for his belongings, the latches broke within one week of showing cracks. I suppose if I were to amortize the cost of the case over 13-months it wasn't a 'horrible' investment. I just sucks that I must now find a replacement in short order. So... buyer be advised that the latches will require great care.",

He doesn't take it back and forth to work or anything so I can't speak to how durable it is in that aspect-however for how he uses it it works very well. I like the combination lock and the many multiple inner pouches/pockets.",

We have looked for a replacement in local office supply stores but did not find a attache that was wide enough for his files. He wanted hard sides and needed it to expand. This new briefcase is not as expandable as his last so he carries his old camera separately. Other than that, this works perfectly for a smaller camera and several files. Very good value and looks professional too.",

Heavy thermos (which fits perfectly as if made for the case) is no problem. The 5 star rating stands.",
