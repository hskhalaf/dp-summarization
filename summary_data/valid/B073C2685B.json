Lice are difficult to completely eliminate and you must use both comb devices AND do the second application 10 days later in order to fully rid you or your family's head of those little buggers. This stuff worked and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again if there is another exposure to me or anyone in my family.",

It\u2019s the full kit- everything you need - although the comb ripped my kiddos hair out so we mainly used the comb on the applicator, which worked great. The product didn\u2019t seem toxic, it had a mild scent and altogether it took a few washes, it left the hair clean and lice free.",

So getting lice is more common than you think. I initially used Nix and another name brand lice removal kit. I had to use another box and struggle with removing the lice for weeks and weeks. With Lice Clinics of America products, I used ONE box and the lice was gone! Buy this product, you will not be sorry! Pro Tip: Follow the instructions and skip any steps. I took my time and was successful in removing all of the lice with one box and one treatment.",
