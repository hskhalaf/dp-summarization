Some of the predrilled holes were a little rough and had to be cleaned out but the sight is of good quality and the fiber pins are as bright as can be. Definitely recommend!",

My complaints, however, are that it arrived loosely packed in a thin piece of bubble wrap in a larger box with one other item. It came with NO documentation or instructions. Rather lackluster for Amazon's usual high standards. After about ten arrow shots, it started to come a bit loose from the riser (PSE Nighthawk) so I applied some thread locker and reinstalled it. Hopefully that will work.",

I just wanted to make the bow so I could shoot it, so I ordered this sight along with an inexpensive arrow rest. Then I went to the Scheels in our area and had them put on a peep sight. Now for about $30.00 total cost for all 3, I have a bow that actually shoots quite well. I had to fine tune the sight and arrow rest, but it was not hard at all. The included allen wrenches helped tremendously, now I just keep them in my bow case to have handy.",

Adjusting the sight was a bit tricky, but once you get it aligned, it stays put. Overall, this is a good value for the money.",

But this isn't a top of the line sight and it's not priced like one. It worked well for my needs. Easy adjustment and hit right on target.

There is not second or third axis adjustment of course. The white ring is glow-in-the-dark, which was a pleasantly surprising feature. I ordered a second one as backup after I mounted the first.

      "text": "For the price, it's well built and very stable on my Sage Samick recurve bow. The sight pins are a little tedious to adjust, but once you tighten them, you shouldn't have a problem. It looks great, too- seems to be built from quality steel, and the sight pins are nice and bright. Allows for a wide range of adjustments. If you want decent sights at a bargain, look no further.",
