But the packaging was great, bit messy with the styrofoam but secure. Putting it together was easy. Only issue was securing the plastic screw covers. Very impressed with the textured finish. Was not expecting that. It looks an feels like real wood but is MDF. Love the weathered color, the size is very good for my needs. Overall this has been a really great purchase. I am so glad I did not get a cheaper corner shelf. I think this one is the worth the money.",

Each of the square boards when attached to the quarter circle shelve were not flush at the edge, often with almost a 1/16\" difference in hole distance to edge for the same board! This may seem like a petty variance to be upset about, but when you consider that each board is off, and the shelve is 48.5\" long it adds up. Specifically, to the tune of 1/2\" at the bottom perpendicular mount location. I hope this saves some one else the installation pain that I just went through.",

It looks great on the wall and we are attaching a clip on light for reading by his bed. Fits the nook we had very nicely. We didn't even use the assembly directions. Come with all the necessary hardware and an allen wrench. We used a cordless drill and it was effortless. Would definitely buy again if we need another one.",

It definitely isn't big enough to use for a lot of storage, just trinkets, candles, small picture frames etc.",

The only thing that I did not like about it, is its assembly with screws that are not fine at all. But they will be covered by the small round plastic pieces provided. Overall I recommend buying this shelf.",
