We\u2019ve had this one for about a month now and we are still amazed at how quiet it is compared to our old whirlpool that it replaced. Anyway, there\u2019s not much more to say about a microwave. It\u2019s got way more functions than we will ever use and it seems to be a good value as compared to the rest of the stainless built in microwaves out there.",
