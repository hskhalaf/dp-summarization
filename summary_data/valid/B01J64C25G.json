I really needed it because I wasn\u2019t used to the weight and size of the new phone and my hand was starting to cramp up (and I dropped my phone on my face a few times lol). This doesn\u2019t just save me from dropping and breaking my phone, it makes it feel lighter, and the additional support allows me to use the phone with one hand and reach the other side of my keyboard. PLUS I got the pop socket holder and use it in my car. Love this product. It solves a problem and makes my life easier.",

So, I am back to using the one that doesn't really match the case but works. And, I am returning this one. The adhesive on the back feels totally different than the other one I have, which is probably why it does not work.",

    "description": "A PopSockets grip is more than a stylish phone accessory. It\u2019s an opposable thumb for your phone. It lets you take selfies like a pro and share with your circle of fans, friends or embarrassing family members. It lets you text things you may or may not later regret with the greatest of ease. It lets you stand your phone up on an airplane tray table to watch a movie. When you\u2019re done, it collapses flat like your bangs in a rainstorm. PopSockets grips are repositionable and stick to most devices and cases but may not stick to silicone or waterproof materials. The product includes a special 3M adhesive disc for attaching your grip directly to a glass-backed phone. You may also buy a separate \u201cmount\u201d to attach your phone to your dashboard, mirror, refrigerator, air conditioning vent or wherever you snack on content. Mmm\u2026content. And now, a little something for all you specification geeks: Diameter: 1.56 inches, Height: .9 inches when expanded, .25 inches when collapsed.",
