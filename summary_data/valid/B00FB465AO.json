I get 10 times the coverage we did prior. In terms of quality and signal strength, this has beat out several other name brands we have tried. This is being used in a large industrial shop and due to the construction of the building (concrete, steel) and the large machines we have, signal strength even directly underneath the router was a problem.",

We are running both our internal network and a guest network on it. Seems to work well and no one has complained of dropped connections or an inability to connect. I'm not sure the upgrade was significant over the Amped AP20000G, but it's way better coverage than the Netgear WNDAP350 access points we were using before.",
