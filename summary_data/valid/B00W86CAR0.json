This looks great on my kitchen counter and holds enough so we are running back and forth to the compost. The only improvement I would like to see made, is an easy way of putting in the charcoal filters. We haven't had to change them yet, but I have read the other reviews and the questions about the product and it seems a little weird. I am sure I will figure it out!!",
