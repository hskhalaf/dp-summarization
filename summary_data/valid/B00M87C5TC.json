After Teflon tape and pipe joint compound was heavily applied we finally had no leakage. Another month passed before we could open. Both sinks in two locations are dropping out on the hot sides. Hot water starts then shuts off on its own or goes into a death rattle. The plumber came back again. He got them to work properly for about two hours before they started acting up again. Now too much time has passed to return them.",
