      "text": "I've bought several Mason Cash mixing bowls from this seller and I can't be more pleased with the swift shipment and the quality of these Mason Cash bowls. This bowl was well packaged to ensure it arrived safely, just like the others that I have purchased from this seller. This particular bowl will be just right for a nice big batch of cookies without worry of spilling over or getting flour all over the counter. I'm so happy to have this pretty and functional bowl! Thank you, Gourmet Kitchen! I gladly give you five out of five stars, and will be on the lookout for other products that you have to sell! Great job!",

I bought this to use primarily for baking (mixing batter, proofing dough) but the gorgeous color and glaze make it great for serving as well . It is surprisingly lightweight, though feels sturdy when you handle it, as some ceramic bowls do. I love this bowl.",
