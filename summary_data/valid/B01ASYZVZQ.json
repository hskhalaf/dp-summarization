I bought a Bona floor care system for it, but the Bona mop won't go all the way under my furniture, so I bought this Bissell duster for those hard to reach places and it does a fine job. It folds easily and ergonomically to dust under any furniture with a clearance of I'd say an inch and a half or two inches. I take it outside and shake it out after I use it, and when it gets really dirty I'll throw it in the washer. I'm very pleased with it so far.",

There is no means of locking the desired angle and therefore, the mop flails about with no control and/or drops to the 90 degree position, still unable to control the mop! I do like the fact that it is very lightweight; but other than that, it is no better than any other dust mop for less money and the \"jointed handle\" is useless.. This is a poor investment for me personally.",
