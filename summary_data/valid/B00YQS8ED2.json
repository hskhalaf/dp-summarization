Within 20 minutes of drinking a serving you begin to feel increased stamina in your muscles. I have FSH Muscular Dystrophy. While there isn't a cure, this has been the only product I can say has given a positive result. - curbs appetite - increases muscle stamina - increases mental clarity - natural burst of energy The only problem, the Amazon photo description of the product is incorrect This product doesn't have the organic mushroom as part of the formula.",

I stopped the smoothies and my hands are better. :( I am sad because it was so good!",

The perforated line proved useless, and the label ended up torn to pieces (the seal is continuous with the label). Also, I had to use a knife to cut the lid seal off, as it was so firmly stuck on. This was so very frustrating, and I now have a damaged label with unclear instructions.",

      "text": "These are a great find. I have tried other greens drinks and they tasted horrible. However, this greens drink is the opposite. The flavor tastes like berries and they offer 50 organic super foods. It's a pretty good price also, for the amount of servings (20) and they provide tons of antioxidants. I have been buying these for a couple months now, and until I find something better, I am sticking with these :)",

Although I really do like the product in terms of ingredients, mixability, and flavor, it is advertised as having 20 servings; which it does not. Using the included scoop, I am on serving #9 and there are only around 6 scoops left in the container. This represents a 25% discrepancy. Keep in mind, these are level scoops, not heaping. So, while I do like the product, the servings are advertised incorrectly, the included scoop is larger than intended, or maybe I just got a fluke batch. Maybe you will be luckier than I did.",
