      "text": "This is perhaps the best mop for general purposes. Some drawbacks prevent it from perfection for heavier cleaning tasks. I love the telescoping handle but it was tricky to extend the first time. Use pliers at the end of the mop by the mop head. I love the microfiber head and though I still have to try the wash in washing machine aspect, I like how it cleans. One caveat: it does have the potential to scratch. As I mop it does appear that it could because often the straps of microfiber don't stay well under the mop head and the plastic scrapes against the floor. That is my biggest complaint so far.",
