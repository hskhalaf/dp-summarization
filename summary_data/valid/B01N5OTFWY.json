It could use a small carburetor adjustment which is no big deal. I like it and it was a good price. I like the fact that it is a Poulan which is made by Husqvarna.",

I have always stored it per the instructions and used the proper fuel mixture. As far as I'm concerned, to only get two seasons of home use out of a trimmer is ridiculous. Never buy a poulan weed eater.",

Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. I ran through 2 tanks of gas last night so we'll see how well it holds up throughout the season. It was heavier than I thought it would be but I suppose that's a nice trade off considering it's more powerful than I thought it would be too.",

But got old quick and trimming with the Poulan Weedeater is so much better. As long as I don't cut down any of my girlfriend's flowers. Lol.",
