I ran the included installer and then full WD diagnostics before I put the drive to work. Drive stopped working after less than 10 hours of backup use and will no longer mount (or dismount) on any of my systems (WIN7, WIN10, MACOS). WD software cannot 'fix' or mount the drive meaning I can no longer use it...and it now makes that annoying clicking noise reported by others. I have used WD drives, both internal and external, for 20+ years without incident or failure. This one is a disappointment and is rated accordingly.",
