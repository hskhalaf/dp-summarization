I can\u2019t speak for older scars since the pigmentation runs deep and UV damage builds more on top of that over the years BUT for those suffering from fresh acne pigmentation, I recommend putting it on twice daily after the blemish has gone down and is in its healing stage. It facilitates complete recovery and no redness or scarring left behind.",
