There is no way to pour the liquid out without it dribbling over the sides, underneath the juicer, and on the counter! How could this major design flaw have been overlooked!! The main feature of this reamer is its pour spout so they should make sure that it can actually pour first and then sell it on Amazon. Buy this if you want 1/2 of your fresh squeezed juice on your counter!",

    "title": "HIC Citrus Juicer Reamer with Handle and Pour Spout, Heavyweight Glass",
    "description": "HIC\u2019s Glass Citrus Juicer efficiently juices fresh oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and other citrus fruits. Enjoy the delicious flavor of juicing fresh citrus fruits in just seconds. A must-have of kitchen tools and bar accessories, this classic hand juicer is perfect for fresh-squeezed orange juice, making healthy foods and smoothie recipes, mixing marinades, preparing and flavoring everyday gourmet dishes, and creating tasty mixed drinks, from to a refreshing Arnold Palmer tea to margaritas and craft cocktails. Using a manual juicer is easier and more economical than a juicer machine or blender. And, it stores away without using up a lot of space. Easy to use, simply cut citrus in half, place it onto the pointed reamer, cut-side down, and twist back and forth with a firm pressure. The extracted fruit juice will collect in the reservoir. Pour juice directly where it\u2019s needed using the easy-grip handle and pour spout. Made from heavyweight glass to resist damage caused by the citric acid found naturally in citrus fruit. Cleanup is a breeze. Hand wash in warm, soapy water.",
