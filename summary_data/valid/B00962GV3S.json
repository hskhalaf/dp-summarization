Color of the band accentuates the watch very nicely. I've received several compliments, and been asked where I got the band. It's a very nice timepiece.

This is more of a casual, wear anywhere watch that still looks nice but could be worn hiking or camping. Looks like great value for the $$ if the reliability is there.",

So I'm getting use to the weight right now, and looking forward to seeing how it holds up through summer activities.",

It would be nice if yall made sure products were in good working condition before they are sent out.",

I am surprised at its original retail price (about $450) but found it easier to swallow at the Amazon sale price (during 50%off sale) of $45..no complaints. Time will tell how it holds up, but so far -so good after a month or so.",
