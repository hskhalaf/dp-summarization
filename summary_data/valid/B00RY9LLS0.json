The chair only got moderate use for 5 months before multiple bolts started to get loose and needed to be tightened again. Additionally, many of the wood pieces started to become loose as well so I had to glue them back in. And most recently I noticed that a bunch of the wood pieces was cracked my wife is on the petite side and I have hardly ever sat in it so my opinion is that it is of low quality.",

I had a chair that was 39.5\" high and I could nap in it. That said, I have a bad lower back and this is very comfortable. It's also just slightly wider than some other gliders so that's nice too. My mother is 5'6\" and she can rest her head back, so my recommendation is to buy this chair if you're under 5'8\". I can still use it, just can't nap.",

The reason for giving a 4 star is : we have to tie the cushion at the back of the chair and the tie will slide down and thus the cushion too. due to this the back side of the chair is exposed all the time unless we fix it up every time we sit.",

The main thing I didn\u2019t like was how the cushions back part slides down and over time does give out. Would recommend this chair for someone who needs it for a newborn or foe short term uses as in 1-3 years. After that I\u2019m guess you willl need to replace cushioning or discard chair.",

My husband was rocking our 3 month old in the glider, the left arm of the chair fell down from the bottom of the chair, and the gliding stopped (can\u2019t fix this). Luckily I bought my husband a rocking recliner for Christmas and just let him open it today so we could rock our baby. I hate that this chair did that, we loved this chair. By the way no one got hurt, thank goodness!",

I would recommend this glider to any pattern in the market or really anyone that is looking for a comfortable glider that is built well enough to last for years to come! Oh and the price was pretty good as well for what you are getting!",

Some reviewers said that the back cushion slouches, but if you tie the ties around the top this shouldn't be a problem- don't tie around vertical back bars or it will side down. Fits nicely in a small corner in my nursery. I'll come back after further use and update my review if needed.",
