I was having a lot of pain in my feet after doing 2 or 3 games and couldn't take it anymore. The first day I wore these I had games from 8:30am to 8pm. I was sore at the end of the day but it was nowhere near as bad without them. I should mention i also went to the Walmart Dr. School's kiosk and got fitted for inserts. The combination has made it much easier to referee those long days.",
