I read carefully to get this one which makes huge pancakes, its primary use, fried eggs, omelets and quesadillas which i have used it for in this week. It works great for everything, the only thing is temperature control is a little high on one side. I will get use to it as i use it more. Overall, i like it and recommend it",

Usually I have to cook the pancake for 2 min., then flip it over and let what was previously the top cook for another minute to get it done. That's why the 4-stars instead of 5; it's excellent for anything else, like a sandwich, but not quite as excellent for a pancake because of having to cook two-sides at once, which was my main reason for buying it.",
