We took 2 hangers with clips on them that we got when we bought some shorts. Place the 2 front ones back to back and clip them on the top edge with the hanger clips. Do the same with the rears. They dry out very well this way and avoids getting all of the Velcro tabs from snarling them together.",

We receive countless affirmations from horsemen crediting our Sports Medicine Boots with saving their horses from catastrophic leg injuries. According to a study conducted at the University of Minnesota, thoroughbred race horses booted with front SMBs \u201cexhibited increased comfort wearing the boots as they shifted their weight forward. Combining the high level of protection and energy absorption with minimal effects on the gait, the Sports Medicine Boot is a valuable tool in prevention of lower limb injuries during training and performance, as well as a valuable addition to the treatment regime for rehabilitating horses with limb injuries.\u201d Booting all four legs allows the horse to comfortably maintain its normal distribution of weight. 30-Day money-back guarantee/one-year w\u00adarranty or as required by law.",
