For the reviews commenting on the picture, I\u2019d see about swapping out your screen. We bought an actual projector screen and when you set the projector up properly, the picture is crystal clear. Easy to adjust as there aren\u2019t many adjustment options you have to play with it a bit but once you find the right position the picture is perfect. We are very happy with it and plan to hook up a roku for the kids! Thanks. For fast easy shipping!",
