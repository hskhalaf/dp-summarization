Plenty of room in the main bag for stowaway containers or just piling in everything you need for the day. And that's just one section of the bag! I'm thrilled that I decided to get this bag over a vest, as I can see myself using this bag for lots of other activities besides fishing.",

      "text": "Perfect size bag for an expedition on the river!!! I just received this bag and I must say after handing the bag it is well made and the quality for the price is unbeatable. One other aspect, is the bag has enough space for all that one needs and remains accessible and easy carry on and this is made possible due to how well made the bag and the straps are. I will update this review once I have used the bag out on the water.",

      "text": "Initially the bag was perfect. It holds two 6500 boxes in the main pouch and a few spools of leader in the side pouch with room for random stuff. What kills if for me is that the bad isn't water resistant at all making it unusable in the kayak and something I had to pay attention to when wading. Opening up the bag and finding a bunch of rusting hooks and mold was not a great experience. Lastly the waist strap broke while hiking. It caught on the bank as I climbed down and popped the threads.",
