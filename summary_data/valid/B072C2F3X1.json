I contacted Nokia and I received a reply saying that when this Nokia 6 phone is purchased through Amazon.com and it does not work it should be returned to Nokia within 14 days of receiving your phone. Nokia do not stand by their so called warranty, I paid $229 of my hard earned money, Nokia needs to tell the truth about what they sell on Amazon. I advise all who are thinking about buying this phone to think twice before wasting your money, good luck.",

I don't like the messaging app or the calling app that come with the phone, but that is easily rectified. The lack of a wallet app sucks, but the google wallet is a fine substitute.If you are coming from android then I would definitely say buy it.

Really solidly built and paired with a decent care - unless dropped on the screen, it'll hold up well. Excited that Nokia is manufacturing again!

After going through this twice, I asked that Nokia either replace or repair the battery or phone. I was told that they had to pass the information along. It has now been over 1 year, and they have done nothing. I WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT MADE BY NOKIA AGAIN. This sounds like venting, but my intent is CONSUMER AWAREBESS.

I don't totally understand why because call quality is fine. If you use your phone heavily for music, podcasts, etc, this is not the phone for you.

This phone is really solidly built, and really nice looking. Some critics kind of bashed the camera but I think that's nit-picking. I have no complaints with image quality or camera function. Also, the display is beautiful... love this phone.",
