      "text": "(Tobias\u2019s wife here) I love these! I was a little concerned when I first ordered them, and seeing how so many people stated to go a size up AFTER I ordered them.. But I went with my gut instinct and got the 7/8 (I wear a 7.5) When I received them they did fit a little \u201csmall\u201d (back of heel popping out) however after a couple of days of breaking them in, they fit perfect! They are memory foam, so you have to wear them down a little and let them conform to you. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say to go a \u201csize up\u201d like everybody else is saying. You just gotta break them in! Very comfy though, and highly recommend!",

The have a very good amount of cushion without feeling thick and overly padded. They wear well indoors and on the few occasions when I have had to run outside or out to the garage-although these are sturdy and can handle more than that. The color (I got grey) is not solid but rather a layering of grey, dark grey, white, etc. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase-so much so I am thinking about purchasing these for holiday gifts for all the ladies!",

They haven't samples snow yet, but I'm quite certain they'll be perfect for a dash to the mailbox. The price was right, too.",

Edit:5 months later, they got more flat, support wise and they make my feet sweat and hold the smell. I use a spray and air them out. But not super happy long term with these.",

They are extremely comfortable and the inside is super soft. The bottoms of the slippers are nonslip. I do wish the inside material wasn't a cream color. But that was the only option with the outside pattern I wanted and I knew the color I was getting when I ordered. So I don't count that against the company/slipper. Despite that, I would order this slipper again, especially considering how quickly they arrived (I live in Alaska).",

I decided to get the size 9 and I feel like I won the lottery! These slippers are perfect in every way!!! I like to wear socks and there is plenty of room with or without and they are not sloppy because of the memory foam. The soles are durable and flexible. I don't think they are the most fashionable but my feet sure enjoy the comfort!",
