      "text": "I so much wanted to love this set. I have my fathers old corded Makita drill from 20 years ago and it is still superb! But this is not my fathers Makita. The quality seemed to be good. But the chuck is not centered. With a drill bit installed, it wobbles quite a bit. Not as much of an issue with larger bits, but certainly an issue with smaller ones. The other issue is the speed control. Might not be a specific issue with this drill, but it is quite hard to have control of the speed of the drill.",

I make use of the soft setting for the occasions that require being careful of plastic parts. Also at home have found the setting great for wood. ( however the third \"A\" assistive set is better for wood.) At work the batteries last about a week. and take about an half hour to charge.",

Works very well doing that. It's lightweight, compact, and battery seems to last forever. Love that it's lightweight so I can use it all day long without tiring too much. Battery seems to last about 16 hours with moderate use. The truest chuck out of the three sets I own. I use the impact driver for setups on the machine. It works well for screwing vices in and out. No issues with anything. Batteries charge in 30 minutes or less. Get a set! You'll love it.",

Only DeWalt makes something like this. I've never understood why drills have a clutch but drivers don't; seems like it should be the other way around.",

The only improvements I would have wanted is for the LED light to remain on longer (like DeWalt) and better light coverages to be able to see the placement of bit tips in total darkness. Also, the battery charger does NOT give charging status sound alerts as the user manual indicates. I returned the first one received for this reason and the second one had the same problem. I suspect the manufacturer has eliminated this feature but failed to update the user manual.",

    "description": "Style:Kit OnlyThe Makita 18-Volt LXT Lithium-Ion sub-compact Brushless cordless 2-piece Combo kit (CX200RB) lets users do more with less, with two ultra-compact cordless solutions for drilling, driving and fastening in a more compact size with significantly less weight. The 18-Volt sub-compact driver-drill and impact driver are a new class of compact, with the size and weight of lower voltage tools but with the performance, power and compatibility of 18-Volt. The expansive breadth-of-line of the Makita 18-Volt LXT Series means an 18-Volt battery from any LXT tool will power the 18-Volt sub-compact driver-drill and impact driver included in the CX200RB. The kit includes an ultra-compact 2-speed Brushless driver-drill with two speed settings that weighs only 2.8 lbs., and a variable speed Brushless impact driver with two speed settings that weighs only 2.6 lbs. For more efficient fastening, the impact driver features assist mode (a-mode) which helps eliminate \u201cscrew cam-out\u201d and \"cross threading\" by driving at low speed until tightening begins. It's part of Makita\u2019s expanding 18V Lithium-Ion Series, the world\u2019s largest cordless tool line-up powered by 18V Lithium-Ion slide-style batteries. Makita 18V Lithium-Ion batteries have the fastest charge times in their categories, so they spend more time working and less time sitting on the charger. Equipped with Star Protection Computer Controls(TM) to protect against overloading, over-discharging and over-heating.",
