Very light compared to the Walmart trail shoes I've been using. On the trail: The shoe loosens up and the toe box becomes more comfortable. Went up 800 feet in half a mile in damp sand without a problem. I don't feel any moisture coming through from the mud. Great grip. A lot less knee pain compared to the Walmart shoes I just got rid of. For as cheap as these shoes are, I'm very pleased. I couldn't ask for much more.",
