To store the tools, I took some clear tape and made some little holders on the back of the top portion similar to the straw holders on the side of a can of air to clean out your keyboard.",

I think it would be best if the company either a) chooses not ship to those states (OR & HI), or B) they should provide guidance how to work around the problem. I'm sure for the rest of the 48 states, this is a lovely item.",
