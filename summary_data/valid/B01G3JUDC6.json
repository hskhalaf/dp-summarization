      "text": "I feel so bad writing this review because I grew up on Corelle Dinnerware Set and when we bought our own house, decided to use these as our everyday set since they're literally unbreakable, look fine, and are such a practical choice. We've been using this set less than two months ago, but they feel like a cheaper quality than I remember. When I try to stack the larger plates, they don't exactly fit and look warped, see picture. Not sure If I just got a bad set since I don't remember them being like this before.",

Everthing came in perfect shape in the box, and after a quick run thru the dishwasher they were sparkling and ready!!!! We have been using them for about 1 week now and even mg husband is impressed. The Lids fit great also. I'm so loving these dishes!!! Can't wait for a dinner party to use a fully matching set!!! I feel like even our food tastes better cause everthing looks so pretty on them!",

We have 12 of everything else, but only 11 of the Dessert plates. I was surprised to find that there was no wrapping around the plates or any other bubble wrap within the packaging. I think it's silly to return the whole set for one plate, so I'm hoping they'll send a replacement one instead.",

And that is without considering that the entire set cost what I could have paid for only two replacement pieces of my discontinued pattern; now relegated to \"accents\" here and there, if that! Highly recommend it. It's a game-changer.",
