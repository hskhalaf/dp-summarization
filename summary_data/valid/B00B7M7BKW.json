The purpose of these is to protect your interior and the design leads this to fail miserably. Our other SUV has had a car seat in it for 10 months without half of the stretching this has caused in 1 week. Stay clear of this product, particularly with leather interiors, and be suspect of all the positive reviews.",

The protector doesn't leave marks behind after taking it out and keeps my granddaughter's feet off the seat back. It's easy to wipe down and after time, the front section does relax enough to lay down against the front of the seat cushion. Since I intended to attach the car seat using the latch system (and not the seat belt) this fit my needs. If you intend to secure your car seat using the seat belt, I will tell you that this protector extends over the belt buckle and will not accommodate that.",

The marks on the seat at the bottom are quite prominent. Wondering if this protector helped at all. 3. The rubber feet at the bottom have gotten disfigured due to weight of the car seat.

      "text": "These are a bit pricey, but the best seat protectors. We have 3 carseats in the car and found the were rubbing into the seats and leaving permanent indents in the interior. Not to mention small food items or spills from the kiddos they dropped we're getting stuck under the carseat. We have three of these and fit well and with the blue Cross rubber on the bottom for support, it keeps the carseats from digging into the seats and leaving indents. When we clean them, we just hose them down and wipe (sometimes scrub) and easy to put back in..",

This is a nice feature since some seat protectors don't have this and if used with a booster rather than full car seat tends to fall forward or side to side. I would recommend this seat protector.",

We don't really give my daughter to many snacks or drinks in the car, so for us it is all about the portion that protects the back of the seat from her dirty shoes or her kicking.",
