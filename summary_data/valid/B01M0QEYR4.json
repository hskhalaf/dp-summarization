Well this morning I came into my office and the keyboard was dead (despite having been plugged in) and its been charging for the last 2 hours and it's still unusable.

Unbelievably inconsistent charging. The equally fatal flaw is that within two weeks of use, the keyboard began emitting a high-pitched tone at all times. If you want to know what it's like to have tinnitus, get this keyboard. Please, please, please: don't buy this keyboard. Velocifire does not deserve your money.",

At first I thought it was just that I didn't depress the key far enough, but as the keys continue to degrade further I realize that the failure is mechanical (backspace requires significant effort on the left side to register at all now).

The keystroke does have a \"scratchy\" feeling that is discussed in the youtuber reviews if you slowly press a key down and examine every millimeter travel however when you actually use they keyboard to type the switches feel nice and linear, and the bottom out is satisfying.

      "text": "I love this keyboard! This is actually the second one I purchased because I stupidly spilled soda STRAIGHT into it, but I would happily replace it 3x over because I love it more than the $100 mechanical keyboard I purchased before. It is mechanical so it's not a SILENT keyboard, but I feel it is relatively very quiet and doesn't bother me at all, and I hate the clicking of normal mechanical keyboards. I owned my last one for over a year and it never looked or worked less than brand new, I am very happy with this company!",

      "text": "Pros: Nice mechanical key feel, similar to Cherry MX Browns. Sturdy construction. Backlight is adequate. Inexpensive. Works on Windows and Linux. Cons: Keyboard is loud, even for mechanical - there's an annoying \"ringing\" sound when you type that I haven't had on other keyboards (compared to a CM Masterkeys Brown). Also, takes a long time to become responsive after wake from standby on my Windows 7 system (compared to generic USB keyboard); not sure if this is a bug in my USB drivers or the keyboard. Keycap labels are a little fuzzy and stencil-looking.",

Brown switches-so it isn't overly clicky, but still a bit of \"mechanical\" sound to it. 2 of the key stems have split over the years, but they were very easy to fix with a drop of super glue. The backlight color is not customizable. It isn't extremely over the top like some other mechanical boards can be. You could put this on a desk in an office environment and it wouldn't look too out of place. I have done some light gaming with it and encountered no problems. It is very nice for what it is, I have been extremely pleased with this purchase.",

The LEDs aren't that piercing blue color that you can see through your eyelids so it's less disturbing for people who leave their PCs on all the time.

      "text": "This product is so close to being great. It has so many of the features I want at a great price. The thing holding it back is what even the cheapest keyboards get right: actually sending a keystroke when you hit a key, and not sending one when you don't hit a key. I work as a programmer and it's infuriating when this keyboard malfunctions, which is often. I am probably going to get a new keyboard and use this one as a media pc keyboard.",

I think they said Green but it feels like an aqua/sea color. Keys seem a bit spongy, but it could be me just getting used to it. Overall, a nice little keyboard for a good price.",

Note that it does not have any stands underneath to raise the height, so if you need that you'll have to use a book or something.

However if you have a little more to spend, i would say go for the G710+ by logitech.
