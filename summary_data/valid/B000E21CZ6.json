I have been trying to get it replaced through warranty but keep getting the tun around. I work in a shop so buying tools form honest sellers is key. Sadly this is not the case here. Save ur money and buy a better gun. At this point I may as well have just saved my money and bought a cheeper gun from harbor freight.",

Comfortable grip. Easily accessible forward and reverse with adjustable torque settings. Comes with protective boot. Ergonomics of grip does not cause hand fatigue like the Snap-on and does not limit grip angle like the Matco. Fantastic product and I recommend this to all other fellow professional technicians.",

It is not the best design for this type of retainer as it can jam easily. You need to make sure it is fully closed at the split so it doesn't get turned in the socket and jam. .Just took a slight squeeze with the pliers to correct. I would have preferred a spring loaded ball in the side of the boss like most socket wrenches. Other than that it has worked to my satisfaction.",

If you're looking for a well built unit that pushes out the type of torque it's actually rated for and don't want to spring for high end name brand unit, look no farther, this is by far the best option around in the 1/2\" impact gun arena.",

I really like the speed, however adjusting the speed could be a lot easier if it had a selector instead of the set screw, the first time I adjusted it I had to use a screw driver, but I guess because it is rugged that's the option the manufactor used for adjustments, a little heavy, I definitely recommend it. A very good tool.",

This Chinese manufactured product, however, has a combination of extremely rough surfaces as well as poorly designed and difficult to use controls. The nut at the base of the grip used for supply air also has a sharp edge that presents a hazard to a user's hand. Ingersoll-Rand has manufactured impact wrenches that are far more user friendly. My recommendation, upgrade to a much better model or buy another brand!",
