      "text": "This is the best I've ever used to juice limes. I process hundreds at a time and I store the juice in ziplock bags, then freeze them. And I'm all set for the year. My Breville stays parked in the basement until I am ready to squeeze another 200 the next summer! Breville squeezes everything out of he fruit, including the pulp (the best in the juice) so that there is no waste. I barely put some weight on the handle and Breville does the whole job!",

      "text": "I bought this to juice the hundreds of pomegranates I harvest each autumn (about 15-20 gallons worth). I've used it two harvest seasons now and am happy to report it has exceeded my expectations. I get more juice out of every fruit than from any other juicer I've tried, with less fatigue and greater speed. Juicing pomegranates is still a messy proposition that no appliance can solve, this one included. Fortunately the die-cast surface cleans easily. Wish I could say the same for my clothes and my sink! I like the looks and performance so much that I've started to replace my other kitchen appliances with those made by Breville. So far, so good.",

This is the first review I have ever written, but I wanted to correct the misperception that the customer service was poor. It certainly is not as far as I'm concerned.",

Zero effort (just a little patience) to get through juicing 5-6 oranges for refreshing juice. The parts are high quality, the weight solid on your counter. The only thing to be watchful of is the plastic top piece which presses down on the citrus...go easy with that piece and do NOT remove it after every use to clean. It will eventually fall off if you do. One hell of a juicer!",
