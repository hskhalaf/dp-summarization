I would give 4.5 stars if this was an option -- The only issue I have is that if a white noise machine is on too loud it doesn't block that sound, but in general I've been very happy with it for the price we paid. There are upgrade models for people who need more features. I've been able to adjust the white noise machine so that the monitor tunes it out.",
