Its lightness, out-of-the-box comfort, and decent support also never went unnoticed. However, despite the good points, there are also flaws found in this model. It is heavily criticized for its narrow width. The rounded heel and hard rubber toe guard are even met with a skeptical reception. In conclusion, the Redmond has features that potential buyers would find helpful on their hikes. That is, if the width can accommodate their feet well.",

The were light weight and I didn't have a problem with the lack of arch support others have mentioned. However, the narrow toe box was a real problem for me - and as the hike progressed it became more and more uncomfortable, especially on the downhills! I don't have a wide foot, perhaps a little wider than average, but I feel the narrow toe box is a design flaw for the standard foot. If I could, I would return them as they were very uncomfortable.",

If you prefer ankle socks like me, I\u2019d definitely recommend wearing them with the type that have a lip on the back (like Nike Karrimore) because my Achilles started getting raw after a few hours of wearing them with regular ankle length socks.

The product fits as expected and true to size, in my opinion. I am a size 10 and have boney, sorta wide but not feet. I'd recommend going up a 1/2 size or full size if you plan to wear these with thick hiking socks. I wore nike dry fit socks and they were a bit snug, but I was able to wear them all day with no problems.",
