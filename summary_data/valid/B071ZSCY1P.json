      "text": "I had a convection microwave in my last motor home, so I was familiar with how they should work. I could cook anything in the motor home, but sadly this one is too weak to cook even a small pork roast. I put together the roast, preheated the oven and in two hours it was still not cooked. The potatoes and carrots were drying out and crunchy - after two hours! When you get it preheated it struggles to maintain that heat. It looks nice and the microwave works well, but this is not the countertop oven you are looking for, and it sure isn't worth nearly double what I paid for it last year. Pass.",

      "text": "First microwave/convection oven I've owned so touch pad not intuitive, but easy to learn to use. Nice features. Warning: Not recommended. After 8 months the interior light stopped working except for occasional flicker. Called and was told it is and LED which is embedded into the circuitry and cannot be replaced by me or repaired by a technician. Since the machine was still under warranty received full refund without having to return it. If this well-known malfunction (folks I talked to knew of the problem even before I told them) had occurred several months later the warranty would have expired.",

The toaster oven feature takes way too long to get going compared to my stand alone toastmaster. Another thing that I thought was odd was that it emitted a high pitch noise when not in use but plugged in. I unplugged it, no noise, plugged it back in, noise. So it was for sure coming from the microwave. I think sticking with a regular microwave and a dedicated toaster oven is the right way for me personally",
