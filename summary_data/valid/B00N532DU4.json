I have to take it out of the case, pry off the back and take the battery out and put it all back together again to resurrect it. I am so frustrated with this phone that I may bite the bullet and replace it with an iPhone more than a year before my contract renewal. Oh, and this phone is horrible with Periscope. More often than not, the live broadcast doesn't load.",
