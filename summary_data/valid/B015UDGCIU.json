Strangely the box they arrived in was in perfect shape. Now I have to deal with the hassle of returning such a large heavy box. Really disappointed - would not recommend.",

The 24-inch counter stools are actually more of a Distressed Bronze, not Distressed Copper and do not match the Distressed Copper barstools I purchased from the Flash Furniture also. The return/replacement policy does not allow you to speak with anyone so I'm quite concerned that the 24-inch counter stools will be replaced with more of the same wrong color. This is upsetting because these are for a backyard renovation unveiling party which is close at hand. I have many other things to do to get ready for the party and did not need this hassle.",

Maybe I'll take some sandpaper to it myself and see what happens, before trying to return it. I have another one arriving tomorrow.
