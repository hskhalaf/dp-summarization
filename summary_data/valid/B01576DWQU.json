This thing will clean your pores too!!! DO NOT USE ON THIN SKIN ON FACE UNLESS YOU WANT A HICKY. But my nose, chin and cheeks look soo much better. Bonus, it's cheaper than buying a 50 dollar electric black head remover. Highly recommend for people with large funky pores.",

For my boyfriend, this sucks out anything that causes the bite to itch and is visible. If you react highly to mosquito bites, there's a good chance this won't work for you. If you have a low/mild reaction to mosquito bites, this will work perfectly and cure the bite almost instantly.",

Don't apply too much pressure, and make sure to apply the pressure for the appropriate amount of time. I don't feel like it does much to a bite that is more than an hour or two old. I also would avoid using it on a bite that has been itched much, because applying suction to broken skin results in increased bleeding. I've had about a dozen people try it and most agree that it provides a significant reduction of itching when used on a recent bite.",

I've noticed that the quicker you do it, the more it helps. The longer you wait, the less itch it relieves. But overall, it was worth $10!
