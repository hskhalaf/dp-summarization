      "text": "LOVE these scissors. Bought them to replace expensive fabric scissors and I wish I'd done it a long time ago. These are heavy, but comfortably to use- no obnoxiously protruding angles like some of the metal-handled scissors I've tried. Sharp right out of the box, tested on a fine lawn that tends to get trapped between the tips of other shears. They are bigger than I expected, despite the manufacturer photos- I may add a couple of snaps to this review- definitely not for travelling. These are like the scissors your grandmother had- with any luck my sons will produce some grandkids for me so I have someone to pass them on to!",

      "text": "Nice weight. Not to long and not to short. Seems like they would hold up for awhile if they weren't such poor craftsmenship. When I got them out of the package to start using them, they were to dull towards the end of the blades and i ruined my fabric. I was expecting to be able to use them right out of the box and not have to go get them sharpened. It's a little upsetting when you ruin perfectly good fabric with a pair of brand new dull scissors. Also, they loosen after every use so im constantly tightening the screw on the side. That is a little inconvenient. Unpleased customer!!! Would not buy this product again.",

The regular scissors did cut, but could only use the first 25% of the blade (closest to the hinge) before it began to bind up. These scissors cut like butter for the entire length of the blade. Of course, the real test of scissors is the test of time. I can't speak, yet, for how well they hold an edge.",

I do not recommend them for kids or for cutting anything small/precise. But if you have a big fat piece of fabric to cut, these are great. And they're a good price. Much better than the fancy Fiskars scissors I bought for 6 times the price (per scissor) at JoAnn Fabrics. Totally worth it.",
