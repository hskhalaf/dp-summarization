Recently though it had essentially stopped removing the whiskers. Tried repeated cleanings and the motor was fine so my only conclusion was that the blades needed to be replaced. Looking through some of the other reviews I see that this has happened to others. The official replacements (SH90) run in the $50 range. Meaning that the razor cost $150 and will need another $50 investment approximately every 6 months?? After all these years I am now looking to switch brands.",

The Philips Norelco model 9200 does a very good job in shaving my face including trimming my beard. It is a very simple process for switching out the razor for the beard trimmer accessory. But I encourage you to be careful in swapping out the razor head when utilizing the beard trimmer and then reversing the process. Surprisingly, this system does not include a cleaning brush. Cleaning the Philips Norelco is a bit cumbersome. Again, be careful in the interchange of the trimmer and the razor for cleaning purposes.",
