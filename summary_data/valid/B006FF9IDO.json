      "text": "LOVE this bar! I went back and forth between this bar and others (ZAthletic, Nimble). With the other brands, you needed to buy the extension kit once the child reaches a certain weight. The extension kits were around $100. -also, after watching countless YouTube videos of at-home reviews for each product, the other brands looked a little wobbly. So, I decided to pay the $150 more for the Tumbl Trak. The PROS are definitely worth the investment. Extremely stable and NO extension kits needed in the future! (I figured I would be paying the same amount overall if I had to buy the extension legs) 6 year old Daughter loves it. Her brothers love it. Would definitely recommend the investment.",

      "text": "Definitely worth spending the money. So far so good since Christmas. This is a very sturdy bar with a nice-sized width between the two upright cylinders. To test it, I did a front flip on it myself (I am 230 pounds) and it hardly shook. My daughter is 55 pounds so I have no worries. You must complement this with a solid, thick mat like a TumbleTrack. The only thing I do not like is the mounting bar does not fit exactly flush down the aforementioned vertical cylinders, so you must be particularly careful making sure the bar is locked in position. Otherwise this is a five-star purchase.",

The problem isn't with the product but rather it is with Amazon's ability to ship this product correctly. I received what appears to be 2 of 8 pieces (1 box of 3). I am working through my options with Amazon since they show the order as fulfilled. I am sure this is a great product and confident that this will be worked out, but it is very frustrating.

      "EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP - The Tumbl Trak Junior Bar PRO is one of the most well designed home use gymnastics bars on the market. Rounded corners ensure that your athlete will be safe and confident when training.",
      "SAFETY AND STABILITY - If you\u2019re looking for a safe and stable bar; look no further! The Junior Bar PRO is one of the most stable bars on the market. The large 4ft x 6ft floor stamp keeps this bar stable for most at home skills.",
      "HIGH QUALITY/BUILT TO LAST - Steel construction with a smooth, tough powder coated finish will keep your bar looking like new and functional for years to come. A 1-1/2in solid wood bar is tough enough to withstand the rigorous training.",
      "SUPER EASY SET UP - We know how exciting it can be to get an item, but then be frustrated with the assembly. That\u2019s why the Junior Bar PRO is super simple to set up! Just screw in 6 knobs and 4 bolts and you\u2019re done and ready to start practicing!",
      "WE KNOW GYMNASTICS - When you purchase a product from Tumbl Trak, you know that you\u2019re getting a TRUE gymnastics product. Coaches, former gymnasts, and industry experts make up the our staff ensuring you get the best product for your athlete.",
      "Weight limit of 125 lbs. is a \"working\" load which is how your athlete will use it (swinging, circling, hanging, kipping). Be wary of competitors who list a high weight limit that is indicative of static load (hanging only) and not working load."
