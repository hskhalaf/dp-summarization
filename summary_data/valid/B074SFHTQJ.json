Have to say the case protects the phone very well and I particularly like the TPU inner case \u2013 it is a little soft to touch and cover roundly of the phone, plus it is slim and comfortable to carry. The pockets for cards and cash are very handy which is my most favorite of the case. The magnetic catch works perfectly and snaps closed with a good contact. Broadly I recommend this case; extremely quality product, wallet style leather iPhone case, and it keep the phone clean and gives very good protection. 10/10 would buy again.",

She was constantly shoving her card in and out and after a year it began to slide out when she didn't want to so she has replaced it now. I still feel it was a great purchase",

I also chose the case because the piece that holds the phone goes all the way around top and bottom.
