      "text": "Great knee board! Just tried it out on the lakes in northern Wisconsin. Our boys, 10 and 12, have never water skiid or knee boarded, so we were excited to try this. It took them 3 tries each before they were able to get up and enjoy it. They said it was much better than tubing. The trick was to start on the tummy and as the boat takes off, quickly push up onto your knees. Then the boat could speed up. No instructions came with this board which was a bummer, but one of my sons watched a few videos on YouTube which helped a lot. They can't wait to get back out and use this again!",

I received the board with no decals so its just black.. not that big of a deal but its like I got an unfinished product. It rode okay and was easy to get up on so for that I gave it 3 stars. If it weren't such a pain to send back I would def buy one that has better padding.",

What a disappointment. The board worked great for the first 2 hours, but then one fall into the water, and the plastic slot that holds the knee strap in place broke clear of the board. There are now two holes where the screws went into the board. You can see the plastic anchors broke clear off of the board. Not very well made if after 1 fall, the board starts to break apart.",

The rope hold on the front was great for them because, as beginners, they didn't have to worry as much about holding the rope and pulling themselves up on the board at the same time. Great starter board and the price seemed reasonable.",

      "title": "Top Quality Kneeboard, Great Price!",
      "text": "This item arrived quickly and just in time for our big lake weekend! Kudos on the prompt order time. Quality knee board for any level of rider from beginner to advanced. Light weight and had great control. (Easy to maneuver and control when doing/attempting your tricks) The hook for the handle to assist in getting up onto the board was very helpful to our new riders. Everyone was able to get up on the board with ease and cruise around without hesitation. I would highly recommend this product.",

Two 14 year olds (one boy and one girl) and a 12 year old girl had a blast. The tow handle catch at the front was a big help in getting them up and on top of the water (and when their arms got tired). Adults had a great time on this thing as well.",
