It is very well constructed- very heavy weight and holds all of his ashes. It makes a nice decorative piece on the mantle. I would give anything to have him back, but at least I still have him close by. It can also be engraved on the top or back where there are no paw prints.

Here is a photo of the urn next to the urn of his Cat Companion in life, Ari, who sadly, also passed away after a long life, recently. I am able to get some comfort by seeing these urns, with their remains, close by.",

We feel good about getting the medium, BUT, it would have been nice to know the dimensions, because the small may have worked out quite nicely too. Perhaps the Seller will give at least height dimension; it would help out greatly. The urn is absolutely beautiful!!!!",
