His socks were always wet at the end of the day which never happens with any other boots he has worn. So, his favourite looking and most comfortable Merrell boots are no more. Kudos however to both Merrell and Amazon for refunding after several months of wear. Such a shame though.",

This turned out to be a perfect choice thankfully. I was really surprised how light they are, as well as being really comfortable. I suspect the soles are quite a soft compound rubber as they are squishy and squeaky. This is sensible for a cold weather boot to give the most grip, a bit like winter tyres for cars. However, I suspect they would wear out very quickly when used in warmer weather, but I may be wrong. Overall I'm very impressed.",
