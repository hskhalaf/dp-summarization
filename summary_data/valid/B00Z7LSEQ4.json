It doesn't seem to fit the shape of the foot either and you notice this immediately when you start playing in them. Prior to this, I would've said NB made top quality tennis shoes and you couldn't go wrong with the brand. Apparently no longer the case...",

I always order 4E, and out of all the 4E shoes I've ever ordered from New Balance, these feel a little more narrow. Fortunately, I'm probably not a true 4E, but more of a 3.75E. It does feel a bit more snug than other extra wide shoes I've owned, but it still fits me. As a tennis player, my feet will swell just a bit after hitting the courts for a couple hours, which is natural. So far, these shoes have been great for me. However, if you're a TRUE 4E wide wearer, you might be in trouble if you're very active.",
