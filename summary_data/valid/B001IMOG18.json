      "text": "These gloves are great to use pudding around the yard or whatever you need to do wearing a lighter fabric glove. I usually rinse them good with a waterhose to remove heavy soil then toss them in the washer. If they do tear you can just sew up the hole, no problem. They are tuff enough and last a long, long time if not overused or used in super hard work. Great garden gloves and soft. Highly reccomend. I like to keep a couple pairs in our RV for handling wood or whatever but not to handle anything hot like frying pans. They are lightweight. Thanks!",

The colors withstand washing, even with hot water. My nails are adequately protected from breakage. What I don't like: One pair developed a hole at the tip of the middle finger, dominant hand after less than an hour of repotting plants. They aren't water-resistant in the least; the cotton absorbs moisture and they readily hold dampness. Soil also manages to get through the weave of the fabric and under my nails.",

      "text": "I needed a pair of work gloves, but my hands are too small for most gloves that are advertised as \"work gloves.\" I usually have to use garden gloves. These are by far the best garden gloves I have used as a work glove replacement. I've used them before. They can take a beating, don't tear easily, have a great grip, they are thick enough to not worry about bug bites, and the fit makes it so I have the same mobility that large heavy duty gloves don't allow.",
