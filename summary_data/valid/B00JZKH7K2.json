If you don't have a strong core you won't be able to use it at full function at first. Just going out a little bit at a time still engages all those muscles that you need to be able to do a full rep. Baby steps. Also I love the fact that it's a family based company. Didn't get any better than that.",

I have tried many types of rollers, and this is one of my absolute favorites. It is very smooth and stable, and small enough to throw into your suitcase.

Can't compare to instructions because it doesn't come with anything (maybe they mention it on one of the videos linked on the box).
