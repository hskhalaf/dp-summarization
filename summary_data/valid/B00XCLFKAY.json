He loves the blueberries. The lids aren't as tough as other to remove. The size is a perfect amount at one time.",

If your little one likes cold foods try putting them in the freezer and then after you've been out and about all day they turn into a slushy. Extra yum! I guess they could kinda double as an icepack too?",

Also, the convenience of the pouch is so great, I keep some in my bag, in my car and at the grandparent's house so I know a healthy snack is always available. Highly recommend trying this product and flavor if you are looking to add tasty nutrition to your child's diet.",
