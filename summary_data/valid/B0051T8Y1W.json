Today I plugged it in, and after several minutes pressed the trigger to check if the steam was ready. I heard a snap, and the trigger felt sloppy and did nothing. I managed to disassemble the unit (out of warranty) enough to look inside, and discovered that one of the hinge pins for the trigger lever had broken off. Cheap plastic part, obviously not designed for \"everyday\" use, let alone the light use I've subjected it to. No obvious way to repair the trigger, and no replacement parts.",

      "text": "What an awesome little machine. Lots of whiners on here, but the fact is that for the size and price, it's fantastic. I used this on some grout/tile that needed some serious cleaning and while it took some time and effort, it really did a terrific job. It has several different attachments for your various needs. I highly recommend this machine. Takes less than 3 minutes after refilling to be ready to go and it lasts 5-8 minutes before it needs to be refilled. Anyone complaining that it doesn't last long enough needs to get an education. You can't expect 30 minutes of continuous steam from a device with roughly two cups of water in it. Seriously!",

The water heats up quickly and I love the little cup that comes with it for filling water. I hope and pray that this steamer lasts longer than the Dirt devil (it stopped working in less than 6 months) steamer. It would have been nice if it was a little less noisy but other than that I am a happy customer!",

While cleaning the equipment, without the steamer, you spend about 15/20 minutes wiping/scraping stuff off. WITH the cleaner, it drops to about 5 minutes of cleaning time *(plus time to heat up), and the gunk just melts off. The small form factor allowed me to store this little guy in a pelican case. This made the steamer a very mobile solution. For larger jobs, I'd recommend a larger unit.",

I may need to actually take a chemical cleaner to finish the job and lift the stains but I was glad to reduce the population first.",

It made short work of some smears of gunk left from the installation of the cupboards that couldn't be shifted with any cleaning products. Ditto the handles of the fridge. So far, it's actually fun to use. There's a real thrill with zapping smears and stains, giving a quick wipe and there's a visible difference. We're still learning and just getting started, but we're happy that this item popped up in a list of Amazon suggestions.",

The only thing I have found it useful for is cleaning small cracks and crevices around the stove in conjunction with a toothbrush.

I don't like my large steam cleaner as it is awkward to use. I have tried to buy handheld steamers in the past, but had to return because it/they didn't work. This cleaner holds enough water to get thejob done, but not so large to be bulky. I have cleaned my stove top, oven, shower, and the grout in my entryway. Love it.",

I found this steamer produces such a tiny stream of steam that it would take many hours to steam clean a bathtub. Using any of the tools included reduced the temperature and diffused the tiny stream so that it was ineffective. I used it once, for about ten minutes, then gave up on it. Now it takes up space in the closet.",
