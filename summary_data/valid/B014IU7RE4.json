      "verdict": "The Skechers Equalizer 2.0 has become a go-to shoe for casual and recreational purposes for a considerable number of buyers. It was able to provide a comfortable, lightweight, and well-cushioned walking experience. Moreover, it helped relieve foot and joint pain for some wearers. Even though the shoe wore out a bit faster than some people expected, its positive assets still overshadowed the criticisms.",
      "pros": [
        "A vast majority of buyers marveled at the comfort provided by the Skechers Equalizer 2.0",
        "Based on general user feedback, the shoe was highly recommended for walking, traveling, and even going out",
        "Nearly all owners reported that the trainer was true to size and width",
        "A lot of wearers lauded how light the shoe felt on the foot",
        "The sole cushioning was also appreciated by many users",
        "People with wide foot dimensions were happy to find a well-fitting and attractive shoe in an extra-wide option",
        "The trainer accommodated wearers with bone spurs and rheumatism, soothing their foot pain",
        "Several reviewers also noted that its slip-on design allowed for an easy on-and-off"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A scant number of users wrote that the outsole wore out and lost traction too soon",
        "Multiple buyers with high insteps had to return the shoe due to it tight fit across the upper"

Will adjust stars accordingly once fully reviewed. Update after 10 days of light use: Very disappointed, look more like they have been around the world and look battered (see pics), this merely after 10 days of use, look horrible now although still comfy as ever, such a shame, even the print inside is worn out, in 10 days!!! I am wondering if this is why many other stores dont stock them, such a shame.",

After reading reviews and asking other buyers about suitable fitting for swollen feet I was advised these would be ok. I can confirm that these are better than okay and are brilliant for arthritis sufferers and people woth wider than normal feet. They have space for further expansion of need be. I will always buy skechers woth theor memory foam as these are cross between shoes/trainers and slippers.",
