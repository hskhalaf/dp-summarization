      "text": "Great cooler for the price. Really holds the ice for many days when opened judiciously. Got this big cooler to store wild game on hunting trips so we're not in it all the time on trips. I bought a 70 qt version the Coleman Xtreme to store our food and beverages and couldn't be more pleased. Only complaint is that the lid is difficult to open because of the tight tolerance when closed. I'm guessing that's why it preforms so well. Seems solid and well constructed enough for how I use a cooler. It's not a Yeti or an RTIC, but it gets the job done at a fraction of the price.",

I love companies that go the extra mile. The cooler is a great color that will not show dirt, grime and discolored white. The top is not a white rather an beige which is perfect! We are using this to house box lunches for our Pickleball Tournament in August! What a great price too!",

The meat is always frozen and at least half the block of dry ice left over by the time I get home. I couldn't ask for more. It's built rugged, and the lid closure is extremely tight on mine.",
