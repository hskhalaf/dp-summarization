While they are easy to remove, even after accidentally putting a labeled lid through the dishwasher, ink smears quite easily. Since I'm left-handed, this always leads to blurry labels.

You can also stack them in the fridge to save space. \"I received this from Sage Spoonfuls as a member of their product testing panel\"",

They don't stain - we make a lot of spaghetti with tomato sauce and none have stained, even if we heat them up in the jar.
