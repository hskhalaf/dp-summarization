      "text": "Very comfortable earphones could sleep with them on but not just that the sound is great it has a very wide sound-stage so you can hear things you hadn't heard before in certain songs the overall sound is pretty neutral perhaps bit more on the mid/high if anything the bass isn't your low rumble type it's more of a punch sound which is fine for me as I don't listen to a lot of dance/dubstep. These headphones don't require a headphone amp but they do still have a higher impedance than normal lower priced headphones so you may have to crank volume up on certain devices.",

The main reason I got these headphones was for comfort. My ears are really sensitive and using on-ear headphones for at least 10 minutes make my ears ache unbearably. This cup design on these is much more bearable as I can have these on for countless hours and not even notice that they are there.",

I find it extremely good and important to have an open headphone as you can head what is going on around you and you can have a conversation with colleagues and people if you need to get a quick message.

Unlike other hi fidelity phones they have a relatively low impedance and don't need a huge amp to sound good or loud,although one usually helps for sound dynamics. They have a great sound quality, very natural and balanced in tone, bass, mids and treble all clean and clearly represented. Soundstage width, depth and precision are all superb and detail is fantastic. A very good buy if you don't want to spend silly money on truly audiophile headphones for the home.",

The first buy was for a model twice the price of this one ( I was so impressed I forget the model ). In both cases, the upper reaches were missing, no clarity of spaciousness, and the bass was muddy and vague. Now, I'm in my mid 70's, and impairment of hearing is expected BUT--my 20 year old HD 330's ( Sennheiser) can still provide the missing sound range--so it cannot be put down to impairment---over to you Sennheiser.

As for the sound, it took a day or two to get used to (maybe some burn-in?), but it's fantastic for my favourite style of music (electronica), I was also amazed at some sword sounds in a computer game. I used to have a cable extender for my old headphones but the cable is so long with these that I don't need one any more. Has a lot of sound escaping but I'm not bothering anyone else, and bassheads will want to avoid this.",

Sennheiser have been making headphones forever and good ones too. Even during the 70s they were tonally bright i.e. the famous HD400, HD414, HD424 which must have sold millions, I know I sold hundreds! So on receiving these I new if they wasn't to my taste I could return them to Amazon. Summary - Good detailed headphones, slightly on the brighter side as expected but when used for many hours settle down nicely. definitely worth listening to (and buying) and justifies all the 5* ratings given here.",

They are extremely light-weight and comfortable (one barely feel them while on), and the colour scheme - while contentious - is original and to my liking. However the most important bit for a pair of headphones is the sound quality, and it is truly superb. The mid-range in particular is of exceptional clarity, but the low and high frequencies are also beautifully rendered, always with the idea to reproduce an authentic sound, as if we were with the musicians. I owned a pair of Sennheiser PX-360, and compared to these, although more pricey, the HD598 are undeniably a substantial step-up in quality. Worth every pound!",

These headphones are also very comfortable to wear. Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for clear, fathifully reproduced sound at a reasonable price.",
