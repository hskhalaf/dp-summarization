She has hearing aids and even with those she can hear the sound pretty well. I use ear buds sometimes when there is a lot of noise in the home. I love it that the movie starts where you left off. I would definitely buy this product again.",

The remote sensor is under the front surface so just make sure the remote is held slightly downward and pointed directly at the sensor, Overall very pleased with the quality and ease of operation.",

Pros: Very easy to figure out how to use it, and the instructions are completely clear. The screen size makes it easy to enjoy the videos. Recharging is quick. Cons: The sound is just o.k., but then, it\u2019s not meant to be an expensive stereo system. The plastic shell seems a little cheap, but it also keeps the weight of the unit very light, and easily portable. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a very good quality portable DVD player.",

It's not expensive, and they can watch movies while you surf the web. Plus--you can control their screen content by limiting it to movies that you want them to see. And, heck, you can sneak it to the bedroom to lull you to sleep. Can't live without it!",

      "text": "Just bought this for my husband to replace an old stereo system that never worked. This is a great little unit, does what it is supposed to do and easy for him to figure out and operate. Dvd's have a great quality, as long as they are not real old movies that were transferred to dvd. The audio isn't the best, quite tinny, but will buy a good speaker and that should help. Overall it's a good unit for the inexpensive price.I just hooked up a pair of Bose Companion III Series speakers and it sound great, what an improvement in the sound.",

      "text": "Does the job. I chose this one for the larger screen and longer battery life plus the other customer reviews were mostly positive. But I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I was disappointed that I couldn't go from a wide screen viewing with the black bands to a full screen. Using the settings only made the bands wider. And it makes the picture smaller on the top and bottom by a couple of inches; still in all you forget about it once you're into the video. Picture and sound are fine to me. The battery lasts at least 4 hours on a charge...haven't tried to push it to 5 or 6. Good enough player for me.",
