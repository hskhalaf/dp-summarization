      "text": "First, let me just say that we did not buy an \"outdoor TV\" for our deck. I heard bad things about them, and they're about a bazillion dollars. Instead, we got a cheap, super light TV from Sam's and got this awesome cover for it. There is no cover over the deck, and not even a ledge over where the TV is mounted. We have used this TV cover for over a year and it's worked perfectly. We do bring the TV in when it's hailing outside or when it's below freezing, but that's just to play it safe. And because we got a light TV, that's no problem at all for us!",

I ended up purchasing another brand that encloses all the way so I don't have to worry about wind, water, or bugs getting in/on the TV from underneath.",

This cover had the necessary cutouts for the dual arm bracket, so it's a winner! Good looking cover as well. Great value. Recommended!",

Our outside TV (not rated for outside) is in a covered area (patio). So, I am 100% confident in the protection of this cover. Lots of Velcro and flaps to secure it.

      "text": "When it is on a relatively new and therefore thin tv, it doesn't hang in that nice squared off way like the picture shows. This doesn't affect the function, but it just doesn't look quite as nice as the stock photo in reality. That being said, it seems thick and study and the pocket for the remote is very handy. I have a tv mounted on the wall (50\") on my screened in porch and this has worked well during extreme cold, a roof leak, and general humidity, etc.",
