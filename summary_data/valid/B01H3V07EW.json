Why waste money and buy phone just for the brand name when there is another that can deliver the same performance, reliability and at times even better. Why waste time and money buying a phone full of bloatware from the carriers. I bought this one and later upgraded to the older brother OnePlus 6. The OnePlus line is solid, great performance, that Dual sim is great for international travelers and even if you refuse to be tied to one provider. I would recommend this phone again and again.",

Always has the latest Android while Samsung Galaxy updates are slow . 3 I love the metal body feel and is an improvement compared to new phones who use glass and steel which cracks easily.",

After almost 3 months of use, it still works as new, has no problems running any app, and it's updated to Oreo. The alert slider is really useful. Things I liked the most: - Physical capacitive buttons for back, recents and home (this was really important to me, as I don't like these buttons using screen space) - Volume slider, really useful - 64GB of internal storage, being used to 8GB on a 2nd generation Moto G - The camera",

      "text": "Be very careful purchasing this in the US. It states this is compatible with ATT and Sprint. However, it DOES NOT connect to AT&T's LTE network. If you are an AT&T customer, you will be buying a very expensive 3G phone. I thought this was an AT&T problem and worked with them. Then I went to OnePlus and they told me I had purchased a phone built for the Chinese market. Understood it was an International phone, but the details in the description indicating this would work with AT&T were misleading. This should not be sold to US customers without some very specific details on how to verify it will work with your carrier.",

Turns out it's NOT the USA version as advertised, but some alternate version which doesn't support TMobile LTE bands. Just switched from AT&T and now it only gets 2G on TMobile. Of course, since we didn't discover it right away (a year has past) there's not much I can do except write a scathing review...BEWARE buying old OnePlus 3 Devices...there are some overseas models which basically don't work.",
