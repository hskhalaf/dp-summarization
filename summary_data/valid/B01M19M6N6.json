I can still smell things I put in, and as a scientist, I'm super careful not to cross-contaminate, using gloves and one person to hold the bag open while the other fills it up with the materials, keeping things away from the zipper folds, etc. etc.. If it's pilot error, then it must take Neil Armstrong. I've even double-bagged and that's at least a little less noticeable. But if you place the sealed bags in a ziploc and a day or two later open the ziploc, you're presented with a very strong odor of the items in the bags.",
