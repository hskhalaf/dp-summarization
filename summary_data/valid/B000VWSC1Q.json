It has a bit of shimmer that gives you a nice glow. It's not super-creamy or oily, but more powdery and smooth. It's probably best for cheeks but I also like it on my lips for quick color.

Or even your eyelids! I'm blonde haired and blue eyed but I really think this would work for just about any complexion. Great product! I sent one to my mom, too. She loves it also.",

I put it on with my finger as I learned to do from a make-up artist - thus controlling the color intensity and placement. As I have oily skin, I sometimes put a touch of powered blusher over - but don't think this is necessary for those with normal skin.",
