      "text": "Not exactly as pictured in the seller's photo (because the seller's picture shows crystal disks above the crystal balls). It is beautiful even without the disks. Perfect size for any room. Love the LED lights with three settings: warm (yellowish light), bright (white light), and then the brightest setting which lights up both the warm and bright LEDs. Installed in bedroom and the fan was very quiet at night. Great customer service (prompt shipment and prompt reply by seller when I asked for instructions in installing the crystal balls).",

The rest of the crystals are all defects, either chipped or cracked or broken. The pins used to hang the crystals are flimsy little pins that made me very nervous that they wouldn't hold and that the crystals would fall or go flying when the fan was turned on.",

The fan had 3 settings and is very quiet and strong for that matter. I loved it so much I bought another one. If you're considering it, just buy it. It's sooooo worth it. Just make sure you're putting it in a big enough room or not one with low ceilings because it is very very bright. So amazing. I love it!",
