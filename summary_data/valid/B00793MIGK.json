      "text": "I am not an expert in blu ray players, everything seems to work well so far for me and I am happy with the price. However, I feel very silly I did not check but just assumed I would be able to watch Amazon VOD on this machine, older LG models have this capability but not this brand new one! Netflix and huluplus seem fine, but I am contemplating returning it because I do like Amazon prime as well and since I am a member I feel cheated not having that option on the TV hooked up to this blu ray player. So just be warned if you are an Amazon VOD user maybe skip this player :(",

For me, any player can play store disks, but I need something that can play avi/MKV files without tripping up. This one is flawless so far (about a month). One feature I really like is the ability to stream off my computer in the other room, onto the player through a network. I have it hard wired because I have a crappy wireless modem, but it runs very smoothly with the included software. Setup was intuitive, it all seemed pretty good to me and well worth the money for what I want.",

I haven't tried an actual Blu-Ray movie yet but will probably be impressed as I am with just the DVD's. I have always like LG as my smart phone is an LG. Will probably get a LG for my next TV.

Nearly all of the newest blu-ray players do not have analog audio output. My previous dvd player would freeze on worn discs, this player has not done that.
