The colors are vibrant, and last quite awhile. I've done dozens of looks and still have quite a bit of my paint left. (I use black and white most often, so I'm getting low on those lol). 4 of the containers are loose glitters. I didn't realize that at first. I thought they were glitter paints, but they aren't. Beautiful glitters though!! I constantly recommend Bobuggles to all the beauty groups I'm in. I would buy this again in a heart beat!! \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b",
