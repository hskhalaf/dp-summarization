NOTHING takes the pain away. However I place the unit on top of my shoulders (behind my neck) and it does relax my end stage osteoarthritis in my shoulders and neck. I use it everywhere that I can on my body as it helps with circulation and looses the muscles that seem tense. This is the BEST buy for me",

Besides the back snd hamstrings, the unit can be pressed against the IT band or glute in any chair with closed arms. As a therapist I appreciate that between heated or not rotations it changes directors. You can use flap for more or less pressure and lastly my favorite feature is the rolling pressure mechanisms are flatter and it doesn't bounce off and bruise your bones or ribs.

But I definitely wanted the cover pad because all of the massage rollers in all of the massagers eventually break through their mesh. Then, to extend the life of the massager, I usually have to wrap it in a towel. However, the pad cover is like a towel when the rollers eventually break through the mesh.

Just lean back and enjoy. Since I like my massages rough, I use it without the flap, and actually use the flap to help lower it behind me and position it. It's much more lightweight then I was expecting, which makes it that much better! So far it's the perfect little gadget.",

This massager fit the bill, with in days I've already used it sitting down on my back as well as laying in my bed for my neck and shoulders. It seems very well built and very soft material. I also loved that it is quiet enought to be using it while watching tv or someone sleeping next to you. Very impressed, thank you.",

This massage pillow is nice and plush and comfortable when you want some relief in the neck area. Have also used it on my calves and feet, so it's great for versatility. Bought one for me and one for my dad for Father's Day. He's been enjoying it too!",
