I changed it fully when I first got and a couple weeks ago and haven\u2019t had to charge it again yet since then. It also comes with its own long charging cable which is a nice touch. What I thought was weird is that it doesn\u2019t have the contacts on the inside so you can\u2019t use the micro usb on the controller itself to charge it. Instead it has its own charging port that much be used. Not a huge deal just something I thought was odd.",

This has caused me to be using the bracket standalone with my phone, rather than be able to sit back and game with it above the controller. This could be the reason they sell the rechargeable battery separate but they should make a version 2 and just make the cutout for the battery and I will give this a five star.",

It just gave up. Leaving me scrambling to find the charging cord. it lasted a little over 2 weeks with me playing about 1-2 hours at a time for about 3 days a week. I am still happy with the purchase just have to remember to keep the charging cord next to you when this happens. 3 days and still full charge battery is great! going to buy another for my second controller.",

Shape was a little weird to get used too but it isn\u2019t a big deal. Just sticks out a little further. Got used to it quick and barely notice it now. Would definitely buy again.",
