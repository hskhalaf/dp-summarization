Some reviews complain that the keyboard is fragile because it starts acting up if you spill food/water on it or drop it on the floor. Yes, that's probably correct. This isn't an oldschool AT mechanical keyboard that you can beat up and abuse. This is a high tech electronic device. Treat it well and you'll do fine.",

Turns out this is a well known issue with the K800, and is solved by replacing the batteries (at your expense) with a new set of rechargeable AA batteries. Works well now, but definitely not cool to have to spend $10 to fix a brand new $65 keyboard. Just remember to keep the old dead ones, because replacing the batteries yourself VOIDS THE WARRANTY. So by all means order yourself a dead keyboard that requires voiding the warranty to get it working. EDIT - keyboard died after 3 days even with new batteries.",

I'd rate Sleep Mode 5* for back light going off quickly when not actively using the keyboard, and coming back quickly when your hand nears the keyboard, but since the battery dies so quickly the sleep mode doesn't work well enough and so reduce rating.",

The latter was super cheap, it came with a mouse, but I can definitely say I will be using the K800 as my primary keyboard. Reasons: It's full sized and even the 10 key is spaced out. The front part of the keyboard also has kind of like a wrist pad, but plastic. The keys feels much more responsive too! The product's title says it's illuminated, but that wasn't my deciding factor to purchase this, but more for ergonomics. Would I recommend this keyboard? Most definitely!",

      "text": "I've been using this model keyboard for years. It is well made and will last several years of all day use, every day of the year before keys start to fail. It has a nice laptop type of key switch action, which is mechanical, average stroke, with a positive stop at the bottom.. It is very very quiet while typing, which is good if you type while talking on the phone, or type with others nearby. Logitech customer service is excellent and have replaced failed keyboards that were under warranty. It's pricey at $100, but I wait to buy them on sale. On the downside, it would be nicer if they lasted more than a two or three years.",
