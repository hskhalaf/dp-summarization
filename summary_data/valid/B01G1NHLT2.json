      "text": "I have been using these everyday since I purchased them. About 2 months. Pros : - audio quality -battery life is fantastic definitely as advertised -comfort -completly functional as advertised Cons: ( very picky issues ) - The plastic ear buds fall off and I've already lost about 6 of them. I have no idea how to stop this. Sometimes they fall when they hit my hoodie pull strings . - sometimes they rotate on my neck because the band is too wide , but this wideness also makes them more comfortable - sometimes there is static or odd connection, they work 95% of the time no problem though",

My only issue is the magnets that hold the ear bulbs are not strong enough to withstand the movement around shirt collars. Overall though this product is top notch especially around the battery life of the product and quality of the device for hearing and speaking to people on calls. They are crystal clear when listening to Music with rich sounds which was unexpected for the price. Definitely a deal for anyone seeking an item like this. I would and will buy again!",

But now the volume down button isn't responding which of course is not only the volume button, but also rewind. The buttons are also just frankly not obvious enough to feel. They are tiny, especially the volume down. It's just a tiny dash/ minus. I'm trying to see if Jabra will either take them back or replace them. We'll see how they respond. May update after that.",

It's too bad because I find them to be the best balance of sound quality, weight on the neck so it doesn't fall off and down your back, and battery life is excellent.

If they lowered the price to $19 I'd buy 4 and deal with it. There something wrong with these sadly and customer service at Jabra is horrible, slow, and just too many hoops to get to real help",

They also have a tendancy to slide off the back when in an office setting which is strange because when running they stay put. Sound and voice quality is acceptable.",

I would still buy it as it has so many great features! I also love the magnets to keep the ear buds in place when not in use! This is a great purchase!",
