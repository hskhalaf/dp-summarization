I contacted Garmin support and they said to get a replacement (which is easy in Amazon.) My second watch arrived and in a matter of hours the altimeter/barometer did not work again. Same issue with the elevation. I guess I'm returning my second watch. I've been saving my money for over a year for this watch and I get crap. I'm very disappointed. I guess I'll look to see what Suunto has to offer.",

Istalled HR sensor seems to be measuring my HR correctly (only slightly delayed displaying as it seems to me). Watch facing is slightly large for my wrist (i usually wear gloves size M), but i guess, i should live with that, if it was smaller, then obviously not as much data and options could be seen on a screen at the same time.",

      "text": "I wish I could say a little more about it but it was a gift for my husband who does several OCR races across the country. He requested this one im-particular for his needs. He says it's great and is still learning all of the ins and outs. Everyday he finds a new feature but and seems to be very pleased. Great for training. He said he was pleasantly surprised on the height of the watch and thought it would be much taller on his wrist than it actually is. Overall I think it was a successful purchase.",

My wife has a Fitbit Surge and the step counters don't really match up. I can't say that it's her watch or mine that's off. It's not by much, and for me, it's not really a major concern.",

    "description": "Configuration:New| Style:Fenix 3\n\nUNCOMPROMISING MULTISPORT TRAINING GPS WATCH\n * Stainless Steel EXO antenna with GPS + GLONASS support for fast fix and accuracy\n * 1.2-inch sunlight readable color Chroma display\n * Fitness training features like VO2 Max and Recovery Advisor (when used with a heart rate monitor\u00b9)\n * Outdoor navigation features like 3-axis compass, altimeter and barometer, TracBack and Sight\u2019n Go\n * Connect IQ compatibility for customized apps, widgets, watch faces and data fields\n\nf\u0113nix 3 is the rugged, capable and smart multisport training GPS watch. With feature sets for fitness training plus feature sets for outdoor navigation, f\u0113nix 3 is ready for any training activity and competition. Access to the Connect IQ platform allows customization of watch faces, data fields, widgets and activities. And, f\u0113nix 3 is a thin, light multisport training GPS that won\u2019t slow you down whether for training or every day use.\n\nSERIOUS STYLE THAT STANDS UP TO THE ROUGHEST CONDITIONS\nf\u0113nix 3 is available in 3 bold models: gray with high-strength, scratch resistant, crystal and black band; silver with red band; and the premium sapphire model with a stainless steel band and sapphire lens. Each watch features a protective stainless steel bezel and buttons, and reinforced housing for extra durability. A sunlight-visible high-resolution color Chroma display with LED backlight lets you access your data in any light. f\u0113nix 3 is water rated 100 meters and has a battery life of up to 50 hours in UltraTrac mode, 16 hours in GPS mode and up to 3 months in watch mode (all depending on settings).\n\nADVANCED FITNESS METRICS\nf\u0113nix 3 is packed with training features to tell you about your form and fitness. The first is the VO2 max estimator. When used with a heart rate monitor\u00b9, f\u0113nix 3 crunches data, including your running speed, beats per minute and heart rate variability to estimate the maximum volume of oxygen you can consume per minute. Track changes to your VO2 max to see your fitness gains and to compare with your peers. Other fitness metrics include recovery advisor with a recovery timer and recovery check, plus a Race Predictor, which estimates your ideal finish time based on your current VO2 max number.\n\nRUNNING DYNAMICS FEATURES\nf\u0113nix 3 incorporates sophisticated Garmin running watch feedback on your running form by reporting multiple metrics. When used with the HRM-Run monitor\u00b9, f\u0113nix 3 reports your cadence, vertical oscillation and ground contact time. These metrics are called running dynamics, and they affect your running economy.\n\nSWIM PROFILE AND SKI-BOARD MODE\nThe f\u0113nix 3 isn\u2019t just for running; special feature sets help swim training and skiing too. Borrowing from the Garmin Swim, f\u0113nix 3 tracks your distance, pace, stroke count and more. You just tell f\u0113nix 3 the size of the pool you\u2019re swimming in and begin your workout. Ski-board mode puts speed, distance, vertical drop and an automatic run counter (with Auto Pause for the lift line) and more at your fingertips. You can even use your f\u0113nix 3 as a glove-friendly remote, via ANT+, for the VIRB and VIRB Elite action cameras.\n\nNAVIGATE YOUR WAY\nNo other navigator GPS plus ABC (altimeter, barometer and compass) wristwatch offers you the combined training functions and our leading GPS technology. f\u0113nix 3 provides comprehensive navigation and tracking functionalities to guide you on and off the beaten track. Its built-in sensors provide information on heading, elevation and weather changes.\n\nIt records a GPS track log creating a \u201cbread crumb trail\u201d as you move. It also allows you to mark locations, such as a start/finish line, course checkpoint, or a campsite, vehicle or other point of interest. With f\u0113nix 3, you can create and follow courses, mark up to 1,000 locations and store up to 10,000 track points and navigate to them.\n\nPlan trips and share adventures with friends and family using BaseCamp. f\u0113nix is equipped with both ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart capabilities to wirelessly share locations, routes and geocaches.\n\nALTIMETER, BAROMETER AND COMPASS\n\n\nf\u0113nix 3 is equipped with ABC sensors to provide relevant real-time information. The built-in altimeter provides elevation data to accurately monitor ascent and descent, while the barometer can be used to predict weather changes by showing short-term trends in air pressure. The 3-axis electronic compass keeps your bearing whether you\u2019re moving or not.\n\nf\u0113nix 3 auto-calibrates its ABC sensors using its GPS receiver and also auto sets the time based on location. For an extremely accurate temperature reading, pair it with our tempe external temperature sensor.\n\nCONNECT IQ\nf\u0113nix 3 uses the ConnectIQ platform for specialized software so you can personalize your watch with apps, widgets, data fields and unique watch faces that make your Garmin smartwatch even smarter.\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\nSmart Notifications lets you receive emails, texts and alerts right on your watch, even if you're on the trail. f\u0113nix 3 receives the wireless signal from a compatible iPhone 4s or Android smartphone and let\u2019s you know you have a message, displaying the text on its own screen whenever you\u2019re ready to read it.\n\nIn the Box:\n\n * f\u0113nix 3 - gray watch with black band\n * USB charging/data cable\n * AC adapter\n * Quick start manual\n\n\n\n\u00b9Heart rate monitors and HRM-run, sold separately.\n\u00b2When paired with your iPhone 4S or later, Bluetooth or Bluetooth Smart Ready phones.
