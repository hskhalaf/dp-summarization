It\u2019s movable to where you want your nails to go(especially studs). It\u2019s light weight and portable. I could take the board off easily and put it back on. Cons: 1) As others have mentioned, markers and erasers that come with it are not that good. It\u2019s a freebie to start using right away. Hence, I am not reducing the ratings. Buy EXPO markers and erasers, you will be fine. 2) Instructions are not very clear. But, there is not much to depend on instructions. Overall, I am happy with purchase.",
