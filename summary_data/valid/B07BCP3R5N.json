      "text": "Bought one of these for my 4 yr olds birthday from a local store as a last minute gift. Sound didnt work, replacing batteries didnt help. So figured it had been played with to much on the shelf. Decided to order one from amazon. Same problem. This is a Hasbro problem. They have really came down in quality. Their toys are cheaply made. And they do not care about customer opinions. I recommend going with a different brand. Even if it's a few extra bucks. Quality matters. It will be worth it. Now I have a super sad 4 yr old. Shame on Hasbro.",

I have two other power movers; the dump truck and cement mixing truck both are pretty decent with the exception of the hub caps constantly coming off. But this excavator is terrible the rubber tracks constantly come off and hardly ever get enough traction to roll on any surface. The bucket arm handle can barely handle a small amount of sand it doesn\u2019t move with sand in it feels like the little handle is going to break off. I feel better materials should\u2019ve been used here. It\u2019s sad because Tonka used to be known for great quality toys.",

This could have been a very good review for many reasons but i guess we just have a bad one. This is a cool toy and i really liked the price but knowing what i know now I would have just spent more money on a nicer toy excavator. The worst thing is that the tracks roll fine when you spin them by hand. As soon as you try and roll it on the floor (marble,tile,area rug, hardwood) no matter the surface it doesn't roll.",
