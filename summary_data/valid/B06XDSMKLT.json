Also the direct connect feature does not work at all with Apple products. After trying for hours I just gave up. Finally, when it did connect, it took minutes for each page to download from my computer to the printer. Literally minutes. When finally downloaded it did print fine.",

What really impresses me about this one is (a) print quality is outstanding (b) the software setup on Windows10 was absolutely seamless, and (c) ease of networking printing. Everyone in the house can print from any machine - the printer shows up on the wireless LAN automatically. Any Windows or Chrome client can print wirelessly. I have had other brands where networking setup was really cumbersome. Not this one! Highly recommend.",

I always write reviews weeks/months/years after purchase. Happy with product so far.",

      "text": "I am in total awe with this laser printer. $300 is total worth for the printer. Bought it just over a week, and have been using for personal, school, and work. Print speed is fast, print quality for black is amazing, print quality for color is equal to a high end ink printer. I was skeptical when buying If the quality of color will be good or not. I am sold. My first laser printer, and proud of my choice :) If you thinking about buying, then I can only say is: Buy now. Stop thinking. You will not be disappointed.",
