      "text": "Excellent value. I spent months researching the perfect patio furniture. The brick and mortar stores were just over the top expensive; but most online purchases looked cheap with mediocre reviews. This hits the sweet spot. Not expensive; but not cheap. Most other online furniture come in about 100 pieces; which means more breaking points. This came in only one split up piece (couch was two pieces). Chairs were each one. The fabric was Sunbrella; which is usually pretty expensive. I had one couch cushion come crushed a bit; the company's customer service was extremely friendly and responsive. No long hold periods or run around. Agreed to ship me a new one immediately.",

The only assembly we had was to attach the back of the sofa to the bottom and that went smooth with no issues. Note: There may be little rubber bumpers covering where the screws/bolts go in. Just remove those to find where the units gets assembled together. At first the bumpers looked like they were actual bumpers to cushion the sofa bottom against the sofa bottom since there weren't bumpers on every one...but they pop off and you will find your opening for assembling with the screws/bolts.",

My only concern, is that perhaps the pillows are a little too soft, as when I get up they still look like someone is sitting in it. However, I enjoy sitting down in it and watching my kids swim. I have no real complaints. I feel the quality is appropriate for what I paid for it.",
