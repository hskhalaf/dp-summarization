I would suggest also, for those of you who have breakouts/acne issues on their back, or other parts of their body, to try this product as a body wash.",

Using this product 1 to 2 times a day would leave my skin irritated and dry and would sometimes peel layers off of my skin, especially around my eyes. And the product, seemingly, didn't do anything to prevent more acne from surfacing. A lot of people are writing positive reviews so maybe it works for them, but I didn't get that experience.",
