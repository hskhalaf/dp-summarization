This mold is a great size, completely round and a good thickness. I was worried if it wasn't sturdy enough that it might bend but it didn't. When it was time to push the cake through it slid right down with the help of the plastic paper shield that I had on there.",

Unlikely to deform further under normal use.",

They are good quality and were perfectly round. I ended up not using them because I found them to be a little large for my purposes, and I couldn't fit more than one in the fryer. Next year I will be getting the 6\" ones from this company though. Very pleased with the product.",
