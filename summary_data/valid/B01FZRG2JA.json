The shoe garnered quite the popularity from runners who search for a running shoe that offers responsible stability and control. Though a few have some issues with the shoe, it is still considered by some success a successful update to the Wave Inspire line.",

        "The AIRmesh is the fabric of the Inspire 12 and it offers breathable and comfortable coverage",

        "The Ortholite Sock Liner gives additional cushioning, moisture wicking and anti-microbial protection",
        "The U4ic is a mid-sole material that is shock absorption, durability, and responsiveness",
        "Moderate over-pronation of the foot is handled by the added mid-sole components, such as the Wave tech and the Smooth Ride system",
        "X10 is an outsole unit that is super durable and efficient when dealing with wear and abrasion",
        "The Wave Inspire 12 has systems that improve the natural flexibility of the foot"

I have flat feet so needed a supportive shoe & these are v comfortable, I run every day and have not had any injuries in them, no shin splints to which I have been prone in the past (& which I still get from other shoes). They're quite a fluorescent pink which is great for outdoors. They were a great price & excellent value, highly recommend",

The lacing is well placed to adjust for wider feet or swelling without losing support. The sole is durable and I have not noticed any stones or dips on the ground when wearing the trainers. With all the support and the thick sole you would expect these trainers to be heavy but to my surprise they are very lightweight. The stitching and overall construction are excellent and even with some intentional pulling around the seams there is no give or damage.",
