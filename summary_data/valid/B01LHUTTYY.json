The patches do in fact still say the company's name, which in my opinion is trashy and looks very unprofessional as a service dog team. I also would add that the print is grey against black and looks quite dull so reading is difficult. The handle placement is poorly thought out as it blocks a good portion of what your patches say. The patches are there to read, blocking them makes that difficult. The front size adjuster is also very difficult to use, I haven't quite figured it out yet, other than getting a fraction of an inch to move.",

As the straps on the vest are adjusted, the reflective side disappears leaving half of the vest displaying the pretty, reflective trim and half the vest as just a solid nylon strap. If both sides of the straps were reflective so that the stitching was continuous no matter how the vest was adjusted, I'd give it 5 stars.",
