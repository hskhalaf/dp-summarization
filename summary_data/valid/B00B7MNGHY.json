We use a few heavier pool toys to keep it in place, but I would have paid a few more dollars more to have it attached. The little boogie board is awesome and my 5 and 8 year old loved it!",

The sliding board eventually deflated and we had to patch it with the included patching tape but our girls had hours of fun in this slip n slide. We cleaned it and put it away for next Summer!",

Also, in the bottom where the water hose connects, it kept coming loose and water sprayed from the connector. The slide itself and the raft that comes with it were fine. It was fairly easy to blow the parts up with a manual pump (sold separately). Honestly, this was a little more trouble then it was worth but my son got a few hours of fun out if it so far this summer.",

As other people mention, the archway falls over constantly. That\u2019s where the hose attaches, so you need to use it in order for the slip n slide to work. All the manufacturer would have had to do would be to add weights to the bottom of each side of the arch. Definitely a poor design. If this had been $30, I\u2019d feel better about the purchase. But $55 is a lot for what you get.",

      "text": "Bad design. You need to prop the arch up with something and even then one sprayer points toward the slide while the other points up in the aid to the right and about 2 feet further than the slide. Yes I tried everything from low pressure to moving it around. No matter what, only 1 sprayer hits the slide and that is if the arch stays standing.",
