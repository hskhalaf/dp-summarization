      "text": "This is a nice drill. You can purchase other snap-in devices for it, like the impact driver, etc. It comes with the small battery, but there are bigger ones you can purchase, that fit it, if you need greater capacity. The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because it only has one speed. There is no fast/slow, high/low speed switch. The top speed of the drill bit might be a little slow, if you are looking for a really high speed drilling application. Other than that, great bang for the buck. It works great and the battery lasts a long time, even though it is the smallest one that fits that drill.",

But that's a rare extreme. Other than that it's not the strongest drill in the world but it gets the job done! I work apartment maintenance and it does everything I need it to. It will struggle a little with 3 inch wood screws in to a stud but it still gets it done. The impact attachment helps a lot. I highly recommend this as a budget general purpose drill!",

I lost the first one somewhere in my house and ended up getting this one because I still have a few attachments for the first one. I am happy to report that the attachments work and this is an even better drill since the addition of the rare earth magnet bit holder. Even ignoring a versatility of using non-drill attachments, this is an excellent unit for all around drilling (perhaps not hammer drilling). It has just the right amount of heft to it and the key-less chuck does not go bad with use.",

Luckily, I had recently owned a B&D cordless trimmer with a 20v battery. It has a lesser maH rating, but it still lasts quite a while between charges. Another thing - it has great torque, imo, but it doesn't seem to have as high rpms as other drills. Maybe it's me?",

I asked the community about using the 2.0 mAh in this drill and almost everyone said it might run hot using 2.0 batteries in this drill. Well, I can't help but wonder if they solved the over heating on the previous model but sending it with smaller mAh battery and raising the price about $15.",
