Our baby has really bad reflux so he actually sleeps in a lounger now and we use this wedge when we have to lay him down for drying after a bath. It works great because my baby would smile and play while we dry him up. Without the wedge he would feel miserable and after a few minutes he would have bug spit up. Once he is transitioned to the crib we would use this more.",

But it leaves a gap in between wedge and side of crib about 10 inches or so, so baby could roll to the side where there is a gap and get stuck. I would have liked it better if the wedge were wider. However, it does say you can use it under the mattress for best results. I just would rather put it on the outside under the fitted sheet.",

If your baby doesn't move at all, this item could work.. however, my son would move and shift during the night and end up perpendicular to how he was originally positioned. Because of the incline, I was worried he would get stuck in a way that wouldn't allow him to breathe. I wanted to like this item, but I would not recommend.",
