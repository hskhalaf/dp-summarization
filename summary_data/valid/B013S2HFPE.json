On the fourth use, (owned for one week) regular white bread went through a toast cycle and stuck in the down position. No amount of pushes on the \"cancel toast\" button worked it was permanently jammed. The warranty dept. is sending a new exchange unit, so time will tell. My thoughts are that if Kitchenaid can warranty this unit for 5 years it should be reliable; we will see!",
