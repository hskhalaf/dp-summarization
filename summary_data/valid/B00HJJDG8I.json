It has a black paint-like coating on every surface except the pad bearing surfaces to help prevent corrosion. Absolutely fit like a glove and zero pedal pulsation after install, Torqued my wheel lug nuts to the GM recommended 140 ft. lbs.each, using a torque wrench. This helps prevent rotor warpage, and also helps ensure you can get your wheel off in case of a flat tire!",
