For lefties, flat part of K by your left leg. Tip: handle height should be about the level of your wrist. Too low and you stoop. Too high and your arm is not optimal for body support (and will get tired).",

The color is a nice shade of lilac, which I think most women would like, though men might not find it very manly. It's sturdy and has worked well. I noticed that the cane is wrapped in a tight protective tube of plastic wrap which is not easy to remove, and you will probably need a young person with a certain amount of dexterity to peel it off. And you will need to peel it off in order to adjust the height of the cane. So be prepared to have someone help if you are an elderly person with limited dexterity or vision.",

The four pegs made this very stable - and the arm itself is adjustable for different heights - but the metal is very strong, yet light - which was perfect for my wife when she broke her leg. The handle is rubber - which was nice, but it might be better if it was foam. The rubber can make your hand hurt when you've used the cane a long time. Didn't really use the wrist strap, though it's nice to know it is there in case you are at risk of dropping this and are unable to squat to pick it up again.",
