My only complaint is that over time they do tend to stretch and lose their elasticity but still can be used. Also another complaint is that they tend to come up \"missing\" because other boaters like them so much as well!!!",

They are especially great for tying off to a T-Bar when stationary at a sand bar all day, as your boat can ride up and down with the waves and not pull all your anchorage off the bottom. Only down side is they tend to stretch a bit over a few years, and you may have to replace them if they lose elasticity or when the outer wound sheath starts to unravel. They come in a few various sizes t match your docking or mooring needs.",
