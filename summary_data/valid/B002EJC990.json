Also I did not think the cable attachments were bad quality either. People just like to complain! I have not one bad thing to say about this rack and I can't believe I went without it for so long.

Lat pull Cables have too much friction when moving on plastic pulleys, tried silicone oil already. The rectangular pipes bend when tightening the bolts/nuts during assembly speaking for sub-quality of material. Good for light exercises or kids play only. Cannot return now after assembly but will look for an upgrade soon (may be in 6 months). Do not recommend buying. Please do not repeat my mistake, invest now to buy better cage instead of upgrading in near term.",

The only problem I've encountered is with the cable pulls... if you're too close to it and don't have enough weight on, it can get twisted a bit. But other than that, no complaints at all.

I firmly believe this is the best value for the money on the market in power cages. It is the perfect cage for the home gym. The lat attachment is functional for pull downs and rows but the mechanism does seem to create a little friction and more resistance than a institutional lat machine. I highly recommend!",

The directions were a bit over simplified, it parses all the steps into four macro steps, where the lines overlap and it takes some organization to get it together, but I was able to build it solo. The only thing I don't like is the chin up bar grip is a bit to abrasive, way more so than the grips on an Olympic bar so I'm going to need to mask over it somehow because I lift barehanded.",
