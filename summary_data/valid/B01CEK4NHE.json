      "text": "Purchased this product (Panasonic RA41660 Electric Thermo Pot Water Boiler Dispenser) 4 months ago and after a month I noticed rust on the lid. My attempts to clean off the rust were unsuccessful. The problem continued to get worse and spread to the backside of the lid and even to the white plastic area. I contacted Panasonic hoping they could send me a replacement lid. The company has done nothing. I am very disappointed in Panasonic customer service and product quality. ` I finally contacted Amazon who stepped-in and issued my a partial refund. I'm in the process of trying to get a full refund of my purchase.",

I had to get a new one every couple of years due to rusting of the lids in the past. Won't be buying this brand again. The quality is worsening. Contacted Panasonic about the rusting parts to get a replacement, but they said these faulty parts are not cover under the 1 year warranty. I just have to buy a new thermo pot because they don't sell just the lid. I am disappointed with overall experience with Panasonic customer service.",

The Panasonic one had No bad plastic smell like some other China or Taiwan brand. the old ones I got did not have the coating like this, so one of them had calcium built up and i had to throw it away, it was impossible to clean it, and another brand from Taiwan had bad burnt metal and plastic smell after several years of use.",
