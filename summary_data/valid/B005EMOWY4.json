A wonderful feature is that they fold away for winter. These are heavy!",

They are a nice weight so probably won't blow around but are easy enough for one person to move. The arms are wide enough to hold a drink or a small plate without and additional table.",

There are only four pieces to assemble (six bolts). Should have been a piece of cake. But ended up taking two days. The first step was bolting the legs to the frame. Easy, right? Except the pre-drilled holes have no tolerance and must be exactly aligned. And a (mounted) fascia bracket prevents them from aligning. I had to file away 1/4\" to 1/2\" of material to make them fit. And then had to do it by feel, not by eye. I'll never buy another product from this manufacturer again.",
