The apps in the store were enough for me, and I loved putting PDFs of textbooks for school so I didn't have to lug then around everywhere. However within the past month the problem of \"phantom touch\" or \"ghost touch\" has popped up. Many other people have these problems, as I have found out online. I'm sad because this really was a wonderful tablet, but I will buy a new one from a different brand and hopefully it'll be as good as this one used to be.",

Windows RT is a different animal and takes some getting used to. For the price and my particular needs, this pad is great. If you need to run more hardware intense applications beyond internet and the preinstalled MS Office suite that comes with Windows RT, I recommend that you look at a higher end system.",

Microsoft offers applications that are not completely functional in that you wonder why the app only does part of a job, or in some cases seem almost useless. This is a problem with Microsoft, however, and not with the product which does perform great when Windows isn't hanging it up. I really do like it for the convenience and the nice display.",

I do experience some weird sporadic \"sleep\" habits, but maybe that's just my inability to understand the power settings for tablet-type devices.

Regarding the free keyboard, ASUS customer service was super responsive to my questions and the keyboard dock itself arrived in about a week's time. WinRT is nice but has a ways to go before it can seriously compete with iOS and Android. MS Office may not be enough for most people to keep them from selecting a competing tab. With the Nexus 10 having superior specs and priced at $399, most RT tabs seem painfully overpriced for what's currently offered. Microsoft gets a C+ for RT and Asus gets an A for hardware and customer service.",

While Windows 8 is awful on a desktop (or even notebook) PC, it absolutely shines on a tablet. It's unfortunate that more developers haven't created apps to support RT. Pros: - Windows RT is a very good OS for a *tablet* - Hardware is thin and light and feels solid overall - Micro SD slot for storing movies, music, etc. Cons: - Occasionally crashes when coming out of sleep - Lack of quality apps in app store",

Then you have to look for somewhere to store the keyboard being that there's no applicable case in the market that will accommodate both. And the Windows 8 RT really sucks!

The apps from the Microsoft Store does not compare to those from Apple and Google. Hopefully Microsoft will resolve this matter quickly. And to the day, I purchased this tablet a month ago for $479. Now Amazon is selling it for $377. I'm a little disgruntled about paying a hundred dollars more, but I know that's how technology retail work sometimes.

It is good for common tasks like email and web surfing, but the apps are limited. the MS store needs more apps, games etc. The design of the tablet is flawless, except for the charging cable, in my opinion it should be a standard Micro USB. Instead ASUS uses a proprietary connector, so you can't leave the cable at home. Tablet has the habit of going unresponsive, it doesnt happen often, but it happens more frequently than I expect. Battery life and screen resolution good. Bottom line, for the price, a good solid tablet.",
