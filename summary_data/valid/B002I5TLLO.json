      "text": "So glad we purchased this birdbath - 4 years ago. Happy to see they are still available. Ours is in great shape. The best thing is it is lightweight and easy to clean. Ceramic and glass birdbaths easily get broken on windy days from falling limbs, etc. This holds up. The patina changes over time, but still looks great. It balances on the unique metal stand so you have to set it just right, but it stays put. If it got knocked off, it wouldn't break. We keep a rock in our birdbaths to give birds a little perch, as you can see in the photo.",

      "text": "This is a nice-looking bath, even though the \"twig\" stake is just bent iron...use your imagination and it looks twiggy enough, I suppose. It's easy to put together and surprisingly stable. However, \"my\" birds will not bathe in it. They will drink from it, but will not bathe, whether because of the slippery sides, the shiny metal, or whatever, I don't know. I had to get a stone bird bath, which they love to bathe in. I kept this one, too, because it looks nice and they do drink from it. But my advice would be to just put the money up front for a good stone bath--won't break in winter and birds prefer the stone surface.",

I've placed it right by the spigot so it will be easy to fill. I figure a little fresh water everyday is the least I can do for these lovely creatures. Seems very well made and came almost assembled, just one easy piece to move into place. The copper bowl is a good size and sits very stably in the base. I don't expect to have any problems with tipping.",

Copper is naturally germicidal and will keep insect larvae and algae under control if it can dissolve into the water. Now I need to dose copper into the bird bath to accomplish this goal...",

My only disappointment has nothing to do with the birdbath itself. Its diameter is too small for floating solar fountains; the slightest breeze blows the spraying water outside of the birdbath, and obviously the fountain mechanism cannot function when the water is gone! So if you're getting a solar fountain, you'll need a birdbath with a considerably wider diameter.",

My husband said that it was obvious that the inner box that held the copper birdbath had been repacked, so it should have been replaced before it was sent to us.
