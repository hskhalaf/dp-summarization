It doesn\u2019t have acro as promised but I am told a firmware update will be coming to fix this and the ability to self tune to your liking. That will put this ready to fly out of the box sport racer over the top! I simply love this thing and the flight time is very reasonable! Give a thumbs up if you found my review helpful. I will add video and pictures later. Thanks",

      "text": "It\u2019s ok, the flight time is wayyyy short and it\u2019s pretty fast, but I would not consider it a racing drone. Acro mode stinks and uncontrollable. The price is a bit high. But it\u2019s pretty stable in angle mode is prob the best thing about it. I\u2019m just not getting very long flight time out of either battery. The remote chews through AA batteries also. If you have any kind of 3s or above racing drone you will not be satisfied with this bird. I don\u2019t really use it for vids or photos. So I can\u2019t judge it on that.",

Maybe I will co tact Hubsanus and see what they say. I hear the customer service is not that great but I'll give it a try!",
