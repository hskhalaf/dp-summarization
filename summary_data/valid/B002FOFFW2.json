First glass is cloudy and hazy after about three hand washes. I have used it to hold wine, water, and fizzy vitamin tablets (Airborne Vitamins). In addition to being too flexible and thin, which I cannot understand how folks think that is cool or good in any way (I was open minded until now) they are just not a good product. Not that great elsewhere if you only want to buy once or buy these and replace them like I am going to do.",

ALL OF THEM. Then I ordered more. They're small (well, 12 oz of wine ....), the have a lovely little finger holder and they're unbreakable (important in my house). I love them. BUT they're not QUITE dishwasher safe. They lose their nice round rim. Obviously I still drink out of them, but I'd personally say hand wash them and don't squish them in your strainer between other things.",

Do not use any abrasive wash cloth, I use soap and water with my hand to prevent scratches. Cold beverages only. Great for parties where the possibility of the glass being dropped and no worry of breakage. I would buy again. But the price on these glasses fluctuate somewhat so monitor the price.

It's just not apparent at all that they are meant to be reused, particularly since they say \"recycle\" on them.

They are nice enough to serve wine in at dinner and then have guests take outside to enjoy a drink by the pool. I have been hand washing these after reading reviews about them becoming spotty in the dishwasher. I accidentally placed a couple in the dishwasher one night and was pleasantly surprised when I took them out and found them crystal clear. I use Cascade and a rinse agent. Not sure if that had anything to do with it, but I now put them in the dishwasher. Would recommend to anyone!",

      "title": "Excellent worryproof wine glass!",
      "text": "We were introduced to these glasses at the Coppola winery in Sonoma, which has a pool and serves all its poolside drinks out of Govino glasses. For an inexpensive plastic vessel, the glass has a very refined feel with a nice thin edge and a great shape for many wines. And if you have small kids or clumsy pets or like to BBQ or have a pool, these are perfect. We actually use them all the time for wine and beer because they're so easy to wash and fun to use -- our fine Austrian wine glasses are getting lonely!",

I have always hated drinking wine out of plastic, but for some reason these plastic glasses do not affect the wine drinking experience. I packed them in a huge suitcase by stuffing socks in them and cushioned them around my clothing and they traveled perfectly. They would be great for camping, boating and picnicking. Now my friend is going to by them for her trailer. Hand wash only. Why would someone put this glass in the dishwasher? It was obvious to me that they would not withstand the heat of a dishwasher.",
