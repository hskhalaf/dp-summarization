      "title": "Great Gift",
      "text": "Bought this as a gift for a 13 year old who had never rode a bike before and we successfully taught him how to ride on this. Looks like it will last long and it\u2019s nice and lightweight with good tires. Because it\u2019s a race bike it comes with a plastic seat that you will need to upgrade for comfort if not using for racing specifically. It also doesn\u2019t come with a kickstand but all in all still a great product.",

I went out an ordered a $40 bike seat only to find upon arrival that it doesn't fit. My 10-year-old has had this bike for 3 weeks now as we are trying to figure it all out and it's unrideable. In addition, there's no kickstand. Aren't these pieces STANDARD for a bicycle??",
