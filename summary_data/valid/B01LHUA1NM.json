I am a student and I already have to carry many papers and notebooks in my backpack so every extra pound really makes a difference. It's also quite powerful for its size! I don't think you could run high demand video games on it or anything, but all the basic stuff (word, powerpoint, internet, photoshop, etc.) functions perfectly and quickly. The SSD and RAM size is unbelievable for how small this laptop is. Bonus: the keyboard is backlit!!! So helpful in those dimly lit classrooms. This product is most certainly worth the price and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic purposes.",

The battery lasts me around 6-7hrs with intensive browsing, music streaming plus a movie or similar. 2 negative sides: - the US bundle doesn't come with the USB-C hub (unlike other bundles I've seen online). - My space bar doesn't respond very well on the 1/3 right side. It is rather inconvenient for typing. I might have to get it fixed. I do recommend it for anyone looking for a laptop to carry around (students, professionals, travelers). PS: the grey color is darker than in most pictures (positive)",
