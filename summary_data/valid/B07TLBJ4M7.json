    "description": "Entsport Story: \nMy grandpa has been fishing more than 70 years. Fishing is a way of life. He had a rod in his hands almost since he could walk. In his early days, he had to find old broken tackle and tried to fix it up so that he could use it. Perhaps because of this history, he learned to love good fishing products. That has not changed over his life, my father\u2019s life and mine. We love to fish, and we love good gear.\nHowever, the most fishing rods in the market are not quality controlled and uniform from one item to the next. Only some big companies can provide great products, but too expensive. So we are determined to develop the unique and qualified fishing tackle at an affordable price.\nOur Brand \u201cEntsport\u201d comes from our three beliefs about fishing: Enjoy, Neverending, Technology. So we divide our products into three series: \nE Series: High quality products that are affordable for any fisherman. \nN Series: Premium products represent that entsport's explore to quality will never end.\nT Series: Super products focus on the technology and provide the best fishing experience! \n\nEntsport Service: \nEvery product from Entsport has one year warranty. If there is any problem about the quality, please feel free to contact with us by email. We will give you a satisfied solution within 12 hours, as we always stand by our product and provide the best service. \n\nSpecification:\nMaterial: Carbon\nLength: 7\u2019\nPieces: 2\nGuides: 6+1\nLure weight: 1/8-3/4oz\nLine weight: 6-20lbs\n\nThe Package Includes:\n1 x Fishing Rod\n1 x Fishing Rod Protective Bag",
