I will probably replace with a can that uses a metal bar rather than plastic. May consider this if your garbage collector uses a lift. If not, then this is a great product.",

When we put it out for pick up we use a bungie(sp) cord to prevent the lid (it is pretty light) from blowing open. We attach the hook on the cord at the back hinge going over the lid to the front handle and it works perfectly. My mom saw ours and ordered one for herself.",
