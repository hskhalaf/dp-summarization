Its a push eject (rather than just pulling the card out) and this also gives it a quality feel. If you are going to spend lots of money on a good camera and an expensive XQD card - why spend the minimum on a card reader. I think I spent 27 quid which is much more than any SD card reader I ever bought - but well worth it.",
