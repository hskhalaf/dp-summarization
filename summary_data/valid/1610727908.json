Not only is it a review of the subjects on the PSAT, but it also gives test taking tips that may or may not be common sense for students. It is very helpful that it gives explanations of the correct answers, and information on how wrong answers, or no answers, are scored. What I also like is information on what the PSAT score means and which school year's PSAT score qualifies for National Merit. My child will be taking the PSAT in 4 months. That result will be a good indication of this study guide.",
