If you turn it over, the chair arm bends the plug in an awkward position. If I hang it over the back of the chair, I can't easily reach the controller.

I will definitely be spoiled now won't want any other brand/type now. I've owned 6 or 7 heating pads through years This is indeed the best of the bunch",

However, I am used to much more heat then this puts out. The highest setting is about what low would've been on my old one. I understand that they have to be careful of someone getting burned, but I want a heating pad that is so hot I can actually get pain relief. So, it's ok, I'll keep it, but it isnt stellar.",
