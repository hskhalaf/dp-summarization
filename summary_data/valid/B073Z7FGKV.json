Because the device that \u201cneeds no drivers or software\u201d actually has the wrong driver and will NOT work with Windows 10. I ordered 2. Instead of wasting any more time on this, I\u2019ll thump both into my \u201cDrawer of Failures\u201d and move on. Recommend you do NOT even consider this one.",
