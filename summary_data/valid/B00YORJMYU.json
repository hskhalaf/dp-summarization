So I carefully opened the top seal and filtered the liquid through a old second hand ceramic water filter (takes about 24 hours). This cleared it and now it is beautiful. I also changed the plug and the globe to 220volt as used in our country. None of these issues are manufacturing faults and I am grateful that they were willing to ship to South Africa. Fantastic product!",

Throw it on an Alexa plug to make it voice controlled and your kids will love it! 100 watt bulb included and it takes about 4-hours to flow properly. Worth the wait! That\u2019s where the Alexa plug shines... you can set up a routine to turn it on in advance of when you want it flowing, and to turn it off so you don\u2019t forget and run it longer than recommended. Going to buy another in purple and yellow/orange for my other son soon.",

      "text": "We were surprised by the great difference between the 27-inch and 14-inch versions of the lava lamp. Of course, the 27-inch lava lamp is considerably larger than its smaller cousin. We were expecting that. What surprised us is that the lava flows of the 27-inch lamp are much more dynamic, varied, and visually striking to the eye. You can watch multiple strands and globes of lava going up and down all at once instead of just one sluggish lava ball rising at a time. But you have to be patient. It does take a full 4-5 hours for the lava to heat up and flow in this mesmerizing manner with the larger lamp. Trust us, it is worth the wait.",

Mine is clear, the glass is nice and smooth and it works perfectly. Took about 6 hours to heat up the first time and now I\u2019d say it\u2019s taking about 5 hours.

It took a while to heat up at first- I was concerned I had a dud for maybe 20-30 minutes but once it kicked off it's been working perfectly since. We've had it over a week now and love it.

Just be aware if you want this for your oh-so-70's evening party, you had better switch it on around lunchtime. Aside from that it is a beautiful product and I hope it lasts for years, like the smaller one it replaced.",

Replacement bulb was $10 we will get it on Saturday. Hopefully that\u2019s the only thing wrong with this product because the size is impressive and it seems to be sturdy built. Do wish this company would improve their packaging though.",

The \"blobs\" are all different sizes and shapes. I did good. I am enjoying it more than I expected. It replaced one much smaller. I don't know how I've lived without it. A+++++ Buy it.

So far the service from Amazon has been amazing. You can't blame them for shipping issues.",

It has an extra-long period when the wax breaks out and then solidifies into freaky shapes, which is one of my favorite parts. Once it's rolling, it works great. Buy a few extra bulbs: the one that came with it lasted about 8 months with almost-daily usage. It's big and it's heavy, so be sure to put it on a very stable surface (not one to put on top of the speakers).",

Buy them for sure and take 2 minutes to read over the booklet...I highly recommend them!!!!",

I love this one so much that I bought another one, the purple and pink one...hoping that one runs just as well!",

While you can see the formations and the wax moving it is not nearly enough contrast. This is an expensive gift that is just not acceptable. I really am disappointed with the way it arrived also. The base has a dent in it. Overall, considering the coloring and the dented base I would not recommend this product.",

Since I have mine at work - I only get to enjoy the flowing lava for a couple of hours before its home time. Still it's worth it. Mine arrived in perfect condition - minus the light bulb which was broken...that was a nuisance to replace but overall this unit a great lava lamp. Works as advertised !",

Gotta remember this thing is getting thrown around and shopmen up during shipping. Be patient and it will be cloudy free. Also, keep in mind the wax takes a very long time to warm up. Mine takes about five hours. I suggest putting it on a timer and have it turn on long before you come home so you can enjoy the groovy action of this awesome lamp!",

So to start with I lowered the lamp socket in the base until the globe set on the base and not on the bulb. Then I ordered a goo kit from Magma Tower and installed it. Now I have a beautiful lava lamp that I am proud to display in my living room.",
