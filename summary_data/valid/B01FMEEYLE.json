I found that when feeding an infant who doesn't have good head control, it is difficult to get them to latch because you can't see what you are doing unless you stick your head in the scarf as well. It's better to use a cover that allows you to see what you are doing while staying covered",

This product is so much easier because it has just enough room for you and baby, and it\u2019s clear where you both should be, unlike using a blanket. It\u2019s also stretchy, which is nice for nursing on the go.

Because it serves both purposes, it is one less thing you have to put in a diaper back. I also loved the colors of this. Unfortunately, the material creates a very warm space which does not work for someone living in warm weather. If they made this color in a cotton material, I would be sold. Just keep in mind the material when purchasing and if that works, it will work great.",
