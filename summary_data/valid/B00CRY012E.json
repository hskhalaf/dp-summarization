      "text": "We purchased 6 of these tablets. The day I tried to set them up 1 blue screened and had to be exchanged and another lost the connection to the mouse and keyboard and I was unable to reconnect them. A day later a second one blue screened and could not be restored and had to be replaced as well. Now just over a week after the original purchase a third one has a blue screen and is asking for the recovery disks.",
