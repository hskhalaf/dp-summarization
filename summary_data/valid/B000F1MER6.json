What a complete waste of money; they are useless with cold drinks as they stick to the bottom of the glass when you pick it up. The first night I used them when I had dinner guests over, was a comedy sketch due to the ineffectiveness of the coasters... Perfectly fine for hot drinks, but not for iced beverages that condensate.",

The only way I could use them was to cover them in a napkin so they didn't stick, kind of defeats the purpose of a coaster right? If that wasn't enough, after one day of use they already look like s***. Apparently these were only designed for setting things on them that dont require coasters in the first place.",

Only details are 3 shallow rings cut into the tops. But I do like the bamboo.",
