Among the options from Optima was to have it tested at O'Rielly auto parts.

      "text": "Had to jumpstart my car 3-4 times since installing it a few months ago, which could be due to the longlasting cold. Overall though, I am grateful my car has a new battery and it seems to be running fairly smoothly. UPDATE: 1 year later, this battery seems to be failing already. This winter seems to be getting to the battery even more and now the car battery is dead after just having a jumpstart on Tuesday. This is super frustrating, especially after the mechanic told me this was a top of the line battery and that it shouldn't be having this problem. My previous car battery lasted for almost 10 years. This is unacceptable.",

Have 4 of these batteries in German and Japanese cars and occasionally they won't hold charge. One or two were replaced by Auto Zone also without any problems. They are able to be deeply discharged and will come back to life once charged. I've used Ctek charger before but find Optima charger to be better judging by the time battery holds charge. Amazon gets 5 stars for customer service!",
