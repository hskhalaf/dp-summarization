However, the design and engineering are very poor because the shaving head has to be removed each time one wishes to attach the side burn clipper. This is a nuisance because it is difficult to align the slot on the shave with the slot on the shaving head and the instructions say not to twist the shaver head. Instead of making things easier, Norelco made things harder and from what I can see, when it's time to change the blades, it's not an easy process of just snapping on a new razor head.

The head is flimsy and after only a few months of use one of the blades will not stay locked in - it comes out on every shave. Also the side burns trimmer is a separate so you have to take of the head and put it on - what a pain. I liked the old Norelco's, so after my Braun wore out I thought why not try a new one - MISTAKE. Going back to Braun. I do not recommend it",
