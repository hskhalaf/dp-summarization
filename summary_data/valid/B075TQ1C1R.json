The structure is built very well and in a way so that kids cannot completely disassemble the entire structure. I was impressed that the screws stay in the plastic so they do not get lost, and it came with extras. One problem we did was was the drill arrived broken, but a quick email into Little Tykes and they shipped us a replacement at no cost and included an extra screw driver (no more fighting kids!).",

We put some furniture in there, Disney Lightning McQueen upholstered chair with matching foot rest and he just enjoys sitting in his spacious beautiful house playing his IPad.
