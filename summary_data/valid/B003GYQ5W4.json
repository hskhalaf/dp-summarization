Lesson learned: I gave slightly oversize dimensions and lower radius corners to be sure the cover was big enough and I now have a cover that is slightly oversized with slightly sharper corners than the spa. No big deal. You probably don't have to err on the big side more than perhaps 1/4 inch.",

From Beyond Nice, for the same price we got a thicker cover, and double wrapped to help prevent/delay waterlogging, and a 5 year warrantee. A better deal.

With the new cover is is staying 102 degrees while using the same amount of energy. This product is highly recommended. Note that I ordered the 5 mil water barrier and the continous hinge seal - it seemed like a worthwhile investment for a cover that I expect to last 5-8 years.",

It's a good cover, although one corner sits about 1 inch above the tub as if it's a tad warped. Not sure whether the other reviews are legit but this one is.",

You need to convince prospective customers that your process for ordering a custom cover really works best. I did not understand why I couldn't simply tell you the make and model of my Hot Tub and expect it to fit. I now understand what you mean when you say in your web site that you build it to the exact dimensions that the customer orders. Thanks for a quality product! Maury F. (Michigan)",

I did my homework before I purchased this and I made the right choice buying from them. Just an all-around good company to deal with!!!!!!!",
