As it turns out, inflation is really easy, and takes just a minute or two! I'm very impressed with everything about this unit, especially for the price. Together with the Onyx M-16 PFD and an ultralight 4 piece paddle, the entire setup fits in a little day backpack. Perfect for my short morning outings to the local county lake and state park creek.",

I can't believe any pro contributed to this design. it doesn't track at all. It is not supportive nor is it ergonomically comfortable. the only good that came from this purchase was Amazon taking care of customer service afterward. it's not worth $10 !",

I was lucky to buy this for $100/ea. It took 20 cycles with the included dry/bag to inflate the raft. It easily deflates on its own, if left be. Also makes a great mattress when ashore (be certain there are no pointy bits underneath).",

      "text": "Bought this and the kids hiked with it up to some high mountain lakes. Pumps up fast, very stable, light enough for backpacking, and durable enough to have some fun on calm lakes. Also purchased a backpacking kayak paddle with it -- highly recommended accessory. Hours and hours of fun on a remote lake. They had a great time and would definitely do it again.",
