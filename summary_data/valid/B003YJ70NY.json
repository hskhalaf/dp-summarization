The Popular is mostly plastic and much, much lighter than the AS-D2. It's also $10-20, while the AS-D2 is $175-200. For me the shave is remarkably similar. A truly enjoyable razor that delivers and excellent shave. I use feather Hi-Stainless blades exclusively in both and highly recommend the combination.",

      "text": "I own the much more expensive Feather AS-D2 razor (among many other razors) and love it, but thought this one might be nice for travel. It seems to be a nice mild razor and decently made for the price. The TTO works well enough and it's a bit light, but shaves nicely enough. I have a fairly thick beard, but with a sharp blade and several passes this gets the job done nicely. Not as special as the AS -D2, but for about 1/10th the price it's nice enough.",

I am able to loosely adjust the aggressiveness of the shave by changing the angle of the blade on the razor. I experience less irritation from my shaving since switching from cartridge razors. I use a good shaving soap, as long as I shave mindfully I suffer few cuts. I certainly recommend this product to other budding double edged razor enthusiasts.",

If you're accustomed to using a heavier razor, this one may take a little getting used to. This replaces my travel razor (a Rimei, i think), and I also think it's a good, cheap razor to learn wet shaving.",

So I decided to purchase something for everyday use and came across the Feather. I am amazed with its ease and quality. What's really shocking is how awesome it cuts. I may be critized by saying this but for the price this razor bets my Futur hands down! The cut is close and nick-free. I wish I would have purchased this first!!!",
