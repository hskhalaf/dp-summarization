The one bummer is that the cubbies are a little too small for shoes with big heels. It does have the ability to leave out some shelves in order to fit taller boots, tho. It\u2019s just that the width leaves something to be desired. Still perfect for what I needed, but if you have more space and want something to fit all varieties of shoes, you may want to get something a bit larger.",

One comment, when inserting the inner set of slats (11 small pieces, and a couple of long ones), fit the slats together, but instead of trying to put the whole thing in horizontally on the ground, it worked much better to lift the outer frame, and insert the constructed slats vertically. When horizontal, the slats would slide apart. So vertical worked best for me. Great value for the money. Wife loves it.",

It looked nice but definitely not practical and especially for the amount i paid for it. Very dissapointed with this purchase.",
