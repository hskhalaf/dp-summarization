The only issue is that there is a gap in the seal between my head and liner in the back that causes wind noise. Didn't get around to fixing it cause a little after I bought it I went down. Pretty serious accident with front end damage on my bike and injuries to me but no head damage or injuries and never lost consciousness. So A+ on saving my life.",

But this is my first \"budget\" helmet, and I am impressed. As comfortable as any other Shoe I've owned, but for less the money. I would give this helmet five stars if they used the same strap buckle that they use on their modular helmets. This archaic D-ring is and always has been a bit of a pain--and forget trying to secure the strap with gloves on. A quick release ratchet device should be incorporated. And Arai needs to know, too.",

E.Q.R.S.
