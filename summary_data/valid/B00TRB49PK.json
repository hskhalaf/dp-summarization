For those saying that the liquid is clear and free of bubbles, all 7 of the compasses I received do not bend a laser beam. I can't believe that the liquid does not have an index of refraction. The clear circle does not have any magnification. Otherwise It looks exactly as pictured Finally got a chance to talk to an eagle scout. He told me that mine were definitely not liquid filled. The needle bounces all over while walking. The purpose of the liquid is to minimize that. I'm sending mine back to amazon.",

Night navigation should not need light to make it glow since you either use a flashlight (ruin night vision) or best red light source.",
