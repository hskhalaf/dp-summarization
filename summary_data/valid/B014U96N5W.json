      "text": "So far I have only worn this neck warmer twice but I love it already. I wore it on a day I was outside for 5 1/2 hours at a barn in 20 degree weather with a steady wind. My neck and face stayed warm though those long hours. The second time was in 40 degree weather - I folded up the neck warmer so that it wasn't so warm on my neck and that was perfect too. A great addition to my active winter gear! It fits my (adult) neck perfectly: loose but tight enough to keep my neck warm.",

Lightweight, have worn it several times for running during cold weather; didn't even feel it on but it kept the cold wind off my neck. Used it also on a chilly day with a cold breeze and pulled it up to breath through a couple of times and it worked great! Really cut through the cold and gave me some much needed warm breaths. This could easily be worn as an ear warmer but I haven't used it that way yet. Very comfortable and it's nice to have something lightweight to keep the neck warm. Would highly recommend!",

Cons: There are 2 seams in the patterned fabric, but only one on the plain black fleece, which seems minor but is REALLY annoying aesthetically. If going for the convenience of not worrying about what is front/back, this fails. Suggestion: Either remove the extra seem, or redesign for a definitive front and back. Add a decorative tag to the front or back hem and/or make the front a little longer so it's not just a tube.",

But it's too large for my head (I think my head/face generally is just smaller than most people's) so it doesn't stay on around my ears and mouth. I'd have to tuck my chin down toward my neck to keep it from sliding down which was annoying when walking to school. Definitely keeps neck warm though!",

The weather in my neck of the woods has been pretty chilly and walking the dogs requires me to wear \"full body armor\" to protect myself against the wind and the chill. This warmer is perfect! Not only great colors, but not too bulky and yet super warm. The soft fleece lining on the inside is like snuggling into your favorite throw. The price is right, so don't hesitate, you're gonna love it on or off the ski slope.",
