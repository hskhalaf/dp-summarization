I wanted a bar that would be good for quick eating while nursing and on the go and these do the trick! They have a lot of protein and taste delicious. They have an excellent chocolate mint flavor and great consistency. The white part flakes off a little, so you have to be careful in the car not to stain clothing, but it's well worth it. I'll even eat half as a little chocolate treat. I figure it's healthier than a chocolate bar and just as satisfying!",
