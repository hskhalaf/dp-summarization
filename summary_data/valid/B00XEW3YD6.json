      "text": "I have been using the Eero system for seven months. It appears that it is fine for providing a Wi-Fi network, but it has issues as a router. If the Internet connection is lost, and the system is rebooted, it loses all routing capability and the internal LAN is rendered useless. This is unacceptable for a router. Additionally, In a complex network with many devices connected at one time, devices get dropped periodically for no apparent reason. Because of these issues I now use a standalone Araknis router and use the Eeros in bridge mode as access points only. This system is way too expensive to require a separate router.",

In the past, I have had slow wireless coverage in the upstairs area, eero's able to extend the coverage in a noticeable manner.

    "title": "eero Home WiFi System (Individual) - 1st Generation, 2016",
    "description": "Style:Individual\n\n\n\neero is the world\u2019s first whole home WiFi system. A set of three eeros covers the typical home. They work in perfect unison to deliver hyper-fast, super-stable WiFi to every square foot. Stream video, get work done, or swipe right in any room \u2014 not just next to your router. It\u2019s simple to set up. Easy to manage. And gets better over time with new features and improved performance. Finally. WiFi that actually works. \n\n eero is powered by TrueMesh, the software and mesh routing algorithm at the core of the product. It\u2019s the next generation of wireless mesh technology, custom-built from the ground up to work perfectly with eero. Taking full advantage of the hardware, it means that your WiFi is not only fast and resilient, but also intelligently adapts to your home.\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nThe one router model isn't working \n\nRelying on a single router is like asking a loud speaker in your living room to provide great sound throughout your home. It\u2019s simple physics: WiFi waves don\u2019t go through walls well and have an even harder time climbing stairs? Ever tried to stream a show from your bedroom when your router\u2019s in the office downstairs? It\u2019s a buffering nightmare. \n\nTo solve this, you need multiple access points \u2014 devices that broadcast WiFi \u2014 distributed throughout your home. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll find in office buildings, both big and small. But these solutions are out of reach for most of us, and all we\u2019re left with is a band-aid solution: range \u201cextenders,\u201d which don\u2019t live up to their name.\n\n\n\nIt takes a system \n\nWith eero, you simply plug one device into your modem. Additional eeros only need power from a standard outlet. Powered by TrueMesh, they automatically connect to each other to create a single wireless mesh network that covers your whole home. If you already have Ethernet wiring, you can always choose to hardwire your additional eeros.\n\nThree eeros cover the typical home. You can start with one and eero-up depending on the size of your space. You already pay for high-speed Internet \u2014 isn\u2019t it time to get what you\u2019ve paid for in every corner of your home?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper-simple setup Easier to set up than almost any other gadget in your home, eero is truly frustration-free WiFi. The simple mobile app helps you get your network up and running in minutes.\n\nEasy to manage Manage your entire WiFi network from a simple, intuitive app. See which devices are connected and the speeds you\u2019re clocking. \n\nStays new, gets better Automatic software updates that bring new features happen overnight and only take a minute.
