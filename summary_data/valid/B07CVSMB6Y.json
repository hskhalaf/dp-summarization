      "verdict": "Under Armour adds a ready-to-wear everyday casual kick into its lifestyle sneaker catalog, the Street Encounter. This low-top variety is built with a lightweight canvas cover that expands and compresses easily according to the desires of the feet.Its simple fa\u00e7ade cannot be underestimated as many consumers find it comfortable on feet. Some may have thought that its shoelaces lack springiness or its outsole short of traction, but many are drawn to its easy-to-wear and easy to style silhouette which comes at an affordable price tag.",
      "pros": [
        "Plenty of buyers said that this is a lightweight sneaker that\u2019s ideal for multiple lifestyle uses",

        "A tester tried walking around and sprinting with this shoe had no negative comments about comfort and fit",
        "One commentator mentioned it is ridiculously comfortable",
        "Lots of reviewers commended the quality and manner by which this shoe was assembled",
        "Satisfied wearers are recommending this style to other potential users",
        "A purchaser mentioned that this is a solid product appropriate for everyday wear",
        "Many claimed that with its good looks and comfort it is definitely worth its value",
        "Few buyers stated that the UA Street Encounter is the best sneaker they purchased",
        "A couple of users wear this shoe under their tailored suits for work",
        "Some buyers went for this shoe for its simple design"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some reviewers had to return this shoe as it felt half size smaller than their comfortable fit",
        "Its bungee cord is a disappointment for one wearer as it does not stretch much",

I normally wear a size 7 and that\u2019s what I ordered. I could barley get my foot in. These are definitely not what I expected and not the same quality one expects from Under Armour. These are definitely a miss. I will be returning these ASAP!",

      "text": "Wanted to buy this product for both casual and slightly smart casual wear, but the material isn't really good for smart casual wear, so it sort of defeated my purpose for buying it. The Men's Street Encounter series are much better, and the material used also more formal and suitable for smart casual wear. Shoes are overall quite light and easy to wear, but it simply didn't fit my purposes. Would recommend for casual wear though!",
