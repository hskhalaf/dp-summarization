      "text": "I LOVE THIS LIGHT BULB!! I bought (and returned) two different sunrise clocks trying to find something that would wake me up with light. Then I realized that the clocks are old school - very antiquated technology. This is the way to go, I'm so glad I took the chance. This is completely controlled by my smartphone. I can make the light any color, and even have it keep with the beat of the music I am listening to. But I really primarily use it for the sunrise and sunset effect, which helps me keep a healthy sleep cycle. This is a fun, really innovative technology that we are glad we added to our house.",

I used to have a stand alone phillips wake up light, which was great, but this is better because it doesn't clutter up my nightstand. I just screwed it into my bedside lamp and programmed it in my phone to gradually turn on at the same time each morning. I also like using it at night because I can make the light really bright for reading or dim it really low for a softer ambient light. The other features (colors, strobing, etc) are fun but I personally haven't used them.",

At times the app will also lose it's \"link\" with the bulb if the phone's Bluetooth radio is turned off (such as to preserve phone battery life) and then turned back on again, requiring the lamp to turned off/on again as well. I also have some concern regarding the product life given that it's dependent upon a proprietary phone application in order to use the advanced functionality.",

The main drawback for me was that I couldn't find a good warm orangy-yellow color from the color wheel that suited my lighting style. It just wouldn't give me the color I was looking for.

I should add that if you're buying it for the colors, some of them are slightly noisy in their darker ranges. Of course my husband says I can hear a gnat fart in the next room, so it may not bother you. I found a nice pale coral that simulates a sunrise that I can't hear. Just ordered another!",
