The SK8-Hi Core Classics carried the original, stylish guise and stayed faithful in delivering superb comfort and ample ankle support. However, Vans failed to fine-tune this model's insufficient arch support, which rubbed a star out of its overall ranking. Overall, while this shoe doesn't offer any modern elements, its supportive and stylish sensibilities are still on point.",
