My old liquid foundation was discontinued (bare minerals bareskin) and it took me so long to find something comparable- and I finally have! This foundation is perfect for full coverage but not cake like. I\u2019d say I like it just as much if not more than my previous baremineral product. This does not settle into lines/wrinkles and gives a nice overall tone to even out any imperfections. You don\u2019t even need to apply concealer for redness/blemishes with this foundation at all. Very happy with this product and will purchase again!",
