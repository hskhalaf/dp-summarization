Which is nice because there are no awkward creases that my cat's claws end up catching when she's scratching in the litter. Now, about this seller - I paid like $4 as an \"add on item\". I thought this was a reasonable price for a box of 15. I don't know if I just lucked out or if it's supposed to be multiple boxes for that price, but I actually received SIX boxes of 15. I actually don't like buying in bulk (small apartment in NYC), but I can't complain about getting six times what I thought I was getting for the price.",
