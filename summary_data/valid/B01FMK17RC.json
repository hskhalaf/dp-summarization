      "text": "Nearly everything about these cameras is perfect. They're nearly indestructible, take lots of great photos, and give young kids a meaningful access to technology. Two complaints: While the cameras themselves are virtually indestructible, the battery cover plates on the sides tend to pop off when dropped. We smooshed a bit of soft foam into the spot you pry them open, and that's helped so far. The games that it includes are utterly unnecessary. They're lousy, frankly, and need literacy skills in a way that the rest of the camera does not. VTech brags in the manual about how educational they are-- but one is about a *worm* turning into a butterfly!",

The screen is tiny, it hard to see it or what you are taking a picture of, I did not notice a flash on it which in shaded woods is important, the games can't be disabled and in my opinion don't need to be on there. Also, one of the battery covers popped off the second time it was dropped. This cannot hold up to a child as children drop and throw things. Save your money, it's not worth it.

I reduced the stars because it is very very easy to get the batteries out. If the camera is dropped the sides of the camera fly off and the batteries go everywhere. I am not talking thrown down, just dropped.. as to be expected with a kid-friendly\u200b camera. I am disappointed.",

It tumbled down the last steps, hit the wall, and landed on carpet. Batteries popped out but it still works as it always has.

They\u2019re not the greatest quality, but a lot of that is because she doesn\u2019t hold the camera as still as she should. There is a bit of a delay between pushing the button and when it actually takes the picture. Closing this gap and adding an image stabilizer would help with the quality of the pictures a kid would take. These features are likely to raise the price a bit, though. Overall, this is a cute little camera. My 2-yo has figured out how to navigate the features just fine and we enjoy seeing the world from her perspective.",

When she drops it, as 3 yo do, it is designed so it isn't damaged, the card allows her to take hundreds of pictures (important since a 3 yo tends to let the lens move when taking a photo. Her dad down loads the card on his computer and saves her best ones for a slide show or prints.

She ran through that in less than 3 hours. You can add a memory card, which we did. By the end of the day, she had taken over 600 pictures. The quality seems fine for a child's camera.

We are not happy with it this time around. The battery compartments are extremely easy for a child to open, resulting in lost batteries and an almost broken camera. The older version has battery compartments that are difficult for a child to open. I wish they had not changed the way it was designed, because right now my 2.5yo is too little to play with it (big sister was the same age when she got hers).",
