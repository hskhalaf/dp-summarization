However, we did have a problem with two of the attachments frequently going off in my wife's purse, with no pressing of the corresponding colors on the transmitter. In fact, the batteries were removed from the transmitter at the time. I simply called JTD's customer service number and was sent replacements for the two problem attachments, in the proper colors. Immediately and since then, there have been no problems. That's what I call great customer service. The only thing that I would have liked is smaller size attachments - say slightly larger than their battery.",

I haven't lost an item connected with one of the locator's remotes since I bought it. My biggest criticism is battery life seems to be less than is acceptable. I have a spare set of car keys I attached a remote to and I find the device will not beep after about two months until I replace the battery. With four remotes you can go through an awful lot of batteries and if you don't replace the batteries regularly, you won't find the device (keys, remote etc.) that you bought the locator to locate.",
