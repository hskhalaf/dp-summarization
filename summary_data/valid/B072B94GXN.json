This case has stayed clean unlike all my other previous makeup bags where products would spill. I would definately recommend the purchase!",

They are constantly coming out, moving and my items don't stay in place. The entire reason for the purchase was to keep things organized and if the baffles dont then the bag does not do it's job.",
