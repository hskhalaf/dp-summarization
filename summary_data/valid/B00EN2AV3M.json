Plus, there was a extra very long screw in the box with no place to go. The opening and closing of the folding bike is difficult to understand and we never mastered it. So frustrating!",

The paint on the bike was significantly damaged due to it rubbing against itself where it folds, despite the padding. The damage greatly ruined the paint, but for me it is not enough to go through the hassle of returning the bike for a new one. Like I said, the bike works fine, and required minimal setup (installing the pedals and tightening the seat). The instructions that came with the bike were for an entirely different bike. Don't confuse people by sending it with these directions.",

I did replace the seat and a few clamps with sturdier versions. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.",

    "description": "Retrospec Bicycles has been a leading manufacturer of urban and commuter bicycles since 2008. While we have successfully launched bicycles of all kinds, our \"less is more\" mentality always leads us back to a simple single-speed drive train and ultra-light aluminum frame. The Retrospec Speck is a foldable single-speed that operates on a coaster brake which allows you to stop easily by pedaling backward. No brake cables or shifters are necessary so this bike is simple and easy to maintain, ride, carry and put away in a small space. Ergonomic grips and the famous Retrospec saddle make this a luxurious bike that will make each ride comfortable. The Speck is recommended for riders ranging from 4'8 to 6'6, under 240 lbs.",
