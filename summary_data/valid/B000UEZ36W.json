The XXL is perfect. It covers enough space for my mouse, keyboard, and headset with room for me to have my phone in front of me as well (see my photo). It's also a little bit thicker than the standard QcK, which I like. Would definitely recommend.",

The mousing surface is also different from the QCK+ and the QCK Heavy and is far too slick with not enough stopping power to it. I was willing to overlook the non-stitched edges to get what I thought would be a much larger and better qck+ but this is a huge disappointment. I will be returning it due to the smell alone.",

I just really wish they wouldn't pack these rolled up in a small box. The edges are warped from being rolled up and still won't sit flat after days of use. I had this issue with a pricier roccat hiro+ pad as well that is still warped after several months. Fortunately this one isn't quite as bad and has enough flat surface to be usable, but still annoying. Does it really save that much rolling these up as opposed to using a flat envelope?

      "text": "With any quality, modern mouse laser technology has advanced so far that the surface you use it on really doesn't matter. Having said that this mat is very durable and offers great grip so your mouse won't glide anywhere on its own but you can still move it where you want it to go rapidly and without resistance slowing you down. It does everything you need a mat to do and it does it at a very low price. Buy this and never even think about a mat ever again. (If you game on the go I suggest buying 2 in case you lose one or it gets stolen. They are cheap and peace of mind is priceless)",

It's so large, that I'm considering cutting it into 4 different pieces and giving them to friends. I may just have to order the XXL to get some padding for my new K70 Keyboard.",

Low price point + good product so it's not a big deal to buy a couple a year however I do wish the durability and material quality was better so that the mouse pad doesn't start falling apart at the edges. It will unglue itself at the edge and the flaps will start coming up with heavy use.",

The pad is smooth and consistent with enough real estate for some of the larger monitors. If you\u2019re a gamer, this pad is excellent also. The gaming mouse I have glides easily and has the perfect resistence to maintain accuracy. Overall, it\u2019s a great pad.",

Pros: good surface, razer lance head glides perfectly good for people with any sens good for people who put their arm further out than their keyboard while gaming perfect amount of real estate for multiple mice good for lefties and righties washable cons: any dirt or crumbs will stick to it, but that can be fixed by just shaking it. Great mouse pad overall, would purchase again.",

Don't expect the thin rubber mate to support the weight of your hand-wrist on the mouse. Secondly its 10x10 inch foot print on my limited space next to the keyboard. I assume the thin rubber backing and black nylon fabric is intended to be custom cut to the size of your mouse area, good design. I hope you have many years of PC-mousing. SacMac",

I took a chance by doing so because I thought if I did this the ends would eventually fray but because of the way this pad is built, since it doesn't use end stitches to hold it together it is holding up wonderfully. Don't try this with other mousepads, they won't hold up. If you need one to cut to size then this is the only way to go.",
