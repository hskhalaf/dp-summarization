      "title": "Brilliant item",
      "text": "I got this app whilst travelling around Europe. Wherever I was it detected my location immediately and gave me the option to add location. Weather forecasts were always accurate making it so easy to plan days out dependent on forecast. e.g, we did cities on cooler days, coastal locations when the forecast was hot and sunny. I love the idea of being able to use multiple locations at the same time with just a click. Even now I am back home, I wouldn't be without this app.",

      "text": "I think this app is very well designed. It has a simple yet effective interface with the ability to view in various levels of detail. You can even store several locations for quick reference. That said I am yet to be convinced of the accuracy. As with all forcasts it is a prediction rather than fact that you are looking at but it does tend to forcast on the safe side. i.e. 30% chance of rain will have a rain symbol (in most cases the rain did not show) so surely the 70% chance of it being dry should have been favoured. Could be great but I still favour the BBC website.",
