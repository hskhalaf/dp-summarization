I washed them several times with different detergents, air dried them but it was no use. Since I have very sensitive skin, Jockey underwear are the only ones I wear, This never happened to me before, the odor problem was a complete surprise to me and a big issue. A total waste of money since they are going to the trash.",

Being 100% cotton this isn't going to have a slimming effect though if you find it too baggy around the mid section give it a good hot wash and high heat dry and it should shrink up a smidgen.",

When I first unpacked the product, appeared to be small. In truth the fit was just right. I purchased with confidence after reading consistent reviews. I have a plump bum but not so big thighs. The Elegance Women's Briefs hug my leg without creeping up or being to tight. Very pleased with the quality of material and the comfort of waist and legs. Especially grateful for the reviews.",

If you line dry your Jockey briefs they will last ten years or more. If that is not possible don't dry them in your dryer's highest setting. Use the warm setting --no more than that and less preferably-- and your briefs will last for many years even if you don't also wash them in lukewarm water.",

I just ordered another couple packs so I can toss some of my other older underpants that aren't as comfy as these. If you are a curvy or plus size woman looking for sturdy and comfortable full coverage panties, I recommend these highly.",
