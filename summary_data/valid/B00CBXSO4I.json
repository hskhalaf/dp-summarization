As it can happen...I found myself running low and did not find my usual brand on sale. I shopped around and liked what I was reading on Nature Made's label. I am about half way through my first bottle of Nature Made's 5000 mcg B-12 - delighted with the all day energy results, I will continue to take and depend on Nature Made's 5000 mcg B-12 product. I am very satisfield with my new discovery.",

It took me over 1 hour pulling them apart and I put them in a bottle with un-cooked rice to keep them dry and apart. Don't your company use \"Silica gel packets\" or \"something\" to keep moisture out? I suggest you do.. I decided NOT to use this product after I got them apart.. These \" Vitamin B12\" capsules might be defective..I threw them out.",
