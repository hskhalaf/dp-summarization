The grill looks great and cooks fantastic. This is my first infrared grill and I am very impressed so far. Temperature gets much hotter than any grill I have ever had before and I don't have to worry about burning the food because there is no way for the flames to get to what I am cooking. Clean up is easy if you follow the instructions and burn off excess food after grilling. I highly recommend this grill.",
