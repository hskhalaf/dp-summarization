      "text": "I love this stuff from a chemical perspective; knocks wasps down very quickly and has a good range. That being said, Spectracide should fire the person who designed the sprayer on these cans and re-design them. The sprayer apparatus is absolute garbage; half the output ends up running down the side of the can while you spray, so not only is quite a bit wasted, it may drip where you don't want it, and you certainly don't want it on your skin. So, wear gloves when using if it's a pre-planned use, or perhaps keep a chemical resistant rubber gloves rubber-banded to the can so you have one handy in a time of quick need.",

This spray is powerful and shoots a thick spray for 12-15 feet. Kills 95+% on contact. Drops them right out of the air. Used without gloves or eye protection. No issues. There is a smell of poison when done that lingers for a short while. Sprayed on flowers...which was NOT good for the flowers, but no more wasps. Have wiped out two large nests with less than 2 cans. Have 10 cans unused. This is great stuff.",

As an experiment, I sprayed an ant nest in my driveway before work. I returned two days later and no more ants. Excellent!",
