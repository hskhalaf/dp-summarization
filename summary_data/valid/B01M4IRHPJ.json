These gloves are fantastic and offered at such a low price. I\u2019ve purchased so many gloves just looking for a pair to provide relief from the cold and pain. Wore them the other day in lower 20 temps. Fantastic! They have stretch and fit snugly. Going to order several more pairs. Recommend them highly.",

It is also poorly insulated, so cold air easily seeps through. Little blood flow + cold air = cold hands. Also, the proportions of the fingers are strange. When I put them on, the palms are too big and the fingers too short. I guess it reduces constriction.",

My only complaint is minor - the internal finger section pulls back and separates a little from the external portion when removing the gloves - almost like it slips in towards your palm when you remove them. They popped right back into place when you put them on again. Obviously, will have to see how they hold up over time, but for $8 I am very happy with them so far.",
