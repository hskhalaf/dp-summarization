      "text": "I had purchased this rocket about 10 years ago. That was back when the fins were made of plastic and the body and top of the rocket separated during the recovery phase and both ascended to earth under their own parachutes. Now, this kit has been updated. There were a few pleasant, and challenging surprises. The fins are balsa, but you have to glue two sheets together and then sand the leading edges of the fins. Overall it was a fun build and I look forward to flying it this evening.",

The fins are surprising rugged. Make sure you use the proper C6-3 engines; if you use an engine with a longer delay the rocket may not be high enough for a safe parachute recovery by the time the ejection charge goes off.",

Nevertheless, it was challenging, and very rewarding when it finally came together. And it flew wonderfully. Some rockets might be put together in an hour, but this took time and patience, and it's now on display.",

Then filed down to the correct thickness. Then cardboard pieces need to be glued with another wood piece. All of this to make one fin. DO Not get me started on the capsule or escape tower. Trying to glue ill fitting pices to make a cylinder or parts to make a triangle to fit on a circle is ridiculous. Great looking model, not for the faint of heart. Lots of skill is needed. Estes can do better designing this kit.",
