Not your power even though you can hit it hard as you want but it will swing around unless you tie it down from the bottom. I wish it was 60lbs so that I could really go to town on this bad boy. I think it would make it the perfect bag in my opinion. The price is Excellent. It's very affordable (gives me another excuse to justify to the lady why I need to buy another bag. A heavier one. LOL), the bag feels like it will last many years.",

That made it 100% better. My 12 year old had this thing swinging in the wind so it's light and moves alot, good for focusing on footwork and striking a moving target. If I had to do it all over again, I'd like to have this design in a 100# bag and could do away with the stabilizer on the bottom.",

Great for a quick stress relief while working on a project.",

It's a great bag to practice uppercuts and body shots on, but is too light for heavy kicks. So if you're looking for something for lighter boxing/kicking and speed/agility over power, I would recommend this bag.",
