Also, the birds tend to get to some of the limes before we do. This picker, attached to a telescopic pole, helps me pick limes so the ones the birds get into and that are still on the limb, I can take them down. I guess if you like limes you can pick some to eat them. I don't and this is how I do maintenance on that pesky lime treat. Why couldn't it have been a mango tree.",

Also - the exterior of the metal had some blue vinyl on top which was sewn into the bag - making it impossible to remove all of it. Since this was very inexpensive, I'll be forgiving and give it 4 stars. For its intended purposes (picking apples in branches too high for me to reach by hand), it should serve well. This is just the picker - you will need to purchase your own handle for attaching. I've included some photos that I hope will be helpful for other shoppers.",
