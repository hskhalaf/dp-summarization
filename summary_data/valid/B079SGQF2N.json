I ordered this one to be ready following the demise of the free one from the school. The free bag from the school made it 4 weeks. This one made it almost 2 weeks before the zipper failed under normal use. The plastic has held up fine in the 2 weeks, but the zipper could not handle being opened and closed with nothing more than a microsoft surface and a folder of paper inside for school days only for 2 weeks. ugh. Can I return this?",
