My husband did the hardest parts, twisting metal pieces into straight alignment, etc. Three of the 20 plastic pieces to hold in the cross bars that support the mattress snapped during assembly, but we left them in. Seems solid, other than that and kid is thrilled. This is one of the few full size daybeds out there, definitely a great price. Plenty of room for under bed storage. Bed is really high up with a thick mattress and foam pad.",

It isn't a daily sleeping space for us but when it has been slept on there's been no complaints. I didn't get a box spring so the sides and back do give some additional support for sitting up with pillows. You can easily make this bed much more sofa like with lots of pillows. Also, its pretty high off the ground which we love as does our pups who love to be with their bones underneath it.",

Pleased with this purchase. There's a lot of space underneath for storage, if something fell behind there, you could crawl under and get it (even if you're not petite).",

Otherwise if you have many pillows its more comfortable.",
