After posting this review, I immediately received an email from Julia at ANKER CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT. She verified my problem and asked if they could send a REPLACEMENT unit for my trial. I, of course said \"yes.\" The replacement arrived promptly along with continued emails inquiring about progress and results. THE NEW UNIT IS PERFECT!!! It fully recharges in less than 6.5 hours from the double input plugs. I couldn't be happier with ANKER and their product. It does EVERYTHING they claim and more!! And Julia deserves a raise and a promotion...",

So I definitely recommend using both charging cables simultaneously to speed up the process & find out sooner wether It\u2019s charging (Sometimes the light will flash to charge but no charge). So definitely use/find a strong/powerful brick for charging and all should go well. As crazy as this may sound, for the price I\u2019m not upset at all and as long as this product keeps working I\u2019m a happy camper.",

Better yet is the capacity this unit holds, and it holds the charge for days if you don't use it.

I bought this one because there are times that I am traveling with a partner and we are in a car and both need to charge our phones. Problem solved. If you purchase Anker's double charger, you can plug in both input charging channels at the same time and charge the battery in roughly half the time. If you have two fast chargers you can accomplish the same thing but that requires two AC sockets.",

One drawback of these batteries is it takes time to fully charge them, however this model addresses that issue by allowing you to charge with two plugs at the same time. Also, the provided cords are okay, but I highly recommend purchasing a pack of long (6ft) durable USB to micro USB cords to go with it.",
