Once it was hooked up there was super loud hum coming from the speakers I did everything I could but had no success. So i decided to go with something more expensive. This pre-amp is excellent. There is no hum coming from the speakers and it works great. Construction is excellent. Get It! Don't forget to connect ground from your turntable to this pre-amp. My setup: Gemini XL-500 II",

The instruments in playback seem much more real and there is no muddy sound. I have both the low cut and the 200 capacitance button activated and the sound is better. I am sure if I paid for a high-end preamp that I would have a better sound but for the price, I am very happy with this unit.",

The low cut frequency switch, impedance switch, and variable gain were alluring features, but didn't make much of a difference. The blue LED power light is obnoxiously bright.",

Once the ground was connected between the turntable and the preamp the hum disappeared and plugging the supplied power adapter into the switched 120V outlet on the receiver turns the preamp off when the receiver is off.",

    "description": "The DJ PRE II (formerly named the \"Phono MicroPRE\") acts as an interface between your turntable and your audio recording / playback system. The analog input capacitance can be switched between 100pF and 200pF to optimize your phono cartridge response. A switchable low cut filter removes turntable rumble while leaving the audio pristine. The front gain trim control and signal/clip LED allow you to optimize the preamp's gain for a wide range of input sources. The built-in low noise phono preamp circuitry is highly accurate and precisely conforms to the RIAA standard. The line output jacks are low impedance and can be used with any sound card.\n\nHoused in an all aluminum black anodized case, the DJ PRE II can be powered by a wide variety of external supplies. If you need to amplify and EQ your vinyl records to interface with your audio workstation, sound card, home stereo system or main monitor system, the DJ PRE II gives you flawless audio reproduction in a rugged and reliable package.",
