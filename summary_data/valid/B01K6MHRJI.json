I found that was a known issue, and by re-flashing the BIOS, the problem was fixed. The next issue I had was with tethering. There was a workaround to get that going. The device would have gotten a better rating if it wasn't for those problems. Hopefully future revisions will fix the issues.",

Initially, AIRVPN didn't work properly with the device, but after he recompiled a new firmware build within 10 days of the support report -- Walla! My trusty o' Asus RT-16u just didn't have the steam (or nvram to support OpenVPN) for the odd project anymore. I thought I would give this a try as they are touting OpenVPN client out-of-the-box. I wasn't disappointed - the OpenVPN client installation was a cinch.",

    "description": "GL-AR300M-Ext is a mini travel router for working professionals and a programmable gateway for DIY hobbyists. \n\nLarger Storage and Extendibility:\n\nThe router is with storages of 128MB RAM and 128MB Nand Flash, which can be further extended using external USB sticks. There are 2 Ethernet ports, 1 UART, and 1 GPIOs available for hardware DIY. It is an ideal portable gateway for IoT development. \n\nWiFi Converter: \n\nWiFi is extremely popular but still may not be available at anywhere. If you are still using a wired network at hotels or cafes, this mini router is able to convert it to a wireless network for sharing the WiFi with all your devices. \n\nEven in places like cafes or restaurants with WiFi, it is not good to expose your devices to the public network directly. This router converts a public WiFi to your own WiFi with a firewall and then works as an agent for securer surfing. The agent connects all your devices when switching to a new WiFi. You don\u2019t have to input password for each of your devices. \n\nThe router is also able to convert your phone tethering, or 3G/4G USB modems into a private Wi-Fi. \n\nPortable Travel Mate: \n\nThe router is lightweight, pocket friendly, and portable. It can be plugged into any laptops, power banks, or 5V DC adapters for power supply. \n\nOpen Source and Programmable: \n\nOpenWRT is pre-installed and backed with a repository of 4000+ software packages. Pre-installed with an OpenVPN client, it works with 20+ VPN service providers. \n\nFor more details, please check our online docs at http://www.gl-inet.com/docs",
