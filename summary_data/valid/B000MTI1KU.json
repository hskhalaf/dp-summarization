First time out, all three seats departed their mounting base due to what has to be a joke of the staple-like things on bottom of seat which pulled out, letting seat fall to the deck. I'm having to reverse engineer them and put in proper hardware. Seats and cushions look good and were comfortable until they fell of their pedestals. Can't believe folks have actually rated them more than 2 stars. Maybe they were properly made in the past.... watch out for these today.",

I'm an average size guy and the back of the seat doesn't reach halfway up my back so keep that in mind if you're ordering it for a ski boat where you want back support. For the price there's probably not anything better out there I just recommend spending more and getting something a little more substantial.",
