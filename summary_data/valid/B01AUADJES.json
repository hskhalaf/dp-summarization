This is the star of my living room. The fabric is soft and almost jersey like. It's stiff but not uncomfortable. The wooden bottom is beautiful. Easy to put together. No scuffs. The shipping was faster than expected. I really couldn't be happier!",

Everything seems well sewn, the wood is lovely and the quality is high. The chaise is very firm, but not uncomfortably so. It\u2019s really a statement piece and it is perfect on its own. I was also very happy with the delivery and the packaging. It arrived a full week ahead of when it was projected to be delivered. The company stayed in close communication to arrange delivery, I was very happy with them. Would definitely buy again!",

We had to bring it through 4 doorways, down a flight of stairs, and around a tight corner and it fit without any trouble. My only complaint is that the couch arrived well *ahead* of schedule. This could be problematic, but we received two phone calls ahead of time so it was fine for us and should be fine for most customers (and in fact it was great to get it early!).",
