Well, five stars will do! Highly recommended! And yes, it is unfinished and you can give it any treatment you like. Also well packaged. A breath of fresh air when compared with all the poor quality stuff made in China that has taken over Amazon over the last few years! Did I say I highly recommend it?!",

The uniform blandness gives way to gorgeous hues and grains, dark and light elements of the wood emerge to reveal a deep, warm, rich kaleidoscope of beauty. It looks much, much more expensive than its modest price. I'd never stained before--what seemed intimidating was actually really easy (Old white t-shirt to apply stain, small foam roller for clearcoat. And wear those throwaway thin latex gloves). Do stain, even a light natural, and clearcoat to protect. Give this wood the respect it deserves.",
