      "text": "My theater room is 12 feet across. As result the projector and the seating are in close proximity. I found the fan noise level and the dissipation heat level too high given my configuration. I was disappointed to have to return the projector as the picture was rich and vivid, plus the HD37 has loads of parameters for customizing the image. The other factor leading to the return was the power cord did not fit snugly into the projector. Even the most delicate of moves while I was optimizing the projector location caused the projector to shut down.",

I purchased it just last week and have been thoroughly impressed with the brightness, color and even contrast projecting a 110in image on a off-white screen, with no tweaking at all. I have watched Cable News @ 720P and Movies in 1080P and they look fantastic. My primary TV is an 80in Sharp LCD and the image quality from the projector compares well with the TV's. I can't wait to install a 120in screen that drops over the TV for game/movie time!",

It has enough zoom, focus, and keystone correction for my 100\" screen from 15' away. As you're watching a movie, the projector's noise will bleed into mostly unnoticed background noise, but with no other noise to wash it out, it's loud. You can find cheaper projectors for similar quality, but I needed the distance.",

We started using the projector 6 months after we installed it. The picture quality was great and we were happy with our purchase. Last night my kids went to watch a movie and the lamp stopped working. The previous model lasted 12 YEARS. This one was used less than 100 hours and now they want me to pay 1/2 the cost for the lamp. I am so pissed and disappointed with this on every level. Maybe the Sale was because they knew they had a defective product. I do NOT recommend!!!",

      "text": "I bought this item on sale thinking it was a good price, however the picture was extremely blurred and it gave out a lot of light. I called the customer service line and was told to return the product. I thought it was a faulty unit so I just requested a replacement to give it the benefit of a doubt. After receiving the replacement the image was the same. I tried different surfaces to project on but even with a screen it has just terrible.",
