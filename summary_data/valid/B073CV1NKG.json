He is not totally pain free but is so much better with this shoulder brace. Both of us are very grateful. Hope it helps him get through until his surgery.",

This brace works well to take the weight of the arm off the shoulder joint and help to keep it in place. Really helps to relieve some of the pain an irritation and does limit the movement of the shoulder. As far as braces goes this one is not very uncomfortable to wear all day. I wore it mostly while I was at work and I am moving around and on my feet all day.",

    "description": "Color:Black\n\n Most shoulder problems fall into four major categories:\n\n \n\n(1) Tendon inflammation (bursitis or tendinitis) or tendon tear\n\n (2) Instability\n\n (3) Arthritis\n\n (4) Fracture (broken bone)\n\n Other much less common causes of shoulder pain are tumors, infection, and nerve-related problems. \n\n Anatomy: \n\n \n\n Your shoulder is made up of three bones: your upper arm bone (humerus), your shoulder blade (scapula), and your collarbone (clavicle).\n\nThe head of your upper arm bone fits into a rounded socket in your shoulder blade. This socket is called the glenoid. A combination of muscles and tendons keeps your arm bone centered in your shoulder socket. These tissues are called the rotator cuff. They cover the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. \n\n The Ultimate Buyers Guide to Shoulder Braces\n\n \n\nA shoulder brace is a sling-like device designed to support and strengthen your shoulder. Shoulder braces are not for day-to-day use, but rather for individuals who have experienced a shoulder injury. \n\n A shoulder brace can be used to heal your shoulder quickly and avoid such damage. Unlike a basic sling, shoulder braces provide stronger, more reliable support.\n\nAs your rehab progresses, a shoulder brace can be used to increase \u201cproprioception\u201d\u2014your sense of how your body is positioned. \n\n\n\n if you are not 100% satisfied with the shoulder brace you have bought you can simply return them and get you money back. \n\n Click \"Add to Cart\" NOW And Purchase Your Own Babo Care Shoulder Brace.",
