Anyhow the shoes only deserve 3 stars at most because the sizes are not right for either men's or kids. They are too long for their sizes even for men. The shapes of the shoes are not right too. The front toe areas are too small/narrow. The workmanship is not good either, compared with my other Adidas sneakers. I bought two pairs of different colors for about $30 in total. But I am not sure they would be comfortable to wear and walk for some distance. I am deciding whether to return both, or just one pair.",
