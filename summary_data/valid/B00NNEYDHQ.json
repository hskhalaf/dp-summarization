The massage is decent and the heat feels great on a sore back. I don't usually fall asleep in a chair, but this one I could easily. It goes back to almost a full laydown position. Update: it is no longer my chair. My wife has taken it over. I guess I\u2019ll have to buy another. 1/4/2018",

When I sat in it I immediately fell in love! This is my first Simmons chair and I must say it has great support and is extremely comfortable. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to relax in an outstanding recliner.",

There is no smooth transition whatsoever when reclining back and forth. I am not a huge person I only weigh 215 pounds. Don\u2019t waste your money get a different chair.",

Aside from the gap in the back and the motor sounds, which both have been mentioned many times by others and that the heated back doesn't get nearly as warm as I'd like, I'm overall very happy with my purchase.
