My only criticism is that I wish the plates had some protection between the plates, but I just wrapped them in the paper that came in the shipping box.The wicker is a really nice rich dark brown color, and the inside fabric seems well constructed. The zip up cooler is a plus! Without food, it feels lightweight. Everything arrived in tact. This is a wedding gift, and after seeing this in person, I want one of my own! Will be ordering again.",

I was advised that the item would arrive at its destination in a period of 11 - 16 October 2019, and it did arrive at 16 October 2019 in good order and perfect condition. I could also easily track my order, thanks to Amazon.com's well-organised tracking feature. I may want to order another item in the future.",
