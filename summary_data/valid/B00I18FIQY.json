I have never had any kind of smell issue...they've come with a very light coating of oily-feeling stuff that wipes off easily with a cloth moistened with window cleaner. My home gym is setup in my garage, I really need plates that won't damage the concrete floor or rubber mats...these completely fit that bill. I use these plates 4-5 times a week and they appear good as new.",

These bumper plates have been used for deadlifts, squats, bench press, overhead press and many more standard weight lifting and crossfit style exercises. That being said I have had to bail on several lifts and they had no problem falling from about 6 feet up. I was more worried about my bar then the weights. I cant say how they would hold up in a gym were they were getting dumped regularly but for a small or home gym with a couple people they do great.",

Better, but the smell is still there. It is nasty. Bumping the rating down to a three. I expect in another month they won't smell.
