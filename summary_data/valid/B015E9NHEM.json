That does not make me feel comfortable with my environmentally friendly attempt to compost. Have not yet used it, so not sure how well it works.",

I saw this one on a \u201ctop 5 composter\u201d list and it was way cheaper than the Jora one, so I figured it\u2019d be a good buy. You get what you pay for, and my whole purpose of creating compost in my backyard was to return even more beneficial matter to the ground....and to think it\u2019s stewing and tumbling along in a Prop 65 bin...I just can\u2019t wrap my head around it. Seems counterintuitive.",
