It simply plugs into a standard outlet using the included cord and it can either clamp to an object or it can be permanently attached using a screw. My daughter uses this light to read in bed and she loves it. The simple touch style on/off works great. The first press is dim light, the second is medium, the third is the brightest (very bright) and a fourth touch turns it off. We could not be happier with this light.",

Her blanket is melted to it, her sheets have a brown burn mark on them.

I especially like the 3 different intensities of light one can choose and how easy and convenient it is to select the settings, as well as how easy it is to turn on and off the lamp with just a gentle tap. This was a replacement for a cheaper lamp that I had that ended up not lasting very long. This lamp appears much more durable and is certainly more esthetically pleasing. It arrived quickly and was packaged very well, ensuring it arrived in perfect condition. This lamp has most definitely earned the five-star rating I have given it.",

If I could change one thing, it would be to not have such intense bulbs, and to make the color of the light less stark white.

It clips easily and security to the headboard of their beds to allow for a bit of nighttime reading. The flexible arm allows you to direct the light away from sensitive eyes and the three intensity settings are sufficient for most reasonable uses and sensitivities to light. The light also seems well built. Assuming it lasts, we will be very happy with this purchase and will likely buy more for the other bedrooms.",

The only negative thing about this lamp was that the hanger doesn't keep light from moving on wall. So we just put another nail on one side of lamp and this keeps it from slipping. Will probably purchase another.",

It's also quite bright - so that when he is reading at night he only needs to have this light on and then when he is done he can touch this off and go to sleep. It's also flexible in terms of how easy it is to move the neck/lamp around. I highly recommend this little light.",

So, after the initial hiccup, I have the lamp it it works as advertised. I'm willing to give it 4 stars because the lamp is nice....strong clamp, simple operation, very bright at highest setting....and the customer service was top notch.",

Anyone who needs a lamp for reading...this is the one for you. There is no glare and it doesn't disturb people around you who may be watching tv or trying to sleep. It's not heavy or bulky and the gooseneck is awesome so you can direct the light perfectly.",

Light levels are adjustable and the power button is unique--it doesn't press in but instead responds to a very light tap from your finger. What keeps it from being five stars is the short cord. But it's an excellent deal for the money.",

The 3-position dimmer allows me to control the light to augment the ambient light in the room comfortably. The LED emits no perceptible heat, so the keyboard area underneath it remains far more comfortable than with the old incandescent lamps I've used before.
