      "verdict": "Similar to other previous models, the Etnies Fader LS is a skate shoe that accommodates a comfortable experience. Up for grabs at a very affordable price, it has a classic and simplistic look and yet aesthetically appealing. It is a bang for the buck as the footwear offers the perfect combination of comfort, style, and performance that anyone wants. \u00a0Albeit a few had reported it as a bit snug on the toe area, buyers still chose to own a pair and hoped that they could soon achieve a more comfortable fit once the upper has stretched out.",
      "pros": [
        "The Etnies Fader LS has a stylish silhouette",
        "It has a great looking and nice design, attested by some of the buyers",
        "A good number of customers mentioned that the footwear offers a comfortable fit especially to those with more than an average-width size foot",
        "This pair of Etnies kicks is available at a very budget-friendly price",
        "Several reviewers lauded the shoe\u2019s durability",
        "Like other Etnies models, this iteration has an amazing quality that it could take a beating and still last a while",

      "cons": [
        "The shoe runs small as per several wearers",

        "A user groaned against the plastic under the fabric at the back of the shoe",
        "He is so disappointed that the plastic cuts into his Achilles heel"

I bought UK 5.5 and it felt like UK4.5 as front part was too narrow - Inner sole of right shoe is clearly bigger (see photo) and they tried to unsuccessfully fit it, which ends up ruining it with glue near the logo Overall I like it, but wont be using it because of size. I might try bigger sizes.",

I've thrown them out already as they fell apart after just a few months. At their reduced price of \u00a316.50 i'd call it a decent purchase but when they're on a full price for \u00a355 i'd rather spend that on some more long-lasting shoes!",

Next time I'll go back to the traditional Faders.",
