This has a smooth track, lighter than most and I really like that its has a special \"fit\" wherein the right thumb has sort of a notched area. This makes it NOT ambidextrous but I'm right handed. It has an auto off and on and batteries on these usually last me more than a year. I still switch it off at the end of the day. Great logitech product as always.",

She said it was more comfortable and lightweight than the wired mouse as well. Overall nice mouse with excellent battery life.",

Other people who have had opportunity to use it have said, hey this is a really nice mouse, it feels good in my hand, where'd you get it? So if you're on the fence, you should go ahead and get it.",

If IKEA made a mouse - I have to imagine it would look and function just like this one - and sell for 3.95.",
