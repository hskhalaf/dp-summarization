These small splits have occurred on the seam of the tire-which to me points to a cheaply made, not durable product. These holes do not occur on the outside, where a thorn, nail, or other outside force could puncture, but on the inside. After the first hole I thoroughly inspected my rim to see if there was something there to cause it, but it appears to be defective tubes. I install these tubes according to manufacturer\u2019s specs and pressures and the problem continues to happen. I am extremely disappointed in this product and am not satisfied with my purchases.",

I suppose it's better than receiving 42mm valve stems and needing 60mm. Running around looking a bit goofy, but won't knock it any stars for that as the product functions just fine. I've not had a chance to ride long distance with these (rode approximately 100 miles so far over the course of the last few days), but Continental's track record has been good as a whole so I'm confident that if they didn't blow up within the first 100 miles that they're good.",

The first instance left me stranded on the side of the road because the valve core was wedged into my adapter. I bought a new pump to avoid the adapter issue and even used small pliers to tighten the core before installation. But the core gets stuck in the new pump too; when you detach the pump, the core comes with it. I thought paying extra for Continental tubes would be a smart investment, but it just lead to me paying more for garbage.",
