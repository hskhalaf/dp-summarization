The only con I would have to point out is that, at least in my opinion, the built-in stock launcher makes the tablet layout look and feel messy. This can be easily changed by downloading a different launcher from the app store (I use go launcher) and customizing as you see fit. I am a former android phone owner so I knew that this was an option. However, I do feel for the average tablet user/someone who has not used android before they might not know that this option is available.",

Lots of bang for your buck. * Built in stand is nice. Adds different configurations when using. Con * The app manager sucks. Better alternatives available on the play store for free.
