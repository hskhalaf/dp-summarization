This steel frame on this trailer took all of the damage and was light enough to be pushed aside from the car. My kids came out of the accident nearly unscathed it was miraculous! A few bruises on both and a bump on my 4 yo head but ultimately they're alive and well thanks to the design of the instep trailer! Thank you and I definitely hope to get another soon!",

For my bike, (Schwinn Discover Men's Hybrid Bike 700C Wheels) the one hiccup in fitting the coupler onto the rear axle was the allen bolt that held my rear fender in place.

The workaround is to remove the fender's support bar from the hole that's meant for it's bolt and reuse the rear carrier's bolt for both the carrier and the fender. This is kinda stupid since Schwinn and instep are supposed to be collaborators. Even otherwise, a top selling trailer not fitting the top selling bicycle easily is not ideal.

      "text": "At first, I was excited about this. But, this weekend after 1 month of use, one of the snap buttons ripped on the front left just this weekend (a couple of days after the Amazon return window). I also happened to notice that one of wheels isn't true and it wobbles a bit. I'm not sure how long this had been going on, because I had been using it as a bike trailer instead of a stroller. The velcro fasteners are also poorly designed. I think that a zipper would have been much better and probably more durable than a velcro/snap option. Overall, not impressed.",

It also comes with a safety flag. My 2 year old loves it as we can go quickly to the playground or beach.",

That didn't seem to bother the kids at all though. It handles nicely overall though. It is easy to push as a stroller and is easy enough to pull once you get going. It is definitely a workout and hard to start and stop frequently with my older child.",
