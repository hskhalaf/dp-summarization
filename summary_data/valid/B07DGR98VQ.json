Playback videos skip 2 to 4 seconds at a time and the motion alerts aren't reliable to pick up motion. I know of several instances where it has missed movement. The point of a security cam is so that you don't miss anything. Customer service has not gotten back with me after contacting them twice. I would return it if I still had the box. Regardless, I'm on the market for something a bit more expensive, but more efficient. Edited to add: shortly after posting this review, it stopped working all together and customer support is unhelpful.",

      "title": "Buyer Beware : Newest firmware + MicroSD = Problems",
      "text": "As above. Newest firmware + MicroSD resulted in constant reboots, loud buzzing issues, etc. Spent a number of hours with their helpful tech in an attempt to manually downgrade firmware; without success. SD slot wasn't reading SD card. Received a replacement unit and similar constant reboots (no buzzing now) happened with MicroSD card inserted. Have not tried manually downgrading firmware (again) yet. I believe No MicroSD means no local storage which means can't record footage locally. So as a PSA - buyer beware. Their tech is very helpful, to their credit and replacement unit was sent quickly. That said, shouldn't be this painful to get their camera working. Get their non Pan Cam instead, that works great.",

I checked my other cam pan the other day and that is not reading the memory card any more either!!! soon this one will die too.

Otherwise it records 11 second clips with several minutes cooldown between detections. But Wyze provides 1-week rolling storage, so compared to pretty much every other brand these are great if you have pretty straightforward needs (like catching people stealing your packages).",
