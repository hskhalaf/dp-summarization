Anyway, this is a new product for me as I have usually used the regular serum for my daily ritual. I like the way this goes on especially on my neck as it evens out some imperfections in that 60 year old zip code. I tan easily in the summer, so I like a bit of color but not too much. It does not cover my under eye circles, so I still have to do makeup if I want full coverage. But overall, better than just serum but not as full coverage as a base. Hope this helps.",

All I can say is that if you want to have a light coverage, and softer skin... great! Just be careful near the eyes.",

Now i don't know if i got a bad egg, but this is immediately going in the trash. What a waste. Sticking with asian CC creams and bb creams from now on. They provide the best coverage and consistency imo",
