One ball out of every 15 or so will fail to hold air. I was able to return those for replacement, so not a huge hassle.",

Probably a couple of grams heavier than the AVP or AVP II ball but that's a good thing, especially in the wind. Unlike (IMHO) the AVP ball it's a volleyball players ball and NOT something branded mostly to generate revenue. This is probably the best synthetic ball ever made...if you're serious about your sand volleyball then get one!",

It's a bit softer so it's more forgiving on the forearms of those getting back into volleyball or are new to it. As far as sand sticking less to it than the wilson ball, they're the same.

It also does not get chewed up or waterlogged like the TF-18 when it rains, since it is synthetic. The texture of the synthetic cover on this ball may actually allow for a better grip than on the Top Flite under most circumstances. I have found that most people (that have a preference) would rather play with this ball than the Wilson AVP or Mikasa balls. After playing with the King of the Beach, the others feel like cheap indoor/outdoor balls.",
