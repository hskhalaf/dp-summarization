Then had to pay shipping and wait for it to arrive before I could really test out the bra. Supports full bottles well. It literally is hands free. I pump at my desk throughout the day, and this is sooo much easier than holding and balancing bottles while trying to do other things. I do not find this bra comfortable enough to wear as a regular bra - I simply keep it with my pumping supplies and slip it on for that purpose.",

The bra is also very bulky since it's designed to fit a whole range of sizes. The adjustable Velcro bar on the back drive me crazy because it kept getting undone. After a month of use the bra is no longer usable. Will not recommend this bra.",

My only issue is that I need to figure out a better way to get the suction funnel things in and out easier. The bra does a great job holding them in, I'm pretty sure it's just me needing to figure out how to work it.",

In the future, I would hope to see Simple Wishes automatically selling the product WITH the center panel, or expanding the width to fit normal nipples. In addition, if the center panel was sold on Amazon, it would alleviate the additional search and purchase from another site.",

Also, it is very easy to put the bra on and attach the pump. So you are not wasting precious time hooking everything up. Finally, it comes with optional straps in case you need more support. I could not ask for more from a pumping bra. Pros: One size fits all Easily adjustable Easy to take in and off Easy to attach pump Cons: No",

The \"cups\" are flat, soft fabric resembling an A/B cup flattening sports bra, with all the depth of a trainer bra, giving the breasts zero support, becoming patently painful as the filling bottles, with their increasing weight, are entirely held to the breast by pump suction. Sure, the band is completely adjustable, so girth is not an issue, but the shoelace thin straps dig deeply into traps while doing offering no more support than needed to keep the top of the \"bra\" up. Ultimately, a similar result could be achieved by laying down and flattening breasts with ace bandages with more support and less pain caused by downward pulling on tissue.",

I liked the fit and feel of the bra and it\u2019s probably my most comfortable and supportive pumping bra I have bought. Only small issue I have is that my flanges tend to get caught in the opening so you have to really position them the right way to make sure you can get the best suction but other than that I really liked the bra. I\u2019m also an exclusive pumper so I liked that the quality of the bra was great so it can withstand the hours of use I put in each day to pump.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a nurse and I was hoping to be able to wear this at work instead of a regular bra so I didn\u2019t have to put it on/take it off multiple times in a shift... found out it would make me super sweaty though if I wore it all day, and not the best support for all day wear. Not a big deal though - zipper in front makes it easy to get on and off quickly. Does its job well for pumping, and easily adjustable, so I\u2019m happy. Also have it in black so I can wash between shifts and have another ready to go.",

But i only wore it while pumping, and then switched back to my other bra to finish work. Just kept this in my pump bag and put it on for pumping.",
