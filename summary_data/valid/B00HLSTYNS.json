I was very excited to receive it considering all the great reviews, but I noticed the weakness/flimsiness in the product almost immediately. Once I put laundry in, it became clear that this product is not worth the $45 I paid for it. The product is composed of very flimsy chrome bars that don't hold up when there's laundry in the bags. I've attached an image of what my cart looks like with laundry in it. I definitely do not recommend this for the price -- there's nothing \"Heavy-Duty\" about it.",

Within an hour after adding clothes to the bag the cart was leaning dramatically. I tightened the screws again as tight as they would go and there is still so much lateral play that it pretty much makes this cart so unstable and useless. Save your money!",

Since then, its gotten increasingly unstable and now it always leans to one side & I have to prop it up against the wall to keep it standing.

When it's full, I run a load. The only thing is, if you are grabbing a lot of laundry out of any one bag, the bag tends to lift up with it, so you have to unload the individual hanging bags a little bit at a time. Otherwise this is a great, sturdy unit.",

It still does the job, but I have to leave it leaning on a wall if it's any kind of full. I did a ton of research before settling on this one. I'm so glad I did. It's simple to put together (even with a 1 year old \"helping\") and Super sturdy. It has an awesome capacity too. Very easily 5 stars!",
