It comes complete with a 1/8\"+ board mounted to the back with hooks to hang either vertically or horizontally already mounted on the board. Wall hardware is also included. The mirror hangs like a picture would on a wall. I like this feature. Should I want to repaint the wall, I can easily remove and then replace the mirror. The top of the mirror does tilt slightly away from the walI (mirror is not parallel to the wall), but this does not seem to cause any reflection distortion. I really like that the mirror is made in the USA and from a family-run company.",

I mounted them today (4 different bathrooms) and I was equally impressed with the consistent accuracy of hook placement. The only way that these mirrors would not hang plumb/level would be the result of a bum level which, fortunately, mine was not. Love the product !! Thank you Better Bevel!",

The only thing I'd wish different is that the hooks on the back were a little longer, it's a bit tricky to mount on the screws because the back has to go so close to the wall before the hooks catch on the screws, and it's a bit hard to maneuver.

My 22.5\u201d by 34.5\u201d mirrors are both an eighth inch wider and taller than the stated dimensions. This does not fit into the frames and will require re-routing the inset. Unclear why the mirror dimensions are not exact as was the case with a third (larger) mirror ordered from a different company? Dimensions would be a non-issue if I were leaving these unframed, but why not give me exact dimensions on a templated product?",

It's a pretty mirror, but it seems that it's very poorly made if the backing hasn't survived a couple of weeks of hanging on a wall, and that's telling me it'll only look even worse very quickly.",

He's got long fingers, but they didn't come close to being able to reach the rings. So It was a challenge getting both of the rings on their hooks at the same time. We installed another mirror that we already owned the same day, and the rings were close to the edge and that went up in minutes.",

The interlocking hangers would also make installation much easier.",
