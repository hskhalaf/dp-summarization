Major inconvenience while traveling overseas. Update: Anker speedily resolved the issue for me by replacing the battery, and followed up to make sure the replacement arrived and was working. They also seem to take great care in trying to discover what caused the issue in the first place, with photos and diagnostic questions, and had an engineer involved in the issue. It appears my issue was a fluke. I remain a big fan of Anker, and use many of their other products.",

The build quality is great and it only takes slightly longer than the 10000 to fully charge (i.e. a few hours with the right charging unit); don't mind the reviews complaining about absurdly long charge times\u2014that's just what happens when you use a basic 5W iPhone charger.

      "text": "I needed to replace my aging set of Lumsing Grand A1 Plus 13400mah powerbanks as they are getting old in charge cycles, out of warranty, and the company is no more. So I've been looking for a brand and powerbank that is of similar physical size, similar capacity, and reliable warranty. Decided to give the Anker Powercore 13000mah a try. 30 days of use thus far it charges a variety of compatible devices with no issues. I like it. The real verdict will be within two years. Will I experience overheat from faulty components? Well I don't know yet.",

      "text": "I purchased this Power Bank on the recommendation of a family member. My family plays Pokemon Go and we are always draining our phone batteries so we needed a power bank that would be able to charge multiple phones more than once before needing to be recharged itself. I have used other power banks in the past and none have been this reliable. So instead of having to bring 3 power banks when we go out raiding, we only need this one. It also allows for two phones to charge at the same time. I am going to be purchasing more for gifts. I am VERY happy with the durability and the performance of this power bank.",

Skip the cord altogether and provided a better case or something. I mean really even the box it came in was 3 times the quality of the cord.",

I have told all my fellow coworkers to get this and they all have. This is one product that is worth every penny and you get your moneys worth quickly.

I do my best to charge it at home. :) My iphone SE can get about 5-7 full charges from this (sometimes starting at 20%, others from 1%). At least it charges my phone pretty fast.

Today, I noticed it was not charging properly, as the LED indicator did not flash even though the PowerCore was at a very low charge level. I wiggled the Micro USB end of the cable, and then the LED indicator began to flash. It appears that the malfunction has been caused by a broken Micro USB port. With that, I am not sure the product is even safe to use anymore. I looked around Amazon and Anker website and did not find an obvious way to exercise the product warranty, which has not yet expired.
