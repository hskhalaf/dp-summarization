      "verdict": "The New Balance 870 v5 yielded a lot of positive reviews from several runners, testers, and experts. A lot of them highly appreciate the support that the shoe provides. Most of the comments are also focused on the shoe\u2019s ability to prevent overpronation because of the support it provides. There have been positive responses regarding the shoe\u2019s lightweight construction, which helps runners conserve energy in the long run. Overall, there are minimal updates made to shoe such as its engineered knit upper and ground-contact EVA outsole, but when all of its standard components are combined, a highly responsive and comfortable stability shoe is created.",
      "pros": [
        "A lot of the users admire how lightweight the New Balance 870 v5 is",
        "The shoe has helped prevent overpronation of the foot by providing enough support, a few runners noted",
        "Some of the testers have claimed that this stability running shoe is the most comfortable to run in",
        "The upper of the shoe, which is made out of engineered knit, provides enough breathability, some testers and experts remarked",
        "Several runners have praised the shoe\u2019s ground-contact ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) outsole with rubber pods that provided zero slips when running",
        "A lot of the wearers praise the shoe\u2019s versatility",
        "it can be worn for everyday wear and as a workout supplement"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "One of the runners says that the 870 v5 caused some pain on the foot",
        "A few testers have stated that the shoe did not have sufficient cushioning making the shoe too firm"

I had these before and glad they were still available. Now they're cheaper because it's a few years old. Still running just fine, the shoes fit just like the old one, and my knees are thankful that I finally bought replacement shoes. I run about 6:30-7:00/mile now. I have no clue what a professional runner would say about these shoes. The pros probably get custom made anyways. So these are perfect for me.",

The picture I've uploaded was from July 28. The shoes are basically unsafe and unusable at this point and need to be replaced. I walk about 5 miles per day and only on the road so there is no reason they should wear so quickly. I'm not sure if I just received a subpar pair but I will most likely not purchase New Balance again. I hoping the seller refunds me in some way.",
