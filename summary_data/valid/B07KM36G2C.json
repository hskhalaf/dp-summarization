One thing worth noting, I can't comment on the comfort of the insole. I put my own inserts in the shoes. They are really light weight. They are good looking shoes. The black does get really dusty on the trail, but the material resists absorbing it pretty well; a lot of the dust can be clapped off. I am VERY happy with these. I almost can't believe I got such a good shoe for this price.",
