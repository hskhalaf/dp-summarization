So I contacted Amazon and arranged for a replacement/return which they did happily. So, it's a good product - just make sure that if you buy the tunable white bulbs that they reach the range they should, as some might be defective in this regard.",

Tune-able means you can make the bulb a soft-white, cool-white or day-light, which makes a big difference in lighting.

It comes on full brightness (which is programmable). As others have mentioned, it would be nicer if was able to go dimmer.

      "text": "I finally decided to jump in and get a smart bulb. The main reason being that I have issues waking up in the morning and the idea of having a light that comes on seems to be a good idea. Additionally, the bright light helps during those dark winter months. Overall, I like it. In fact, I bought one for my living room. The app is easy to use, set up took less than 5 minutes. My only complaint is that when you use the dimmer there is a slight buzz that grows to be annoying. So, I have not really been able to use that feature. The pre-sets and programming is great.",

You then have to go to the app and get remote access back. It is much easier to simply turn on the lamp with a conventional bulb.",
