And no, my son does not leave the shoes on all day, I'd say the light are on maybe 1 full hour then they won't come on until recharged. I feel the lights should run longer than that.

I loved the different variations of lights that will compliment his outfit every time. Charging was simple as will. It wasn't difficult to figure out how to adjust the colors even without instructions. My son was devastated when they died and we had to give them a quick charge in the car. I read a lot of reviews where the lights stopped working and I'm hoping that doesn't happen because the lights make the shoe pop.",
