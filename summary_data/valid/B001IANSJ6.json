If you are light weight then this bike is good for you. I don't have any issues with the bike but it is just not meant for people who are overweight. If one is less than 200 pounds, I can see this bike not affect one as much. Honestly get a bike with that is sturdy.",

I have one dislike, the pedals that screw into the crank set don't go all the way through and one side of the crank set striped the threads, if this happens to you call the warranty department and they will send you the parts, but first register your bike on the internet. over all, this bike is awesome I put 4 stars just because of what happened to the pedals.",

EDIT: after 3 weeks the bike had a problem. Gear stopped working one day. Thankfully amazon was graceful to take it back and refund. Overall it is a good bike with decent shock abs, breaks and handling. Could be small for a person taller than 5.5''. Definately not a bike for someone seriously looking to put some miles into. Could be used for recreational purpose or going around the neighborhood. Not beyond that.",
