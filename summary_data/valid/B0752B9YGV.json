I haven't used all the magnifications yet, but glad to know I have them if I need them. I wear glasses and if I wanted to could wear the headband magnifier with my prescription if I wanted, however haven't needed to. These make painting easier then using one of the big round magnifying lights. I don't second guess where my brush is landing and can really get the details right!!! This has also stopped my eyes from getting tired after several hours of work.",

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they are a little heavy on the bridge of my nose.",

Otherwise you can just put them on like a pair of glasses and they'll actually fit over your glasses as you can see in my photos. It does take three AAA batteries for for the little light and those are not included of course. Seems to be a good quality product and exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend this product",
