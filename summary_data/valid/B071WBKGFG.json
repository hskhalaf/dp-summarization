      "text": "Bought this in a queen size for my elderly Mom. It is very well made, light enough that she can move it herself (without too much struggle), really fits well side to side on the queen size bed, and a bonus: it can be turned many different ways to give her a straight-up sitting support, angled sitting-up support, and even turned longways to be more of a wedge-shaped laying-down support. The fabric is sturdy and the brighter green color makes her feel happy.",

We don\u2019t really have a traditional headboard and that doesn\u2019t help either. When this came, I was a bit intimidated by how huge it is! But it\u2019s working wonderfully! Really supportive and very comfortable! I did make a new cover for it, the khaki green corduroy is pretty atrocious. But it\u2019s a great purchase overall and I am glad I bought it.",

Washed the covered for the first time, yesterday, and had no problem putting the cover back on. The buttons do not come off, so you do have to unbutton when removing the cover and button when putting the cover back on, but, again, it was not difficult, at all. I would say my wedge headboard/pillow looks even better. Washed on gentle, without bleach, and air dried. I recommend this purchase. :-)",
