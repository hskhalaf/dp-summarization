We would get them wet wring them out and get ice and let the ice sit with them (slightly damp) (I know people say not to get them cold) in a sink until the next morning. They stayed ICE cold the entire day in 102dg temps with 95% humidity. At one point our 4 year old said it was to cold but we LOVED them and will be using them again when it gets hot.",

We also had a fan blowing on him to help circulate that cool air, and it made the miserably hot day bearable. Summer fun requires these for little ones who can't regulate their internal temperature as well as adults. Glad I have it and I'll recommend to all my mommy friends.",

I recommend these for ANY amusement park in the summer in Texas!!!",
