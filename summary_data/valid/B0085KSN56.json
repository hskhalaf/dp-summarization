We both experience no pain. I know it stinks to buy yet another lancing system, but this is 100% worth it if you experience pain with your lancing.",

This device works fine, is relatively painless, and (for now, at least) the Fastclix system is relatively inexpensive. If it were not for having to push the plunger to operate and the lack of automatic advancement in the needle drum, I'd give it a five. Four stars seems too little but I can't give it a five, either. I would hazard a guess and say that, the way things stand now (Multiclix being phased out), this is the best lancing device system currently on the market and readily available. If you are new to testing, this is the system to go with.",

I had found that the favored Bayer glucose meter provides me with the most-accurate blood sugar levels. What hadn't occurred to me until later is you don't need to buy (or use) the Bayer lancing device (which in my opinion is poorly designed and more painful). Instead, you can buy this one to use with *any* meter, taking advantage of the gentle pin-prick and fantastic six-needle advancing barrel design so you don't need to reload the pin each time. It goes together easily and can even be used one-handed quite simply. I would not be surprised if it's the best design out there! ;^)",

Because this device is so easily adjustable when it comes to the depth of the needle, it's virtually painless. I use a needle more than once which is a cost saving for me. Since I HAVE to prick my fingers, I'd rather do it as painlessly as possible. This device allows me to achieve that. It's the absolute best one I have used and I have tried many.",
