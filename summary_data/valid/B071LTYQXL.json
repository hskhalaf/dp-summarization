I believe the self winding function is not working properly? I hate to return it but I may be forced to. A watch that won't keep accurate time is worthless. I attempted to contact Sieko for warranted support, they want to send it in and the repair costs might be $115.00. Sorry, looks like this one is trash. I just missed the Amazon return window, so no fault for Amazon.",

Automatic movement definitely suits the watch. Cons: No lume. Watch is all but unreadable at night. Leather strap is a bit stiff at first but I am sure it will break in over time. Summary: For the price, this is a fantastic watch. I really cannot stress enough how gorgeous the dial is on this watch. Whether you are a collector like I am, or just want a decent casual watch to wear to the office, this retro designed watch looks great and will capture notice.",

After following all the instructions on how to wind it, it still was stopping every 15-40 seconds. 2. The movement is made in Malaysia. I have a nice time piece - SEIKO presage (the movement is Japanese) and the difference is very obvious. 3. Spanish calendar mixed with English. I was expecting English only. I have no problem with Spanish, but that watch supposed to be the wedding present for my fiance, who loves watches and green.",

However even in sunlight it does not look ANYTHING like the picture, where the entire dial is green. And in any artificial light it looks dead black. I returned it.",
