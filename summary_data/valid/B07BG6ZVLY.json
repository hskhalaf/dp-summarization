Think carefully about what you will do if the TSA lock freezes up while you are traveling because the only immediate solution would be to cut off the two zipper pulls that fit into the lock.",

      "text": "Purchased it for my wife for short trips ~ we found it better built and less expensive than the other brand names on the site. About a year ago before the Amazon 22 inch was available, I purchased a brand name case just like it for about $25 more ~ I find the Amazon brand one I got for my wife better than mine. Would recommend the Amazon brand if you find one the size you need.",

So, a decent suitcase for the money. It does lack some features one would expect: the pull-out handle only has one length, it does not lock in the middle; it's scant on extra pockets, compartments, etc. It's just very basic. The red is easy to spot at baggage claim.",
