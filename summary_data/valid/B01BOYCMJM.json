I really like how both characters have their own accessory and animal sidekick (great if you're splitting up between siblings!) Maui is HUGE and his tattoos look very cool! Moana's hair and dress are quite nice, as well. The price I paid for this set was amazing...I got a Cyber Monday deal for $25. Kohls is selling this same set for $75!! What?! Overall, great product. Tons of hours of imaginative play to be had here!",

The Moana doll is beautiful and looks to be of good quality, and Maui is really huge as stated in some other reviews. Like, he completely dwarfs her, but he's really huge in the movie, so I don't know why we'd expect something different with his proportions as a doll. It would look weird if he was the same size as Moana. Anyway, I think they're well-made and I can't wait to see her play with them!",

She loves looking at Maui's detailed tattoos. And, let's not forget Pua and Hei Hei, whom she kisses many times every day. Great value for the money - especially for a massive Moana fan. I also appreciated that the manufacturer tried to be provide the most sustainable packaging possible, such as raffia ties (versus metal) and cardboard (versus plastic).",
