Recently built a 10x12 storage shed and fired 1500-2000 nails through the framing gun - no problems but it is heavy, your forearms will get a workout. Would not want to use this all day every day.... Overall, well worth the money. If you are going to be doing a lot of framing, go with a lighter framing nailer.... I paired these with the Makita MAC2400; works very well.",

I have never seen an 18 gauge pinner that wouldn't accept up to 2 inch or longer brads. Should have read the fine print! Sometimes while doing trim work it's beneficial and even necessary to be able to drive a longer brad. The one that's included in the trimmer set from Freeman can handle longer nails, not sure why this one can't. Overall, though, a decent set, especially for the price.",

    "description": "Style:Combo kitThe Freeman P4FRFNCB Pneumatic Framing and Finishing Nailers and Stapler Combo Kit with Canvas Bag (4-Piece) is an essential set of tools for professional construction contractors at the job site as well as DIYers tackling home improvement and repair projects. This collection of air powered nail guns and a stapler covers your framing to finishing needs and includes a 21 degree 3-1/2\" Full Round Head Framing Nailer (PFR2190), 15-Gauge 34 Degree Angle 2-1/2\" Finish Nailer (PFN1564), 18-Gauge 1-1/4\" Brad Nailer (PBR32), and 18-Gauge 1-1/4\" Narrow Crown Stapler (PST9032). The powerful framing nailer is specifically designed for tasks such as framing, sheathing, truss assembly, roof decking, subfloors, fencing, furniture, and assembling pallets and shipping crates. This durable nail gun features a one piece drive blade made of hardened steel and a lightweight magnesium body. Put the finish nailer to work on door and window casing, moulding, trim, chair rails, cabinetry, and other fine finish applications. The 34 degree angle of the magazine makes it easy to access corners or tight spaces, and the dual mode trigger allows to easily switch between sequential or bump firing.

The brad nailer is ideal for interior and exterior finish and trim, furniture, cabinetry, picture frame assembly, and hobbies and crafts. An oil-free design eliminates the need for regular maintenance and prevents stains on your work surface. The narrow crown stapler is perfect for projects such as decorative trim, cabinetry, cabinet backing, and hobbies and crafts.
