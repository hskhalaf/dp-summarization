Easily remove axle shaft gaskets and DPF gaskets with angle grinder. Nice and quiet compared to other tools. Overall work good when maintained properly. Used in heavy duty truck shop by professional mechanic. Will update in 6 months or after they break... Whichever comes first",

They dont get cold like the economy metal handled tools. Theyre fast, compact and light. I just love them. They also dont vibrate in the hand a ridiculous amount like some die grinders ive had. The greatest surprise about this kit was the carbide bits though. I was expecting them to be pretty disposable and overall not that great, but they are wonderful. Very sharp and hard and have held up to everything i have put them through so far.",

It\u2019s exactly what you would order off the manufacturer\u2019s site, but a lot less $$$. The minute you pick up the tools, you know they are very well made. You just have to remember the attachments are new and will grap the material quickly and it could get away from you. I would definitely buy it again.",

This is more a feature for a grinder that is to be used as a cutoff wheel and costs a bit more money, but for this economy set that also comes with decent carbide bits, it is well worth the cost!",
