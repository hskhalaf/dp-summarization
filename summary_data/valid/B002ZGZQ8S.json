I only use it sparingly, a half an eye drop size dab around my eyes will do. Worked great for me in the mountains though. You need so little. Just a tiny dab on your fingertip, and rub it around the eye. It is perfect for my overnight eye cream. Sometimes I use it in the day, but I have combo oily skin so I don't use it all the time. I can really see the difference and the skin around my eye areas are soft.",
