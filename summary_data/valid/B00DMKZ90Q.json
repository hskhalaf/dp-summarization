Maybe if I were riding on cobbles or doing cyclocross, I'd think about a clutch derailleur but I wanted a little less drag on my chain for the road.",

    "title": "SRAM Force 22 Rear Derailleur",
    "description": "All the best things, from Tufnel's amp to SRAM's Force 22 groupset, are designed to max out at 11. The Force 22 Rear Derailleur is a key part of the new Force 22 drivetrain, and it gives you smooth, laser-guided 11-speed shifting under even the most demanding conditions. SRAM didn't design the Force 22 from scratch. To ensure precise shifting no matter the gear combination, it took the 1:1 Exact Actuation technology from its award-winning 10-speed Red groupset. This means that you'll pull the same length of cable in every shift, regardless of gear, so shifting stays super precise and adjustment free. More speeds means smaller gaps between gears, too, so each shift is lightning fast. Not content to update the shifting mechanism, SRAM also updated the pulleys and the materials used in the Force 22. The AeroGlide pulley system ensures super-smooth, quiet, and efficient pulley action, and a new elastomer coating reduces noise even further for a more pleasant riding experience. There's a new barrel adjuster, too, which lets you dial in micro-adjustments without the need for tools. As far as materials are concerned, the Force 22 is made from a combination of rugged aluminum, carbon fiber, and magnesium for the ultimate combination of stiffness, lightness, and durability.",
