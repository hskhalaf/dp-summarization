I was so excited to get a significant improvement, particularly, in my TVs streaming, and this router did nothing. And Asus support, who I had multiple calls with, was virtually useless. I'm no expert with this stuff but it seems to me the router is correctly hooked up but it's just doing nothing. I don't have \"dead zones\" per se but I have \"extremely weak zones\" and \"medium zones\" and this brand new very expensive Asus 3100 router gave them No improvement at all. The signals everywhere in the house are as weak as ever.",

I researched the issue and apparently this is very common and Asus refuses to do anything about it. I know it is a hardware failure because updating the firmware, using a third party firmware, and restoring to factory settings doesn't fix it; as well as the 2.4 Ghz MAC address is missing. It's a good router unless you are needing the 2.4 Ghz for anything.",

With over 50 WiFi devices in a 2story 2000sf residence, I need better coverage and more power but the ASUS failed in 3 departments: 1. Coverage not as good as a lower powered AC1900. 2. WPS did not work properly. 3. No matter how I tried to tighten the antennas, they just fall/flop too easily. Next I will try 1 more ASUS. After that, might just make myself a tin foil hat and have a beer.",
