I can no longer get the blade in and out of this. It's very difficult and frustrating. Rendering this tool useless. You dont believe me Milwalkee??? Use metal[AKA HEAVY METAL] next time you want something to actually last. Don't disappoint your customers by saying \"Nothing but heavy duty\". Then they skimp on quality components that go into their heavy duty tools.. Total bs. Very disappointed. Back to the drawing board Milwalkee. #Advice. #Saving people headaches.",

As far as vibration goes, this tool has much less vibration then the DEWALT DCS387B (I tried both). The Dewalt was really tiring in that regard. The Milwaukee is on the heavier side, but that is an advantage as the kickback is minimized. The Milwaukee also has an adjustable shoe at the end. This gives you some adjustability on how much blade stroke distance you want. This also lets you vary the blade position to a different and sharper section. Get the larger battery if you plan to do much cutting.",

Also made quick work of cutting up some old treated 4x4 posts I wanted to get rid of. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

My chainsaw works, but it keeps getting jammed up with fine product from the Palm tree. The Hackzall worked but the M12 was barely enough power to cut through the trunk.
