Also, despite the product being cheap, it does not cause irritation to the eyes. The overall quality is great because even with less being applied, the product still gives your lashes a longer lasting result.

It looked like it could give a better application due to the way it has a fan look on one side and comb lOok on the other side of it. Well it was nice too see that it works just like I thought it would. I like it. I dried fast and it took me a couple times using it to where I didn't cause clumping on my lashes. The color is black Brown and I chose waterproof because I end up touching my eyes throughout the day. Baby oil and baby wipes remove it easily.",

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I always have to use a Q-Tip along the bottom lash to remove mascara that has smudged. However, I am 65 years old ... and that may be part of the reason it smudges a little. I would recommend this if you are looking for a \"removable with water\" mascara.",

I noticed right away that it made my sparse lashes look very thick and luxurious (awesomely happy about this). Beyond that, If I gave a second coat, I had lashes that most celebrities would envy. Like the name of the product, it truly is SENSATIONAL. Not one bit of irritation from this product, it doesn't flake off in the middle of the day, therefore making it a great match for those wearing contact lenses. I will be using this as my new \"go to\" mascara. Oh, and one more thing... check out the price, it's sooo affordable. A++++",
