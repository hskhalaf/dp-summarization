I stream at 1080 60 and do very little YouTube so 4k60 Pro is pointless to get. Im able to capture both PS3 and PS4 with very little troubles ( splitter for PS3). The card also automatically changes resolution when playing on the PS3 which games run at 720. Just to add there is no latency unlike the usb capture cards so setup is super easy.",
