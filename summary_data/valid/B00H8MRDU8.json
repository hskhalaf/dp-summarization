I love that in a few months I\u2019ll be able to take off the small napper and use it as a playpen. Also don\u2019t be discouraged by the reviews saying it\u2019s difficult to put together.

We purchased this item so when our daughter and son-in-law visited with their newborn they wouldn't have to worry about bringing theirs. I love the front storage for baby items. You don't have to run somewhere to get extra pj's, outfits, diapers, or whatever else you might need. The diaper changing station is large and convenient also holding babies up to 30 lbs.. My favorite feature was the battery operated white noise and vibrating for the newborn napper XL that help to sooth the baby. Another feature that I appreciated was the neutral color that will work for either boy or girl for future grandchildren. ;-)",
