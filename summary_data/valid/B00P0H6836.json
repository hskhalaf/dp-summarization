I am SO disappointed that this is the quality they allow to get to customers, the hassle this is causing us is not worth ever purchasing this litter again and taking the chance.

No odor and I only had to remove the urine and feces. The way this gels up, I have never seen anything like it. The rest of the litter stays clean and odor free and guess what, so does the litter box. Ordering some more today. Thank you to whoever invented this stuff.",

I agree with other reviewers that it does get tracked in the house more than many other brands, but mats help with this. I do not find the slight smell unpleasant at all. The litter itself smells a little butterscotchy. There are no added fragrances. If my cats bury their feces, it definitely controls odor (no litter can control odor if you have a cat that does not bury it's feces). It is not dusty.",

It does not control the odor from feces as well as traditional clumping litter with chemical deodorizers, but it is dust free and much better for allergic people like me. I think this is also much better and healthy for your cat than traditional clumping litters. The only downside is that being lightweight, your cat will spread it all around when scratching if you have an open litter box (like I do). But it takes just a few seconds to vacuum around the box. I highly recommend this natural litter.",
