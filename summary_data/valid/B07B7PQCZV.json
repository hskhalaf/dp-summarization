So, I wasted $78.00 on a cool thing that breaks the first time you use it. I should have sent it back right away, but this appears to be a design flaw (that it freezes and is no longer functional). I would like a replacement, but I doubt if Amazon will give me one. How about it Amazon...I'm an artist and should be able to make terrific things with the 3Doodler if given the chance. I made a pyramid, and a sculpture, but then it froze on me.",
