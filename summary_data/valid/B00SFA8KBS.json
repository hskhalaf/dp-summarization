I lined the bottom with absorbent pads and made him a soft bed. He was contained so he couldn't bump into things in the house and he peed at his leisure without ruining the floor. I think a he actually liked it because it made him feel secure when I wasn't with him. I liked it because it felt more like a baby play pin rather than a cage. This is a small kennel, perfect for my chihuahua. He passed recently and I miss him like crazy.",

It comes with a carrying case, a top and bottom, and I love how everything zips up. She's a jumper... A really high jumper, even at age 14 weeks, but she can't jump out of it. I'll probably put the top on it if I have to leave her alone, though. I'm so happy I got her this pen!",

      "text": "Bought this to use as a chick brooder and it worked amazingly well! Put 4 chicks in at about 2 weeks old when they graduated from the rubbermaid box and they were fine in this playpen until they were ready to go outside. Used pine shavings and a Brinsea EcoGlow brooderfor them - (not sure how a head lamp would work because of the soft top, i don't use the lamp) After I moved the chicks to their outside home I emptied the playpen and hosed down, hung it on the clothesline and then put it away until the next batch of chicks! Would recommend it for this slightly un-conventional usage!",

If you have a puppy or smaller to medium dog this is perfect, but when you get ready to potty train your puppy I would also purchase a crate, because you will need a small space and this is too big, so they will likely potty inside it. Also, I like to use the XL pads to line the entire bottom if you have a puppy; the regular (22\"x22\") are too small, so you will use about 5 each time.",

It fits up to three puppy beds, has a removable (mesh) roof, and a removable nylon-esk bottom that doesn't soak up any messes. This really was one of the best buys that we got for our puppy. Spacious but also doesn't allow them to roam and pee everywhere.",

They managed to break the zippers and therefore escape, just one out of the four little baby yorkies. Twice. I ended up having to build a fort around it that consisted of various household items and it just ended up being a complete hassle.",

Bottom is water resistant so if water spills or the puppy has a \"poo-pad miss,\" I dont need to worry about my floor. It's bigger than I expected...both in diameter and height, but that's ok. I made it work. I will probably look for a smaller one for when I travel with her. Highly recommended.",
