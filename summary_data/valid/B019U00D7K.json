When turned on, it automatically connects to my cellphone every time after the initial set up. Voice quality for phone conversations is good; people at the other end could easily hear me. Wired connection is good as well. When one side of the heaphone did not work, I contacted the seller. They promptly responded back and took care of the issue, which I'm very happy about. I would highly recommend this product and the seller.",

I noticed if you have the noise cancelling on and you barely bump them they make a crackling sound also the music sounds more like it's in a hall. With noise cancelling off they sound excellent crisp sound great bass the works. They are great headphones. UPDATE: THESE HEADPHONES ARE STILL AWESOME.MUSIC SOUNDS BETTER ON BLUTOOTH AND NOT WITH THE NOISE CANCELLING ON. YOU CAN SAVE $10.00 BY BUYING THE VERSION WITHOUT NOISE CANCELLING. THEY REALLY DON'T CANCEL OUT NOISE BUT WITH THE MUSIC PLAYING YOU DON'T HEAR OUTSIDE NOISE AND THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE YOUR THERE OR EVEN BETTER. GREAT QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP. VERY WELL BUILT",

BUT, these had that weird compression feeling when the anc was turned on...and a bit of hiss.

Forget about listening to tracks with sounds directed towards the right or left, it won't work. Very uncomfortable, especially for someone who wears glasses. I have no idea what everyone is raving about when it comes to comfort, it definitely isn't. They're way overpriced for uncomfortable headphones with bad sound. I would have bought a sony or something else had I known these headphones would be this bad.",

When I walk with them on they make this weird bubble noise, like the drivers are going in and out. Construction - Cheap, flimsy, uncomfortable Noise cancellation..

Also, whenever I turn on active noise cancellation I get a weird vibrating hum. Very annoying.

      "text": "I missed out on a slightly lower price back on prime day, but there was a coupon recently and decided I wanted to try them...my mpow's creak and irritate me when moving around my room but I liked their sound signature for the price I paid....enter these, the build quality seems better in certain areas...but the swivel piece catches a little and feels cheap. At first the mid bass seemed too forward and it definitely is but switching back and forth between the mpows makes me appreciate the sound stage on these a bit more. Theyre not perfect but if you catch them on sale theyre good not a bad bt headphone.",

I also like the bluetooth feature. Now I can listen to podcasts or music or watch Netflix without all the distracting noises around me interfering with my enjoyment of the programs.

I initially thought the annoying beeping sound might be a built in reminder to charge the headphones. Nope. Headphones are fully charged and the annoying beeping sound continues to occur.
