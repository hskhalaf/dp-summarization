With a stationary subject grouping, and on a tripod, it can give a very interesting result, The IQ is good enough for an 8x 10 print if you dont; crop the subject. Its value as a camera is to force you to think differently about subject placement and depth of field. I though it was a good photography technique to learn.

      "text": "There is no question that this camera is not for everyone. But I have used and still have all the icon cameras going back to the '50s. I currently use an EOS full frame sensor with L lenses for most of my photos. But, for me, this is the bomb! I'm over the pixel and resolution contest. This camera makes you think of perspective and how the human eye works. The simplest shots are interesting. I find you are drawn into the photo. Now I can't wait to go to the places I want to bring back live!",

So the product is totally damaged. The problem that I left to France directly after I got the camera. Since it has no SD card provided, I couldn't try it before I get one. Now I am stuck because I am not coming to US soon, and I feel so bad that I wasted my money and I do not know what to do. CAN ANYONE HELP ME WHAT TO DO?",
