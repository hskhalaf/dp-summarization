      "text": "I have two labs that shed year round but now that it's summer they are REALLY shedding. Especially my 13 year old yellow one. Regular brushing did not help with her short hair. And the poor dog was so hot with all the extra fur just hanging around. This did the trick! It took a whole other dog worth of hair off of her. The hairs either stuck to the brush or, or sat on top of her to be easily brushed off with your hand. The hairs that were in the brush fell out of the brush easily when it was tapped on the floor. Highly recommend this!",

PROS: * It does pick up hair like a magnet, which allows you to easily collect it. CONS: * Small size requires you to bend over a lot. Thus, for large surface areas I suggest using a chair or stool and do the work in sections. I 100% recommend this product for picking up long human from carpets or rugs!",

We now use the ZoomGroom to brush our dogs a couple times a week, and also to really get in there and scrub during baths! We were skeptical at first because well, it's not an actual \"brush\". But, it really gets the job done, perhaps even better than a conventional brush. Now keep in mind, it will not remove as much hair because it's not \"cutting\" away any good hair, it's only pulling out the dead hair that was going to fall all over your precious home lol. Awesome product!",

I have a shiba who is blowing her puppy coat and this collects hair I didn't know she had! It's a rubbery, silicone-y material reminiscent of her Kongs so she does chew on it if I leave it handy/while I'm brushing her, but man does it collect hair! The collected fur comes off so easily, maybe even a little too easily as it slides off from the motion of lifting the brush when I go for another stroke, but that's a weakness I'll take. I have not tried it on wet fur or for shampooing just yet.",

It pulls the excess hair out gently and holds it to the brush with static I believe but then all you have to do to get the hair released from it is to blow it loose and it comes right off. I\u2019m not sure how it would work on longer coats though?",

The only down side is it makes the hair static-y which then clings to me, her, and little flyaways drift around the air. Best to brush OUTSIDE. But I solved the static problem by dipping the brush in a bowl of water and then brushing and repeat as needed. This brush is so gentle my dog begs to keep being brushed. I'd recommend it to anyone with medium to short haired dogs & cats. (My cat also enjoys!) I also use it to remove hair from furniture, dog's bedding, and carpet. Great product!",

The only caution is that it can get statically charged if it's really dry out, something to consider. If you're using it for his bath then scrub away, the hairs get collected in the nubs so you just pull them off in one big mat and into the trash can.",
