I tracked it down to the yard where it parked after a 15 minute search in the freezing windy cold just so I wouldnt have to wait for its replacement. These are irreplaceable when you need them. Nice and light, slim design, and strong as hell. I dont like to keep my tools spotless so I like to get things that wont fall apart after a bit and these absolutely do not dissappoint. These are wonderful. Do yourself or the mechanic in your life and get them these.",
