      "text": "Great game for my son, 12 years old. However to play multiplayer he has to use my account due to his age. At 13 can play multiplayer on his own account. tons of hours of play and achievements and unlocks. You will need an xbox live account to play online and sign up for an EA account. It also has a mode to play by yourself offline and with a friend on a split screen. Recommended as an alternative to COD or battlefield for younger kids but great for any age especially if you love star wars.",
