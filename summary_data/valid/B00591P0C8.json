I've ordered many, kept few and even those I have kept weren't quit right...until now. These shoes are so comfortable I ordered a second pair in the same color. I removed the insoles and inserted my own and regardless if I'm on my feet all day or not, my feet feel great. I highly recommend them. I wish they came in more colors.",
