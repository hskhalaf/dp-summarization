After initial set-up, I had a play with the extended settings. Some great options, too many to mention here. Camera quality is great, even in low light. Again, plenty of options included with the stock camera app. Battery life is pretty good too. Can easily get 2 days out of a full charge with moderate use.

    "description": "Size Name:HUAWEI P20 ProThe Huawei P20 Pro isn\u2019t one of those underwhelming phones that get churned out annually with a negligible upgrade - this device is something special. Looks elegant and packed with features, this flagship smartphone has been created with an OLED screen, a bezel-less design and a glass back, while the octa-core processor and 6 GB of RAM mean that it\u2019s fast. Then there are the fantastic front 24 MP and rear 40 MP cameras that not only shames competitors due to picture quality and speed, they positively destroy their innovative reputations too. Radical photos, the P20 Pro comes equipped with AI (Artificial Intelligence) image stabilisation, Leica optics lenses and a laser sensor for instant focus with motion prediction. There\u2019s a 24 MP front camera, so you can take selfies, while the rear camera contains 3 lenses: A 20 MP monochrome, a 40 MP RGB as well as a 8 MP telephoto lens. Along with all the hardware power, you have Huawei\u2019s clever AI which will ensure you take vibrant photographs, no matter if you\u2019re in very lowlight conditions, all the while safeguarding that no one is missing from your group shots.",
