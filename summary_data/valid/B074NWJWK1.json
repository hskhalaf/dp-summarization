The material and for and finish is world class. The lock down is above average. The only draw back is that they do not breath at all as the material is built for support and protection. My son has the prime net version and it's a trade off... less support for breathability and comfort... your preference will be based on those needs. Top notch comfort and bounce makes this a recommendation by me anyways.",

Pretty much all other tennis shoes I\u2019ve gotten (even high tops) I have issues with rollover. These are great! Have a nice wide base/bottom. Slightly tight around the metatarsal area - seemed a little narrow for listed size but have broken in with time. Could use a little better arch support. (Hence 4 instead of 5 stars). I ended up needing inserts which made them even tighter around the forefoot. But they have stretched out with continued wear. Once broken in these are incredibly comfortable tennis shoes even after long days of being on your feet/walking. Will definitely get again when these wear out.",
