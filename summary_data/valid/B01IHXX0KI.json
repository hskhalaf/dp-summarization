There are a few things that could be designed better, but having purchased and returned others this is the one of the better ones on the market at this price point at this time. The push handle needs to be improved and could be a little more sturdy and have a different handle so you could steer only with hand ; the cup holder comes off a bit too easily.

      "text": "Ordered this tricycle for my 10 month old grandson who did not like being buckled into his stroller. The Joovy Tricycoo is perfect for him. He loves being pushed around in it and is so much happier taking walks. It is a sturdy tricycle that will be great as he grows and can begin to push or pedal himself.",

      "text": "I'm disappointed because the cup holder and cover is falling all the time. The second defect -spot where the parent handle connects to the trike became very loose and made the trike more difficult to steer. But still easier than another brand. I like wheels of this bike and riding without noise. This bike is used by two children. My daughter is 2,5 years old and so 18 months. Babies love this! Trike is very useful for both of them because it features a flip-down footrest for the child to rest their feet on-and that works! Very easy to fold and put to the car trunk. I hope my review helped you.",

    "description": "Color:BlueThe Joovy Tricycoo 4.1 is your child's first vehicle and the perfect way to introduce balance and coordination, one step at a time. Ideal for babies as young as 10 months, the Tricycoo 4.1 transforms through 4 stages as your child grows. Stage 1 (10 months+) - Parents have full control with the adjustable and removable parent push handle. Baby sits in a padded seat with head support, surround arms and a 5-point harness for their comfort and safety. The extra-large canopy has multiple positions and is made of a 50 UPF fabric to keep baby cool and harmful sun rays away. Stage 2 (18 months+) - This stage is gearing up for the training stage. The Tricycoo 4.1 features a flip-down footrest for the child to rest their feet on. You can set the pedals to freewheel which prevents the pedals from spinning and avoids hitting little legs and feet. The extra comfy shoulder and seat pads are removable and machine washable. Stage 3 (24 months+) - Parents can remove the surround arms and lock the pedals to allow the child to pedal by themselves. Large pedals make it easier for the child to place their feet on and learn to pedal. The Tricycoo 4.1 features a large 10\" front wheel (larger than the competition) and 7.5\" rear wheels for easier riding. Stage 4 (30 months+) - A 3-position adjustable seat accommodates growing legs. The parent handle is removed completely for kid powered fun. A convenient cup holder and rear storage basket are perfect for child must-haves.",
