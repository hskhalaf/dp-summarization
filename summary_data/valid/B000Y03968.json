Your ex girlfriend from high school will call you and tell you she messed up. Your mother might finally quit her drinking. Well, probably not, but she'll be mighty impressed with how quickly you fixed that plumbing under her sink. Anyway, this is a beautiful and excessively useful wrench that has launched me into a lifelong relationship with Knipex. If I ever lost this tool, I'd replace it quicker than my tears would dry.

Maybe I'll give them to my 3 yr old son\" But, Immediately after using them for the first time, I have realized that this is NOT a toy! These tiny pliers are incredibly well built, and the leverage makes it possible to grab things really tightly. I was able to easily smash the edge of a nickel. (See my included picture.) I can't wait to add the 10\" set to my collection. Highly recommended!",

There's nothing quite like exerting as much torque as you're capable of knowing the jaws won't slip or mar the surface. Well worth the investment!",

Shortly after, operational flight control checks had no leaks with 3000 PSI. Everyone is trying to borrow this amazing tool. The only issue - Skydrol (commercial aviation hyd fluid) soften the rubber grips on the 1st day.

There is an engraved scale to help you to initial setup of the tool. Updated on January 25th, 2019: today I discovered it can be a great tool for climping electrical cables.

These are hands down the best out there. Definitely recommend. I have all different sizes, mostly 10\u201d and above because commercial calls for larger size tools. But I\u2019m getting the smaller for my home kit. Definitely recommend.",
