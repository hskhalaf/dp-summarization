For the money this trike works. Good cardiovascular. You're outdoors, not sitting on a stationary bike indoors. Do not buy if you want to go fast or cruise long distance. For the naysayers who say it won't climb a grade, it's not true. My driveway is at a 40 degree angle and I have no problem. Again , as an exercise bike for daily short term use, it performs well. Does, however, encourage me to invest in a more expensive trike in future.",

You lose traction too easily on slopes. However, since there are not many moving parts, durability is the big plus. Additionally, you don't find too many recumbent bikes in this price range.
