It has a very slight wobble, but once you put a pound or two in it, it quits wobbling. The first use produced an odd new-appliance odor, but it didn't affect the flavor of the food.

      "title": "Great little skillet!",
      "text": "This skillet is the perfect size; not too big, but still holds plenty for cooking for multiple people or just one! I use it outdoors in my screened Arizona room so I have plenty of ventilation, and, as any cook knows, when cooking meat, fish or chicken, it makes a mess of the stove and smells up the house for hours. It is also lightweight and very easy to clean! Just unplug and wash in the sink! The nonstick surface on the skillet and lid cleans very easily. Sweet!!",

      "text": "I've had this skillet for a few months now. I found it heats up fast and the non-stick coating makes things easy to clean. I've made omelets with cheese and the cheese just wipes out of the unit. Water heats fast. With the lid on, pork chops and chicken breasts cook easily. Definitely, a good, versatile skillet. Perfect size for one person.",
