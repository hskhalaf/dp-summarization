The safety buckle is a nice edition even though my changing table came with it's own. I should also note that I was happy with the packaging! It comes pre-packaged and not packed by Amazon so it can't be tampered with or altered in anyway before delivery.",

Still a waterproof cover, plenty of padding for comfort, and a good size. I\u2019d recommend it as a secondary pad.",

      "text": "This changing pad was perfect for the first 9 months! Its plastic cover made it so easy to wipe away any messes that come with baby. It is marketed as superior quality, made in the US etc but the cover actually got a hole 10 months in that gathers poop and pee and makes it so difficult to clean. I thought it was supposed to last way longer than that.",
