If the rear triangle of my frame joined the seat tube higher up I\u2019d probably be ok (as I could mount it closer to the seat), but on my bike (and presumably a large number of common road frame geometries) it\u2019s not possible. It makes the seat completely unusable and since I\u2019ve already removed it from the packaging I can\u2019t do a return :-( massively disappointing.",
