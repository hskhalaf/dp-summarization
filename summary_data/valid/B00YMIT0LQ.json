So I guess it could also be used for home security. But mostly ice cream.",

Very heavy duty but not too heavy. It has a nice covering that makes it easy to grip especially since I have small hands. Its dishwasher safe and comes with a lifetime warranty!!!

Incidentally, my dog loves licking the cold ice cream off the shiny stainless steel and then it goes right into the dishwasher.No, not the dog silly, the scooper goes into the dishwasher.My cat, on the other hand, loves the dishwasher and cats normally don't like water.The short cycle is a definite must though and Harvey comes out smelling like a rose.So there you have it.We love all you wonderful people.Ciao,Me",
