The only Down side is that the water has to be very hot in order for it to feel hot enough. I\u2019m guessing due to the thickness of the rubber. I actually heat water in the microwave to fill it if I have time. Otherwise I just use the hottest tap water. The bottle does handle the heated water with no problem. I definitely recommend this product.",
