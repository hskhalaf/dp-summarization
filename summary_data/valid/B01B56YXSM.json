The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the way it's designed, there's a wedge on the back side that, when you strap this to a tree, tilts the feeding trough up and out. But unfortunately it also presses the back side of the lid snugly against the tree which makes it difficult to remove and replace the lid.",

It attaches to a tree eaily and securely; so no need for a separate stand. Angling it very slightly, when attaching allows for easy access to the cover for refilling. As other reviewers have mentioned, the top cover bends easily so you need to handle it with care.and make sure that it is tightly shut to prevent wind from blowing it off. I also found it best to fill the bottom tray first and then add to the top to prevent excess spilllage on the ground.",

After a couple of weeks the squirrels had chewed big holes in the top trying to get in. At this point I replaced the removable lid with plywood that extended several inches out from the edges of the feeder. This solved my problem, at least for now, and my modified larger plywood top is also keeping the feed drier here in rainy western Washington. Basically, if you have squirrels, you are either going to make some modifications or use a lot of duct tape covering squirrel holes.",
