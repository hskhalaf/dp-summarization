Overall it is sketchy that I have received a product not in the original packaging, although it was advertised as a genuine pair of Dr. Martens boots. Lastly, the fabric part on the right shoe is stretched out already, even though I have not even tried it on. Disappointed. Pictures are attached.",

Great shoe, does take a little longer to break in. The sole is not thick the way typical doc martens are, so they do not come across as clunky and do not look like combat boots.

Wanted to exchange for a size 7 but price went up significantly so I\u2019m going to hold for now. I am returning these but the quality of these shoes is great. I see why this brand gets so many great reviews however definitely do research the sizing. Based on my experience I would say go 1 size down from your norm especially since they are leather and will loosen up even more over time.",

I've been walking through snow and over icy sidewalks and while they aren't super grippy they do have decent traction. I've been using the Dr. Martens wonder balsam for protecting the leather.
