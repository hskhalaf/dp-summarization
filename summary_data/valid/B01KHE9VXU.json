This is a super fun bike (yes, as an adult female who is 5'4\", I have driven this bicycle a few times. :-). It rides super smooth and spins fast. The position low to the ground makes it stable enough it will not tip over. My 3 year old is a little to short to drive it yet, but my 5 year old daughter rides this daily and all the neighborhood kids beg to ride it as well. I will be purchasing a second one for my son as soon as he is tall enough to reach the pedals.",

They all ride this trike and love it, just like the last one. They all have bikes that go faster, but they really enjoy these things. His last Razor trike lasted 3 years of hard and steady use by multiple kids before the seat broke. So, I hope this one lasts at least that long. I think it's a good value.",

The spinning is super cool and he was completely surprised and impressed. I did paint the frame neon green with a sparkle green coat on top to make it look cooler. I thought the look was kind of bleh, plus his favorite color is green, so I am the best Aunt ever! He will no longer ride his other bikes because this one is his favorite and it does tricks. Size wise I think he will be able to use it until he's about 10.",

I figured the boys were going to wear it out so I got the used one. When it arrived it was still in plastic, had the original tags on it and had no wear on the wheels. It was a brand new bike. So...not only do all the kids love these but I got a bonus price. Thanks, Amazon!",

      "text": "My husband and I are struggling with this. We ordered this for our boys and unless they are on a perfectly flat surface, these are a bit dangerous to ride... Because with any sort of little slope, the trike starts spinning and rolling backwards and there is no way a seven year old can peddle fast enough to go against the slope that is pulling him backward. We don't get it, we also don't get the stellar reviews. Unclear what is going on here.",
