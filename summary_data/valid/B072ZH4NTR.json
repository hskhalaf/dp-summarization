I find it inconvenient because I like to use the right one until it runs out of power then put it in the case for charging and using the left one. These earbuds do not let you do this because the left one is useless when the right one is in the charging case.",

(1) Never were truly a \"comfortable\" fit in the ear - tolerable - but would noticeably lose their comfort after an hour, at which point it would bother me to have them in. Tried all 6 combinations of sizing/build. (2) Using the buttons on the ear buds, if you have your phone inaccessible, is borderline painful.",

After 30 days of daily use, I finally purchased the COMPLY Brand ear Tips designed for my Jabra Elite Sport wireless earphones. Additional $20.00. But, finally this product has achieved my 5 Stars ! I sweat more than most people during my 10K runs and 20 to 25 miles bikes and this product stays in my ear without any adjustments. But WORKS BEST WITH THE COMPLY BRAND tips. I only wish Jabra would have included the COMPLY BRAND PRODUCT just as their competitors have in this product category!",

If you wear them for hours on end they might not be the most comfortable, but is by no means a dealbreaker. the sound quality is good but I\u2019ve seen some complaints on other comments and for me it wasn\u2019t anything that would stop me from buying them again. Battery life is good. I would buy them again",
