    "description": "Saucony Zealot ISO 3 Running Shoes The Saucony Zealot ISO 3 delivers maximum cushioning at a minimal weight with dynamic, foot-hugging ISOFIT in a low-profile package to help push you further than ever before. ISOfit Upper As part of the ISO-Series, the Zealot features an ISOFIT upper. Designed with an ultra-soft inner crafted from malleable air mesh, the upper guarantees that air permeates the exterior, allowing ventilated air to cool the feet when temperatures rise. Add to that a floating support cage and the Zealot adapts to the contours of the wearer's feet, increasing the responsiveness of the shoe. Capitalising on the consumers' needs, a revolution in fit has been engineered with supreme breathability and pliability. FlexFilm technology is also incorporated into the upper to provide an exoskeletal support frame for unparalleled strength and comfort. FlexFilm is heat melded to the upper, which reduces the amount of stitching and creates a soft, almost seamless surface against the runner's foot. When the laces are tied, the FlexiFilm overlays tighten to secure your foot in place and minimise any unwanted movement for an unbelievably stable run. Everun/PWRGRID+ Midsole Everun cushioning is three times more durable than Saucony's standard cushioning, and it delivers a greater energy return to put a spring in your step whilst you run. The cushioning is placed closer to your foot for increased responsiveness, and therefore provides a smoother transition through the gait cycle than this shoe's ancestors. The Zealot ISO 3 also features a PWRGRID+ midsole, which offers 20% more cushioning than its predecessors. The optimised materials and geometry employed by Saucony work with the runner's stride to promote a more efficient run. The blend of the ISOFIT upper and PWRGRID+ midsole along with the 4mm offset allow the Zealot to perform immaculately over a wide range of distances. The Everun topsole and PWRGRID+ midsole work in unison to provide a stunning ride",
