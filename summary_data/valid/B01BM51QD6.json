Haven't had to use it yet, but love the idea of providing start functions for a dead battery!",

The only thing that I can figure happened is this: When the charger started charging it showed on the display the amperage. It kept rising and when it reach 25 amps the charger shut off and the battery was not charged. It stated on the charger that the max output was 25 amps, but I did not think that the charger would shut down when 25 amps was reach. If anyone has any explanation please let me know. I would not purchase this charger until this problem has been explained.",

The state of charge guage is like a car fuel guage. I would prefer a real digital readout in numbers but I can live with it. I feel for the money its a good charger. In a couple of months I'm going to buy another one for my Florida home.",

I checked the owners manual, and it said nothing about problems with the unit. I called customer support and the rep said there was nothing to do except send it to a service center. Too bad this unit was completely unreliable.",
