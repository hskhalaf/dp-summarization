      "text": "First of all, I really like the way this reel looks and feels. Pulled in a stripped base with no problem and the drag works nicely. Throws really well with light jigs. The extra large handle feels really nice when fishing for long period of time. I also love the zero reverse one way clutch bearing which gives me solid hooksets. I got the XY1000 with gear ratio of 5.1.1 which is plenty for me since I'm not looking to reel the fish in fast but to enjoy the moment of reeling them in. The 13+1BB makes the reeling very smooth and I can really enjoy the \"fishing\".",

I have caught pike, bass, steelhead, salmon and catfish using them. Great quality, amazing price!!!",

Having said all that, look at the price! For the price, she is a winner! Compared to high end gear, she comes up short.

Have had for over a year with no freshwater issues, haven't used in saltwater. Good, smooth functioning reel and drag. When Penn parts cost as much or more than this reel why not spend my hard earned money on this for less headache.",

Here are the cons, the handle/knob on handle are too big/awkward in my opinion. 2,two, and maybe not even a con, the reel has a lower retrieval rate. I would not recommend this for spinner bait usuage because it is difficult to retrieve it fast enough to keep bait in the top water sweetspot. I would probably give this reel 3.5 stars, but rounding up to 4 because it feels solid and has a smooth retrieve for the money",
