I also like the addition of the bright LEDs that turn on when you press the trigger and the bit set that comes with it. It also has a bright flashlight on the bottom of the handle. I've used the TACKLIFE cordless screwdriver drill for driving screws throw aluminum and drywall with ease. Also, I use the drills low torque settings for removing delicate computer screws when I'm repairing or upgrading PC systems.",

I wanted to keep this in the kitchen drawer. The LED lights are very good and torque control works for most smaller screws. So, overall a pretty nice driver. I wanted a more compact tool so I went with the WORX WX270L 8V Cordless Impact Forcedriver. This is a little \"Beast\" due to the impactor technology and more compact as well. It's $10 more but it fits in the average countertop drawer and will drive virtually and screw you throw at it.",

I can't attest to battery life, but the construction seems to be solid. The clutch is a nice feature, but it seems to be very \"tight\". (even at the lowest setting, it doesn't slip).

      "text": "The TACKLIFE electric driver is a nice unit, and the price is right. I bought an additional set of socket drivers for it. There are a couple of weak points: * The speed is fixed. You can't slow down as screw reaches full depth. * Even with the clutch set to the highest level, it starts slipping (clicking) on screws that require good force. I'm talking about a 1\" # 8 screw into pine -- not a #12 into oak. It's easy to finish the task with a screwdriver, but it ought to have enough force for that.",
