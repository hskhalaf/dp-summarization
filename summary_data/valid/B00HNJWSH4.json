      "text": "We love this action cam, and it saved quite a bit over buying a Go Pro. The image quality is great for picture and video. We bought it primarily for a winter family vacation. I was able to take the footage and make movies with credits, music, slo-mo....a lot of cool things that I have no experience in. They came out great and everyone enjoyed watching them. I have also used this underwater and it worked great there as well. I'm not sure how it does biking/surfing etc., but it did work great for snorkeling, sledding, skiing, and normal back-yard type stuff. I would highly recommend this camera to any family.",

It does have somewhat of a fisheye lens around the edges but the stabilization feature is well worth it compared to other cameras. I recommend using the PNY U3 Turbo Performance 64GB High Speed MicroSDXC with it though. I purchased some different cards first and they didn't work. Once I found this card I stuck with it. It has a fast enough write speed that allows you to use Pro mode and the higher HD modes. Hope this helps!",

The remote can be use but not really necessary cause the screen is way too small and if you are on a bike, cannot take a look all the time. Also the quality is wonderful, the only disadvantage is that you are required to free Sony software to download videos and edit it on the computer. To watch on any Sony TV, a micro-HDMI cable is enough. Purchased cause this is affordable action cam, not like the other square camera that everybody loves.",

While the Go Pro is an amazing camera as well, there are many other features that this has that go pro does not. The image stabilization is sensational! The High speed setting (480 at 240fps!!!) is crazy!!! The comparison of this camera to GoPro is like an Apple vs Andoid device. When it comes to mounts and such, the market makes everything for GoPro, just like most phone accessories are for Apple. However, buy the Drift Go Pro mount adapter and a go pro mount accessory kit and you are ready to go!! I would definitely buy this again!",

For me at least. I also wanted more than one so the price here was in my favour. I tried the gopro on a motorcycle helmet and I felt the air pushing my helmet to the left due to having the gopro camera mounted there. After trying this one, I found out the problem isn't that evident like the gopro. So I bought this one. I'm not dissing the gopro though. I'm neutral here. I strongly Recommend.",

While it still has a wide angle lens, it does not seem as fish bowled as the Go Pro. The fact that you can view it on your Smartphone, has interval pictures, and regular pictures is great added features. Small enough that I could keep it in my wetsuit, and then pull it out when I needed it. The only Con I can think of was battery life. If I tried to go more than on than one day, the battery would die. Just got to the point where I recharged it every night.",

Sony easily beats go pro in every aspect except for a slight reduction in quality during lighted conditions. Better price, has video stabilization, long battery life, splash proof, comes with a case included so you don't have to buy it separately, you can connect it to an iPhone or many smart phones. Overall, I'm really satisfied with it.",

Bought it mainly because of high bitrate XAVC S codec and good price. Using it for areal video on a multicopter @60P with a modified lens since the stock lens is too wide that the distortion is way too much. The image stabilisation does get rid of distortion because the FOV becomes 120 degree but then image quality takes a serious hit. Overall an excellent camera for the money.",

The slow motion capabilities are fantastic as well. With a few extra batteries, I can take off for a few days and not worry about being near a charger. It's hard to imagine a better value for the money.",

It's a bit grainy and I wasn't totally expecting that. But you get what you pay for with cameras. If you want something close to being HD, go with the Sony HDRAS 200 or higher. I've used this Wasabi power battery pack and charger and the batteries work and charge with two extras since the camera came with one.",

The live view remote is very convenience to allow you to frame your shot but the camera lens is very wide so without a live view remote you can pretty much get everything intended in view. The battery life on the remote is great but the battery life on the camera is not. I spent about 2 hours at the playground and used the remote to start/stop the camera quite often, The battery indicator on the remote still had about 60% after about 2 hours of shooting however the battery one the camera was completely drained. Extended battery is a must.",
