Would recommend if have large feet and walk quite a bit. They are sorta mesh so will breathe quite well but not good keeping heat if in colder area.",

However, the mesh tears in 6-8 months usage (~500 miles) even though I keep my toenails cut flush with my toe. I wish the company would use a more long-enduring material for the upper.",

Bought regular width. No complaints yet. He is active and puts sneakers through challenging wear; can update in a while after he has used them for his everyday training.

ASICS could well learn to market these shoes in conservative colors to older people with foot problems. The 2E width fitting contributes to the comfort in my case.",

Plus, these are extra wide which are hard to find in running shoes. The backs do not rub on my heals and they breath great. They are a bit pricey to me, but I think that's just how good running shoes are. I'm running in these 2-3 times/week on pavement.",
