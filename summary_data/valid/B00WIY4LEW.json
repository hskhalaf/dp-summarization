The first time I used it, I used it all over my body(not rubbing it on my body but onto my hands and then thoroughly washing my hands after each body part(especially careful to wash the area of the ringworm LAST)), and it ended up causing really bad pimples to pop up on my chest and shoulder. This is the most expensive stinky soap I've ever bought. And it most definitely hasnt helped the ringworm:(",

Especially great for those afflicted with skin breakout problems (regular acne, oil acne from coming in contact with industrial machines, folliculitis and bacterial skin infections). Saw improvement and healing within a few uses! Make sure to let the soap lather sit on your skin for a few minutes before washing off. Great lather, smells like eucalyptus, skin feels refreshed after using. Caution when using after shaving, will burn a little since pores have been opened. Only complaint is how costly it can be for a bar of soap, but to us it is very worth it. Love this stuff, ordering more today.",

After noticing how bad it had gotten I immediately stopped using it and started using tea tree body soap from the body shop.

      "text": "Minor help with itching but I really learned to like this soap. It takes very little to suds-up a wash cloth in the shower. The fragrance is nice for a guy in my view and I prefer it to my old soap. It is worth the a try if looking for an alternative to modern day soaps. My dermatologist recommended Dermend Moisturizing Anti Itch Lotion and this has really helped.",

There is no medical treatment other than Presnidone, a harsh drug. Defense Soap seems to be mild enough, yet does a good job on my sensitive areas; underarms, pelvis, adjacent to the genitals. I have searched for creams and lotions, spending copious funds, but the Defense Soap does help the itching and outbreaks.",

Defense soap has good lather and scent, rinses off easily, and does not leave you feeling like left over residue on your skin after shower. It quickly worked on both foot fungus and jock itch at our house which is a huge bonus as we do not like the feeling of creams, lotions, or the spray on powders. I found it to somewhat leave skin feeling drier, but to be fair, I would rather have a soap my house will use and works as advertised over somewhat drier skin any day.",
