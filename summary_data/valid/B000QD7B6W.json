That is something I can't say about any of the other 4 brands of routers/modems I've had so getting another DIR-615 was a no-brainer for me. I run speed tests now and then to see how our 15meg fiber service is performing. Our provider guarantees 15meg service at all times and it has never varied. These routers show NO band width degradation. I'm thinking about buying another to have on hand.",

I bought this router in January 2012 to replace a Buffalo Technology Air Station Wireless Router WZR-HP-AG300H that is pre-confirgured to use DD-WRT. The Buffalo router was difficult to configure so I send it back and bought the D-Link 615 E3 instead. The D-Link router was easy to flash with the DD-WRT firmware and is working well. The signal is decent and comparable with other routers in its class. If you are looking for a router for OpenVPN at a low price,then the D-Link 615 E3 is a good choice. Hope this review will help other shoppers who would like to explore OpenVPN, but having challenges choosing the right router.",

It probably performs well after it is installed, but the installation wizard didn't work for me with set up, and tech support told me it would have to be manually installed. They tried walking me through that. To make matters worse it was hard to understand the people I spoke with at tech support because of their strong foreign accents.",

I bought it used, but couldn't find anything wrong with it, not even a scratch. No heating issues with day-long continuous usage. (I switch it off at night.) Wireless works fine in a studio. Not tested for a larger space. Have owned it for about a month and am very satisfied. It's unobtrusive and just works. I like that in a router :-)",
