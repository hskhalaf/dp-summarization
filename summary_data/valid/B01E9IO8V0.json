What I like about this heat mat is the fact that it has an appropriate power density for reptile heating - meaning that it does not get too hot at room temp even w/o a thermostat (but please use one of course.) The size - the 10\" x 20.5\" - is great for a sizeable tub. A similar pet store heat pad would cost 3 or 4 times as much, and this one works perfectly.",

Leaving the seedlings on the mat produced 2nd real leaf sets 65% faster than the set not on the mat. The test I describe took place in Florida and not in some dark and frigid Northern hinterland where the ambient environment was inhospitable to new growth.",
