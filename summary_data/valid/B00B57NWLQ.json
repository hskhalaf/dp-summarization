I love the little light it has, because sometimes I may not be in adequate lighting. This is definitely a watch you will want if you are a nurse, someone in the medical field, or someone who just wants a reliable watch!",

It has military time and the light shows the time beautifully for those moments when I may be in a patients room. I did a lot of research on which watch to get. Even though some may say it doesn't matter but I prefer the accuracy of the digital time view and product itself in terms of color and size fits exactly as described.",

I love that it lights up as well. I've used the stopwatch and that works great, I haven't used any of the extra fancy features but as everything immediately important is fine I assume they would be too. Durable and definitely waterproof so far (2 weeks in, and I'm not easy on my possessions). For $22, you get a lot I think. I would expect to pay a lot more than that for a watch as nice as this one seems so far.",

Functionally the watch has been solid.",
