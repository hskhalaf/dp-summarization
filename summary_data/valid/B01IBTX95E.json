After wearing arches, foot supports and doing stretching exercises, I still had a dull ache in my feet. I was tired of that ache, and happened across socks and arch supports on Amazon. I chose these arch supports, and am glad I did. I wear them at home while doing my housework. After a couple of days, I noticed that my feet no longer ache! I am so excited! For the first time in 5 years, I am pain free!",

This one fits better as I can adjust the strap. The slip on one is OK but the gel support is a little soft. This one is much better. I even recommended it to a friend for her husband.

They do help somewhat with short-term plantar fascitis pain relief, but they don't take away the pain completely, and they're not good with long-term relief.

After several months of 100+ miles per, I started to get pretty significant heel pain from what appears (to this former massage therapist) to be plantar fasciitis. Self-care only provided minimal relief. Then I found these and have been really impressed with how they gently stretch the plantar fascia, reducing the pressure (and pain) on my heels. They are well made, the gel pads withstand being walked upon all day and they fit nicely into shoes. I also like that they come with three thicknesses of pads if/as you need to increase or decrease the pressure. Totally recommend these!",
