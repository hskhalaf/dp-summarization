      "text": "I bought the same brand as I received in the hospital because of the quality. I thought this would be exactly the same and it is not. 1-the flat black portion of the jaw is smooth and mine from the hospital is ridged which seems to work a little better. 2-it is longer than the one from hospital and being 5'1\" makes it a little awkward for me to grab the object from the jaw. 3-the one from the hospital being shorter makes me have to bend my knees to pick something up off the floor so I thought the longer one would be better. In conclusion, they both have good and bad but both are good quality grabbers.",

You don't realize how much you use them, until you don't have them. And if it didn't come with a little piece of rubber tubing on the end of the pincer, get it you pick up anything with that on there even a dime lying flat. In my header I wrote \" Looks low tech.
