      "text": "Ive tried several different brands/versions of protein powder and this is the best by far! It tastes great, even when only mixed with water (I mix one scoop with 20oz water). Also, lots of healthy protein! Whey tends to upset my stomach and plant based soy tastes like chemicals to me. Not to mention, some brands have a service size of TWO SCOOPS to get what one scoop of Six Star provides. This will be a regular in my diet. Only gripe...please make the package smaller.....making a huge package that is only half full when you open it? Why are so many brands doing this? Its not fooling anyone.....either fill it or make it smaller. Thanks!",

I did a lot of research and found two options that were popular with people in the same situation: this and a weight loss powder with vitamins, but less protein. I tried both and the Six Star is definitely the best for people who prefer Soy over Whey or other protein types. The taste is close; the texture is a touch more grainy, but nothing big. It seem to digest better than the EAS, which is a bonus.",
