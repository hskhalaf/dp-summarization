I went to a local store and it helped me realize how not amazing quality these shin guards were.",

      "text": "These were exactly what our daughter needed for her Upwards soccer matches... being a smaller kid in the middle school age range means those girls kick HARD! These were great to help protect her, especially when she was playing goalie. The only reason I went with 4 out of 5 stars is that they seem to run small and I am afraid they won't even fit next season. Maybe I can sneak them under one of her younger brothers' socks next year?",
