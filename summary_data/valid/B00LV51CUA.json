      "text": "Yes my wife and I love JBL products we have an issue with the silicone ear piece coming off. I have been in contact with JBL but their solution is to send the unit back instread of replacing the ear piece. I purchase the first set of JBLs from a box store...my wife tried them and we then purchase the next set through Amazon. But we both lost one of the ear pieces. Great sound and great microphone when using the phone, clarity. Highly recommend them. Just use caution with ear pieces because of the softness of the material they grab and come off. They do stay in your ear well.",

      "text": "I purchased these headphones for the gym, riding my bike, and running. They perform really well; they are light, sound great, fit comfortably in my ear (three sets of ear fittings are included), and don't budge once they are in there. They also do a great job of sealing out sound, so much so that if you wear them while riding, running, etc on the street, you will not hear the bus that's about to run you over. They are great, but not safe for street use.",

I put a pair of over the head ear protectors over top for greater hearing protection and not cranking the volume but also to try and anchor the ear buds but they would fall out. I tried coiling the wire around my ears and still no luck. These are an amazing fit, the sound, and the ability to stay in. I haven't mowed yet but they were perfect while snow blowing.",

Specifically, in Google Music it skips to the next song for no reason. I tried using them on a different phone (Droid Bionic), and it kept trying to make a call. It's frustrating and annoying. I tried other headphones on the same phones and have had no problems, so I know that these headphones are the crux of the problem.",
