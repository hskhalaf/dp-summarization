The difference is the way they feel in the hand, the quality texture of sound and projection onstage. The vertical grip provides an easier ability to add little rolls and colors in between the cadence. They just feel right and are manipuated so much easier than traditional maraca's. I have the studio and live version. Each has it's own texture and volume according to the setting. I have used both live on stage in a variety of venues and they always cut through the mix.",

Definitely a good cajon to start out with, and it has served me well with worship in the virtual Christian fellowship setting (thanks to coronavirus) and at random campfire worship sessions!

      "text": "I bought the Meinl Cajon Box Drum with Internal Snares for a daughter-in-law who really wanted a musical instrument like a drum to simply enjoy creating rhythms with her hands. A musician friend has a Meinl cajon that he made from their kit. It sounded so neat! I purchased it for her as a Christmas gift. She loved it, and it is great to play! It is very well made and does everything they advertised.",

      "text": "I'm no expert, but i was really impressed at the sound and build quality of the cajon. Based on specs, I was concerned that this particular one was a little smaller than others, but the volume is fine and sound/timbre possibilities are super cool. It's a good choice that will work with kids and adults. It was easy to rate this a 5 star. Thanks!",

They are also very comfortable to hold. Highly recommend.",

It's quality construction is impeccable with nicely mitered seams. It looks great too, the two tone look offered byt the birch front makes it very attractive. The size is perfect. It's large enough to offer great sound yet small enough to be easily portable. The sound is great, offering several different tones depending on how you play it.

    "description": "Color:JC50LBNTThe Meinl Jam Cajon is perfect for playing on the go. Its compact design is lightweight and easy to carry to drum circles, unplugged gigs or wherever you want to enjoy playing. The size makes it ideal to grab and go for spontaneous jam sessions and has every feature of a standard size MEINL Cajon. Crafted in Europe from birch wood, the Jam Cajon has great low end punch when played near the center and dishes out high frequency \"slaps\" when striking the top corners. Two sets of internal fixed snare wires brush against the playing surface to deliver a crisp, sensitive snare effect. The finish lets the beautiful natural wood grain show through, and the birch construction produces a rich sound that goes with any style music.",

    "feature_bullets": [
      "Create drum set grooves with bass and snare notes using your hands \u2014 the wood playing surface has two zones for bass and snare \u2014 play with your hands toward the center for deep bass or strike near the top corners with your fingers for crisp snare sounds",

      "Internal snares \u2014 dual sets of internal fixed snare wires are positioned against the inside of the playing surface to give you the same effect as a snare drum \u2014 these snare wires are held in place with a thin mesh strap that leaves the tone unaltered",
      "Made in Europe (light brown finish) \u2014 constructed with 100% Baltic birch wood, a wood type commonly found in high end drum set construction for its superb natural acoustic qualities that give you plenty of definition with deep bass and cutting high tones",
