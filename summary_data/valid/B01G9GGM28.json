While I think the GMSS is a product that works for me, I have a hard time keeping it in all night because my teeth painfully dig into the top and bottom of my tongue. Enter the Professional Dental Guard. This product works, fits, and feels better than expected! It's thin, custom, and comfortable. For the price, you can't beat it! Give this product a shot and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

I'm afraid I will pull caps off or even break teeth. So I ordered these dental guards. Although I have molded guards previously, I watched the video that came in the box. It was quite helpful. And there are four guards in the box which is a bargain. The guard molded great. I have worn it two nights and like it. I didn't trim on it as I used to the adult sport mouth guards. It's great. I would highly recommend it.",

I still have two of the smaller ones which I will probably allow my children to use for sports. All in all a good purchase at a good price for what appears to be a quality product.",

      "text": "My husband and I tried tag-teaming these and messed up both pairs even when following directions. When it got boiled, it got really wide and the ends shrunk shorter. They float, so the walls don't really start to curve unless you gently Pat it down into the water. Without biting down, this guard would not stay in place well enough for my husband to get anywhere near a decent fit before it cooled. I'm not super happy, to say the least.",

I ordered the Dental Duty mouth guard. It was delivered promptly. It was easy to shape to fit my mouth, but I messed up one of the guards. The product comes with a replacement guarantee. I contacted the company and was promptly issued an entire new kit. Great customer service!! The guard is helping with my TMJ issues and aiding in getting a better night\u2019s sleep as well!!",

Very comfortable and they work perfectly. 4 in a box so I usually change to a new one every 6 months. Easy to mould especially after doing it once. My teeth feel much better in the morning when I wear this at night.",
