The color is very sheer: more like a tinted lip balm instead of a lipstick, per se. Give time to \"melt\" on lips and a faint shimmer and slight shine appears. I think NARS discontinued this line of lipstick... since great price here and not available on NARS website. Personally speaking, I have gotten just as good or better lipsticks than this at the drugstore. Good shipping though. Lipstick did arrive new and unopened. Just remember: very sheer tint and very subtle shimmer. Perhaps, that is what you are looking for..",
