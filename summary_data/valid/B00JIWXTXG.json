I'm all for smaller, lighter, quieter in a full-frame and this fits the bill. So far, as expected, continuous autofocus doesn't seem a match for cameras like the Nikon D3s and D600 but I'm trying a Sony A-Mount 70-300 with an adapter and that is fairly speedy.",

I don't use this camera much for stills since I need the extra megapixels for my commercial clients.

    "description": "Color:Black| Configuration:BaseFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPresenting the world\u2019s smallest and lightest1 full frame interchangeable lens camera. With a groundbreaking 35mm large pixel image sensor rated at 15.3-stops of dynamic range and an ISO 409,600 sensitivity2, the \u03b17S reveals astonishing detail and color even in the dead of night. Video excels with Full Pixel Readout, a 4K-optimized sensor and uncompressed 4K output. Fast, intelligent autofocus completes the picture. \n\n\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\n35MM LARGE PIXEL IMAGE SENSOR WITH 15.3-STOPS OF DYNAMIC RANGE\nThe groundbreaking \u03b17S features a 12.2 effective megapixel 35mm Exmor CMOS sensor paired with a powerful BIONZ X image processor. The \u03b17S can shoot at a sensitivity range of ISO 100 \u2013 4096004 with low noise and unprecedented 15.3 stops of dynamic range. The extra-large pixels on the \u03b17S collect dramatically more light than traditional cameras to produce beautifully detailed, low-noise images in even the most challenging lighting environments.\n\n12.2MP SENSOR OPTIMIZED FOR 4K AND LOW LIGHT VIDEO\nThe \u03b17S is the world\u2019s first 35mm camera to incorporate \u2018direct pixel readout\u2019 utilizing the entire width of the full-frame image sensor without line skipping or pixel binning. Therefore in both HD and 4K video acquisition it can read and process data from every one of the sensor\u2019s pixels. This allows video shooters to utilize all of the artistic and creative benefits provided by the unique sensor.\n\nHIGH ISO UP TO 409,600 W/ FAST AF IN LIGHT AS LOW AS EV -4\nEquipped with the same high-precision Fast Intelligent AF system as the award-winning \u03b17R camera, the \u03b17S drastically improves AF sensitivity in low-light that can go as low as EV -4.\n\n\n\n\nNEW-GENERATION RGB FILTER WITH GAPLESS ON-CHIP LENS DESIGN\nThe larger than normal pixel size on the 35mm full-frame image sensor with effective 12.2MP, employs Sony\u2019s latest image sensor technologies on the \u03b17S. To boost the image sensor\u2019s light collection efficiency, a new-generation RGB color filter has been adopted, in addition to the gapless on-chip lens design, light concentration technology and photodiode expansion technology delivers unprecedented high sensitivity and low-noise levels with high dynamic range in every light condition from severe low light to bright sunlight. By applying an AR coating on the surface of the seal glass over the image sensor, ghosting and flare have been minimized, further contributing to the \u03b17S\u2019s high image quality.\n\nUNCOMPRESSED 4:2:2 FULL HD AND 4K QFHD OUTPUT VIA HDMI1\nIn video mode, the \u03b17S can output 4K video at QFHD (3840x2160) in 4:2:2 to an optional external 3rd party 4K recorder via the HDMI1.\n\n50MBPS XAVC S 1920X1080 AT 60P, 1280X720 AT 120P\nFor the first time ever in a Sony \u03b1 camera, the \u03b17S adopts the workflow-friendly XAVC S recording format in addition to AVCHD and MP4 codecs. XAVC S format allows for full HD recording at a data rate of 50 mbps with lower compression for improved video quality. The \u03b17S can record full HD (1920x1080) at frame rates of 60p, 60i, 30p and 24p directly to a compatible memory card. Video modes can be changed from full-frame to APS-C (super 35mm equivalent) if desired, and in this crop mode, the camera can support high frame rate 120fps shooting at standard HD resolution (1280 x 720p), creating a 5x slow-motion effect.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nSILENT SHUTTER MODE FOR DISCREET SHOOTING\nSilent shutter mode is ideal when discretionary shooting is required; like capturing a recital or wildlife. Activating the silent shutter eliminates the use of the mechanical shutter and therefore shutter noise by utilizing an electronic shutter in its place.\n\n3.0\" 1.23M DOT LCD TILTS FOR HIGH AND LOW ANGLE FRAMING\nThe tiltable 3.0\u201d (1,229k dots) Xtra Fine LCD Display makes it easy to photograph over crowds or low to capture pets eye to eye by swinging up approximately 84 degrees and down approximately 45 . Easily scroll through menus and preview life thanks to WhiteMagic technology that dramatically increases visibility in bright daylight. The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.\n\nSIMPLE CONNECTIVITY TO SMARTPHONES VIA WI-FI OR NFC\nConnectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi/NFC control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, \u03b17S also supports NFC (near field communication) providing \u201cone touch connection\u201d convenience when transferring images to Android smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control \u2014 a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone \u2014 connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.\n\nPRO-WORKFLOW W/ PICTURE PROFILE, S-LOG2 AND TIME CODE\nThe \u03b17S is equipped with S-Log2 gamma. Common to Sony\u2019s range of professional video cameras, S-Log2 expands the dynamic range by up to 1300% to minimize clipped highlights and loss of detail in shadows. The \u03b17S includes a picture profile that can adjust settings like gamma, black, level and color adjustment, and can be saved for use in a multi-camera shoot. It also has Full HD and 4K base band HDMI output, time code/user bit for easier editing, synchronous recording feature with compatible devices, various marker and zebra displays on both the LCD screen and viewfinder.\n\nAUDIO LEVEL CONTROLS, AAC/LINEAR PCM2, OPTIONAL XLR KIT\nThe \u03b17S has a Multi-terminal interface shoe that is compatible with Sony\u2019s XLR Adaptor Microphone Kits (XLR-K1M plus a new model under development), allowing the use of professional microphone systems.\n\nPLAYMEMORIES CAMERA APPS ALLOWS FEATURE UPGRADES\nPersonalize your camera by adding new features of your choice with PlayMemories Camera Apps. Find apps to fit your shooting style from portraits, detailed close-ups, sports, time lapse, motion shot and much more. Use apps that shoot, share and save photos using Wi-Fi that make it easy to control and view your camera from smartphone, and post photos directly to Facebook or backup images to the cloud without connecting to a computer.11\n\nHIGH CONTRAST 2.4-MILLION DOT XGA OLED TRU-FINDER EVF\nView every scene in rich detail with the XGA OLED Tru-Finsder, which features OLED improvements and the same 3-lens optical system used in the flagship Sony \u03b199 Full Frame DSLR.
