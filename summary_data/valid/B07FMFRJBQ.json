It holds liquid in just fine, though I wouldn't turn the bucket upside down while filled. Overall, great quality bucket.",

We had read lots of blogs saying a bucket with a seat and lined with a strong trash bag and sprinkled with kitty litter works great and can be disposed of in the trash instead of using the toilet which has to be taken to the dump station, emptied and cleaned. We ordered this bucket instead of a 5 gallon because it is a bit taller. I must say, it works really well. Sturdy and takes less floor space than the portable toilet we have.",

Hard to fit the holding/mounting ring onto the bucket, even used a rubber mallet to ensure that it was on tight. It would not make an airtight seal, I even resorted to using silicone sealant to try to seal the gap between the outside of the bucket and the mounting ring. I applied vaseline on the \"O\" ring on the screw on lid to make sure it sealed well, also. Very frustrating and not worth the effort to make it air tight.",
