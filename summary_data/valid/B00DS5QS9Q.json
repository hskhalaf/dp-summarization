I\u2019m using it to debark and shape several different types of wood ranging from soft cedar to very hard osage orange. It works well drawing at any speed and with the bevel blade, depth of cut is easy to control. It handles shaving off knots, etc. which take a lot more force than simply shaving bark. It gets the job done. I have no doubts this tool will last and perform well.",

I would definitely recommend As it is good quality for a Japanese knife, Though an authentic American draw knifes have the very best quality, This isn't bad",

Nice touch to include a blade guard. The only detraction was one spot about 1 1/4 inches where the factory grind on the bade was poorly done. Took a lot of wok to get that resolved and polish out the factory grind scratches. If the factory grind had been better, this would be five stars. I did not consider that to be sufficient reason to give a poor review. Any tool is going to have small issues, and will require the buyer to touch up and sharpen. This is to be expected.",

As a result, I can really only sharpen the center 3\" or so. That being said, once it's sharpened it does make quick work of stripping bark from slabs.
