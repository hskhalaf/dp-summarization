It is also good to remove the fur BEFORE washing to prevent putting a bunch of loose fur in the washer/dryer.",

This has made my life way better..... although its a bit expensive compare to the other ones but it is really worth it... thanks!!!!",

The great feature is that as the roller fills with lint, you just peal off a portion and have a clean, sticky piece. I would definitely buy this again if I need another one.

Not only is it extremely sticky, significantly larger, and easier to use than the traditional ones, but the price is lower as well. Now I just hope I can find the refills-I noticed some customers were having trouble ordering as they were not in stock. Regardless, I am so glad I decided to order this!!! It has already saved me so much time and eased my frustration-HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",
