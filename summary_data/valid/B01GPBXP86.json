Ladder is \"cheap\" as in it is plastic, but what other material would you wish it to be made from? I find the quality to be fine. The product works great, and nicely fits in the bag. Actually longer than most speed ladders I've used. I'd highly recommend this, especially for the price",

It certainly made our workout more fun especially since all of our drills prior have been without a ladder. Here's the thing. I don't know how durable the ladder is against cleats. My trainee and I were using tennis shoes because I feared of the possibility of the yellow plastic snapping. So if you use cleats, you might possibly chance breaking the plastic. Though when using tennis shoes, we did not have any problems. Hope this helps. We plan on continuing more ladder drills to help us become quicker. Moreso for my trainee, but I like running fast too.",
