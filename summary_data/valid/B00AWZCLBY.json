This is a really nice simple camera to operate and the pictures turned out so good I hardly even used my Nikon D40. I was able to shoot videos that were really great even though I was shaking while taking them, the clarity and colors were great. The only thing I would recommend is using a Eye-fi Card if you have an I-Pad, the viewing screen is small if you want to see the pics at the end of the day.",

I was able to use it right out of the box, then I just played with it for a little bit and I was able to figure it all out. So if your looking for a good camera that takes good pictures this is the one. Oh and the battery life is great, the kids always view the pictures right off the camera and I know on my Olympus camera that would just drain the ife right out battery.",

The PowerShot A2600 will keep on shooting with the new ECO Mode, which preserves power so you get more shots per charge. The versatile PowerShot A2600 can get you the shots you want, simply.\n\nHIGH RESOLUTION, HIGHLY ADVANCED PERFORMANCE\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR WITH DIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nWith the PowerShot A2600 digital camera's 16.0 Megapixels of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the 5x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution is ideal for creating the largest prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor powers the camera\u2019s advanced systems and features, ensuring fast, reliable performance with low battery consumption.\n\nDIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999.

The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.\n\nZOOM IN ON WIDER, STEADIER SHOTS\n5X OPTICAL ZOOM WITH 28MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS\nThe 5x Optical Zoom (35mm equivalent: 28\u2013140mm) in the PowerShot A2600 digital camera delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. It gives you a great range of potential images from a single location, which is perfect for sporting events and other occasions when your shooting stance is fixed, or times when moving in too close might disrupt the action you're trying to capture. The lens' 28mm wide-angle perspective puts more image in every frame for dynamic, exciting shots.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS\nSMART AUTO\nPhotographers of all levels appreciate a camera \u2013 especially a go-anywhere compact digital \u2013 that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot A2600 gives you Smart AUTO \u2013 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Live View Control Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls. Digital IS The camera digitally corrects image blur by analyzing the subject prior to choosing the best correction method. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Face Self-timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations. Fisheye Effect Now you can get the fisheye effect \u2013 a classic photographic distortion \u2013 without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Long Shutter Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography. Movie Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. GORGEOUS HD VIDEO FROM YOUR STILL CAMERA\n720P HD VIDEO\nYou can shoot high definition video anytime, anywhere right from the pocket-sized PowerShot A2600 digital camera. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you'll be able to instantly record every moment in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid, and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories. In addition to being able to shoot 720p HD video at 25 frames per second, the PowerShot A2600 can also shoot 640 x 480 VGA video at 30* frames per second.\n\n*Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON FOR EASY VIDEO CAPTURE\nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. To make shooting video as natural as snapping pictures, the PowerShot A2600 has a dedicated movie button. No need to plan ahead, no need to search through menus on the LCD screen; when you feel a moment would be best captured in 720p HD, simply press the button and recording begins. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want.\n\nSAY GOODBYE TO BLUR\nDIGITAL IS\nDigital IS beats the blur that mars many shots by recognizing the main subject, then automatically applying the camera shake correction that best suits the situation. If the subject is a person, blur reduction processing is performed. For landscapes, cityscapes and other still scenes, the camera takes 3 quick successive shots and composes them into a single clear image. If the subject is moving, the camera takes 3 successive shots, then automatically saves the clearest image.\n\nA CHARGE THAT LASTS AS LONG AS A MEMORY\nNEW ECO MODE HELPS REDUCE POWER CONSUMPTION FOR LONGER BATTERY LIFE\nThe PowerShot A2600 takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated via a dedicated button for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won't miss the moment. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the evening, ECO Mode on the PowerShot A2600 makes sure your camera keeps up.\n\nMORE WAYS TO GET CREATIVE\nSCENE MODES\nScene Modes are fun, easy ways to give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters. Super Vivid heightens and saturates colors for eye-popping intensity. Poster Effect eliminates gradations between colors for an illustrative feel. Miniature Effect enhances perspective in a scene, blurring the top and bottom to make it look as if it were created with miniature models. You can also make a quirky portrait using the Fisheye Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as it capturing the photo using a \"toy\" or pinhole camera.\n\nHELP YOU WON'T NEED HELP TO FIND\nHELP BUTTON\nThe PowerShot A2600 digital camera is designed to be fun and easy to use, even for beginners. A Help Button on the camera's exterior brings up the help menu any time you need it, right on the LCD screen. From here, you can scroll through a variety of topics that answer your questions with clear explanations, offer helpful shooting advice, and show you diagrams highlighting the position of any buttons you'll need.",
