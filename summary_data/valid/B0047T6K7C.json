Rated at 4 rather than 5 stars because the white one had a shelf support that had the screw in slightly the wrong place. I had to take out the single screw, drill a small hole adjacent to the original one and re-attach the support. 2 minute job, but if I didn't have a drill handy it would have been a problem.",

I'm noting this stuff, and would give a 4.5 star if I could, but I am pleased with it. In the pics it looks like it's meant to hold light stuff - and it is. The sorta-Craftsman design is well done. The 12\" on a side is accurate.",

Beautiful, real wood, sturdy construction and very stable even stacked on carpeting. It comes with a bracket to mount to the wall, but with my heavy books on the bottom shelf I didn't need it. I was hoping these were similar to the ones I have seen used for displays in stores; they are EXACTLY like the ones I have seen. Very pleased and will most likely be ordering at least two more.",

I like the shelves because that were narrow enough to fit in my small space on either side of a window in my office. I also like the fact that they are wood an look nice. no assembly required and the reasonable price are other benefits. I wish they were a little more stable, they sway a little if you push them. I do not think they will fall over. I do need to figure out how to bracket them to the wall. I read the reviews carefully and was not surprised when they arrived.

The wood peg in the bottom center (you can see it in the picture) and 3. Snapping the top on. Now, it's not going to hold a 100 lb sculpture but It was only $28 and it looks good!",

The top shelf comes right off - the supplied rubber nobs should work but the holes where drilled to deep so 2 do not support the top shelf. Will try a wooden dowel or glue and update as I find out if this works. Hence 4 stars.",

The 4-tier design uses bolts and cross pieces that can be tightened to hold the sides together and make the shelf more stable. The 3-tier design uses plugs and brads or staples to hold the sides together permanently and there is no way to tighten the sides to make the shelf more sturdy.
