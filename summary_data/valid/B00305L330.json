I then tried just one and it wasn't good either. It binds up and floats to the top. It sounds disgusting but it looks and has the texture of something gross floating on your coffee. Maybe blended with just water in a blender would be better but reviews seemed to think I could do it straight in the coffee which is why I bought it. The taste is actually good, I just cant get past the coagulated goop floating in my java.",

The flavor isnt not appealing and the caffeine advertised is exaggerated. From a true coffee drinker and health conscious person. Bad choice. Also will ad unwanted calories for those wanting a nice cup of coffee and protein in the morning. I wish I could return the rest. What a waist of money.

The mocha is thicker than the others but not so much that it puts me off. The vanilla isn't bad, it's just not my cup of tea. :)",

      "text": "So good! I am not one who really likes the taste of protein drinks and this just taste like coffee to me it is really tasty. I mix it just with water and ice and it does not take away from the flavor at all. When I mix it with almond milk the consistency is a little too thick for me but the flavor is still good! Not gritty at all but I use a portable blender bottle to mix it. Only gave it 4 stars because like some said the container only comes a little more than halfway full with product.",

Also feel less bloated waking up in the morning. As a reference, I have been having the drink for breakfast, eating lunch at 1pm and then something lite for dinner. So I have ended up fasting anywhere from 5/8pm all the way until 1pm and have had great results.",
