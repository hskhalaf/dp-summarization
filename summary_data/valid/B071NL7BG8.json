I was walking home on the sidewalk, not perfectly smooth but not full of holes either.. just uneven here and there. Back wheel broke.. plastic ring in the wheel chipped off so I couldn't reattach. I had to remove the back wheels and struggle home using the front wheels. This is a nice cart but if you're not on the smoothest of sidewalks dont buy.",

She has a hard time walking and cannot lift heavy objects so this cart was a god send!!! Wish I had thought of it sooner. It was easy to assemble and is lightweight for her to lift into and out of the car. She is thrilled with its ease of use.",

One tip - the large wheels in the back of the cart roll a bit more easily over uneven surfaces than do the smaller front wheels, so if entering elevators or going over a bumpy area, we've found that it's better to pull the cart rather than push it so that the large rear wheels are leading.",

It is heaver than my previous cart so I chose a smaller size so when I fold it and lift it into the car it won't be as difficult to lift. If I didn't need to lift it I would have gotten a slightly larger one but this usually holds all the items from a shopping trip. It came with a lightweight liner which I was not expecting but is very helpful.",
