      "text": "The only reason I got these was because I couldn't find the el distrito converse at the time. For converse they are on the tight side especially in terms of width. I'm sure most people agree converse run quite big and wide (which is why i love them) but these dont. They're ok. Not really liking the suede detail in the front because it sort of makes the shoe look like it's dirty due to the tone difference in color.",

In the last six months, I have had to return shoes that were too small and get one size larger. I have worn the same size shoe since high school and shoes bought two years ago in that size still fit fine but new shoes oddly don't. Guess that I should stop buying online and make my lazy self actually visit a brick and mortar store.",

Let me also say that they look much better live, than in pictures. was expecting way worse product for 12 dollars, apparently, I was wrong! hope that they are durable as well. If so, may get another one!",
