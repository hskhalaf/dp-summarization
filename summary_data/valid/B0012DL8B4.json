      "text": "This poor rating is reflective of Conair's return policy and not Amazon. Since the item stopped working after a few months, I contacted Conair directly because it was beyond Amazon's standard return period. It was covered by warranty BUT user needs to pay shipping and handling to return the item to manufacturer as well as return shipping to get the replacement. This turns out to be MORE than the item is worth! I will be shopping for another hair dryer -- probably at a standard brick and mortar store (in case of any future return problems) but one thing is certain -- it won't be a Conair product.",

It is small but did a great job on the low setting (only low used with the 240 wattage). I am home and have switched it back to 110 wattage and can use here. Hair dryers were not available at all hotels/B&B's we stayed at; would definitely recommend taking a dryer on any trips outside the US.",

As a matter of fact it is a safety hazard! High sounded like low and low was nonexistent. I have fine thin hair and don't need much so I thought what the heck; I'm not over drying my hair. That burning wire smell increased the more I used it and I only use it once or twice a week. Seriously, the last time I plugged it in to use it, and looked in the front, there was flame!!!

Sadly it was a smell that will never go away.... Thank you Conair and please don't ever stop making these.",

And it's a good thing I don't want any cooler air because the \"cool\" button is one you have to hold in constantly. Update: I ordered this Remington dryer instead:  It is SO MUCH better than this Conair. Remington has a hot setting that works, actually multiple heat and fan settings. Get it instead of the Conair.",

One year of use isn't so bad I guess, but what scared me was that ALL of the wires in the handle were similarly exposed and partly cut. If they had happened to touch, probably it would have caught on fire. I would avoid this product or at the very least, don't fold and unfold it every day.",
