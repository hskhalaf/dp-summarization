For me, an avid puzzler, it was about an easy to medium level in terms of toughness.",

They also tape the sides of the box down which forces you to peel off some of the pretty covering of the box, as well. Plastic wrap or some sort of damage-free means of securing the top to the box would have been ideal.",
