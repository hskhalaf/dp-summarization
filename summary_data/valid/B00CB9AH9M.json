I'm very happy with my purchase and I've been wearing it ever since. the design is simple and modern and that's why I love this watch. I thought it might be hard to match with different clothes but it is not. It will go both with casual and dressy styles. the size of the watch is perfect for me, not too small,not too big. I don't know long the white band is gonna last for me, but so far I'm very happy! BONUS: It is solar and I can stop spending money on changing batteries!",

The supple leath seems to wrap around my wrist well. I had to use the second to last hole. I like that it had two strap placement holder thingies (one right after the clasp thing and an adjustable one so that the extra room on the strap isn't just flapping around). Definitely recommend for the chic in all of us.",
