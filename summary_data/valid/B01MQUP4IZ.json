I have contacted Wacom multiple times, and uninstalled/installed the software per their instructions. This has been going on for 9 months now. They have confirmed it is a software issue so a new tablet would not fix the problem. There is still no fix 9 months later. They informed me there is no ETA for a fix either. So... that's it. I paid for a brick tablet and Wacom can't help. Do not buy this model or any Wacom model which uses these drivers.",

The best biggest issue is that more often than not, the dial responds erratically to even light tickets, brush size and zoom increasing and decreasing rapidly for up to 30 seconds after just a second-long touch. And last is the price. My Huion was $80 and worked much more reliably with equal specs. I will not be purchasing from Wacom again.",

      "text": "I bought this for a second computer. I have a 3 year old Wacom tablet that still works great. This newer model is sleeker, easy to install...had it up and running in minutes. The price was good, the construction is smooth and solid, the pen holder/nib storage is beautifully machined. Reaction time of pen from tablet to screen is fast, so drawing is much more intuitive. For the money, i like this tablet a lot",

One small note about the table is that the 4 corners that mark the working area doesn't not glow like the INTOUS 4, therefore don't be surpised. Over all the table it's great in both design and functionality. i strongly suggested it on top of the 4.",

I've had it only a few months and it's given me nothing but problems, including a weird delay issue, and, most recently, suddenly and randomly not registering pen pressure. I've been on the phone with their support people multiple times and tried all their fixes, even resetting all of my Photoshop preferences, but nothing works. Highly, highly disappointed and frustrated with this purchase. Would not recommend.",
