They are soft and pliable and look great with jeans. I take between a size 8.5 and 9 and bought the 9 so I could have room for a thicker sock. They are perfect.",

I'm usually a 9 so I got a 9.5 and I feel like I could have gotten a 10 or 10.5 (which they don't make) they were very tight in the footbed but the length was good. I have what my family calls pencil feet because they're so skinny and long. I'm going to risk it and get the 10 as I plan to exchange them. They're adorable and for real hard work at the same time ( I work at a wholesale greenhouse) I'm excited to get the 10s. Man I hope they fit.",

I also like that the interior is pretty soft behind the leather. The only area I find them lacking in arch support. It's not a deal breaker for me, but for those who need more support, you might want to consider purchasing arch support insoles for them.",

      "text": "I returned these as they are SO ugly, and the quality was deplorable. The seams on the right boot at the top were missed altogether so they flapped. Poor quality control to say the least. There were strange scuff marks on the rubber as well, and they really just looked awful on me. If you're going to spend any money on duck boots, go for the original and the best, Sorel. I have absolutely nothing good to say about these.",
