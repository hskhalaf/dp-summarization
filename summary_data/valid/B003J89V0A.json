The rep from Rosewill tried to tell me they aren't responsible for any damage done as a consequence of manufacturing deficiencies because they didn't install the product. That is contradictory to the actual definition of products liability. I wouldn't use this in your computer unless you feel like risking an electrical fire.",

Newer technologies have advanced the need for forward thinking. This power supply has a large fan providing good air movement while not loud as in previous models. The design of the cable management allows you to only have cables inside the machine that needs to be there thus cutting down on clutter inside the machine that could bump into other fans, possibly causing fan stoppages on other devices like the CPU or GPU. I will buy from them again as the need arises.",

I advise others to spend a few extra dollars on something less awful.",

I am using this to replace a Corsair CX500 that started failing a month ago. That PSU has been getting noisier, and when using that PSU the system would experience random stability problems.

This is semi modular PSU, which was really good in my case, because the physical dimensions of this PSU were slightly larger than the previous one. It comes with plenty of cables to attach all your hardware. It also has Short-Circuit/Over-Current/Over-Voltage/Over-Power/Under-Voltage/Over-Temperature protections and a three year warranty. For this price, I'm impressed. I would definitely recommend this to anyone for a budget or mid-range gaming rig.",

The fan, while \"quiet\" enough was the loudest component in my new system. As something marketed as \"silent\" this is unacceptable. I took apart the unit and fan just to see since I replaced it with a Noctua and now my system truly is silent (at idle). Was amazed at how cheap this fan was as it doesn't even have bearings (just a bushing) and the plastic was so brittle it took little force to snap. Take this from someone who works as a system integrator dealing with Rosewill cases.... avoid.",

This PSU has a big and silent fan, the connection rack system makes all easy to install and helps to build your system in a very neat way. I dont actually need 650W for my system but bought it looking forward to upgrade GPU, cooling etc. So Im fine for now. Regarding the packaging, it was ok. The PSU arrived without a dent. The accesories, screws, cables well packed. The product seems like high quality. Time will tell..",

The modular cables are great for reducing clutter. However, I do think that the cables are a bit too stiff and can be a bit difficult maneuvering them around the appropriate spot. It's a fantastic product and I really recommend for any build.",
