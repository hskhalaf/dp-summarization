Anything beyond that causes the cursor to jump around the screen. And finally to add insult to injury, I can't return it for a refund. Spend a little more money, and buy a wireless mouse from a reputable brand, such as Logitech or Microsoft.",

I bought one a few years ago that I liked, but it wore out. I bought this one, took it out of the box, put in the dongle, DONE. It works great and feels great. I had medium to large woman's hands and it feels great. I would recommend this to any of my friends and family.",

I accidentally ordered two, but I'm happy enough with the product to not return the 2nd.

Two main issue: 1) the USB transceiver is almost impossible to pull out of the hole in the bottom of the mouse. Don't cut your fingernails, you'll need them to get this out (although you will then likely break them. 2) The On/Off switch is really difficult to move. Again if you don't have fingernails, you can't do this at all. Functionally it seems fine once everything is plugged in, etc. But you will be annoyed by how difficult they made this to use.",
