Amazing quality and then I queued up Us & Them by the Floyd. Gilmour and Wright never sounded so Good,The alto sax was a musical pleasure.these headphones never really distorted and had clear crisp highs and solid base tones. I have tracked this song a thousand plus times and has never sounded this good,highly recommend these quality Headphones you won't be disappointed.",

Now, the 2nd time I've actually used them, they're broken at the top of the headpiece. At least now they're tolerable to wear. The volume control doesn't actually work on a Windows computer either. They are nothing short of a waste of money. The box they came in is nice though.",

I plug it into my audio interface for monitoring the bass response is great. but when i plug it into my monitor speakers the bass does not respond at all. I at first thought this was some rigged chinese product and i got scammed. but i guess i just cant simply plug it into my speakers to listen to music at home at night. i have to take out the bigger jack and plug it into my audio interface. Is this just my problem or anyone else experience similar symptoms?",
