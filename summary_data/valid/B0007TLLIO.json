She used to tell him to wear New Balance but after seeing how well the Skechers were made and the support they offered, she was going to start telling her patients to get the Skechers shoes instead. She said she had heard about Skechers but never examined a pair.",

      "text": "I inspect buildings and so I\u2019m on my feet a lot. I usually wear Skechers black Oxford shoes but decided to give these a try. They\u2019re slightly dressy since they\u2019re black and the logo isn\u2019t too garish. Like all of my Skechers shoes, these fit fine in a size 12. Also like all my other Skechers, these started out slightly snug but wore in quickly. And gosh are they comfortable. And the tread is extremely slip resistant and sure-footed. I\u2019ve worn these shoes for a little more than 3 weeks and love \u2018em. They show no wear, either. Definitely a great shoe !!",

      "text": "Shoes are fine, fit great and are very comfortable. The reason I gave them 2 stars was that they were sold as \"NEW\" but they were not new maybe like new. The box was beat to hell and one corner was even held together by tape. All the tags and stickers were already removed from the shoes as well. These shoes had to be a return item and should have been labeled as such.",
