It's a great calculator with basic functionality that mirrored the keypad layout of the Ti 84 which I was used to growing up.

It also has some constants and unit conversions to choose from. The number solver could use more memory though as it can not solve for some equations it also does not do calculus with degrees properly as it gives incorrect answer!!(I checked the mode). The display could also be brighter at certain angles. Otherwise for $20 this almost rivals a ti 84...without being programmmable or being able to graph of course",

Same familiar interface but without graphing/programming, honestly neither of which I need in my professional life. I have much better tools for that on my computer. Solar, do need to worry about batteries. Simply put, it's much easier to hammer out some quick calculations on a physical calculator rather than click around in an app.",

Compared it to other offerings, including a Casio I picked up at Walgreens. The only part I don't like is that the cursor defaults to \"replace\" instead of \"insert.\" My TI-89 defaults to \"insert,\" which is far preferable. You can switch to \"insert\" mode, but it frequently reverts back to replace. If there was a way to swap the cursor to \"insert\" permanently, it'd be my favorite calculator, even better than my TI 89.",

Can convert between Celsius, kelvin, metric, whatever so you don't have to run look stuff up. Really nice for calculating statistics of anything!!! It was way faster to use for calculating standard deviation than a graphing calculator or by hand. Plus, it's $18. Dunking it accidentally in an acid bath won't set you back a small fortune.",

This solar-powered calculator combines features for statistical analysis, Boolean logic operations, and unit conversions in one sleek package.\n\nMath students will appreciate TI36X's ability to perform fractional equations and calculate angle units (radians, grads, degrees) when performing trigonometric functions. Everyone will find the calculator's English/metric conversions helpful.\n\nThe TI36Xs single-line LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying on a desk, and users in need of graphing functions will have to look elsewhere. Overall, however, for a calculator in this price range, the TI36X provides enough power for most high-level math and science needs.",
