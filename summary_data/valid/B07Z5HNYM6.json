Other than that, its an awesome and easy product to use and if used regularly you will see results. I've lost 2-inches in 2 weeks using it ever- other day. Another thing to watch out for, while using the EMS function the electrode currents stays on the head of the infrared part of the machine which gives a receiving shock back. (is a bit painful)",

Well for me was totally the opposite, I found it very easy to use, and I specially think the instructions are clear, also I could totally feel the EMR. Haven't used it long enough to see results, but I really like this machine, so very excited about the new version, if this one is good the other one would be excellent.",
