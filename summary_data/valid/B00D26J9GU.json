      "text": "I've used many projectors as rentals over the past 17 years. This one has incredeble short throw. My clients love it. It saves so much on the projection footprint. I have two, and bought them both December 2013. The first burned through its bulb at 315 hours. The second just burned it at 397 hours. They earn a ton in rentals, so I don't mind replacing the bulbs, but beware. They also start dimming at around 150 hours. I don't get where Optoma can claim 3500 hours, when I have two identicle units that both burned out under 400 hours.",

      "text": "Frankly when I ordered it, I didn't realise just how short the projection length was on this unit: you need to be within 4-5 feet of the projection surface, even for large images. Focussing is good, as is keystone adjustment, height adjustment less so. Image quality however is excellent and the in built speakers are quite adequate for a small conference room. Picks up color in backgrounds on video etc well, but be clear, it is a business projector, not a media unit. If these limitations are OK with you, buy it.",

Disturbance for other people and suffocation for the person moving. The Short throw is amazing . The Projector is now kept close to the wall screen. No shadows now. Myself and others are free to move around without any concerns. Its Bright Clear, 3D is great !!!! It has a Vertical Keystone ...I wish it had a horizontal keystone as well. Perfect for my requirements -- watching movies , TV, Videos , 3D movies :)",
