Bottom Line: If you are in need of a small, lightweight umbrella for daily commuting to and from work, I highly recommend this umbrella.

      "text": "The umbrella appears to be robust; I used it recently during rain and gusty winds in New York with no problems. However, though the ribs seem largely rustproof, I am disappointed to see visible rusting at a couple of the rivets where sections of the ribs are joined, in one case offsetting to the fabric of the umbrella. It makes no sense to me to construct a good frame from rust-resistant materials only to sacrifice that quality with cheap rivets. I\u2019m disappointed, though I\u2019ll keep this.",

I contacted them on April 13th and the replacement umbrella was in my hands April 20th! I am not shy about contacting customer support when I have a problem with a product.

The shaft of the umbrella is a strong hexagon shape instead of the traditional round shafts, the additional strength is great for windy days.",

As I live in southern Arizona, I have not had an opportunity to use it yet, but it is monsoon season so I should be able to within the next couple of weeks and I will update this review at that time.
