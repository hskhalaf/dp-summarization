I am shocked at the difference in quality between the last box and the one we rec'd this week. Stitching lines/quilting boxes are much larger, less quality of stitching and padding. Padding is dispersed throughout the pad unevenly. Box says 25% more absorption, but I doubt this very much. You can see straight through spots where there is no padding - so this is not possible.

      "text": "I always buy these for my dog. Even though he is over a year old now, and he is eliminates outside when I walk him, my dog is still an indoor dog. I live in an apartment, and he stays home alone the majority of the time when I am work. Although he waits until I get home, for him to go potty, I like the fact that he has the option to go in doors and not hold it more than he needs to. They actually hold most of the odor, and even if you don't have a pad holder, they hold pretty well. They aren't as thin as they look. They last a while too.",

Just watch for that and be careful because the bottom side is pure plastic and slippery when wet.",
