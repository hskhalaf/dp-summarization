Amazon quickly sent me a replacement bounce house, but the new replacement broke in the exact same spot after only three uses.",

We have had this for almost a year now and it has held up really well! While it\u2019s was a bit more expensive, it has been worth every penny! When we bring this out all the neighborhood kids come out and play for hours! We will see how much longer it actually lasts given how much heavy use it\u2019s getting but again totally worth it!

But since I just paid all this money I wanted to try. To my surprise they responded the same day! Instructions on how to proceed and mailed us a new bounce house immediately! Sad that I was shocked with great service, but am very impressed!! The 2nd one is just fine too plus no rip.",
