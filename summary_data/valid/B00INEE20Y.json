Instructions were intuitive and simple. So far reliability has been 100% with no resets required. Product comes with a three year warranty which is above average for routers. For the price, this product is an competitive newcomer in the home router world.",

Another bug is If you add a MAC to authorized list and remove it, you have to add it to authorized again, even if you set it to accept all MAC. Tried new firmware, still same issues. Decent firewall/virus protection and logging with email ability. UPDATE: Turn off Net Detector in the routers web menu, and the signal drops happen less often . DO NOT USE THE BUILT IN VPN! IT USES ANCIENT MPPE ENCRYPTION WHICH IS INSECURE(128BIT RC4 MSCHAP). USE ANOTHER DEVICE WITH L2TP IPSEC (AES-256-GCM 4096 BIT)",
