I also used caulk to \"cement\" the arm to the base and put the same on the pin that holds it all together. It is used in the shallow end for kids in our neighborhood pool. Not sure why the little kids like pulling out the pin that holds it together so much. With the changes it has held up well all summer. Should be usable again next summer. Without the changes the first one failed half way through the pool season.",

My last one was like that and I tried to get away from that engineering, but oh well. What is worse is that the post rotates when you hit the board off center. I just put some shim sticks in at the base and so far that has stopped the spin. All in all, it is good for the price.",

The only problem is where the backboard pole goes into the base it's not super tight, and will swivel when you hit the sides of the backboard. FIX- use a tube of superglue on it after you assemble it. Problem Solved....",
