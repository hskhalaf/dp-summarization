The only problem I'm having is blade wear. It wears quickly... and that's probably due to my excessive use! Don't let the negative reviews fool you. This is a great machine!",

Apparently the throttle has a plastic device which holds the throttle cable and throttle lever. It really irritated me when I saw the cheapness of this device but the upside is you can manually adjust rpm's at the carburetor. I need to call McLane to express my concerns. I would definitely recommend.",
