Quality is great, feel is nice, comfortable, I am a big guy ordered a 3x to have extra room and it fit just right (not any extra room) in some colors, and somewhat small in some colors. I didn't find it to run very big like most reviews say. If anything it's a little bigger in the arms and a smidge long. Overall great product!",
