I went to test a new VTX on my racing Quad and nothing. Will not power on. Even with a freshly charged battery. I haven't even flown with them yet. Just two test runs on my work bench. I hope to get this resolved, as I purchased these based on a majority of good reviews over more expensive goggles like Fat Shark. Edit: Amazon replaced with zero questions asked. So I'll bump it to a 3 for now. I will buy a few extra battery packs if the new one powers it up.",
