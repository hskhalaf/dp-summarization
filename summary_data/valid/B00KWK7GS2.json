I wiped out a number of times on terrain my Keens would have gripped easily. I really wanted to give these a good review. Back to hiking in my Keens.",

I also wear them hiking trails in Florida and the ankle support (again) is key. I'm very pleased with these shoes and would recommend to anyone!",

About half way in both my feet were getting hot spots. I was in agony by the time I got off the trail. I so wished I could have returned them but the allotted time had expired.

They fit perfect, even with thick hiking socks. I really appreciated the reinforced ankle support as walking over rocks can make your foot slide. I HIGHLY recommend this shoe.",

I ordered an 8.5 to compare and ended up keeping the 8.5 because they felt more snug around the foot but the toe box still had enough room. Comfortable shoes. Can't wait to get some more use out of them.",

They're comfortable, supportive, no rubbing against any part of my foot or blistering. Will wear them on some longer hikes before heading up to Cloud's Rest next month! Maybe Mount Tallac? This is my 3rd pair of Salomon shoes but the first high-top, figured the upcoming hikes might require more ankle support. I've been extremely happy with Salomon!",
