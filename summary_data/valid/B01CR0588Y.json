Which makes it very difficult to maneuver your character around, especially during battle. The other thing is you can't move pan the camera around either making it hard to see what's going on around you. The motions on the screen gave me a really bad headache within about 20 minutes and I had to stop playing. I'm very disappointed, I was stoked to play this game again :(",

In fact, the controls are so clunky (as one other reviewer wrote), that I got nauseous after about an hour of play.
