Sinking with the phone is the next fun part, as it often requires the phone to be restarted before the fitbit will reconnect and sink? Overall its more trouble than its worth!!",

All though the Charge 4 has a better look & feel, I was disappointed in the accuracy of the Heart Rate Zone. It was showing Cardio Minutes when my heart rate was not even close to the Cardio Zone & this impacted the Zone Minutes recorded. Overall the Charge 4 doesn't bring any thing to the table that I can't get from the Charge 2 to meet my daily requirements. Back to using my old faithful Charge 2 which ticks all the boxes.",

The straps do not sit flush with the screen which causes a significant gap between the strap and the screen (I tried both straps and they both had the same issue). This means things can catch on it and a lot of dirt is able to build up inside which you wouldn't expect from genuine fitbit straps. This is a known issue on fitbit support forums as well (I wish I had noticed before I purchased it). Overall it doesn't have the same quality the previous models had and was not worth the money.",
