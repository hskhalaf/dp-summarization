Its like if l looked down and my chin touches my neck they'd be glued together. You may wash your face/neck after but I think that would defeat the purpose. Will not recommend.",

It does help brighten the skin and has enough serum in there to last a good 30-40 minutes, before it starts to dry out. I detracted one start because of the fit of the mask (I have had better fitting masks) and because it leaves behind a bit of a \"sticky\" feel from the serum. Still overall a good mask that delivers what it promises.",
