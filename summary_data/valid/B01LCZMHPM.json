Certainly I understand the positive reviews. The tank did go together easy and look great until it failed to do the one thing it was meant to = hold water!!!!",

Aqueon is a good brand but things happen. Fill your tank halfway, check for leaks. Fill it up and check each day for two days. In this hobby, there is always risk. I upgraded the lid to the Aqueon Glass lid (fits perfect!) and Nicrew lights. Looks much better now! You can\u2019t go wrong :) My betta girls love this tank.",

With other reviewers stating aquarium held water for the short term, but then leaked, I decided to return 2nd kit and look at other products. Its a good price for a kit.
