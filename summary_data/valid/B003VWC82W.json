These are good quality shoes, they just aren't shaped like they used to be, which is a tad disappointing. If you have a wider toe region, and slender heel, these will totally work for you!",

    "description": "Sansha's Pro 1 ballet slipper is perfect for training or performing alike. Its lightweight canvas upper is double-lined for durability, and elastic straps secure the perfect fit.\n\nIn 1982, Franck Raoul-Duval, a 25-year-old Frenchman with a passion for dance and Russian history, created a new type of ballet shoe. After numerous trials and adjustments, he came up with an innovation that changed the lives of dancers everywhere. The split-sole ballet slipper, with its glove-like fit, was born. Sansha now manufactures an extensive range of dance shoes for everything from ballet to jazz, hip-hop to flamenco, and ballroom to tap. Sansha collaborates with dance professionals, teachers and store owners to remain a prominent brand in the dance capitals of the world.",
