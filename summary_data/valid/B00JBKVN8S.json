The take up lever is buried so deep in the \"nose\" of the machine that catching it as part of the process is difficult. Unfortunately I let my return window lapse hoping against hope that the machine might prove to be of some worth. But no such luck. I can't recommend this machine at all.",

This one even has an attached gizmo that helps you thread the needle. I messed that up regularly on the older machine. I will probably use only about 10% of this machine's features.

Apart from price, it's an acceptable sewing machine. Since it's lightweight, it has trouble sewing through 4+ layers of fabric, and I haven't even tried denim. I can't even get it to sew through the 3 layers of mask+ elastic on my masks. Overall, somewhat underwhelmed and wish I had shelled out more for a more powerful machine.

I find it easy to operate with the help of the videos, and it's a great help that there are directions printed all over the machine itself. There are several full sets of instructions for the basic operations of the machine - a huge help to a novice such as myself. Everything about this machine has just been so easy to use, and I'm learning a great deal along the way. The device for threading the needle is also a most welcome convenience. I'm mostly using this machine for fixing and fitting my clothing.",

CONS: the self threader is hard to use (I end up giving up and threading the needle myself), the foot peddle slides (which is easily remedied with 2 sided tape) . The instructions state to only use the bobbins that come with the machine. I would recommend this product.",

It was an awkward stitch that probably should have been sewn by hand, so I was pushing the limit of the machine. I loved that it was so easy to take apart and put back together.",

There is only one stop on it, therefore it will make only one pass to make a hole. Therefore you are left with button holes with only one stitch around it. If you keep going, the machine just continues to straight stitch down your project ruining it. Other machines I've seen are equipped with button hole devices with 2 feet so that you can make as many revolutions as you want to make a strong button hole.",
