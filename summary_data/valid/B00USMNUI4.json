For those who got the error somfy mylink cannot be found, try this: 1. Use a 2.4ghz wifi network 2. Go through the setup process on the app. After you enter your WiFi network password it goes through a 4 step process to locate your somfy device. At the 4th step, use your remote and move all your shades up or down (do this while the app is locating your Somfy motor!) This allowed the device to discover my somfy motors. Nothing else worked and the troubleshooting guides are non existent. Good luck!",

Sometimes I'll issue a command from the app and it won't even register with the shade. They functionality of the MyLink and the app don't come close to replacing the remotes the shade comes with.

    "description": "Add smartphone/tablet remote control to all of your Somfy RTS motorized devices (sold separately) with the Somfy myLink RTS Smartphone and Tablet Interface. Designed to work with the free Somfy myLink app for iOS and Android, this plug-in module works as a simple signal converter. It receives your app commands over Wi-Fi and transmits the equivalent RTS signals to your RTS devices. The app works even when you're away from home, so you can control your motorized shades, blinds, and more from anywhere you have an Internet connection. The Somfy myLink Interface is designed for quick DIY setup. Just plug the module into a standard power outlet and use the app's on-screen setup wizard to add the module to your home network. Once the interface module is connected to Wi-Fi, you can easily add your RTS devices to the app interface. About the myLink App: Available through the Apple and Google Play stores, the Somfy myLink app gives you complete control over your RTS devices, organized by room in your app's interface. The app supports up to 5 channels, so you can control up to 5 individual RTS devices OR groups of multiple RTS devices. You can also create scenes and schedules directly through the app. If you need to control more than 5 groups of RTS devices, you can use multiple Somfy myLink Interfaces together. Each additional interface will add 5 more channels. CONTENTS: myLink Interface Module, Quick Start Guide. NOTE: RTS devices sold separately. Requires a wireless router and Internet service.",
