The game just doesn't have much to offer beyond cosmetics.",

Through the support forums, it was clear that this was a Blizzard issue of some kind, but their support personnel were largely ignorant of it and rather unhelpful. In the forums, we ended up finding a fix ourselves and it now runs great again.",

After watching every Overwatch clip he has posted, he made me want to pre-order and be in the early beta. And now since the game is out I am having a TON of FUN!!! Sure it is repetitive but when you think about it, most multiplayer-based games are.. ;) Great fun, Great buy :D",
