Trying to dig it out of hard dried soil will kill you, not the grass. First application killed about 70% of it. Second application killed about 95%. There are a few strands here and there, but the landscape beds look beautiful and neat. I'm no longer embarrassed about the appearance of my landscaping and now I have one of the prettiest houses on the block.",

It works quite well. 1. Use product with a good surfactant. 2. Apply early in season as the Quackgrass is starting to grow 3. Apply repeatedly and it does not harm the daylilies 4. In a week it kills off the Quackgrass that has infested the flowers 5. After the growing season it does not really work so remember to start early and often 6. I have not examined multi season protection but will do so later. Overall it is great!",

There is another Ornamec which is 6.75% concentration ( and comes with a small bottle of surfactant ) . Clearly , the second one is stronger and works better . Also , less product is needed to cover the yard . Always zoom the LABEL an check the Percentage concentration . Other than that , it really works to kill Bermuda grass , which is otherwise impossible to get rid of ( as it spreads through ryzomes ) , and chokes all other plants and grasses around it .

It does kill the grass without affecting Juniper, or other perennials in the garden but it takes a while to act and usually takes a couple of applications to be effective so even though the grass dies it is still there but brown instead of green. Eventually it will decay enough to fall and disappear. So, a mixed result. By keeping on top of the new shoots I have reduced the occurrence of the grass in the garden since this produce seems to kill the root also preventing new runners..",
