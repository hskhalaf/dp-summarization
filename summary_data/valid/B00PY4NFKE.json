      "text": "Changed the stock tires on my 2012 FJ Cruiser to these and it made a big difference in snow and bad weather. Only put about 1000 miles on them so I dont have a long term review but I like them so far. Now it feels like a off road vehicle and drives great on the highway. Makes a little more noise on the road at high speeds. Tires are made in the USA.",

Can't speak to tire life, but after nearly 10k on them they look like new. Tires balance out very well and highly recommend them. Most recent order was for a spare and it shipped and arrived VERY quickly.",

My truck handled like a champ. The traction is awesome and it rides nicely. The tread is deep on the tires so they should make 50,000 miles and the road noise is minimal at best. Highly recommend these tires.",
