      "text": "It doesn't hold a lot but it does hold the essentials. I have another pouch I slide onto the belt if I need extra space. The best thing about this pack, and the main reason I bought it, was because I like the way it holds your water bottle sideways. It has an elastic strap that goes over the top of your bottle to make sure it doesn't fall out. It's easy to get your bottle in and out, and comfortable to carry. If you're not carrying a bottle, the bottle holder folds away in a zip compartment so you have a normal looking pack that's not bulky. Love this thing.",

That said, I don't think you can do any better out there without the water bottle being specifically built for the waste band. I like being able to use whatever water bottle I want. The storage compartment for my phone and doggy bags is perfect. My only comment for a future generation of the pack would be to improve the belt holders. They don't really hold very well but this is very minor.",

You can clip a cellphone case to it, if your cell case has a clip in it.",
