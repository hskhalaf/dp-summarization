      "text": "We are setting up a group bar for our NASCAR camping group at ISM Raceway in Phoenix in November, and I have been searching for a bar that would not be high-priced and easy to transport and assemble. The Party Bar is PERFECT! What is truly amazing is that I ordered it the evening of the 8th and I received it today--the 10th! Thank you for the super prompt service. I love the LED lights on the edges and the shelf underneath. The carrying case makes it the perfect accessory for racing, camping or tailgating and I will be telling everyone who stops by our bar tent that I got this from PARTYPONGTABLES.COM!",
