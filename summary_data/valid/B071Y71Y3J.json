You cannot just play the drum sounds without incessant, agitating music and talking on in the background the WHOLE time. It is just aweful. I so wish we had gone another route for drums. Toy noises don't usually annoy me either, this one is just really bad. It also doesn't pause the noises when not in use. If it is on, it just keeps going and going and going. My advise, don't do it!! Save your sanity!!!",

Even the setting where the child can drum independently has extra sounds after each strike. It is more like a newborn toy than a toddler play drum set. We are only keeping it because my son destroyed the box while he was unwrapping it. It appears to be well made which is why it got two stars.",

The different modes are kinda cool. If you have a kid that loves to whack stuff I'd give it a go, but don't expect anything amazing. It's marginal and doesn't get a lot of use.",

      "text": "This is great drum set for a young toddler. It has many different settings/variations from prompted drum along to free style and everything in between. It's the perfect size for my 20 month old grandson and the \"drums\" and \"cymbals\" make electronically created noises. It's also great for parents because it doesn't take up much space and the sound volume is not very loud so it's very bearable :)",

Oh well, the kid likes making music. Too bad it is only musical in his own little head. It came with batteries and worked right out of the box. I'm glad I purchased it. I think the kid will use it a long time.",

I purchased it for my three year old who really enjoys music. I'm not ready to buy him a full size drum set and wanted to see how he reacted to this first. I love that it's a table/lap top and fits great in the toy box with all of his other toys. He really enjoys it, his favorite is the voice autotune. I purchased the entire matching set (guitar and piano). Great quality, toddler friendly. I would purchase again.",

We catch ourselves playing with it a lot! It doesn't take up much space, gives the feeling of playing the drums, entertains your child (and parents) and for the cost it is an awesome value!

It is a little confusing for my 18 month old because on the bottom three drums you tap the part that lights up but on the \"cymbal\" you are supposed to tap the ring around the part that lights up.

He will play with this all day long if I let him. Easy on/off button, different music setting. Perfect for him.",

Oh, and if you want to return it, you discover that the one \"leg\" you had to insert at the back is impossible to take out, and it now doesn't fit in the box. Just get the \"Amazon Choice\" - in this particular instance, there is logic to their decision.",

This toy is definitely a great method for very young children to become introduced to the methods of rhythm and coordination. I stress though tha one should read the instructions completely and you will be happy with this item. An added measure is that your child will focus their love of hitting things on this toy rather than your walls, furniture, or pictures. Enjoy",
