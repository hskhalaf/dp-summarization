I knew this sounded like way too much, so I started with 64oz of water per Tablespoon and that was still too much. I dumped out quite a bit of water, so I probably only used 30-40oz. They're perfectly plump without being too mushy/wet, my 2yo daughter loves them! We haven't had any problems with them falling apart (other then when she purposely rips them apart). The colors are really pretty, too.",

It's possible for kids to break them apart, but it's not easy. My nieces and nephews were crazy for them, and continue to play with them. I emailed the company directly with a question about how long they last when hydrated, and I got a personal response within 20 minutes. What great customer service. You can let them dehydrate and rehydrate them later to avoid concern about growing bacteria. Will definitely purchase again for the kids in my life.",
