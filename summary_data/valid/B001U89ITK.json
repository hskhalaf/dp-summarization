So why did I purchase this? And why you should if you have these reasons: - There's an ongoing coupon discount. That brings it down to a competitive and comparative price. - It's smaller (faster to consume and convenient to bring around). - Lastly, this powerbar mainly focuses on protein. For those of you who only want to get protein out of a bar, this would be more suitable than the meal replacement bar.",

They are very different in texture and taste. I love the 30g 'During', but the 20g 'after' is downright disgusting. Texture like sawdust, taste like playdough. Threw it out after one bite. Taste is an individual thing, but if you're looking for the 30g version, make sure you get what you're looking for. The Amazon heading says 30g, but when you select the flavor, it switches to 20g. Anyone want a free box?",
