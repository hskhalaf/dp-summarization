It will smoke for around 10-15 minutes the first time you plug it in that is normal as it's just plastic burning away off the heating element. My only complaint is the grip isn't anything special and if anything the molding feels a bit sharp but I just used some hockey tape around it and it feels way nicer to use",

Using a similar immobilizer from a junk yard, after opening both immobilizers we transplanted the module from the one with bad antenna, to the other with good antenna.

I had to leave the connecting wire between the two ends loose because the iron would vaporize it. Hopefully the repair will last and the connections won't come loose.
