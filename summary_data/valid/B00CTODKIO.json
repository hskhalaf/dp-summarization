Just tap the touch screen on the chat input, type what you want and hit enter. then continue gaming. It has never been easier boys. PogChamp in the chat",

I wouldn't recommend it for a photobooth because it's a lot bigger than is needed to show the picture of the people and 2 buttons, but if that happens to be your idea, a smaller model of this touch panel would be perfect. I'll now be using it as a monitor for a new computer I'm building.",

Touchscreen response was terrible compared to my Win 8 computer's primary touch screen. Not sure if that was due to sub-optimal settings or intrinsic to USB cable operations. I blame the monitor because my keyboard and mouse are on wireless USB and yet operate flawlessly.",
