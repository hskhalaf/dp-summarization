I've been using this tablet for a good 2 weeks and i must say its amazing. The only reason i don't give this 5 star is MI UI is really annoying. I recommend a launcher for all Huawei devices and second this doesn't support 5GHZ wifi which is absurd in this day in age, but i can look pass that. This tablet also has a bit of weight to it and is not as light as an ipad air mini.",

I tend to like it better than the Samsung and it cost about half what the Samsung 8 inch tablet would have cost. I'm referring to the higher end Samsung tablet -- not the cheap ones with poor screen performance. But, this MediaPad has a quirky home button that takes some getting used to. If they were to improve anything, I would strongly suggest they make the home button more like other tablets. I will say also that the battery life is far better than my Samsung tablet.",

Very long lasting battery too. I must've watched videos on it for around 10 hours before I bothered charging it, and even then it was only down to around 30%",

I purchased it in early December and still no update. This is probably not an issue for most users and not a huge issue for me, but I'm a tech geek to the core :-P Other than this, it is a solid tablet that will please most, if not all owners :-)",

Just within six months of use, I got a whole patch of dead pixels on the lower screen. Some apps starts to crash, Microsoft Outlok stops working. The screen blacks out frequently.

Well, i send it to Huawei for warranty work, and they say it had been rooted (I dont know how to root a device, and didnt try to), and that the warranty was voided. On top of that they wiped the device, and it no longer even turned on. So... if you need parts, head to ebay! Terrible customer service.",

The recent update prevents you from having the navbar and fingerprint gestures on at the same time which makes no sense. It is very helpful having them both turned on, there are times when I prefer one over the other. I see no reason why they wouldn't allow them both to be turned on. Another thing is face unlock is a feature of just about every Android device but this device does not have that feature. Overall this is a great tablet and probably the best Android tablet in this size.",
