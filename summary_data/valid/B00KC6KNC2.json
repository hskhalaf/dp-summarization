It does not always react on a single or more touches which is an irritant. Other features have changed in appearance and I am not finding the logical way around as easily as with the older version. Maybe that is a matter of time and use. It is still a useful tablet but I am sorry there is still no USB or SD card slot.",

I synched my books onto it in seconds and it was very easy.

The battery is quite short however in airplane mode it does extend it.

We bought my daughter a cheap tablet last year, and have learnt to never do that again. We chose a Kindle Fire as my husband has had one for two years and been quite happy with it. We trust the Kindle Brand, and were really impressed with the features on this. The cameras are great, as is the colour choice and size. Very happy with this!",

The only instruction that came with it was how to switch it on - but it didn't need any more as it is really intuitive. I am enjoying it very much. Lightweight, good camera. Am very pleased with this buy but am still exploring it!! Have downloaded a couple of apps already and am happy with them. Well worth it - excellent value!",

As with all the Kindles (this is my 4th & my wife has one also), they are a reliable platform with easy access and many features. I love the screen refresh speed, the colour and clarity. Being able to have my purchases and calendar on both is exactly how I wanted to be organised, so another very happy Kindle customer.",

Still finding the screen a bit of a challenge so plan to buy a stylus. Getting ebooks from Amazon is so easy (not tried other providers yet) and there are loads of free classics. Only gripe is as many have said have there is no mains charger included and I see widely varying reviews about them",
