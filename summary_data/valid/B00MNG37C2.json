Here are the Plus and Minus of this Drone: Plus: - The biggest Plus of this Drone is its cost. At 45$ you can at least have a Drone flying experience. Minus: - Really really hard to control and keeps drifting to one side. Tried recalibrating but to no use. - Battery lasts just a few minutes. - No Altitude hold feature. - Bad camera. - Bad remote design with display on the bottom of the remote rather than on the top, which makes it hard to see.",

My child has crashed this thing into chairs, trees, the ceiling, the dog, and the ground from 45 feet up and it continues to work like a champ. The camera produces great quality shots. The batteries are a little short on life, but getting a few replacements means lots of flying time. I've been nothing but impressed with this little work horse. In fact, my other child received a defective one of these which we returned. We have been through two other drones as replacements. I finally re-purchased the Syma because of the durability and ease of control.",

Don't worry, you probably won't break them. I've crashed mine a few times and none of them broke at all. Check on amazon for extended batteries. It'll make your flight time more enjoyable.

I never really used the camera so I can't say anything for it. Since I crash this thing often I had to calibrate it often and then fine tune it. I mostly fly it indoor.

I just wish it would have better control range. That simple issue is causing a lot of problems for a lot of people.

Right out of the box the propeller guard deals that help keep the props from breaking when you crash it, interfered with two of the propellers so they would hit it. No big deal really but I always had to kinda bend it down a little before flying. The only other issue was the camera falling out sometimes, eventually it fell out and the little wire came out of the plug so I couldn't film anymore. Overall though, this thing is awesome!",

When you're starting out, be sure to use it in a wide open area so that it doesn't fall into somebody's yard. Also, because each battery gives you less than 10 minutes of flight time, you'll want to get some extra batteries and a multi-battery charger. I'm using Keenstone batteries and a Quadpro charger and I've been happy with them both.",

Also if you fly too high you will start losing control, IMMEDIATELY CUTOFF THE THROTTLE, that will have it fall slowly, then you can restart the throttle and get back into range, otherwise it will start to fly on its own!",

From 10 feet away my remote lost connection and my drone went up, up, up, and away.... It came down in my neighbors yard so I got it back. This thing is durable if nothing else and image quality is decent, amazing for the price I'd say, but the connection issue is a big deal. It's fun for a while, but I'm on the fence about recommending it. I am not super happy with it, but I also don't not recommend it.",

Two modes - high and low sensitivity. LCD screen showing trim points. Camera mode is not his res as advertised but still works well enough. I gave them away for new clients at a trade show.

While probably a standard feature in quadcopters of this class, the removable battery is much appreciated after owning several copters with non-replaceable batteries that die prematurely. The copter is sturdy enough and is still in good working order after quite a few flights and a couple of less-than-graceful landings. The sometimes poorly-translated manual and the trim knob arbitrarily re-purposed as camera control button attest to the sacrifices that need to be made to meet the price point, but all in all this is a fun and worthwhile toy.",

None of the pictures ended up being what I was pointing at. Clear pictures but pointing is ambiguous and mostly a matter of chance Getting the micro SD card out is a real trick - bring tweezers. Hover is OK but takes some trimming. After two minutes you have to trim again. Once the battery wears down - trim changes a lot. Height control is still 'old-school' It over-reacts - both up and down. I was not impressed for the money charged",

Unfortunately, my son came over and flew it straight up about 150 ft and we watched a strong gust of wind blow it about ten houses down into a high tree. Arrrggghhhh! Oh well, at least it was only fifty bucks. Maybe the next one I buy I will have more fun and hide it from my son. Dollar for dollar, this is the best drone FOR THE PRICE and a great learner. Parts are available too. Have fun.",

It would be nice if it had a greater tendency to land upright and it's a little hard to tell what direction it's facing in daylight. The lights are great at night.

On a clear day and at the right altitude I've captured images of mountains and buildings that are 10-20 miles away.
