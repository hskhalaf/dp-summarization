A little more expensive then others but worth it because the quilted pad was thick and didn't rip or crumble when our dog stepped or moved around on them. However, the last two boxes I purchased had thinner flimsier pads. Clearly a change in the design since it was multiple boxes. Very disappointing as I am going through them twice as fast. Will be looking at different brands now.",

I don't know if they are having problems with a batch or if they have cut corners because the product is now mediocre at best. The last 3 boxes I have bought I have noticed the padding were thinner than before and the plastic barrier now leaks. If a puppy pad leaks, I think that is a fundamental flaw in the design and it is no longer working for it's sole purpose. Too bad. Another great product that is now crap. I hope the corner cutting was worth losing everyone's business. I am now on the hunt for a something better.",

After using these larger sized ones, I refuse to go back to the smaller ones. These also absorb quickly.

My vinyl plank flooring is taking a beating and I am getting so mad, the potty wrap I bought is too small for my male fat old grumpy german so have to try another route (he is a 12.5yr old dachshund and just started this). Maybe I just need to put them outside when I go to work? They have a dog door to a covered screened porch and another dog door from there to a well groomed, grassy yard. Spoiled brats.",

      "text": "After trying many brands we have settled on these All-Absorb as our only dog potty pads. The ones by AKC were terrible! They (and others) didn't absorb anything. It was like a paper towel over thin plastic. One pee would spread out to cover nearly the whole pad and remain wet for tracking. These hold the liquid in one spot and it doesn't track. Also the plastic backing doesn't leak. The bottom of the clear plastic storage bucket that we use as a potty (cutting an opening in one short side) is always dry underneath. Makes having a small inside dog so much easier. We buy this 200 bulk pack for more savings.",

The technology and construct are similar in all brands of pads but this one does stand out from the rest for me.

Puppy uses them almost 90% of the time, so the attractant seems to work. I like the large amount (120) that comes in each bag. Some pads seem thinner than others, but hasn\u2019t caused an issue with leakage. I usually dispose after 2 uses, but they have held up with 3 pees. I thrown them in the outside bin, because they will smell up the bathroom garbage can after a few days.",
