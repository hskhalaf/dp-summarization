If you're doing more than one room, just buy extra blades to replace once your blade is dull. I also loved the versatility of the machine. The blade can be pressed down and turned in different directions to achieve angles and diagonal cuts. Additonally, you hook your vacuum to the hose on the saw and it sucks up the saw dust as you're cutting You will be definitely satisfied with this saw. Recommendation: Please have extra blades because your blade will get dull. Orhan than that. Perfect.",

As other reviewers have mentioned, the vibration is considerable and it really needs to be held down. The little edge-clamp at the front will stop it from moving backwards from the edge of whatever table or work surface you put it on. Combine that with some hand pressure as you work the piece through the saw and it will remain fairly well under control. However I have had occasions where I've clamped the whole thing down to the table with bar clamps.",

With the use of a jigsaw blade over a circular blade, it definitely is safer, but that's all that I can say that is good. The blades do not cut straight. The mounting mechanism is at a constant angle, so cutting straight pieces is nearly impossible. Additionally, the metal that holds the arm is thicker than the blade which causes it to be hard to push pieces through when you are using the width guide. It might work fine with some very thin material, but not a replacement for a table saw.",

The miter slot in the plastic table is way too wide for the rail of the guide. Also, there is considerable flex. The rip fence appears to be much more stable.

Make sure you get the guard arm locked down so there's no movement of the arm. Also, be sure to set the guard down tightly on the material to be cut. These two things will keep the material from wandering and the blade straight. Absolutely recommend the Bladerunner X2!",

      "text": "This is an unusual saw that I find to be very useful. It is basically an upside-down saber saw, with a blade guide above, and an adjustable guide to keep the piece being cut flat on the table. That's a job you would have to do with your fingers, at some risk, if it were not there. My only objection is that when making longer cuts, they must be very straight, because the cut kerf has to fit the slender blade at the back of the saw that supports the blade guide and work clamp.Otherwise, the saw binds and jams the piece being cut. For free-hand curves in larger pieces of material it is necessary to remove the entire superstructure.",

However, in this case I think it very important to warn everyone just how bad this piece of equipment is. As a mechanical engineer by trade I can tell you the equipment is not made very well and isvery hard to cut straight with even when using either of the provide guides.",

One thing other reviewers notice is that original blade will bend as to not cut straight, the Bosch blades don't seem to bend and stay very straight.",
