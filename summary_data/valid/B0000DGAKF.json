At 5 watts per foot, 50 feet of cable uses 6 kWh per day, or 180 kWh per month. At 20 cents per kWh, that costs $36 per month. To reduce that cost, I've started unplugging the cables when the roof was clear of snow. The reviews on the optional automatic control have been mixed, but I may give that a try, next season.",

When the ice melts it can really do a number on repair costs. Easy Heat ADKS roof de-icing cable prevents this water and ice damage by providing a clear path for melting water to flow off the roof. The versatile design adapts to most roof and gutter configurations. This product is intended for the sole use of preventing ice dams from forming on inclined roofs with tab shingles, in gutters and downspouts. This roof de-icing cable is not intended for use as a snow melting system to clear roof of ice and snow. This system can be installed with confidence that it will operate for years without requiring service. All components are made of the highest quality material and are tested during critical points in the manufacturing process.",
