I purchased the Eton hand turbine product a month ago, and have yet to get it to charge anything. It's not like I don't know what I'm doing (I'm an Engineer). I've not torn the device apart and tested the output with a meter yet, but it certainly won't plug-and-play with my iphone 5 at all out of the box. I've contacted support (cservice@etoncorp.com) and had no response after 1 week. Sadly, I would not recommend purchasing products from Eton.",

Amazing to see a product broken on the first day. Since, I contacted Amazon and got a refund. I liked the product, design and concept. Feel so sorry it didn't work for me.",
