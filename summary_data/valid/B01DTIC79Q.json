Six weeks came and went. Three followup emails to Sun Joe ignored over the next 6 weeks. So next year, I'll be looking for another tiller. No point in having a 'help' email if you aren't going to answer it.",

I would not utilize this tiller for large to very large areas. While it will still turn that soil over, it is not as powerful as a rear tine, counter-rotating gas tiller and would take much longer for very large areas. I don't utilize a tiller very often, so an electric tiller made perfect sense for me. I would recommend this product.",

Lighter in weight and equally effective, handled cleaning out dead grass, churning rocks and really aerating the soil. For the price of a 1/2 day rental now have my own tiller. Remember you need the proper extension cord, AMP and length.",

If you want to do a big area with it you need something to weight it down, because power to weight is high and it likes to jump around.

      "text": "Like many reviews, I was amazingly surprised how well this worked for how lightweight the unit is. It\u2019s been used so many times already this summer by myself but mostly by my neighbor. And because of the low price, if he breaks it (because he\u2019s been pretty much using it daily for a week) it won\u2019t cost too much for him to replace. You do have to stop often if tilling where there a lot of roots.",

Cut through existing sod easily. Got clogged in the really nasty clay, but spun up the dirt quickly and easily. Blades turn faster than I expected - guessing at 240rpm instead of 60rpm (didn't measure it or see it specified anywhere) but that number may be way off. I'm pleased and plan to use next to clear a new flower bed around the house.",

I would think if a smaller person could rig up a harness it would be a little easier. It seems the best way to till is by pulling the unit backwards.",

I tap the trigger on and off walking the blades to the edge of where I want to till and than till pulling it backwards. Once I get to the back edge I let the blades ride on the surface and tap the on/off slowing walking it back forward for another pass. A lot easier on your body this way!!",
