They told me it was out of warranty (which is only 90 days), but I could buy a new box from them for $50 off. Rather than throw good money after bad, I just kept the first one. Five months later it's making all kinds of noise again and restarting hasn't helped this time. What a disappointment.",

Then there is a local CBS station that is identified with the proper call letters, but TIVO doesn't identify it as CBS, so no listings, which means I can't make recordings. Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of this unit? I don't know where TIVO gets their listings, but they need to up their game a lot. Several emails to customer service have gone unanswered. Great hardware, lousy schedules and non-existent customer service.",

Being able to control power, volume and mute with the same remote simplifies things, also. I am still adapting to the remote. It is very efficient, but also a bit complicated. Programming TiVo to record TV series is also a plus and I guess all the options for different activities are necessary.

I considered the Channel Master but chose TiVo Roamio OTA for 3 reasons - (1) 1TB internal hard disk was part of the package as was, (2) built-in wifi that discovered my 5.0 ghz network with ease and, (3) ability to set record for a show over a season vs. having to do it every week. This was the clear choice over Channel Master for a no-fee DVR cable-cutter solution for local broadcasts.",

Had to call the next day and spend another hour going through the setup steps for the upmteenth time and finally unplug and then reboot the box, then it worked.
