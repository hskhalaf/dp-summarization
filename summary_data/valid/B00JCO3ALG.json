I tend to have a hard time falling asleep as well as waking up through the night. These pills helped fix that! Just a warning, if you have to wake up early the next day plan ahead and take the pill earlier. If you only get 5 or 6 hours of sleep, when you wake up you will feel super sleepy. These pills really work for helping you sleep.",

      "text": "This Gentle Luna Sleep Aid has a great variety of natural sleep herbs/aids contained within. It's pretty amazing to have all those in one capsule. The smell is not overpowering, just a mixed blend of herbs. The capsules are easy to swallow and do not taste strongly on swallowing. I like that the capsules are vegan. I like that they have two safety seals in place and the expiration is stamped on the bottom of the jar and is over a year and a half out. These gentle capsules have definitely helped me sleep better and wake fewer times through the night, if at all. I recommend giving these gentle herbal sleep aid capsules a try.",

      "text": "I think that one's ability to sleep is due to so many different factors. No sleep aid will fix a congenital condition of the brain which does not produce enough sleep chemicals nor will it override digestive issues and other issues which interfere with good sleep but God knows how much I have done to sleep well and yet still have an ongoing problem! What this product is doing for me is significant and may very well do also for the reader but the science of sleep is still not what it should be so who knows how well this Luna will really work for the reader!",

I've taken LUNA for two months now and I can verify that it has helped me the most. I take liquid magnolia bark along with two capsules of LUNA each night. I've found myself dreaming quite vivid dreams (I have NEVER done that before) which means (I believe) that I'm experiencing REM sleep. I wake up most days feeling like I got a good nights sleep and I'm not groggy all day. Just received my second bottle today. I'm so pleased that I've found this wonderful product!",

So far so good, I do believe it helps me get back to sleep when I wake up at midnight or 1:00 am and I think it helps me fall asleep too. I will continue to use and evaluate. Next time I'll try the Luna without the melatonin since it's the one ingredient I'm not crazy about. The company has great follow up as well, always nice to know they care about their product after the sale. Thanks fellow reviewers for sharing!",
