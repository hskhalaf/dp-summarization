Also, the biggest concern is that while it does come with mounting hardware, NONE of the centers or relevant points are marked on the back of the board. So you'll have to do a good bit of very exact measuring to get your board hung correctly. Not too much of a problem if you're equipped for it, but it's worth mentioning because every other board I've had, had the center screw and the brackets already started into the board, or at least the points for them marked.",
