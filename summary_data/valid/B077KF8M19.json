Howser II shoes provide the right amount of support, are cozily warm, and have very grippy soles. The materials are quite durable yet light.There are only two things that take away from these sneakers being perfect. For one, these shoes run small, and second, the shoes\u2019 back rubs on the heels. Both are fixed easily enough. A size adjustment should suffice while thin socks should stop the shoes from rubbing too much.",

Not a lot of arch support but had room to add cushy insoles and are now soooo comfortable and lightweight.",

The shoes are great and Keen customer service is as good as their shoes. Thanks, Keen!",
