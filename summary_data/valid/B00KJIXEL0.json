When I put this on, it felt just a hair too tight but I went ahead and snapped it in. I take it out of the case pretty frequently. After about 3 days of snapping this in and taking it out, the wifi was gone. It wasn't the software and I can't help but wonder if the hardware broke from the stress on the tablet. Anyway, other than this coincidence, I've always loved this case, it's lightweight, great keyboard size and never falls down when it's propped open.",
