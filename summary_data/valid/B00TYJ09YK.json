Outside water protection, the shoe also seems to have hit the home run thanks to its incredible amounts of comfort and remarkable surface grip. What some might find detestable in this Vasque gear, however, is its hit-or-miss heel hold. All in all, the Talus Trek Low UltraDry is a highly competent shoe that shines in many areas. Those who are prone to heel lift might want to steer clear of it though.",

I also own the higher cut version of this shoe and it is excellent for hiking without a backpack. The fit is the same as my other 3 pair of Vasque shoes and all except the Summit model did not require any break in period. I have become a huge Vasque fan and purchasing this pair has only verified that my loyalty to the brand is justified. I highly recommend this shoe.",

It does. I'm a 9.5W and this fits as expected. The quality is nice, they're very sturdy and well built. The sole is a little hard and flat compared to other brands, It's not \"cushy\" or ultra contoured. But they don't hurt my feet and that's what counts. The \"green\" color is barely green at all thankfully, it's almost khaki. There is a touch of green in there but they're pretty neutral, not too \"green\".",

These come with the ribbon shoelaces and it seems that I'm always having to stop and retie my shoes. I'm going to replace the laces with a cylindrical pair.",

Despite not ever wearing a wide shoe in the past the wide 11.5 fits perfect. Extremely comfortable on long hikes. Great shoes. Just what I was looking for. I would imagine that people with truly wide feet would have problems. Unless you have a super narrow foot my rec would be to order in the wide.",

The nedlework on the upper leather has ca 3-4 mm difference, slipping between the left and the right shoe. So the boot lace holes are not in face of each other. The right and the left shoe are not reflexion each other. The size of the parts of the upper leather are not same on the left and on the right shoe. Very poor esthetic quality from Vietnam. Other problem: the shoe does not hold my angle, the shoe just like slippers, my foot moves in it. The size is right anyway.",
