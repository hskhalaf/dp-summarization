I found when I applied it directly to my skin without a carrier oil, I got some nice heat/burning sensation for it, which I liked. It comes in a brown glass bottle with an add-on included eye dropper. Overall, I am very satisfied with this oil. Pharmaceutical grade, but states on bottle NOT for internal use.",
