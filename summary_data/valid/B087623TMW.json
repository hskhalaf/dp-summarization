Personally I loved having a non-phablet phone with this amount of power and speed. The camera is great for the price range, and call quality is also excellent. The one drawback is a shorter battery life than what I am used to.",

I was a little pissed that it\u2019s more expensive here on amazon than it is on crickets website but I needed the phone ASAP so I guess I can\u2019t complain too hard about that. The quality of the camera is great. Fits iPhone 7 and 8 cases too. Very pleased with my purchase so far.",

Insert the SIM, power up the phone and follow the prompts on-screen. No hiccups, no glitches. Easy! Cricket sent a text with a link to set up the phone number. Also very easy - click the link and follow the on-screen prompts. Nice phone from Apple! Great value and service from Cricket! Highly recommend!",

All I had to do was pop in the SIM card, walk through the iPhone set up guide and then go to my text messages and activated a new number (you also have the option to port your number form another carrier). Process took a total of 10 min to set up iPhone and activate service. The activation was the easiest part! $55 for unlimited everything and the phone worked right away!",

I ended up returning the phone and just bought a new one from the apple store. It cost more, obviously. Too bad because this would have been a great deal - but who wants to change their phone number when it is attached to so much info we use on a daily basis.",
