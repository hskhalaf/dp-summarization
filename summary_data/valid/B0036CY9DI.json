      "text": "This is a nice sturdy bench for the price. Great customer service. I use this for all my herbs and have it on the deck. Holds a lot of pots and very sturdy. I can place them on the bottom shelf when a heavy rain falls. Plenty of shelf space on the bottom for extra pots and supplies. The item arrived with the shipping box damaged by UPS and a couple of small pieces were missing. Rather than sending it back, Dura Trel fedex'd the pieces and I had them 2 days later, no questions asked. Great company to deal with. Dura-Trel is great Amercian company an understands what customer service really is.",
