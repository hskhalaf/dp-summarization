      "text": "This is a very nice heavy duty fireplace grate. I see some people have complained about the legs being 4 ins. tall and they can't keep a fire going. The solution is to always keep a bed of ashes below the grate , between 1 1/2 to 2 ins. This will allow the embers to be closer to the wood you are burning. I look forward to many years of service from this grate.",

Then they sag so badly there is no more room under to create draft. These folks eliminated that. Have only burned for half a season so far, no visible sag beyond what they have allotted for. Well made and designed. One year later 7-3-2020 After a full season this grate is as functional as it was on unboxing day. Granted none of the paint is still there, lol. Sturdy, with some slight scaling from many temperature cycles. The picture is from the edit after a year. Very...very satisfied!",

Bought this unit because it has three extra support legs to prevent the gate from sagging with use. Note: I had to shorten the (7) feet by an 1\" as the unit sat a little to high, but I was able to cut them down with a hack saw. It would be nice if the company offered this unit in two different heights. The Extroadroadinaire 44\" is a very popular Zero Clearance Insert used in most newer home construction these days.",

    "title": "SteelFreak Heavy Duty Steel Fireplace Grate - Made in The USA (15-Inch)",
    "description": "Size:15 InchThese steel grates are built from heavy duty 3/8 x 1 inch thick solid bar steel for added durability. Stove and fireplace grates lift firewood up off the bottom of the stove to improve airflow to the fire. These grates are tapered to fit most fireplaces. Their all-steel construction is designed to outperform their low quality cast-iron counterparts. All sizes feature center support legs which are slightly shorter than the outer legs to prevent rocking in the middle while also stopping the grate from sagging over time. Proudly Made in the USA.",
