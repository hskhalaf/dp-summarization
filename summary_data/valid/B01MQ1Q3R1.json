All you need is some cardboard tubes from used paper towel or toilet paper rolls, some hot wax for the dripping wax effect, and then a coat of spray paint and some fishing line to hang them. I loved the flickering effect, and the batteries lasted for several nights and probably still have a lot of juice. They could be a little brighter, but I suppose that's the trade-off for long battery life. We're thinking about doing a similar crafting project for Christmas decorations and will definitely purchase these again.",

I put one into a luminary votive holder and I could not tell that it wasn't real and I'm a pretty picky person--lol!! I am really looking forward to using these all over my house this holiday season and beyond. We purchased ours through the seller OPPAPA and they not only were the best price around, they were WONDERFUL to work with--speedy, well-packaged shipping among other positives! We would highly recommend them and would definitely purchase with confidence from them again. Love these tea candles!! Thank You!!",

By December 24, I stopped turning each candle off/on for an hour each night and let them all \u201cburn\u201d. Some lasted one full day but some lasted over a week! All worked when we received them and all worked when we asked them to. The battery only ran down after being left on over day/days. We did through them away after I found that the batteries are more expensive than the candles! Will rebuy next year for same purpose. These would be great for parties, dances, weddings, churches.",

Can't wait to see how they hold up for Halloween night, but so far they are doing great! One battery did come without the cover, but it has not affected how the candle at all (the battery is secure and the light works). I put it in a witch statue cauldron for some added ambiance.",
