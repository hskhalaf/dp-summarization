      "text": "I always forget to bring a mini speaker to the park or just out to a friend's house. This way, I get the benefit of both. The bottle itself holds about 16oz which is an average bottle amount. I'm still testing how long it will keep my drink cold/hot. Still testing the life of the battery for the speaker once charged. But overall I was impressed by the quality. You need to charge it before using and that didn't take long. It definitely feels well made for the price, considering my Swell alone was $25. To get a decent sounding speaker is great!",

Keeps my drinks cold and last a very long time. The speaker can detach, battery last a good amount of time. I don\u2019t know if the speaker itself is waterproof but I haven\u2019t had any problems with it. So worth the money!",

      "text": "This sand proof and waterproof hydration bottle with Bluetooth speakerphone is of great use when you're on the beach or camping. And you can detach this waterproof speaker from the bottle and use it in your shower! The 16-ounce bottle is BPA free. As a water/drink bottle, it works well. The sound quality on the speaker is good, but it has no volume control. You can adjust the volume only from your device. As of now, it is priced at $69.95, and unless you can see yourself using this product in situations as above, I do not think it is worth that money.",

Simply unscrew the bottom from the speaker, unscrew the speaker, and then screw the speaker back on to the bottle. Speaker is easy to pair and sounds decent considering size. Great when you need to carry your drink and your music with you, and it works as a speaker phone as well. A bit high on the pricey side for a water bottle, but it's definitely made with quality.",
