Way to expensive for the quality. Never buy anything from Eton again. NEVER I tried to get a replacement battery and spoke to a very rude lady from customer service. They don't sell the battery anymore, it is oem. Only manufactured by Eton. She suggested I buy the Rukus extreme. Yeah right. I don't think so.Hope this helps someone.",
