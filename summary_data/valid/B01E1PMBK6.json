I tried bacon grease, crisco, coconut oil, flaxseed oil, a combination of, and still had sticking issues. Decided to try Crisbee Puck and after 5 or 6 seasonings, it is now as it should be. Eggs and/or cheese do not stick. Made Shrimp Scampi tonight and cleanup was a sponge and warm water. The tin stays on the counter now as it's the only thing I'll use. Thanks for a great product.",

    "description": "Crisbee Puck Cast Iron Seasoning - The Cast Iron Seasoning Oil & Conditioner Preferred by the Experts - Plant Based Oils With Beeswax. Family Made in the U.S.A. Very cost effective! Each Puck will treat a 10 inch skillet over 75 times when used as directed. Most cast iron seasoning oil products require 1/2 ounce (1 tbsp) per application. This means an 8 ounce bottle equals only 16 applications. Compare and save! Also works excellent on carbon steel cookware, griddle cooktops, wood cutting boards, wooden utensils, wood knife handles, & gun stocks. Our products will not turn rancid unlike vegetable shortening, flaxseed oil, coconut oil, or canola oil. Will help to develop a beautiful finish on all cast iron cookware. For tough to reach areas, melt a small amount and spread with a pastry or BBQ brush. Bonds to cast iron. Will not become a brittle surface and flake off like many experience using flaxseed oil. Always free same day shipping! Perfect seasoning every time for cast iron cookware. Crisbee is a proprietary cast iron seasoning blend of Soybean Oil, Beeswax, and Palm Oil. One 3.25oz Crisbee Puck included in tin. Free shipping.",
