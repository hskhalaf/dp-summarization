Lots of torque: I don\u2019t believe that you could bog it down. Easy set up and use. This little piece of equipment deserves six or seven stars. A mere five star rating is not sufficient in extolling just how good this little grinder is. Well worth the money.",

The one thing I did not expect was that the grinder bits it comes with will chip the glass as it grinds until it is worn down. Had to buy new fine grinder heads which work a ton better. I will still use the rough head for things like nuggets. In any case the price was affordable and I love having my own grinder.",

We considered the Wizling, since we're just starting and didn't know how much it would get used, but we're convinced we made a good decision. We've had no issue with it so far. Though the workshop is outside, we do store it inside when not in use. It is extremely consistent, which makes the work easier and faster. That consistency also makes learning that much easier. It also the easiest to find accessories and grinding bits for.",
