They are very good quality and a reasonable price. The sizing when purchasing was a little confusing. I purchased the 2xl for my niece who wears an 8. She is very thin and wiry, they fit perfect. I purchased the 4xl for my daughter who is thicker and wears a 10-12. I wish I had gotten the shorts one size bigger, but overall they will do. I will likely purchase again next year for my daughter.",

The yellow mostly has gone to a much lighter yellow except for the yellow around the neck which stayed the same. In this way it was obvious that it faded.
