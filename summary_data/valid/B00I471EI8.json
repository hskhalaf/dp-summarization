So, you cannot put in the small car easily. We anyhow desided to keep this walker since based on our experience other ones most likely be the same",

I find the knee cushion uncomfortable and can\u2019t find the position where the edges don\u2019t cut into my knee. It would be much more useful if it had a narrower turning radius. Just turning into a room requires either a series of forward/reverse moves like parallel parking or lifting and rotating it. It\u2019s not heavy so I can do that but it\u2019s frustrating.

Could not have done so well with my surgery without it, because is so easy to maneuver through the house, can get to everything I need, is sturdy, lightweight and will fold up to put in vehicle . Drive gets a gold star for the quality, the price, and shipment. I received it much sooner than I expected. I would recommended this to anyone having foot surgery.",

It is hard to scoot the back wheels sideways to maneuver in tight places such as the bathroom or to get close to chairs. To fix that, I added straps from the back brake frame to the handlebar. These work like reins, making it easier to pull the back of the scooter sideways. They also make it easier to lift the scooter. I highly recommend this modification.",
