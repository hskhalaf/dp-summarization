      "text": "I bought these to replace a set of the early AKG Quincy Jones headphones, which are the best set of headphones I've ever owned. In every way, except durability, I leaned on them wrong & broke an earcup off. I bought these because the specs were similar, but the were about $30 cheaper. The really feel like knock offs, the build quality is inferior to the Q model's, for the first week, I really thought the sound quality was really, really, bad. I finally noticed that the headphone plug was bent, right out of the box. I may get the Q's fixed, but I don't think I'll be buying AKG's products anymore. The 518LE headphones were that bad.",

I also love how you can turn them all the way up and not have to worry about blowing the internal speakers, unlike the beats by dre, with any genre of music. I did find that after wearing the cans for more than an hour per say, watching a movie or so fourth, the clamping issue comes into play, i have a shaved head being in the military and all and my head is normal size, i would say. They push hard on the ears creating annoying pain. Other than that, I have no complaints",

The AKG's sound killer: not the best for classical, more for HIP-Hop, rap, Dubstep, they don't sound bad just more geared toward anything with a lot of bass. Been commuting with them to school built very well have not broken them in yet still hurt my ears after listening to them for long periods of studying, etc...My buddy got a pair of Ear candy or whatever and the AKG's blow the ear candies away, and his already broke. lol",
