I think more lather/suds means more chemicals that are more drying to the skin. I also got more suds when using a shower puff, but using straight out of the bottle not a lot. Rinsed off nicely without feeling a residue. Did it leave me feeling super moisturized? No. But, I also didn't feel like grabbing body lotion right away. Overall, I am happy with the product and will purchase again.",

It\u2019s expensive for a plain old body wash (the bottle is fairly large, though) that doesn\u2019t do anything bar soap or another dry skin body wash couldn\u2019t, so I probably won\u2019t repurchase.",

I also like the fact that it's relatively scent-free. I have terribly sensitive skin, very prone to allergies, and I usually break out unless I use my regular shower gel - yet this one did not cause a reaction! Yay! Also, it seems that the bottle will last a month or so with regular everyday use. I recommend it!!",
