Even though I'm big busted with a small waist....it's very tailered and fits me perfectly as if it was custom tailered. It's tunic length which I love. Own black, white and the black and white flower pattern. The shirt looks better than the photo and the pocket has gold CK initials. Also, the best thing about this top is it doesn't wrinkle even in extreme warm weather. Love, love, love this shirt its worth every penny of the hefty price tag!",

I have 20 of the mandarin collar style with same fabric but need many more with the collar. I would buy every solid solid color if made and florals also if made with collars as it gives me diversity in style to my apparel. I also wish Calvin Klein would make this collared version in a thicker type of 100% polyester fabric for cooler weather. There is a real shortage of those and I am having great difficulty finding 31 inch long polyester shirts with relaxed fit.",
