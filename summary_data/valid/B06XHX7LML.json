      "text": "I purchased two of these for my theater room. They are very well made especially the quality of the leather. These are great if you never expect to pack your theater but want to have that center seat available in case you do. The assembly was easy, but I did contact the seller just to make sure I did not damage the seats, when attaching the backs. There are very basic instructions (one page on assembly, nothing on operation or warranty). They responded very quickly and were professional. I was apprehensive to spend this much money on seats sight unseen. I am very happy I made the purchase.",

It seems that it will hold up for a long time. I love the quality leather they used and I really enjoy the middle console that allows you to plug in devices and even wirelessly charge phones. This is a superb sofa and well worth the money spent. The ONLY thing I would want added is something to keep the cords organized in the back. My power strip keeps falling out.",

I will probably never use those lights anyways so it isn\u2019t worth the return hassle.",
