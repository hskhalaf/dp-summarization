Because of the heat, the screen stopped working. This was in the first year of buying, so it was replaced for free. 3. The heating problem continued so after a few months of replacing the screen, it stopped working again. I bought a secondary display, so primarily used it as a desktop. 4. All connection is of type c (i was using it in India). So had to use adapter for everything (screen, external hard disk, mouse, keyboard) It's definitely not worth the price.",

I mostly used it for admin type of tasks (word doc, ppt, xls, etc.) The laptop was typically on the desk, didn't travel with it, so it was pretty stationery. Apparently the screen malfunctioned (per GeekSquad's assessment) but it wouldn't even worked when connected to a monitor. It appears GeekSquad was not able to obtain necessary parts to repair it (after 7 weeks!). This is why I wouldn't recommend getting this model because it seems once it's down, it is down.
