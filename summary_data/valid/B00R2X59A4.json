To make sure I never blew over the .03 limit set by that system (and get charged $50 every time I did) I decided to buy this product with all the positive reviews. However, when I blew in each to see if they would give me the same read out, this device was .015 lower than the one in my car. That's a big shift in difference. This could say you are right at .08 but if you were to get pulled over you would actually be closer to a .1. I'm returning mine and hopefully find a more accurate device",

Mouth alcohol usually evaporates in 20 minutes. If you are still too high, get a cab. This is cheap insurance to make you think twice before drinking and driving. It is also a lot of fun at parties if you buy extra mouth pieces.",

It was eye opening to see how few drinks in an hour it takes to get to .08. I've used it about 20 times so far and it seems to be very accurate. And now i know i shouldn't have more than 3 beers in any hour...which will come in handy!",

      "text": "Seems to work well. You definitely have to wait the 20 minutes before you blow. Testing the device is fun and you can see some CRAZY readings right after someone has taken a shot. I'll say this, it's good to keep on you if you drink often and have an option not to drive. It's also very fun to have at your place when hosting a party so that people can decide to take a cab, or sometimes compete to see who can blow the most lol.",
