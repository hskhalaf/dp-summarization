The same thing happened to my speaker mood I used it once and then after that stopped working. Everything else seems to be working fine just wish certain things wouldn\u2019t break down so easily.",

And i searched for them on here and they are cheaper on here. $15-30 less depending on the color. I love that you can do so much w/ this headset, listen to music and have the music come out of the cat ears lol change the volume using the headset or cord and they sound really good too. Very clear. I want to get another color now just to have all of em lmao",

However, within the first week I noticed the sound jumping between ears as I moved and eventually just went to one ear for a while. It somehow fixed itself though. The cat ear speakers are intense in the best way and the lifts are very cute. Make sure to purchase a male and female cord. It came with a very high quality carrying case as well!",

Should have done my research because apparently this happens a lot. They light up perfectly though. I bought them for streaming online with my PS4 and they are kinda hard to figure out how to switch back and forth.",

She certainly has the coolest headphones around, according to her.",

That said within a month the LED on the right ear suddenly died, and this seems to be a pretty common problem along with the audio eventually dying too. Buyer beware, whether these things last or not seems to be a roll of the dice. Headset just broke, they lasted roughly a year before a thinner piece of plastic on the ear snapped.",
