I wouldn't say they are super easy to clean as my child put a scuff mark on one very easily and it won't come off with any cleaner or amount of scrubbing. Where I did scrub it left a dull spot on the mat, which kind of sucks. Overall I would consider it a good mat though.",

The cushioning material itself is nice and helps keep fatigue away during the work day. I recommend figuring out some sort of way to adhere it to the floor if you are putting this on top of carpet, because it won't stay in place on carpet. Tile or hardwood floors will likely be fine, though.",

We would not be able to work in our kitchen standing directly on the tile. Mats are thick and cushy. Smooth and easy to wipe clean. They were shipped flat with no creases and we purchased a 70\" mat. Both came in boxes large enough to remain flat. We've purchased cheaper mats in the past and were not as satisfied. Much more economical than replacing the tile. Excellent product.",

I find it useful and bought it for $24 when it was on sale so I am happy for the price point/service ratio.",

In my kitchen, the wood extends there, so I bought 2 of these mats. Not only do the mats make standing while cooking + washing dishes a lot more comfortable, it protects the wood flooring from the light splashes of water from the sink and oil from the cooking area. From a design standpoint, I bought the dark grey color and it matches my countertops elegantly as well. So far so good!",
