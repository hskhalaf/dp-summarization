Keeps the 30 minutes way more interesting. Since it's more of a glider motion than the stair like motion of an elliptical, my feet sometimes ache a little from being kept flat. It folds easily, light enough for one person to move. It is a bit squeaky, but no biggie.",

However, it squeaks every time I use it which can be annoying. Other than that it is a great product and if you follow the videos you will definitely start to feel the burn quickly.",

      "text": "Good product with sturdy construction. Very versatile in how you use it. The main complaint I have is that other than the cross bar, it comes unlubricated, particularly the sleeve bearings on the front and back of the pedals and the cable supports. These sleeve bearings must be greased, not oiled, to keep them quiet and running smoothly, otherwise the machine will squeak and make a lot of noise. It's surprising they don't come that way. To lubricate these properly you have to remove the fastening screw or bolt. The rear back pedal bearings are challenging to reassemble because of the spring loaded plastic housing.",

That said, it is really boring, I couldn't do it if it weren't in front of the TV. Also, there's nothing super comfortable to do with your arms. The handles are too high for me and my arms wear out quickly, the bar is too low, and there's not much room to swing your arms.
