I have owned several pairs of Maui Jims (different styles) and this is my first pair with the Grey lenses. I can now say for sure that I prefer the Bronze and Rose. The sharpness and color enhancements are amazing with them, whereas the Grey lenses feel brighter to my eyes and more like what you see with any old sunglasses. If you want to truly see just how \"above the rest\" Maui Jim is, get the Bronze or Rose lenses with your frame choice.",
