      "text": "I am in love with my DYMO 450 Turbo Labelwriter. It's a delight to use. I could have used help getting started, like being told there was software available for downloading or the MS Word plugin. But a quick search on YouTube showed me what I needed to know. I really like how quickly I can make a professional label or a funny one. I made quick name tags for a recent event and it was easy to add a nautical flair to the name tags to match the event theme. It's quick and easy to change labels and there are a variety of sizes available for purchase.",

      "text": "We ordered this for a major event check-in name tag printing and it was incredibly simple and easy to download the software, design our name tags and enter as our attendees checked in. It was far more efficient than printing hundreds of name tags ahead of time and trying to find the correct name tag (which slows down check-in). We could peel and stick them onto the clip name tags, but they were too wide to fit inside the name tag holders. It was exactly what we needed to streamline our event.",
