I have a 75lbs Malinois who technically measures 28inches from shoulder blades to root of his tail.. but then I went with my gut and got the 26inch instead. Lucky me, because the size fits perfectly and he even still has an inch of room (there is a cinch mechanism on the tail end that gives you some wiggle room). So if your pup is between two sizes, I would go with one size down. Other than the sizing issue, the coat is awesome quality! Definitely stoked to have my pup wear this during the cold Minnesota winters :)",

Besides the attachment method, I was also looking for belly coverage - pits have good bit of keel with little fur, and this coat provides precisely the coverage they need while fitting their wonky body shapes (I have three of different proportions). I also really like the adjustability for the inbetween sizes, and have taken advantage of it for my dogs' fit. HIGHLY recommend.",

It goes on easily, adjusts well for various body shapes (I have a bully breed, so it's hit-and-miss getting something that fits such a stout and beefy frame), and keeps me from worrying about whether or not the dog is too cold whether we're out in the neighborhood or hiking in the woods.",

Only thing I needed to improve on was the warmth factor. Found the summit parka and it's perfect. It's well insulated, keeps my pups dry, and fits them well even when they are being active. It adjusts enough to fit my long, lean coonhound and my stocky white lab. As hard as it is for me to spend this much on dog clothing, i'm a convert. haven't found any other jackets that keep my dogs warm and fit well enough to withstand some activity.",

She has had a number of coats over the years, but this one is the all time best! Well worth a few extra $$.",
