No more bulky layers under my ice fishing bibs...all I wear is these long johns and wool socks. Spent three days in a fish house and they were perfect... I wore them everyday without them being damp or malodorous. They were true to size and I had no problem with the band rolling or twisting. The knees got a tiny bit loose after wearing but was not an issue for me. I will definitely be buying the top.",
