So using a couple of jumper wires I connected the tact switch in the doorbell to the normally open side of the relay. An \u201calert\u201d from the Dakota receiver then acts like pushing the doorbell button activating the chime that is some 200 ft away. This is an easy way to add multiple annunciator locations to the Dakota system and increase the utility of the doorbell\u2019s wireless feature.",

And I'm not tehnical. And this time even included picking out the sound of the doorbell. So easy. Purchased because I couldn't hear when someone knocked on the door when I was in the back bedroom.

It is simple to set up when you CORRECTLY read the instructions. Has over 4 dozen different chimes to choose from. It's great.

It has over 50 rings including a few melodies. It is made of plastic and appears to be well made. When you press the doorbell the ring around the button lights up blue letting you know its functioning. The receiver/bell also lights up when the door bell is pressed, which gives you a visual warning that someones at the door.
