The issue I have is that this tape doesn\u2019t seem to stretch at all, so the use is quite limited. If I use it in places like ankles and wrists, it severely limits my range of motion. If too much force gets applied, the tape would eventually come off, which would mean that I must apply more. I\u2019ll definitely finish all of the rolls I\u2019ve purchased and I won\u2019t be returning them, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d buy again.",
