      "text": "I have used this for three years since being recommended to it by my stylist. The best! I have used Kiel's silk stuff and a host of others, nothing comes close. For me it lightly holds my (thankfully) thick hair in place, adds a bit of sheen, and diminishes the encroaching grey. I love it. My salon stopped carrying it as the distribution was apparently spotty so I am now buying it here. Really good for a mild hold and great silky manageability.",

It makes your hair look dirty, damaged and unhealthy. It has an unpleasant knack of making your hair lose the clean, glossy look from when you it wash and also gives it a strange texture that looks really unnatural. I could stay well clear of this product if you have medium length hair especially. On short hair it might be better but I previously used Aveda light elements texturizing creme and plan to return to this product asap.",
