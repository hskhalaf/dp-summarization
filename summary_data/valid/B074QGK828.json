I was debating options and got this plug for another light I had on a timer that operates from a floor plug. I had hoped it would fit into the recessed plug (it didn't--a bit too big) and thought I would try it for the outdoor light and was pleasantly surprised to see that it stays connected substantially more (like 95% vs 50%) than the first smart plug I got.",

Installing the plug requires you to download some third party app. I got the Amazon Smart Plug and that plugs in and installs seamlessly in the Amazon Alexa App. While the latter is more expensive, it is designed to allow the usage of both sockets, which is awesome.",
