Furthermore, calling customer service was a lesson in futility. But - look them on Facebook, send them an instant message and the response was almost instantaneous. So, the four stars are for lack of clarity on additional collars purchased and way less than stellar phone customer service",

Now Sammie is able to completely use the whole two acres thanks to our Sit Boo Boo Fence. Not a very smart dog but she learned the fence very quickly and absolutely will not cross that fence. Nice to leave her outside all day on a nice fall day.",
