A minor complaint is that they can get kind of load but its not the motor itself, its the air moving. i can live with that as long as I'm not getting eaten alive by mosquitos. i will likely buy more.",

So make sure you dont order these for your patio or where you want to hear someone speak. On a positive note they do provide lots of wind. Thank you",
