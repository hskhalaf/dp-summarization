Smouldering urban looks and rock-solid build quality aside, this Kodak is pain to use and delivers only average images. HD-style movies are better, but watch out for a sting in the tail -- that \u00a370 HDTV dock",

When I looked through the viewfinder to take a picture, all that was visible was blackness and wavy lines. The camera did not function at all. I turned the camera off and then back on to see if that would help and it read that it overheated and then shut down automatically. Very disappointed.",

The earlier reviews, about the battery cover flipping open occasionally, is one giant lie. The battery lid slides neatly in. The touch screen is another fantastic quality it has. It makes it look more like a mini computer than a camera! An almost buttonless wizard! Men, you cant believe the level this camera can give you, when you go to an occasion and as other people bring out their \"camera\", you bring out this \"near buttonless wizard!\"",

      "text": "I have Nikon dslr camera, very heavy and expensive, not for everyday use who likes to take pictures a lot, so I wanted something easy and simple after my Samsung exhibit phone lost its mind, which used to take great pictures. I read some of the reviews, and some said picture quality is good. So, I bought the camera but if you have taken picture with iphone or Samsung galaxy or Samsung exhibit, this camera is nowhere close to the picture quality of the above mentioned ones. And currently I use blackberry Torch, picture clarity of even torch is better than this camera, not happy.",

I love the touch screen and so does everyone that sees it. I've only have two minor complaints. The screen can be a little dark in bright light but I've still been able to see enough to take a good picture. The other complaint is that sometimes the touchscreen can have a mind of it's own, but this is very minor and once you get the hang of it, it's not a problem at all. I promise if you buy this camera you won't be disappointed.",

      "text": "We had this camera for one year. It worked great for the most part. Then we noticed it started to slow down. The time it took between taking one picture and then being ready to take the next took longer and longer. Then the zoom out function stopped working, so you could zoom in but you would have to shut the camera down and restart it to reset the zoom. A month after that it stopped working completely. It would turn on, the lens would come out make a few clicks then go back in and shut off. Completely useless now. I don't recommend this camera.",

There are several different styles and what not available to use, so you honestly have a very professional camera for a great value. Kodak is a great company and you can know that you will get a good product. Caution though. Don't buy from Beach Camera as they sold me a defective camera and left me in the lurch. Once I went up the chain of command at Kodak, they quickly replaced the camera and I couldn't be happier. Craig Charleston, SC",

If you are a everyday camera enthusiast, this is the camera for you. At under $200, it is very affordable with easily the same results as a $500 Canon or Nikon. The touchscreen works well but is sometimes hard to see in direct sunlight. The camera self-adapts its modes and works well in any environment. 10MP is more than enough for me and just using this camera, you can take pro quality pics with a consumer price!",
