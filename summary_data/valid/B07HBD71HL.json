I currently use my Yubikey with Dropbox, Google, Twitter, and KeePass. You can check Yubico's website to see which service's support Yubikeys. One thing to consider when purchasing a Yubikey is what features you'll need. There are some cheaper options such as the Security Key NFC that doesn't have all the features of the YubiKey 5.",

This additional security guarantees that no one will be able to access your personal information, unless they have the physical key. This can be used to login to your gmail account, protect finances; but if you lose the key you can't log in to your account anymore. Great security, may not protect you from an online attack though",

So I really don't understand how it enables \"passwordless\" authentication like Yubico claims it does.",
