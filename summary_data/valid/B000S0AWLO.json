Is amazing when you are working but doesn't have time to go check on your make up.",

One paper - edge to edge - does my whole face. I use it after my tinted SPF moisturizer and cream blush in the morning as a final touch before spritzing with rose water and dashing out the door. Perfectly matte and decreases pore visibility. I have my mom's pale Irish skin and no color transfer. Seriously has cut down on my makeup time by 5-10 minutes. I re-use around noon and am good until about 5. Forever convert!",

      "text": "I bought this about a year ago because I was surprised at how cheap it was (they're usually $5 a pack and this is 6 packs for $20), but the rice paper is more thinner than the real product. The real product has thicker rice paper. BUT I would still recommend because of the price and it STILL works pretty good. I have very oily skin and this gets rid of the oil. I use it about 2-3 a day. It's a must-have for me now.",
