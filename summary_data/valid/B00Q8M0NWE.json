If I bought one of these again, I'd pay the $200 more and buy from a local company where I could bring it back to them to fix. Update: I was able to return unit to Matronics. They repaired it under warranty and shipped it back fast. Working fine again, but I still would probably buy locally if I had to do it again.",

      "text": "Best pool cleaner I have ever had. This is an update to my last review. It's been almost 2 years and the only thing I done to it is replace the foam climbing rings. My house is built around my pool so everything that hits the roof winds up in the pool. I usually run the cleaner twice a day. The durability of this cleaner has been fantastic. I could not be happier. Update: over 2 years old could not be happier. After 2 years i did have to replace the rollers, sponge rings & belts but i run it 2-3 times a day. This is the greatest pool cleaner - all others i have had were junk in comparison.",

It cleans so much better than our old Polaris. The difference was visibly dramatic after the first time we used the Nautilus. It also uses far less energy than the Polaris 3/4 HP booster pump. We couldn't be more pleased. Definitely deserves a Five Star rating!",

It climbs the walls all the way to the water level, trys to clean the steps, but doesn't do a good job on them, so sweep them first. Very easy to clean the filters. If it cleaned the steps and didn't miss a couple of spots I'd give it 5 stars. This is going to make my job very easy, I'll update review after I have had it for awhile, so far very nice machine.",

It does a great job of cleaning the pool and leaves the water sparkling clean. Never need to hand brush the walls. Just drop it in and push the button. It even works underneath the safety cover. The filters are easy to remove and clean with top loading. I would recommend getting the caddy for ease of storage and moving it",

The filters are easy to clean with 2 twist locking hooks on both filters. Easy to empty and options on the type of filters you can put in the dolphin. I have very shallow steps (8\" deep) so it does have difficulty there as it is wider than the steps but this happens with all auto vacuums. Aside from my steps there is no extra work or attention needed. Good value in this purchase.",

It would power on and then power off after about four seconds. We do not get refunded or credited anything for shipping either and Dolphin only pays for repairs done by their mechanic. ABSOLUTELY do not waste your money. You're better off spending your $800 on a pool boy for the summer. Giant piece of crap.",

After the first cleaning cycle was complete, I pulled the filters out and there was so much sand/dirt picked up by the unit that I was amazed. I washed them out reinserted and did another cleaning today. It's only been 24 hours but I'm very impressed. I'll update in a few weeks but I'm sold on this unit.",

On the plus side it is easier to get out of the water and the filter removal on the top great. It is a solid cleaner - I just hope it last a long time!",

      "title": "Best pool cleaner I\u2019ve ever seen",
      "text": "After going through six Pool Rovers in 4 years, I had enough. I wish I had gotten this Dolphin to begin with. It\u2019s a much better cleaner; it does a better job and it\u2019s faster. The cord doesn\u2019t tangle up like the Pool Rover. It climbs walls, and it picks up stuff from the floor that other cleaners would miss. I\u2019m very happy with it and I\u2019m sure it will last longer than what I\u2019ve been using prior. My brother has one too and loves it.",
