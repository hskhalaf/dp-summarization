Kickball is great for families with young kids\u2014 you can all play together and it can still be fairly competitive! Buy this ball to do it. Just be careful of chain link fences. We had one get punctured because it landed on the top of the fence where the chain link was fairly sharp. So\u2014 maybe buy 2 just in case!!",
