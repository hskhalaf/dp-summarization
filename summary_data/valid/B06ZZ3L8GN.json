Larger than I had thought, I measured before buying, and I thought I could store them on the bottom shelf, but when I assembled them and tried, I had to move the middle shelf up another level before they would fit.",

The only con is the angle is not dramatic enough, so gravity is not quite enough to get the cans to fall forward when one is removed. I would rather these be 1\u201d taller with a more dramatic angle. However, a simple tap and the cans roll forward. These are much better than cheaper versions I\u2019ve tried and I ended up buying a second set.",

Of these sizes holds 10 cans; an 11th can will fit but slightly over the front guard on top rack. So much easier to add new product to top rack to dispense out vs. pulling product off the shelf when getting low to put newer cans behind to keep rotated. On occasion a can will get wonky rolling from top rack to bottom but a quick jiggle usually resolves. These are installed on a pantry shelf side-by-side, have not stacked units to review that functionality.",

No problems with assembly, made correct in the first place, some reviewers noted theirs were not so. No can punchers or cans popping out of the front when loading either. Just put one unit in the fridge, the other in the pantry. Nice to have but overpriced for what they are.
