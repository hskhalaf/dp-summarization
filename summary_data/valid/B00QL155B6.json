Remove them carefully and allow to cool completely before inserting sticks and dipping. They were moist and delicious. Huge hit. This batch with 1 cake mix made approx 60 cake pops. They come out prettier/smoother finish if you coat them with your candy melts twice.",

I made a bouquet for my son's teacher as my first project! After baking, I just removed any of the extra by cutting it away. Perfect little Mickeys and Minnies.",
