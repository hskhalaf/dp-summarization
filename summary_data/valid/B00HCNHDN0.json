You won't have most Google applications even the most common, and you will need to forget about other common applications you are used to in Apple's or Android devices. The other thing that bothered me is that you need frequently to reboot it because it tends to freeze once or twice a day.",

My big point was that the screen needed to be about one inch larger in each direction. -- And this 8.9 device does meet that requirement. The features for the future should be 1) an HDMI output 2) a replaceable battery 3) a low priced protective cover (not the expensive Origami). 4) A Bluetooth connector. I still use the Kindle Fire (7 inch) about 10% of the time since it is more portable. However, I prefer the larger format for about 90% of my reading. I also like the sound quality of the new device and the picture quality for viewing Amazon movies is excellent.",

It has a new music feature which is more like surround sound and some new video enhancement to prevent buffering. Also, like the Fire phone, the tablet now has Firefly, the ability to use the camera on anything and it will take you right to the product for purchase. This is great for Prime members. There is a slight modification to the log on screen but overall it's very similar in design to previous generations. And my favorite feature, the Mayday button, is still there. Geez I love that Mayday button.",

I am also pleasntly surprised at the battery life which actually seems longer than the smaller 7\" version.

I haven't been able to figure out why Amazon made the change to the keyboard. On the new HDX tablet, it is easy to accidentally tap 2 lower-case letters due to the smaller letters being so close together. In any event, I love the tablet and won't rate it lower based solely on the smaller lower-case letters on the keyboard. Maybe Amazon will read my review and design a down-loadable \"fix\" for it.
