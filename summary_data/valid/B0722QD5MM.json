It\u2019s a very minimal incline, but enough to make a big difference in sinus drainage for my 2 year old. He used to stay up all night due to coughs and colds. Since getting this and putting it under his mattress, even when he has drainage, it doesn\u2019t keep him from sleeping. It is truly a wonder we went so long miserably before making the purchase. I highly recommend it for 2 and up. Younger than that, I can\u2019t say.",

I lay her down at the top of her crib and in the morning she has scooted all the way down to where the crib mattress is flat. Still good quality product.",

Only drawback is a very chemicalized smell that came with the pillow. While I washed it, it seems to be from the foam rather than the case. The pillow also folds in half which I disliked at first but became more practical over time since it allows prop for a higher incline. Overall, great value for the price & can be used for tummy time as well. FYI Pediatrician recommended use after two months to ensure LO\u2019s head would not tilt forward & obstruct breathing.",

The size fits the bassinet when it is folded and unfolds to move to the crib with ease. I do not have to worry about her falling off the edge and getting caught between the edge of the bed and the wedge. The cover comes off for easy cleaning in the wash. I recommend this wedge for all new parents.",
