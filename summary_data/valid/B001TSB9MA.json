I try to pick out my hair after brushing, but the nest of leave in conditioner and fluff holds on like magnets. With some Windex, warm water and 3 minutes of scrubbing, my brush looks brand new. It's easy enough to do once a week. Don't be afraid to get a little aggressive with the scrubbing, it will work out in your favor.",
