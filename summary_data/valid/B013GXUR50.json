I probably have 20 hours into it and it has been great. If you start developing wrist or elbow issues one of the lighter more expensive racquets would be next or if you think you already have issues you might want to spend the extra 50-75 to get a light one.",

The price I bought on Amazon was $39.XX but the price on the racquet was $34.95 when it arrived.... not sure what the deal is there. I guess they need to cover their shipping costs but it was kind of annoying.",
