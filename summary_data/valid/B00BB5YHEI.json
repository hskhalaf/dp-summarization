Remington's product warranty specifically excludes returns regarding shaving foil, likely because Remington is aware of this issue. Replacement foils are not cheap ($20), which if you're required to replace every few months defeats the point of having an electric razor. You should take the $80/year it will cost you for replacement foils and just buy a better quality electric shaver, but based on my experience here I would not recommend that being a Remington.",

Just follow the instructions; gently glide over in small circular motion to get a nice smooth and close shave. The cutter assembly can be easily poped out for a quick rinse under running water together with the exposed blades. Rechageable battery allows cordless use.

It takes forever, compared to rotary shaver I used to use, doesn't get most of the hair, and it sheds everything that it does cut, so I have to stand in the tub. I would definitely not recommend it for someone using it on the head. I don't know why someone would answer that it works for heads. I'm buying a different shaver and hate this one.",
