The cat that adopted us (and is pretty much an outside cat due to that being his natural state) is a bush ninja and every collar we tried on him went missing within a day. However, this collar has prevailed! He still has it on! It's been months. We finally trusted the collar enough to put his ID tags on it. The reflective part of the collar is nice, but I don't see it being obvious enough to people driving/etc. It's a pretty sturdy, fabric collar although fraying/etc is definitely to be expected if your cat goes outdoors. Fantastic buy. If we ever go through the three provided, would buy again.",

My calico recently got hers caught on a limb. It broke away I'm assuming like it was supposed to. She wasn't injured at all. And I went outside with a flashlight. The reflective collar was glowing about 50 yards from my house caught on a limb. It didn't choke her/hang her \"my worst fear\" and a added bonus I found the collar because of its high reflection with literally 0 effort. Will purchase more to keep on hand for the future.

At first I thought it was the buckle that was low quality, but my professor told me afterwards that it was intended that way to prevent cats struggling and choking themselves when it got hooked on something else. Then it was the bell to blame. Originally the bell was connected by two rings to the collar and it was long enough for my cat to bite and drag the collar off by. So I removed one ring and my cat could never do that again. Another perk is that you can write with a marker pen your phone on the reflective band.",

      "text": "I have 3 cats and shopping for collars can get quite expensive. These collars came in a set of 3 for such a great price, I just couldn't pass up that deal. We have several other cats in the neighborhood that look similar to mine, so I love that I can spot my cats out amongst the rest. We do have a stray dog from time to time, so I like the snap apart safety feature in the instance they get stuck and need to get away. The band is very comfortable and easily adjusts. The best part is that the clasp is the shape of a cats face! Love it!",

I wanted a good collar that would come off if they got stuck on something Really anything to keep my babies safe from danger that having a collar or not having a collar could bring, these are a great value for your money, although if your cat scratches at it they get all fuzzy and weird. Now, most of my cats lost theirs but that's most likely my fault I put them on quite loose because I didn't want them to get hung up on a fence or something. One of my cats actually still has his to this day and I bought the collars in december! #ProudCatMomMoment",

My cat rarely lose them, and I usually throw them away because they\u2019re worn looking, not necessarily nonfunctional. I especially liked that they used a tiny key ring type attachment to affix the bells to the collars, so I could easily remove them if I didn\u2019t want them on there. Not fancy, but perfect for basic use, even on indoor-outdoor cats.",

You would pay $5 or more for one of these collars at any other store! I know... I checked. So to get 3 for $5 is a great buy. Hey, and even if you only need one collar, then donate the extras to your local adoption center :) Win, Win! You won't be disappointed with these collars. Meow!",
