One must make adjustments to ones TV settings. Besides turning off the television speakers and making audio adjustments (PCM, variable) one must also enable the CEC setting in order to turn on the HDMI ARC feature. Without that, the soundbar will play music but there won't be a peep from the TV. Also enable the Alexa app to detect the soundbar. Honestly, Bose, how much ink would it take to put those key points in the nearly blank instructions? It now works great but what frustration.",

Again, non-intuitive and it uses a light gray on white background. Does Bose think that color coding settings is not millennial cool?
