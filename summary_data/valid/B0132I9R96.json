For those who want a solid, fast commuting bike it works terrific. I switched out the big clunky White grips that get dirty if you even look at them. Put kool stop road brake pads for better stopping ability and put on white, black silver pedals to replace the ugly black plastic ones and the bike looks as well as it performs.",

One spoke was bent when received, the tools that it stated were included were not included, and the price of the bike went down a day after my purchase, (which is always disappointing). I ordered the XS size, with 700cc tires ( I am 5'0 and it was a perfect fit). I am finding it difficult to find a back rack that fits due to small frame and large tires. Again, I see these as minor issues and ultimately very pleased, hopefully this will be helpful for others considering this bike purchase. Lightweight,cute, comfortable ride!!!",

    "description": "The clarity 1 could be one of the luckiest bikes on the planet: it has inherited a slew of features from our more expensive models, making it a surefire value. This bike shines in fit, ride quality, and ease of use. Combining the riding position of a mountain bike with the efficiency of a road bike, our performance hybrid platform revolves around a lightweight aluminum frame. A low stand over height makes the bike easy to get on and off, and women's-specific touch points keep you comfortable on longer rides-the seat feels right and the handlebars are just where you want them. Smooth-rolling 700c road wheels and 21 gears keep your speed up on rides of any length, from trips to the store to weekend bike path excursions.",
