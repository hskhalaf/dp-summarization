      "title": "Very poor quality - had to return it",
      "text": "The blower worked fine but the cordless string trimmer was suspect from the beginning as the electrical switch that controlled the rotating head would not stay engaged. After using it intermittently for 1-2 hours, it quit completely and would not start again. We called WORX customer service and they were not available to take our call and we waited almost 2 hours for them to call us back. When they called back they were not at all helpful in trying to resolve the problem. The quality of the product is poor - made in China. We returned it and bought another brand. We will not purchase another WORX product.......ever. If we could give this product zero stars, we would.",

Eats battery life in about 12-15 minutes full power but really pushes the air out. Lower power settings the batteries hold up well.",

    "title": "WORX WG926 Turbine 56V 13\" Cordless String Trimmer/Edger & Leaf Blower Combo Kit",
    "description": "The WORX WG926 56-Volt combo kit gives you all the power you need with none of the gas to get your yard looking great. The combo kit includes the WG191 String trimmer/edger and the WG591 brushless TURBINE blower. The WG191 features a new command feed system, that can advance trimmer line instantly. No more bumping or waiting for line to advance before cutting. With command feed, the user electronically controls when to feed more line by pressing, then releasing, a pushbutton above the trigger. This feature not only conserves line, but eliminates downtime when edging and waiting for additional line to advance. This trimmer uses a thicker professional line (.080 in. Diameter), 1\" x 20' in length that is more durable than conventional line. WORX incorporates a quick-change, easy-to-load, pre-wound Spool accessory, so there's no fumbling with line changes. The trimmer also has a new method to switch from trimming to edging. This new twist-and-edge feature operates smoothly for a seamless transition between functions by simply pressing button at the top of the shaft and turning it. The WG191 comes with two wheels to steak the tool while edging, but those wheels can be removed and housed on the lower shaft to give you full visibility while in trimming mode. The trimmer head Pivots from 0 degrees to 90 degrees to give you any Angle you need for trimming and edging. The WORX WG591 TURBINE 56-Volt cordless blower with Brushless Motor features variable Speed capabilities. This allows you to gently clean out corners of the garage or patio and then crank up the power to pile up those leaves in the yard. The WG591 is a powerful 56V max lithium, lightweight cordless blower with TURBINE technology and a Brushless Motor which delivers up to 465cfm of air velocity. This allows you to get the job done quickly and efficiently. The blower has an ergonomic handle to make the job comfortable and the tool easy to handle.",
