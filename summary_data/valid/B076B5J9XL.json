      "text": "Total lifesaver! I bought these initially to help with a very drafty window. They worked well for that. A few weeks later we ended up with a leaky pipe in the laundry room. After going through countless towels to soak up the water I remembered these were good for absorbing water too. I can't believe how much water they soaked up. These saved me a ton of time cleaning up the water. Once the pipe was fixed I laid these outside to dry for a few hours and put them back on the drafty window. Definitely got my money's worth with these!",

My only complaint is that they were incredibly dirty/dusty when they arrived, such that I had to take them outside and shake them out pretty extensively. Looked pretty good afterwards though.",

She has had to replace window sills and plaster around windows several times because of constant moisture causing mold and even breakdown of mortar in the outside bricks. I put these is the windows and they absorb all the moisture before it has a chance to seep into walls. They are wonderful. She says she wishes she had these years ago.",
