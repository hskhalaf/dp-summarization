The bike was in perfect condition when it was delivered (my son scratched it with a screwdriver within an hour though), it went together very easy and rides smoother than I could have imagined. I do not know much about bikes but as someone who recently chose to use a bike as my main mode of transportation I am very pleased with it. Others say they do not like the seat. No complains so far but I may start to hate it.",

Think of putting a tortilla on a pencil and spinning that....slowly. It was bad. I couldn't straighten it so had to take it in. The bike technician's comment when seeing the wheel was \"whoa\". If you get this bike I recommend getting the professional assembly if they offer it. The amazon price for tune and assembly is probably better than you're going to get publicly and you'll likely need it. PS Brakes are bad. At minimum replace with some better brake pads.",

The front tire almost hits the frame as well with no clearance for the gear changing and rear brake wires. Pictures attached.",
