I had to run to local pet store and spend about $14 more to replace it. :( Not cool. Otherwise, neat little tank. Would have been perfect but for expired water treatment product.",

Additionally, although there are tabs that can be cut out to make room for tubes, etc, it is very difficult to cut those. I\u2019m going to have to get a replacement hood.

It came with the initial products I needed to stabilize the water. I guess it depends on how much you pay for it. It's totally worth the $40 I paid. I've had the tank for a week and I put platty fish in the day I got it. I put the \"Day 1\" ingredients (that came with it) into the water/tank and then put my fish with as much as their existing water as I could reuse in the tank (that was half full with tap water).",

Wonderful size for decorations for live plants both in height and width. I have not have any problems with the led lights like other people have commented about. There are way too many settings.
