Even thought there are multiple levels of brightness, I typically use the brightest white light. The arm is very flexible and stays where I put it. The power cord is detachable, which is nice for moving it out of the way when not in use. The base and the light themselves take up very little room. The light is very sturdy. I usually leave a personal size fan clipped to the arm near the top, and it's very sturdy.",

That's not saying it didn't come with them, just that assembly was straight forward. You can make it shorter by eliminating one pole as well. I love the 3 color options for lighting as well as the 5 levels of brightness! The neck is adjustable so you can maneuver it to your liking. So far I'm satisfied with this lamp. I hope it lasts. I'll update if it doesn't, but I recommend it unless you want something more expensive looking.",

She's had numerous lights to do her work by but none has been 'exactly right'. I spotted this unit, bought it, and told her to give it a try. She doesn't like it - she LOVES it. It is exactly what she needed. The controls are very user friendly and the flexible neck makes it good for whatever she's working on. This is a keeper",

Wish it had a telescoping height but its still plenty tall enough and it bends backwards so not a deal breaker. For $39.99 there is not a better lamp. Wanna make it a desk lamp? Just use one of the poles. This thing is really worth the money.",

They're a good solid weight and the gooseneck is helpful to adjust to where you want it. It also does not light up the room and only lights up what you want to see. I highly recommend it.",
