I sent it back for a new one and received the exact same thing. Bashed and dented box and lampshade. The Lampshade is about an 1-1 1/2 inches too wide for the box. Very disappointing to receive something in worse shape than the one I was going to replace.",

      "text": "I love my new Royal Designs lamp shade. It makes my inexpensive ceramic lamp base look expensive. It's contemporary and well made, worth every dollar. Next time though I'll be sure to buy a paper shade. The linen fibers show when the light is on and the shade turns tan, a characteristic of linen that I didn't know. The selection of shades is great and the quality, now that I have it at home, is apparent. I'll shop at Royal Designs again.",
