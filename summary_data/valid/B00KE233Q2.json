Thinness means you are more sensitive and flexible, which is good. It also means it tears easily and is sensitive to extreme cold/heat/chemicals; obviously bad. I wouldn't work with toxic chemicals, chemo or engine blocks. I would wash delicate china or glassware, apply medications with these gloves. If you want tough, stick with Halyard or Kimberly Clark.",
