They really run true-to-size, in my opinion. The glitter is well-done and secure; it does not flake off or leave glitter behind. I am also very pleased with how sexy Betsey Johnson is able to make a 4-inch heel appear (I am always skeptical of lower heel heights). I was a bit worried the glitter would be somewhat on the dark side for wearing with a wedding dress, but when I had them on together, it looked wonderful.",
