This works well on all types of grease, oils, and fine dust, etc. The odor is not so powerful as the acetone version (3M 08180). Does not cloud acrylic. Does not dissolve paint (YMMV). Evaporates quickly, so there is less runoff and mess to clean up. I used this to clean dry (wax) lube from a bicycle drive-train. I can easily go through a whole can for one cleaning. Serious gunk should be cleaned off with a penetrating oil and/or degreaser. I recommend saving this brake cleaner for the final rinse. (UPDATED: I had swapped part numbers accidentally.)",
