I am currently using it in my office and shop for both standard desk work and work bench level work. It is a very new style of sitting for me and I am still adjusting. My back feels great but there some soreness in my shins. I chalk it up to needing to adjust the chair and my sitting posture until we find that comfy spot for long term sitting.",

If you are my height or shorter I would seriously consider another style. The problem one's height poses is to get your knees to rest on the pad, you have to sit on the edge of the chair; this becomes quite uncomfortable on the butt relatively quickly. I find myself sitting more with my feet on the knee pad due to my knees starting to ache. My other issue is the construction of the chair allows it to wobble side to side quite a bit.",

I still shift and change positions often, but being able to sit at my desk allows me to get so much work done. My old standard desk chair caused a familiar back pain that made me scared I was going to herniate again. This however is lovely. The seat is faux leather so I would recommend a blanket over it if you're not wearing pants.",

Yes, it does put pressure on your shins/knees which overtime gets uncomfortable. A few weeks in and it has gotten much better, but still noticeable. Overall, would recommend.",

There was a problem with the 2nd and SLEEKFORM did not hesitate to correct it. Great product and customer services!",

The seat is quite comfortable, and the cushion my knees press into absorbs my weight, so my knees don't hurt at all. I'm short (5'5\"), but that doesn't seem to make any difference in my ability to get the most out of this chair. It works best when I limit my time sitting in it to two hours (with breaks during those periods to get up and stretch). Plus, customer service has been proactive and accommodating.",

This chair is solid, and it fits under the desk. It does take a while to get used to the pressure on your knees/shins, but if you make sure to move periodically, and sit in different positions, it isn't bad. It certainly feels better overall than a traditional computer chair.",
