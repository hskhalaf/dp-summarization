Two caveats: The lid is a bit hard to grasp for opening and filling. The inset lid handle is smooth and doesn't narrow where you would grab it. If I overfill the jug, and not all the water filters down, the filter floats up out of its position. If I do not notice but just pour some filtered water out, the rest of the water will bypass the floating filter (defeating the purpose).",

When you place the filter in it, great but then when you lean it to pour water out, it slams up to the top and sloshes water out but not too bad. Great design though. Great item to buy, plus cuts back on so many water bottles unless needed for emergencies.",

It is absolutely crucial that you pull out the filter every time you filtered your water, because it will get moldy and so you can trash it to the bin and buy a new one without bacteria and fungi ;-) Not the most convenient device, but the price was also low, so just keep the pitcher clean and take care of the filters, then youre fine :-)",
