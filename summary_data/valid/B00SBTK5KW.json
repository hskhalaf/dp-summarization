The ease of just opening a steep packet of loose leaf tea was wonderful and smooth. You just tear and pour the tea into the infuser. It is as simple as that. Boil water either over the stove or in an electric tea kettle and pour in your tea pot. Put the filled infuser in and wait for a little bit or put infuser in the ceramic cup with lid and in minutes you have wonderful calming experience because of the aroma and taste of tea . It was heavenly. Calmed my nerves perfectly.",

      "text": "Just received my box of tea.....it smells great when it's not used or open yet. But the taste of the tea wasn't fruity at all like the smell. It also smells totally different once used. I even had several friends smell it and give me their opinion and they said the same thing too. There's no hint of natural sweetness like I thought there would have been. The loose leafs are also so much more smaller than what's pictured because it spills all out of the tea ball and the holes in my tea ball are also very small. Not up-to-par with what I was expecting. This tea is too expense and I wouldn't buy it again.",

After the first sip, the tea goes down just fine. :) The only problem I came up with the loose tea is that some of it is so fine it goes through my steepers. I don't mind having loose tea in my water, but that has happened on three of the flavors I've tried so far.",

Also, the Earl Grey was especially strong and I didn't care for it or the red colored mug... but overall love the set as a complete package.",
