In many places they will serve you a been in a similar shaped glass. This glass is as good or better than the glass I drank the excellent beer from. They are so refined, delicate and yet durable I really do like to drink my beer from them. I still can't believe how nice they are. It is a real treat to drink a beer from these beautiful glasses.

Second, and more concerning, is that the bottoms are stamped \"Riedel 001\", not simply \"Riedel.\" Googling that, it turns out I was sold Riedel's \"Restaurant Series\" glasses that are only available at wholesale, not authentic Riedel Ouverture glasses. The former series of glass is sold for roughly $4 per glass while the latter type goes for $14-$15 per glass ($15 directly from Riedel). My hope is this was an accidental shipping mistake and will be immediately corrected by the seller. My experience on Amazon has always been great - I hope this isn't a sign of what's to come.",

Compared to the Vinum (or higher) series of Reidels, and I find the shorter profile and slightly thicker (though plenty thin enough!) stems and bowls make it easier to focus on enjoying the wine, rather than worrying about tipping over or breaking the glass. They're only about ten bucks each, so it's no Shakespearian tragedy if one gets broken at a dinner party.",

Weighted slightly at the stem and you will not feel it is too delicate because if it. Most people are happy to drink beer out of the bottle or can these days, but it will be so nice to have them on the table visually plus it's more classy to drink out of a glass :-)",
