Obviously, the issue doesn't go away that fast, but I am on day five and am nearly back to normal. Normal skin tone and all....without the pricklies. Thank you!",

Our powders are all free of talc, grains, and anything synthetic. Talc is now known to remain airborne for an extended period of time, allowing it to get into the lungs and has also been found in other various body tissue where it doesn\u2019t belong. We don\u2019t like this. Corn and grain starches, a common powder ingredient, has been shown to exacerbate certain types of rashes. We don\u2019t like this either. Our powders are all free of talc, grains, and anything synthetic. We make our unscented baby powder truly unscented because babies smell good enough all on their own. It is important to be aware that with the newborn, scent is a crucial part of the bonding experience between mother and baby. It is known to be a factor in the establishment of the breastfeeding relationship too. As challenging as the early months of infancy are, the more we learn about it, the more we see that nature got it right. We like to stay out of the way. Enjoy. Please be in touch with any suggestions, questions, or just to send us some love. We like that too! -Ora",
