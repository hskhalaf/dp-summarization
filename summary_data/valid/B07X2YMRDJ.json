These work better for my husband, who has a cute button nose, than they do for me. I have a wide flat nose so I need a lot of \u201cflex\u201d up, which means I need good adhesion to grab and pull out to get that good air flow. These performed pretty well but could be a little better.",

My husband says they're helping the chainsaw noise too. Small update. I tried to use some store brand and the brand name ones again since we were at the store and they were easy to grab. Big mistake. The store brand ones left my nose raw and peeling. The brand name ones were \"okay\" but not as comfy as these. It's worth the very short shipping wait.
