We bought 2 and they work great with our PS3 motion controllers. If playing Gran Turismo (and potentially other games), you need to set your motion controller to 1 & 2 before launching the game. I ended up changing the button associations quite a bit as well. The paddles WILL work.. I believe they need to be remapped to L1/L2 or L2/R2 (Had to Google it and am not in front of the console to verify)",

      "text": "I can't blame this vendor for being in Quebec Canada, nor for selling a product that probably works okay, but I paid $48 (with shipping) to buy two of these Sony MOVE racing wheels, which I could not use since I couldn't calibrate two Sony MOVE wands, and I wound up paying $43 to return them, unopened, to Canada. Plus the vendor will deduct the original shipping charges from my refund, as he has a right to do, so I will wind up paying over $50 for absolutely nothing! Nobody's fault I guess, except Sony for making faulty MOVE wands and software, but it's the last time I buy from a foreign vendor through Amazon, nor any Sony MOVE products.",
