The only reason I ranked it 4 stars is because I ordered two of them and they weren't exactly the same. One was boxier and the other was more rounded. Overall, great product, especially if you're only ordering one.",

One major deficit with the design is that I like to water my succulents from the bottom - so that the water absorbs up into the roots, but the dish is so shallow, that not only do I have to water from the top only, but I have to be careful that the water doesn't come out and overflow on the tray.",
