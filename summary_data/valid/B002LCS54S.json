      "text": "I was tasked with remodeling the basement before our baby arrived, and could not have completed it as quickly as I did without this lift. It was in 3 pieces when I got it out of the package, and putting it together was very easy. The crank wheel and main support is very heavy. Very intuitive interface, and easy tear down. This literally takes all the \"grunt work\" of lifting drywall out of your hands. Just align, lift, and screw into place (or use nails, if you're a heathen). I will most likely never need this lift again, so my initial thought was to just sell it afterwards, but I'm having a hard time letting it go to be honest.",

The bathroom was full of tight corners and obstructions (i.e. toilet, tub) that made getting the hoist into position difficult given its wide footprint, but once it was there, it raised the drywall pieces without issue and held them in place while we put in the fasteners. We have a lot more work to do in that house and are confident that this hoist will continue to serve us well.",

Large casters made moving and positioning it easy, even when fully loaded, and there were no problems working the wheel-crank and wench assembly. Thank you Best Choice!",
