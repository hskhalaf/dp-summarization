To receive other radio station you need to purchase access to the radio software. Also, you should join the yahoo group for this radio. Outside that, the setup is easy (if you follow the instructions). Radio output is ok, it sound more boxy that anything else even if you change the output quality. Its ok for this inexpensive radio. 12/19/2012 ===== This unit is still working fine and with the use of Tversity is streaming to my shed or garage depending were I use it.",

No problems updating the firmware, no problems getting them onto my wireless network. I'm happy with the sound of the speakers, I have one unit hooked into my stereo system One day I'll probably buy one of those $300+ units out there but for now I have more internet radio stations that I need",

Bottom line, you need to jump through too many hoops to get this thing to sing for you. Good Luck!",

The interface (screen) is not much different from the SMC wireless media adapter I have, but the remote is much better and the buttons on the unit are handy. The speakers are only good enough for a small room (I use mine in the bedroom) I don't use internet radio really, so no comment on that feature. - Cheers",
