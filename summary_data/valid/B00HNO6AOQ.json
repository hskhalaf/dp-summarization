They aren\u2019t very warm but they do keep my feet dry in the rain. I normally wear a 9, 9.5 or a 10 depending on the shoe so after reading other reviews about size I decided to go with a 9.5 and I am so glad I did because they fit me perfectly. I\u2019ve worn them with heavy wool socks and light weight ankle socks and always experienced a great fit. I would recommend these stylish boots to others.",

      "text": "I previously had a pair of Sorel Out N About Boots without ties, and needed to replace them. I had difficulty finding the same design in my size, so settled on this version with laces. While I like them, the opening for your foot to slide in is much more narrow than the slip-ons, so they are not as convenient to slip on quickly. And, because of the height and narrow opening, tall socks are necessary or they rub. Still satisfied with the purchase, although I will continue to look for my preferred original version.",

I have a wide foot with a very high arch and the support in these is great and feels comfortable to wear all day walking around! They also do a great job at keeping my feet warm and dry even in the cold North Eastern winter. I definitely receive compliments everytime I wear these!",
