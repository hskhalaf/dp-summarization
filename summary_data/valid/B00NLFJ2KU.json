I loved this camera, however, the 'cover' to the shutter speed dial came off and is lost. I've tried everything and everywhere to get a replacement, which could be fitted with a dab of glue, as was the original. No luck. That \"company near Gatwick\" didn't even bother to respond to my illustrated request, and all others want me to send the camera... with battery (fully charged) AND the charger, fully insured return postage paid approx \u00a325 plus minimum charge 50-60 more quid...

The video quality is also extremely impressive for a camera of this class, if you are looking for a holiday camera and don't want to lug around a big SLR ( I switched to this from my Canon 700D + L Glass set up) you will not be disappointed.

I received it the day before travelling to Disneyland Paris, but managed to get wonderful photos including of the firework display at night. The automatic mode is excellent. Only negatives are: a little larger than I'd have ideally liked (the RX100 was better here); the flash isn't built in (but is excellent considering its size); and the lack of an electric lens cap. The image quality, performance, ease of use, and video quality all more than make up for this. Very glad I opted for this rather than the more expensive latest gen RX100... Highly recommended.",

Such a shame as the thought of having full manual control and a proper view finder really appealed, I bought this as an additional camera when out and about with my full frame DSLR - I wasn't expecting miracles but I expected better than what I got. Back to the drawing board to find a manual point and shoot that delivers on quality and performance.",

    "title": "Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX100EBK Premium Compact Camera with 24 mm LEICA DC Vario-Summilux Lens - Black",
    "description": "Colour Name:Black\n\nLUMIX DMC-LX100 - DESIGNED TO INSPIRE CREATIVITY\nThe LX100 combines a Micro 4/3\" sensor with a fast 24mm Leica DC Vario-Summilux lens and manual operation. It offers a level of creative control usually only found on more complex camera systems.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY\nIMPROVED DYNAMIC RANGE, IMPROVED IMAGE CLARITY\nAt the heart of the Lumix LX100 is a 12.8-megapixel Micro 4/3\"MOS sensor - the same type found in more complex camera systems. With a surface area that's greater than many conventional compact cameras, the LX100 has improved low light performance, saturation and defocussed bokeh capture. The larger sensor and dedicated ratio switch let you quickly select different aspect ratios - including 16:9 for wide-angle composition.\n\nView larger FAST, WIDE LEICA LENS\nWith one of the widest lens in a large sensor camera, the LX100's 24-75mm Leica DC Vario-Summilux offers improved creative flexibility. The F1.7-2.8 range allows for improved low light capture and blur reduction. The unique optical design offers the same performance as a system camera lens, but with half the focal length. Nine diaphragm blades ensure smoother background defocus gradation.\n\nUSER COMFORT\nMANUAL CONTROLS INSPIRED BY CLASSIC CAMERA DESIGN\nWith an analogue control environment routed in established camera design, the LX100 has a dedicated aperture ring, focus ring, shutter speed and exposure compensation dial. There's a comfortable, instinctive and tactile familiarity to the feel of these controls. With the LX100, you're given greater freedom to make quick, flexible, creative decisions with even greater accuracy.\n\nPinpoint Autofocus HIGH DEFINITION LVF FOR PRECISE DETAILS\nThe LX100 features a 2.764K high-resolution viewfinder. This allows you a greater degree of control when framing shots and integrates manual focus aids and autofocus feedback in an instinctive and responsive fashion. The viewfinder offers a 35mm equivalent magnification.\n\nINSTINCTIVE FOCUS CONTROLS\nFor shooting in different environments, the LX100 is equipped with a number of tools to help you capture high quality, rich imagery. Using micro contrast detection, focus peaking provides a real-time and intuitive graphic display of focal areas. MF Assist offers up to 10 times magnification for assured crispness, while Pinpoint AF lets you easily designate specific focal points in low light conditions.\n\nCREATIVE PHOTOGRAPHY\nENJOY RICH DETAIL WITH 4K VIDEO\nThe LX100 shoots video at 4K. With this resolution, greater clarity, depth of detail and colour is captured at source, and allows for improved flexibility when editing. Techniques such as stabilisation and pans can be applied to footage without loss of quality when exporting to full HD. Videos shot at 30fps in 4K allows each individual frame to be extracted as an 8MP image, so you'll never miss a moment.\n\nRAW: AS RICH AS A NEGATIVE\nThe LX100 can capture images in RAW format, preserving them with the minimum of processing. Colour and light information, as well as metadata, is taken directly from the Micro 4/3\"MOS sensor, to allow for greater flexibility when reproducing and editing your images.\n\nIN DEPTH\nAPERTURE RING\nExperimenting with depth of field can add character an expression to your imagery. The LX100 offers a number of different settings - including analogue program mode (both shutter and aperture set to A), aperture and shutter priority, as well as full manual control.\n\nMANUAL FOCUS RING\nUse focus to add emphasis to images. The manual focus ring is placed to allow you to easily make creative decisions. Manual assist lets you quickly gauge focal crispness by enlarging a section of your composition by up to 10x.\n\nSHUTTER SPEED DIAL\nAdd a dynamic quality to your images by experimenting with the shutter speed. The LX100 offers automatic mode (both shutter and aperture set to A), shutter priority as well as full manual control.\n\nEXPOSURE COMPENSATION DIAL\nBy using exposure control, you can make fine adjustments to accommodate unusual lighting conditions, lens filters and even to over or underexpose images intentionally for effect.\n\nLIVE VIEW FINDER\nThe LX100 has a high definition Live View Finder with a resolution of 2.764k. This allows for precise composition in strong sunlight with 100% field of view. The refresh rate is 60fps, making it ideal for action photography.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nDimensions (W x H x D): 114.8 x 66.2 x 55.0 mm\n\nWeight: Approx. 351 g without Battery and SD Memory Card/Approx. 393 g with Battery and SD Memory Card\n\nCamera effective pixels: 12.8 Megapixels\n\nSensor size / total pixels / filter: 4/3-type High Sensitivity MOS Sensor / Total Pixel Number 16.84 Megapixels / Primary Color Filter\n\nLens aperture: F1.7 - 2.8 / 9 Diaphragm Blades (F1.7 - 16.0 (W), F2.8 - 16.0 (T))\n\nLens: LEICA DC VARIO-SUMMILUX/11 elements in 8 groups/(5 Aspherical Lenses / 8 Aspherical Surfaces / 2 Dual-sided Aspherical Surface ED Lenses)\n\nFocusing area: Normal: 50 cm - infinity/AF Macro / MF / Intelligent Auto / Motion Picture: Wide 3 cm - infinity / Tele 30 cm - infinity\n\nViewfinder: 0.38\" LVF (Live View Finder) (2764k dots equivalent), Field of View: Approx. 100%/Magnification: Approx. 1.39x / 0.7x (35mm equiv.), Eye Sensor\n\nRecording modes - filters (Creative Control): Expressive, Retro, Old Days, High Key, Low Key, Sepia, Monochrome, Dynamic Monochrome, Rough Monochrome, Silky Monochrome, Impressive Art, High Dynamic, Cross Process, Toy Effect, Toy Pop, Bleach Bypass, Miniature Effect, Soft Focus, Fantasy, Star Filter, One Point Color, Sunshine (22 filters)\n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nBattery Charger \nBattery Pack \nAC Cable \nUSB Cable \nLens Cap \nLens Cap String \nHot Shoe Cover",
