That really narrowed our choices. And the important point is that the child loves and appreciates her gift.",

I like that the drawers are each side of the box. There is at least one drawer on each side. The music is not too loud and winding is quite easy which was a concern for me. Previous reviewers have commented on the size of the box. It is the perfect size for a little girl. It will hold just enough 'jewellery' to make them feel they have a lot of treasures. I would purchase this item again and am looking forward to seeing it in use.",

She loves to wind it up and listen to it, watching the ballerina twirl. No problems at all-- I feel this product exceeded my expectations.",
