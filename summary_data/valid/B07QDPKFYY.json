This is being used by a female friend and her fingers aren't strong enough to get them to work at all. I can get them to work, only with great difficulty. It's easier to pop the iPad out of the case than to try and get the buttons to work in the case. I was disappointed with the selection of cases available for the 5th gen mini. I hope that will improve in the future.",

I bought this clear OtterBox case and purchased the Apple Smart Cover, as well, to use together and they are perfect! My stickers are on the back and not at risk of getting worn off and I feel like the iPad is fully protected!",

It\u2019s unclear if the just don\u2019t line up over the iPad properly or if they\u2019re just not made to move enough to effectively work.

This clear version lets the aesthetics of your iPad mini shine through. It has plenty of grip even though the case is smooth. I do find the volume buttons to be a little bit hard to press. Hopefully this will become easier over time. I do like the Apple pen holder and removable side spine. These are new features that I haven\u2019t seen before in a symmetry case.",
