      "text": "I have just returned this camera having found still images produced to be soft focussed regardless of whether produced with JPEG or RAW. I am an experienced photographer & understand how the camera should be set up. Video was good but my assumption is that either this camera was faulty , or as indicated in some professional review sites, there may be a problem with the lens arrangement. I have subsequently purchased the Panasonic FZ 1000 which produces excellent still images & video whilst being cheaper & lighter.",

The main let downs are : 1. contast detection autofocus isn't good - in fact , just use manual and save yourself a headache. 2. the lens is mediocre , but adequate. 3...VLog-L is extra purchase - I wouldn't bother , bought it , never use it. Big positive : 1. can send 4:2:2 10 bit to external recorder , like Atomos 2. good stabiliser 3. loads of features",

I already had a lower end Lumix FZ camera which was pretty good so I went for Panasonic's top of the range model. It didn't disappoint. It is easy(ish) to use and the picture quality is very good. It has a lot of features - I'm looking forward to trying it's time lapse feature.",

A lot more features for the serious videographer such as the built in ND filter system, colour bars, master pedestal and Cinelike D & V profiles. 4K video is superb and even if you downscale to 1080p it gives you flexibility to crop into a shot and get higher resolution.",
