With the programming that comes into play and all the different pieces, he has had a lot of fun with this and has learned a lot. He gets excited with the projects involved and has learned how to create things on his own. I highly recommend this to an older student or any adult with an interest in electronics.",

Not sure if I will build a Andruino drone or one built on Raspberry Pi. Maybe both. If you want to start learning about electronics, I would highly recommend this kit. Sure the components could be higher quality, but I can't complain since it comes with so much.",

Came with a load of peripherals that will undoubtedly get used in some project or another in the future.",

Secondly, none of the tutorials tell you what is going on under the hood, except for the obvious like telling you that and LED lights up when you connect a wire to it. Lastly, you need to know how to code to use these guides, as they do not explain how the code works after the first tutorial or why a certain line of code is used to create an output.
