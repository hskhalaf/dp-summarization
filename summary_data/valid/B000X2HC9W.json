I used to hate having to use this stroller because of its many flaws but things have definitely changed ever since I ordered this stroller organizer! I love it I can fit so much in it. There's a place for my phone, keys, and water bottles. The mesh part of the organizer is amazing I throw so much in there lol and dont worry about it because its sturdy enough. This is a must have! Stop thinking about it and order it!",

Hoping I can return or get a new one that can last more than 3 days. Aside from that it is a great caddy.",

We\u2019ve had it for almost a year now and it\u2019s still in great condition. It holds so much. I just love it and am so glad I bought it! November 2019 - Like this very much. Lots of storage space. Cup holders expand nicely (just don\u2019t put anything in the zipper compartment behind them). Feels sturdy. Obviously not meant for a lot of heavy items, but that\u2019s fine. We use it for pull-ups, wipes, and a few other lightweight odds and ends. Great bag for a great price.",

There were also a few other things that were crammed in there from time to time.

Suggestions- move cup holders to middle, insulate them, and have divided center compartment secured by magnet. Modifiy the back zippered pocket so it is the mesh bag (with zipper access) with ability to rollup and secure excess bag when not needed. (Still allow zippered part to be functional for diapers, etc.) Keep front zippered long pocket and front center. Add small mesh pocket where one cup holder is now and modify one holder to an open padded pocket for sunglasses, etc. Just a thought!!",

But as soon as you put in a 32 ounce cup from a gas station or Burger King the whole organizer collapses. That is the only reason I give it a bad review. I bought it specifically to carry large sodas while walking around places I cant carry my kid.",

The cup holders are to small to put a cup in but hold a bottle of water great and probably would hold one of those metal water bottles well. There was plenty of space to hold our books and all of our souvineirs and stuff like that. Honestly I wish I had had this for years on my previous trips, it worked great. I left the stroller there but brought this home with me to pass on to someone who could use it.",
