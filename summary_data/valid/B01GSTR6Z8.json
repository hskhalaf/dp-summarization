You really have to wait till your hair is just slightly still damp and THEN put it on. If you do that, it really will work wonders. Trial and error on your part will give you the best timing for your own hair.",

I've tried using less of it to see if that would work, and I still have the same feeling. I've settled into just using it at my roots, and that seems to have helped. There's other products that I'd recommend over this one, but those are more expensive. For the price of this though, it's not bad!",

Not like someone can use this and go from very fine hair to thick, so don't expect that, but it does add a noticeable thickness and allows me to have more hairstyle options than I would have without it. Taking all factors into consideration for the rating, I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the price.",

Not only did it thicken my hair noticeably, but my hair had body I would never have guessed it had. My hair sits just below the chin line and is in layers. My hair is thin and very fine and since using this product, I will never be without it with my results. Love, love, love it. Oh, and by the way, not greasy at all. Leaves no film on the hair. Wonderful product. No negatives in this review.",

Once the gel itself sets/dries and I brush my hair before styling, my hair looks and feels thicker without this overt stickiness. Purchased 2-bottles: will either return or drop in garbage. Sorry, but this is the truth of my experience. I am now going to rewash my hair to get this stickiness OUT!",
