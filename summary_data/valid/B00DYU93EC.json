Easy for my kids to fix themselves a snack. The results are much better than using the microwave when you want to create a crunchy exterior like on chicken nuggets, also great for reheating.

We cook frozen pizzas in it by setting the timer to 10 min, 500 degrees and immediately throwing the pizza in without waiting for it to preheat. If the oven is already hot, subtract 3 min. The handle does constantly loosen over time so high temp thread locker is recommended to solve that problem. The unit itself using very thin stamped stainless. It works well enough but makes it feel cheap. A pizza stone for cooking your own pizzas is recommended.",
