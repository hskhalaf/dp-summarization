I\u2019d highly recommend if you have a place to display it. The build wasn\u2019t too bad except all the clear pieces can be tough to sort through.

Now that you know whats going on with this model, re-build the ship & bottle but this time include the wiring for the light kit as you go. Much easier than ripping stuff apart as they would have you do in the light instructions (again, see flimsy build).",
