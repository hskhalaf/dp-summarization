      "text": "Can't praise this lens enough. It's light, fast and very, very sharp. It has excellent colour rendition and the bokeh is very smooth. I've tried many L lenses and this has got to be one of the best ones, and unlike say the 85mm f/1.2 there's no learning curve with it. Just take it out and use it. I use it for street photography when I want to isolate a subject from the background, and at motorsports events for the back story (pits, etc). It's excellent for portraits, low light candid shots, etc, etc. Highly recommended.",

I favour it over the 70-200 f/2.8 is II as the larger aperture makes for a more versatile offering indoors and in reduced light conditions. Also, the fact that it's smaller & black rather than white is a tremendous advantage when trying to capture more candid scenes, especially portraits, which given the 135mm focal length is what this lens excels at in my opinion.",

The quality is superb, it focusses quickly and accurately even in low-light indoor conditions, the range is perfect for candid party shots, and it's extremely versatile - portraits, snapshots, still-life, landscapes, pretty much anything you can throw at it. The only thing you may not like is being on the receiving end, as the lens element has an eerie irridescent green glow to it which can be quite intimidating! Bear in mind that on a cropped sensor camera (e.g. 30D, 400D, etc.) this will be the equivalent of a 216mm lens which may not be quite as useful indoors.",
