After talking with tech support and detailing the problems they agreed to replace the unit. The replacement I received was a refurbished unit, and it too died in short order. I took good care of both printers for the short time I had them, and neither one was used more than 5 times. Bottom line- don't buy this, it's a waste of money.",

I don't print everyday and almost every time I tried to print something I'd have to clean the nozzles and that didn't usually work. I can't even comment on the print quality since there was always at least one color that wasn't printing and the colors that were printing weren't printing well. I was spending more on the ink than I did on the printer to begin with. If you don't print every single day don't buy this printer.",

It will not feed paper and when it does decide to feed a sheet, it comes out blank! No print. The really sad part is that I bought this printer for business purposes and it has made it impossible to do any business! I make personalized shirts until now! I was right in the middle of completing a large order due on Saturday Sept 3,2005 and can not finish if the printer won't print anything! It goes back today for a different brand. Maybe Canon is more reliable? I rate this printer a big fat ZERO!",

It's also worth noting that the CX6600 is also a more recent model, and a bit my stylish than the boxy CX4600.",

For me I print about one thing a week, clean it once a week which causes my ink to run out in about 8 weeks. On top of this the cartridges are hugely expensive. I estimate I am paying somewhere around ten dollars a page! Obviously this printer is useless for my needs.",
