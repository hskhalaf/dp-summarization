      "text": "This product comes in a nice little dust bag made of the same fabric. Very cute pattern, had a nice soft Silk feel to it. Compared to its competitors it holds up very well! I really got this to protect my baby from outside elements and from strangers trying to touch her and it definitely does its job! I did take away one star because I felt like there was a little to much fabric at the bottom, it sometimes hangs over and gets in the way when trying to click in my Greco car seat into the stroller. I do understand this is made to be universal for all car seats & breastfeeding moms. Hope this was helpful!",

I have a Graco Click connect and the cover didn't fit like the picture, so the fabric is all in my baby's face. The cut at the top where the handle goes through is too large causing it to sag down. I've had this for 6 months now and have only used it ,3 or 4 times. I just started using a blanket instead.",

The only downside seems to be the fact that it stretches too easily when taking the cover on and off the car seat multiple times. When it stretches out, it hangs too far down the handle and in my baby's face. I have to wash and dry it a little more often than I'd like to, in order to tighten the fabric back up. Overall tho, that issue will not stop me from using. It's also a very cute print and great price!",

I mainly use it to keep people from reaching in or touching the baby when I take him to doctor\u2019s appointments.

The only thing is that creates the ultimate body heat and it get super hot inside there. So I point a small fan from the floor up to get some circulation for the baby. It's not see through so you can use it anywhere, I personally wouldn't put it over the carseat just cause I'm paranoid about baby getting fresh air circulation, I havent tried it. I wouldn't let baby sleep in my little contraption unless the fan is blowing.",
