Apparently this is a common problem with this camera based on my Google search results. Unfortunately, I missed my window of opportunity to return the unit by about a month and eligibility for support expired last month. Typical. I think the quality of the camera is highly overrated. I would not buy another one and now l am wary of the Leica brand in general.",

No flash needed so far and it's been 3 months. Pictures are perfect 95% of the time the remaining 5% is user error. I now have a desire to use \"stop action\" shutter speed control and changing \"depth of field\" arpeture control. Manuel mode wow, I thought I was done with that. Ease of use great when want it and ease of Manuel use is terrific. My only complaint is the pics and movies now need a new home on iCloud or biggg hard drives.",

The Leica makes it very convenient to manage everything without using the menu system - a huge plus for me. Rock solid feel, perfect layout of controls and excellent picture quality. A bit awkward to hold though. I have ordered a grip from J. B. Designs and hope that solves the problem. It's half the price of the Leica grip and more interesting to look at... IMO.",
