The texture and vinyl is a matte texture, which makes it look more painted on the wall. It was incredibly easy to place the flowers by myself (which is awesome to say for large format decals). I placed them on a textured and painted drywall surface with no issues. I'll update if I have any difficulty with peeling up, but I dont forsee that being an issue. Really worth it!",

I do want to advise if you want the look from the photo it can be quite time consuming as each sticker, leaves included, are indiclvidual so you have to make sure each one is exactly where it needs to go. It did take us several hours to place them the way we wanted, but we can be very meticulous. Other thank that the product is perfect.",
