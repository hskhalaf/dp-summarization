I have very sensitive gums that demand I use an extra soft toothbrush (or they up and recede on me, so rude). These have soft enough bristles to keep my gums happy! I also *really* like that the packaging does NOT have a surprise plastic film sleeve around the toothbrush... thank you!! The whole reason I switched to bamboo was to reduce plastic use - so, GoWoo gets a big happy thumbs up from me, my gums, and the environment. Good job guys!",

If you dispose of your bamboo toothbrush every 2-3 months (I change mine around easy to remember holidays so I don't forget) then you shouldn't see splinters of wood or anything - these are good toothbrushes. Also, I keep these on hand in case guests forget to bring theirs. If it isn't their preferred thing, then when they throw it away at least it isn't more plastic sitting around forever. Plus the packaging is recyclable. This is an easy way to make a small change and it doesn't hurt your teeth.",

All I know is using wooden toothbrushes is immeasurably better for the environment than the classic plastic brushes. These bristles won't break down easily, but the handles will decompose much quicker than a plastic alternative.",

The two positives: 1) they are different colors, which makes it easy to tell them apart 2) They have a smooth, round grip, which is more ergonomic than some of the other brands I've tried. Unfortunately, none of us like the bristles. They feel too scratchy and at the same time don't seem to do a good job making our teeth feel clean unless you really scrub, which then irritates your gums. One of my children has braces, and these bristles kept getting stuck. For those reasons, I would not buy this brand again.",

I find the toothbrush pretty cumbersome to use as well, I think the wood at the head of the toothbrush is too thick and I find it difficult to reach the back of my mouth with it. Will continue looking for a brand that more closely replicates the performance of a plastic toothbrush.",

      "text": "These are the BEST toothbrushes I have ever used, even better than those handed out by my dentist! The bristles are SOOOO soft up against my sensitive gums. NO bleeding when I brush at ALL! That's a first! And I love the feel of the bamboo handles. These feel like they're so well made and will last for quite awhile, but I'm very glad that when they DO finally wear out, it won't take forever for them to break down and return to the earth in a usable form again. Win-win-win for everyone!!! :)",

They also are much cheaper than some of the other brands. Unfortunately, the bristles are made from nylon. Another brand I tried had some kind of natural fiber and charcoal which I thought was a nicer option.",

I will say the first brush I used got a little poke-y after using it a few times after the friction from brushing caused the bamboo to wear away a little and get some bumps and grooves on it. It's hard to explain, so hopefully that makes sense. It wasn't a big deal in the end, just wanted to point out one of the things I noticed that was different from using a plastic brush.",

My kids loved choosing their color (the bristles and end of the brush were blue, yellow...etc) and have made the switch to bamboo. I don't think we will go back to plastic brushes again: ) .",
