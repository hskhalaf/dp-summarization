The product inside the package reflects this condition, squishy, crumbling and damp, nearly 1/3 of the individual packets are empty , sealed and puffed with air but empty !

That's a problem, since separating gel packs can cause them to rupture. These are individually wrapped, so they stay dry until you are ready for them. They clean the dishes very well, and I think they etch less than other brands (we have soft water).",

We very rarely have a situation where we pull something out of the dishwasher and have to rewash it. Keeps glassware streak free. Amazon's prices on this product are insanely cheap and usually much better than Target or other big name stores.",

No more pink gunk, dishes are generally clean, no bad smell, easy to use and portion. I love them. Four stars only because once in awhile they don't dissolve, but I haven't had that problem often.",
