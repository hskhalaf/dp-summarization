These will function great for many-many different types of construction work. But when it comes to Roofing, FORGET IT, these fail Big Time because they have a Slick / Hard Outer Surface which contacts the Roofing Materials; effectively \"Slipping\" when you need Grip & Traction on critical Slope Positions. So either locate the Lesser Model (somewhere), or Modify a pair of these by Cementing/Stitching some Inner-Tube or Neoprene to the Outer Shell. Then these will work for Roofing. Otherwise they're all but worthless, and pose a considerable danger to the Wearer.",

Instead of a lightweight gel pad gradually sliding down my leg, these 2.6 lb. battleships sank to my ankles like stones. They are well-constructed and comfortable while kneeling on them, but not practical for real-world use.",

The placement of the straps keep them from bunching in the back of your knee and the brace portion keeps you from sliding off to one side of the knee pad. This also works as a fairly good knee brace. If you have minor knee stability issues this will work for that as well. If you have major knee stability issues get a proper brace and wear these over them (they are roomy enough to handle something else. Speaking of which these pads are very large, i have gigantic legs and still have some room to spare with strap length.",
