I have knocked over these glasses twice and dropped one in the sink... cringing while expecting to see it break. But it didn't. I once owned a set of 60 dollar a piece of Zalto De'Art wine glasses. Broke every one and I said no more! So I bought a set of Riedel wine glasses for around 140 dollars. I broke everyone. I bought this set and I think they are as nice as the Riedel's and possibly stronger... Very impressed. Great Buy.",

I reordered and they arrived yesterday in perfect condition. We are so pleased- these are perfect for us.
