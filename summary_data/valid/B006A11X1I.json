Wish I could give a better review, but unfortunately this makes them unwearable (and I really do not think that is something you could break in or change by wearing them).

Now I wasn\u2019t doing any crazy hiking, at most maybe ten miles total for a day and they held up really well. For the price, I\u2019d definitely recommend these and I would absolutely purchase them again.",

I bought them for a backpacking trip 6 months ago and have worn them regularly through winter since then because they're waterproof. They were super comfortable backpacking 10 miles a day for a week, with minimal blisters by the end (for anyone who backpacks, that's pretty great). As for winter wear, they keep the snow out in Michigan, but aren't insulated, so require thicker wool socks on colder days. I prefer them to regular winter boots though because they're much more enjoyable to walk around in all day and my feet don't get too hot inside.",
