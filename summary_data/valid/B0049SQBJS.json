The ad and the package state they are dishwasher and microwave safe. After one mug came out of the dishwasher, in which it was carefully place so as to not hit anything, it had water inside the double wall. Kind of like the old trick milk glass. Amazon replaced it with no problem. A second mug disintegrated in my wife's hand when she poured out the water she had heated in it in the microwave. Be careful.",

The handle snapped and the glass shattered in the sink causing quite the mess. They seem to be more fragile than a wine glass. I cut myself this morning with a piece that must have missed the sink. Thus the review.....Updated based on my cal lot the manufacture's rep. They replaced the Mug, and were very kind. Still very fragile, so take care. I would compare them to a fine wine glass.",
