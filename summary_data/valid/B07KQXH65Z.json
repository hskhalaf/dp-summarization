Lovely sound and come in quite a fancy bit of packaging compared to say Turtle etc. 10/10 Would buy a again.",

This is even when volume is substantially low, and mic sensitivity is on 1 out of 10 on Xbox. Only way ot doesnt echo, is with no game volume on at all, and master volume on like 25%. Please be mindful, I have ALREADY warrantied the original pair from Amazon from hyper x. Even with the new pair, it still does it. Tired of this headset, frustrated, more than likely will not buy another hyper x product.",

(Even better than detachable one IMO) Cons: - Physically plugged in has slightly better sound quality. - 100$ more for Bluetooth capabilities and built in Mic compared to the Cloud 2. Summary: I would highly recommend the Mix if you are willing to spend the extra cash. However, it's hard to justify the price point for some.",

This isn\u2019t my first set of HyperX\u2019s, so I knew what to expect with the build quality. These things are definitely built to last. The earpads are some kind of pleather, so they WILL wear eventually, like most others. The drivers sound phenomenal though, and they give you a 3.5mm cable and a mic attachment, if you want to hardwire. I definitely recommend these over some of the more expensive brands, especially if you\u2019re planning on using them day in and day out like I do",

      "text": "I really wish I could recommend Cloud headsets, as I have used them for years and have always enjoyed the audio quality and feel. However, I've had to replace them every 1-2 years because the quality of the cords is pathetic. I've had this headset for less than a year and already, only 1 out of the 2 ears is outputting audio. This is typical for these headsets. Poor build quality is undermining otherwise quality headsets.",
