Hardware is anchored to stud in ceiling to make them safe and holds up to 250lbs. Worth the trouble when you see what a hit these make for the recipients, any gender, any age, indoors or out.",

The swing was delivered quickly and we have since had no issues with the Macrame\u0301 shedding or falling apart. To sit in it, the back hoop can be uncomfortable and there is no lower back support, but with a few throw pillows, that issue is solved. (I am 5' 6\" and when I sit in it the back hoop is at the base of my head.) It adds a bit of whimsy which we love. Dimensions: seat diameter = 25\" from base of seat to where the back hoops sits at it's highest = 21\"",

I ordered extension ropes to suspend them by and after a few uses had to remove them because the chairs were hanging too low. Given the braided threaded material, this stretch should be expected but was poorly thought out on my end when ordering. Great chairs for the price, my daughters love them.",
