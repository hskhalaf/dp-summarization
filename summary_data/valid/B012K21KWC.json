Since she is growing, I bought her a 1/2 size up and they worked out well. She complained that her feet hurt, but I think that she isn't used to wearing shoes made this way (Jazz shoes only have support at the toe and heel in order to bend in the middle of the foot). So far they have been holding up well and I'd buy this brand again.",
