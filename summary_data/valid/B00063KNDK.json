I called it \"Kitten crack\" as a joke - don't want to be offensive or make light of drug use - but they were all into this stuff, really.",

I would not recommend continued use of this product if your kittens have the same issue as they can get dehydrated. Adding to my review....I tried it mixed with water and they had no diareah. Tried again with KMR mixed in and within minutes diareah.",

Second step eliminates the worry and promotes successful weaning to either kibble or soft food.",
