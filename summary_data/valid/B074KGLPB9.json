In eight days of walking, I slipped six times and fell three times despite taking extra care - and this while carrying my heavy and expensive camera gear. I'm lucky that I didn't get seriously injured though there was quite a bjt of blood on one occassion. There seems to be a manufacturing inconsistency which Salomon refuse to accept and I'm now having to use the Sale of Goods Act to get my money back.",

The weather has been very wet so I have trudged through the usual mud water and sopping wet grass and bone dry feet. All holding together and the locking laces keep the footbed well grounded.
