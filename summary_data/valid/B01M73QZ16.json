Advice: simply take new dough discs off the stack and set them exposed when you make each round. Flip them to put the dry side down when you build them. This way they slide off easy.",

      "text": "Just used my Pizzarette for the first time last night and LOVE it!! The unit itself is really well-made, with a great design. My friends and I had so much fun using the Pizzarette because we could all sit around my table, enjoy our wine, make our own pizza, and no one was stuck cooking in the kitchen! Since everyone can choose their own ingredients, even my picky-eater friends enjoyed it. One tip- (as with all pizza dough) it's always good to let the dough sit for a few minutes, or spray the unit with some light cooking spray to prevent sticking. Excited to use it again!",

So bought this one for my daughter birthday present. On the old one you can push the pizza in farther so we cooked all around on the one I just bought a pizza can\u2019t go in all the way so you have to rotate it around that was the big difference I found but we still love it but take those black spatulas away and give the metal ones like you used to thank you",
