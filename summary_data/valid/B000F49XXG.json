After 3 months, It developed a water leak at the bottom of the unit that would flood the counter top when the water container was inserted. I suspect that the pressure water hose at the bottom of the unit has developed a split or hole but am unable to remove the bottom plate to check it out as I don't have the specialized tool to remove it. I checked DeLonghi's website and they don't list this leaking condition in their FAQ section. Sent a summary of this problem to DeLonghi and I am awaiting a response. James",

All of that is nice, but this machine works fine without overly complicating things. Follow the instructions...or watch a youtube video if you don't like reading.

Also, I'm not wild about how it vibrates when dispensing the espresso. It is sort of comical to see the cup vibrating and dancing around under the dispenser. I wonder though: does the vibration indicate that something is wrong with the pump mechanism? Still, the coffee comes out nicely and I feel good about that.

I like to blow the line out into a towel after frothing, but this thing snaps back into the brewing area. If you drink straight espresso, you'll like this machine.

      "text": "my current delonghi is my second one. I know some people say this breaks after 18 mos - 2 years, but my first one in the same model lasted with daily use for about 9 years. I purchased this one after that one went, and after i had a bout with trying out a nespresso machine. I am just not into the pod model. I love this machine and if you do the math, even if the machine does wear out after about 2 years, this thing still pays for itself easily. Also - I got my mom one and we did the amazon 4 year protection plan they offer. Why not do that?",

No idea what caused the espresso machine to fail (the pump still makes noise), but I honestly think this machine is designed with parts that fail after 1 year.",

      "text": "I bought this highly rated budget expresso machine after a trip to Italy last year. I am very much satisfied with the quality of the espresso. However, it is more accurate to call it an expresso and lotte maker instead of an expresso and cappuccino maker. The frother does not make enough form for cappuccino, especially micro form. Warning: don't listen to the online articles and videos about making modifications to the machine to improve either the quality of expresso or the form. They don't work or not worth the effort. Just keep the machine clean and tidy and enjoy your espresso and lotte. They are not perfect, but good enough.",

Also, a pain to clean. The filter basket is too persnickity, and a drag to clean. Thereis too little height below the filter to allow for anything but shot glasses, so if you prefer to make your espresso directly into your cup, you're out of luck. It is a good looking and compact unit, probably just dandy if you only plan to use it once in a while, but not a good pick for daily use.",

If you're trying to save money by skipping the coffee shop and making espresso at home (like me), keep in mind that this will basically cost you $70 a year just to have an EC155 that works.

Still I guess it is OK, because it made about 300-400 espressos (for about an year). Doing the math ... 80$(for the machine) + 100$ (12 months coffee) = 180$.

Only issue is that it does not have enough clearance for a coffee cup but you can brew your espresso in an espresso cup and transfer to a bigger coffee cup after.
