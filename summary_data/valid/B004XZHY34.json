Too many strong stations. Maybe it would work if you only have a few in your area, but it\u2019s non functional for me. But the sound quality for voice and everything else is fantastic. I especially like how it turns itself off and on when you leave the car and return. Super easy! If you are buying it for the FM feature I\u2019d be ready to return it. But if that\u2019s not necessary please get this one. You\u2019ll be happy!",

The Bluetooth signal to other callers especially while driving was spoty. Sometimes the person on the other end could not hear me at all. We compared it to a 4 yr old Jabra Tour we had and people we called said the sound quality and signal were better on the Tour. Dissapointing but not too surprised given the many negative reviews I saw online...inaddition to many positive. I returned the unit after on half a day and order another Jabra Tour",

The usual complaint is that they can only hear every 2nd or 3rd word I am saying It's beyond frustrating. I tried using it with my wife's cellphone and the results were the same. And the sound problem is not consistent. Sometimes, I am told that I can be heard very clearly but oftentimes, I've been told that I sound garbled.",

No way that I can find to disable that feature. I did manage to turn off the annoying \"connected\"",

I had gotten spoiled by the hands free functionality and I never liked any of my Bluetooth ear pieces. I happy with the Freeway. It actually does more than our newer car's integrated system. An apple person. This jabra device enables me to use SIRI in every way I'm accustomed to. Decent sound quality... With any speakerphone there can be issues... ESPECIALLY when talking to another speakerphone. Still, I like it.",

I've only been in the car with him once while it was in use but the volume was good (even for him, with bad hearing) and the conversation clear. Easy use. I just might need one for my car as well!",

Has excellent background noise canceling. The price is very fair for what it does, it works. I see so many people endangering themselves and others by hanging a cell phone to one ear, this is clearly the answer. Seems to me if they can afford a new car they surely get this very affordable speaker phone and protect themselves and others.",
