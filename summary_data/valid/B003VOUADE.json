Much happier after the modifications. Doesn't fit my Leupold Yosemite 8x30 binoculars, I've tried vertical and horizontal orientation. Nice pouch other than that but I can do without the gigantic Velcro closure for my purpose. For the price I'll probably remove the Velcro and get a small pair of binos that fit in it.",

I feel like my binoculars finally have a decent case. I love the fact that they have straps in the back that slip right on to the belt of a fanny pack I use when I go bird watching, so they make the whole thing essentially hands-free and I can use the binoculars with ease. The case is heavy-duty and seems very well made. Frankly, I feel like it is the kind of case my binoculars SHOULD have come in to begin with. It is the best protection I've found for them.",
