Totally disappointed very wrinkle, not white color and doesn\u2019t feel as soft as the other one.

Cons: holds onto wrinkles even through the wash, attracts fuzzies, easy to see dirt, had to buy the duvet separate from the sheet/pillowcases because the queen set was different from my duvet size. overall I love this set. It's a nice color, goes with my current room set up and my future wall color.",
