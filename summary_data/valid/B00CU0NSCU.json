My Battery lasts for days not hours and it doesn't glitch out. It is a little long in the tooth in tech years. So it is slow to download a book. But I can close it and it doesn't kill my book losing my spot or being unable to pull it back up. My 2019 Kindle 7 inch glitches out looses places in my book its battery wont last a full day with out charge. I hate the layout of the new kindles and how they mimic a run of the mill tablet.",

Love the screen as I have big problems with blue light, even with light-blocking screens, glasses etc. I\u2019ve tried the lot - I still have major problems. Of course, I have NONE of these problems with the Kindle & can read all day & all night if I choose to. Love it! Highly recommend & will definitely keep on buying as long as they have their special paper-like screen. A+++",

The High Definition display is also of superior quality because I have not detected any pixelated graphics for 4K videos. The WiFi connectivity favors speed and does not attenuate even when the user is located approximately 150 meters from the router and the wireless setup was a simple process.

The built-in web browser means that it will do most things any Android tablet will do, while sill having the superior reading experience of a genuine Kindle. I bought the somewhat-quirky \"Origami\" case for it. See my separate review, but I recommend some kind of case to protect the screen when not in use. As always, the \"Special Offers\" never intrude when you're doing something with the Kindle, and some of them do offer intriguing items tailored to your habits. Recommended.",

No and no, and no. Lame. Anyway, that's basically why this gets 2 stars; it would be a great tablet for the price but it's hamstrings are cut. Amazon's insistence on control takes away whatever cool factor this thing has; I just use it to read books on the plane.",

The 40 second reboot does not work, so they say it is unfixable. They will do nothing about it. They offered me a 'discount' on refurbished kindles, one being the exact same kindle, and they all cost MORE than my original brand new one. I am very upset, considering I don't have the money to buy a new tablet EVERY year. I will definitely be looking into other options, as a Kindle is a pretty bad investment.",

      "text": "My husband has a KF HD and I have a Paperwhite. We wanted to get a KF HD for my 10 year old daughter for books and games. She loves it! The price of this device is a steal compared to all other tablets, both Apple and Android. I couldn't be more thrilled with this purchase. She quickly loaded it up with about forty FREE apps and has already read two complete books since school ended. That's two more books than she read all last summer! I bought the FreeTime kid-proof case, which I wouldn't have dreamed of NOT getting for a kid. I'm probably going to get one for her six year old sister for christmas!",

It has worked flawlessly for me since I bought it. Made my life a little easier if I want to take a break from reading and surf, hit facebook, or shop. For the price point of a woeful android tablet, this thing is spectacular. It's not a real full function tablet, and it's tethered to Amazon, but so what? I find myself buying through amazon more and more. So for what I needed, it's the best thing going.",

For someone like me, who has never had a tablet before, it was a nightmare to try and get everything how it was supposed to be for connection. In addition, which this was not Amazon's fault, 7\" was just too small for me to do the things I wanted to do with it. After less than a week, I returned it and Amazon gave me a full refund. I would have liked to buy the bigger version, but it was out of my price range.",

Pros: The 2013 comes with a 5W charger (2012 didn't come with a wall charger - and USB charging sucks). Power and volume buttons larger and more clearly labeled. Cons: The 2013 model does not have a mini-HDMI port! 2012 did, and cost whopping $2 for a cable that hooked the Kindle to the TV. 2013 model requires a certain TV, OR a $60 conversion box.... Major feature loss for 2013 Model IMO. Other than that, they are about the same.",

One of the things I've always liked about my previous Kindles is the INK; one of the thinks I disliked was the lack of color (making it less than desirable for periodicals). The Fire display sacrifices the totally awesome beach-read capability of the black-and-white Kindle for a vivid color display (which washes out quite a bit in direct sunlight) plus the capabilities of a good, Wi-Fi-only, Android (sorta) tablet. Not a bad compromise, especially considering the also-totally-awesome Kindle book store. I'm still getting familiar with Android, but the Fire definitely lives up to my expectiations; maybe more.",

I ordered a new Kindle Fire HD display with 16GB memory. I discovered that it was a game I had downloaded that used up my battery so fast as the new Kindle Fire's battery lost power just as fast. Frankly, I like my old Kindle Fire more than the new one. I prefer the original display of apps and the shape is easier to hold. I do like the volume control on the outside of the new one.

Down side... only 8 Gb, I forgot to warn my wife when she did the purchase to make sure was higher that 8Gb... So far hasn't have any Storage problem.",

      "text": "I enjoy this Kindle a little more than my previous one. The power button is in a better place, and there are external volume control buttons that weren't on my older Kindle Fire. I don't notice all that much difference in the HD screen because I mainly use it for reading and FaceBook. I like the placement of the external speakers better than the older one. They sound better too. This model was cheaper than my previous Kindle Fire because it contains adds on the home screen. I didn't realize that the advertisements were responsible for the discount at first, but for $50 off, I can deal with the advertisements. I'm very satisfied with this product.",

No camera A bit heavy compared to my Samsung 2 10.1 Not expandable so buy the gigs that you need. affordable and a great deal at 140 for this. actually bought this for my daughter for Christmas so she could use it as a reader and stream movies - and actually use my Prime services that I don't use very often. i.e. streaming, books, screen to smart TV. I will update later, if and when I get to play with the device.",
