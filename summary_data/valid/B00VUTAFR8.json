The one down side (to me) which is very subjective, is you have to hold down the power button for what feels like way too long for it to turn off. Often as I leave my office for meetings and what not I don't have the time to sit there and hold it down. Why can't it just be a single tap like the rest of the functions?",

The light itself is fine, but everytime it turns on, it defaults to half power (even though the readout goes to full power, then back to half). You have to then click the full power button t restore the full brightness setting. And in order to turn it off, you have to hit the power button, then wait till it decreases to the lowest setting, then hold the power button for a couple seconds. After having this for a few weeks now, it's become very frustrating each time I turn it on or off. A simple on/off toggle (like my Anker LED light) would have been much better.",

The reason for the low score however is because after returning home from a Thanksgiving trip, with the light off the entire time, noticed that the indicator light was dead (shows red when off.) Attempted to turn on but was dead. Moved the plug to another outlet and not on an extension/surge protector and still dark so ended up in the trash. So, while the light seemed to fit what I needed, cannot endorse a light that I have to replace less than 6 months later of infrequent use.",

The purchase was made February 2019, and just last week (August 2019) my husband\u2019s light completely died. I thought maybe his had a defect, so we threw it out and just continued to use mine. Well today, still in August, my second lamp had died. I am sad and frustrated. I really liked these lights, but for both of them to die within 6 months of purchase?? That made us so sad! Update*** The seller has amazing customer care skills and has reached out to me. My replacements are on their way!",

I purchased 3 others first and sent them all back, so I was not hopeful about this one. The color options are great to adjust with the changing sun throughout the day (or my mood!) It's easy adjustable, the swivel at the top makes it plenty tall enough to shine over my whole desk and oversize monitor. Sleek and doesn't take up much space. Love that it's LED. Very happy with this purchase!",

It's worth noting that the light head pivots 180 degrees. It would be great if you could freely rotate it all the way around. Also you can't angle the head directly vertically but it hasn't been a problem for me.",

Today that money will buy you 50 different light settings, a USB charger, touch controls, and a soft-diffused light panel! Amazing! Four stars because while I understand that the joints that hold it aloft vertically need to be stiff, the rotational joint is also very stiff. I can't rotate it without turning the entire lamp unless I hold the base still with one hand, and turn the joint with the other. Otherwise, I'm quite happy!",

In fact the main support arm cannot stand straight up but has to lean a little forward to support the light.

      "text": "I originally bought this lamp in white for use on my crafting/sewing table, but after getting it, I want another one for my computer desk. This lamp is just awesome. The brightness/color settings are excellent and will come in handy when I am working on various projects. One of my favorite features is how you can bend and tilt the arm at various angles to direct the light exactly where you need it to be. I love the design of it as well; it fits my modern decor perfectly. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase.",

I plan to use this for doing artwork as the light can be changed to white or daylight modes (in addition to other modes). This would be perfect for a student too. I bought the white woodgrain and it's very nice. Hard to tell from the pictures how nice it really is.",

Another upscale feature is that when you push the end of the touch-slide to turn it off, it slowly and quietly turns it off.
