Using this gripper to move the sheets from my trailer into the shop to my storage rack was great. Would definitely recommend based upon my experience, which is all on flat ground. As for some other reviews/questions I've seen on here about it, I can't speak. I'm not climbing up ladders or going up/down stairs with it.",

Of course you still need the strength to lift sheets, but the Gorilla Gripper makes it less awkward. Really noticeable when wind is blowing and moving up ladder.

Probably not a problem for the occasional user, but if you swing a hammer and push a plane all day your elbow is probably already worn out and needs no futher abuse from a labor saving device.

It worked great for single sheets of 5/8\" rock, and for double sheets of 1/2\" ultralight rock. Since the sheets are taped together face to face, just needed to insert a cardboard shim between the tapered edges before gripping the panels, to avoid crushing the edges.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Gorilla Gripper is a unique construction tool that allows one person to lift and carry heavy sheet goods (such as plywood, drywall, particleboard, melamine, tempered glass and granite) from the top, with much less strain and greatly reduced risk of injury to the back, neck, shoulders, arms & hands! The gripper works by clamping onto the top of the material, creating a sturdy temporary handle for the person who is carrying them. It allows the user to lift and move them with a straight back, eliminating the requirement of bending over to get under the bottom, thus avoiding the torqued back and the aches and pains that are far too familiar to construction workers and do-it-yourselfers. It's made of aircraft-grade aluminum, very rugged and virtually indestructible. It is continuously self-adjusting from 3/8-inch to 1-1/8-inch. Rubber gripping pads mounted on both plates protect the surfaces of the materials from being damaged or marred. There's just nothing like the Gorilla Gripper...it works!",
