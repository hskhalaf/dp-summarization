Camera was subsequently returned by the postal service. Now I can't find where to send camera for repair, although while researching possibilities I was told this was an older model. I would not purchase this camera again nor can I recommend it as it has such an odd battery set-up. Four heavy AA batteries that take >24 hrs to recharge. I fear this is going to turn out to be a wasted purchase as the 4 months exceeds Amazon's return policy for what has turned out to be an obviously defective product.",

According to the instructions the batteries take 22+ hours to charge so I purchased a rapid charger that will charge them in 2 hours. Kodak was not helpful regarding the battery situation.",

Other complain about the battery compartment latch--valid, but not a deal killer. Does well with video, only complaint is the auto focus motor constantly refocuses the lens and sounds like someone typing in the background. But for quick home movies it's fine. I find disposable batteries hold up great and get me a day's work of snaps & video; rechageables not so much, dunno why.

I am glad to have purchased it when I did, because shortly thereafter, Kodak went out of the camera business. Got an excellent price on it at Amazon.

Only problem is that when I put them in the camera the camera reports the batteries are only one quarter charged. So now I think there must be something wrong with the camera.

Absolutely love the optical power of the camera and the zoomable view finder. My only suggestion for improvement is to make the mode dial a \"push and turn\" device. Often when turning the camera on, I find that I am in the video mode and not the still picture mode. A nuisance, but not a discriminating item.",

I received it and decided it was a little more complicated than I wanted at this stage of my life (baby boomer). I have loved my Kodak digital cameras in the past so I decided to try this one. I like the fact that I get a great zoom without attaching extra lenses that you have to carry around. A point a shoot camera is more my speed and this one has a very good shutter speed and captures my subjects before they can move (grandchildren). If you are looking for a larger point and shoot, this is a great buy.",

The battery life is good. The only other problem I can see is you can't take multiple pics right after one another. Its like its processing for about 15 sec between shots...so far it hasn't really mattered but I can see this being an issue for some. Over all for the price its a great buy.",

The colours are not exact, it has a tinge of yellow but for a price so low it can be negated. The best part is that it has a manual setting for shutter speed upto 15 seconds. The video is pretty good with full 26X zoom in high definition video shooting mode. Overall a decent buy at low bucks.",
