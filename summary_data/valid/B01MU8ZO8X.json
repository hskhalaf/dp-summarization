      "text": "I love Dolce Vita shoes and this beautiful sandal is no exception. It's super cute and the added cushion makes it very comfortable without any insole. Lace up makes it a perfect fit for my somewhat narrow feet. Quality is awesome too. It matches with jeans, skirts, shorts, dress up or down, just perfect. The length of laces are also great to tie in front or in back for different styling. I will be wearing this one all through summer season! Very happy!",

Did anyone else find the sandal uncomfortably narrow and the laces not as pictured? Really wish they worked out.",
