Since I found out the 72\" was not quite long enough to go around my back door that swings outward, instead of returning the Supergate that I bought at a discounted open box item, I did some research and took a chance with the 2 panel extension (discounted open box) for the 'Superyard 3 in 1 Metal'. I used a phillips screw driver to take out the plastic end pieces of one of the panel from the extension and switched them around to make it connect between the gate panel and the 18\" short panel...voila! Works perfectly!",

Only other thing was that Amazon recommend by \"Frequently bought together\" some \"wall saver for baby gates\" which totally to not work with this product. A minor ~11 dollar loss, but not sure why Amazon recommends purchases for incompatible products.

The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the gate doesnt screw into the floor and there for it moves a little at the turning sections if you push it, but not that much.

Normally I'd just replace the screw, and not give it another thought. But the broken screw got me looking closely at the whole thing. At first it appears to be well made. But the double latching mechanism is weak, doesn't operate smoothly, and just seems like a failure waiting to happen. Couple that with its price point, and the cheap (soft) metal hardware. We just couldn't justify keeping it.",

      "text": "The gate does not actually fit the range of openings it advertises. Instead it must be anchored to a wall (you cannot have any floor trim to anchor correctly) and the angled at the two hinge points. So if you are expecting to have this at the top of a set of stairs, prepare to have the gate 2 feet into the room as it won't actually fit a smaller opening than it's max size.",

      "text": "Excellent gate. I have a 2 year old who is always on the go. I originally had a gate on the steps that didn\u2019t have a door and the older (and heavier) he got it became more challenging to climb over. After researching for a long time we found this gate. Our steps as you can see are wide and there aren\u2019t any good options for banister to banister. I ended up purchasing a universal banister to banister gate attatchment. That didn\u2019t work properly but it came with these thick zip ties that ended up working perfectly. What I love is this gates door shuts and locks automatically most times. It\u2019s well made, sturdy, and looks good.",

It may just be me that can\u2019t open this type of latch easily.",

The walls we needed to connect the gate didnt line up, and were about 3 feet apart. This gate fits perfectly, and now our love bugs can be together in a comfortable area when we are out.

I drilled holes slightly smaller than the screw diameter and they went in just fine and did not strip. The gate is sturdy, opens easily and locks automatically when it is closed.
