Lights of fire engine weren't pained (just left silver), Chace's car is green and blue (when it is shown as white and blue), and Sky is a head only, not turned sideways as in picture, and there is not moving flap on her helicopter when picture details movement. Would rather have spent more over time for better toys (I've seen removable ones that are sold separately) and would have if this toy had not been so badly misrepresented. It looks like they took pictures of the more expensive (better crafted) toys and used them on box.",

It had large dirty sticky patches on both sides of the box where lables have been removed and some other wear on the box that was not caused by shipping. Edited to add, the inside is even worse. The figures look like cheap knockoffs of the ones on the box. Hardly any detail in the paint, and the front wheel on Skye's vehicle doesn't even function, it's cast as a solid piece. The propeller doesn't spin when you push it as is implied.",

As for quality, definitely not worth that price. More appropriate for a 10$ item (so if its this price listed, its fine). The pups do not come out of the car (which I knew before from reading product reviews). Sky's helicopter is hard to roll on the floor because the front wheel is plastic and does not spin. Not worth the 24$, but okay for 11$. Kids like them, which is why it gets 3/5 stars.",

I like that the characters are inside the vehicles (not able to be taken out) because then I won't have to keep track of where they go, which vehicle they are supposed to go in, etc. I love that it is the vehicles that go inside the Paw Patroller which I'm sure will be the next gift she asks for for her birthday!",
