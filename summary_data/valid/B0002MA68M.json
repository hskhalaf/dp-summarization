Cool winter temps made the \"heavy rubber\" brittle and they detached during normal city/highway driving. The mats cracked and broke off at the top - adjacent to the bolt attachments. Bolts were snug but not over tightened when installed. I am disappointed and would NOT recommend this product to a friend.",
