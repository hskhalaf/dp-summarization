      "verdict": "The vintage Asics Gel collection continues to have a loyal following among sneakerheads and admirers of classic lace-up kicks. The low-top Asics Gel Circuit may have already retired from the court, but it still grants plush comfort with the presence of the proprietary Gel-cushioning component in the midsole, a smooth interior, and a moderately padded sockliner.Its hard-wearing cover, made mostly in leather, and a thick slab of rubber on the sole are some of the indications that this Asics Gel sneaker is ready to take on some abuses.",
      "pros": [
        "According to most statements, the Asics Gel Circuit comes with durable leather upper",
        "Satisfied users reiterated that this Asics sneaker has a comfortable Gel cushioning on the heel",

        "Most of those who rated this shoe gave it an A+ score for its overall appeal",
        "The ankle offers luxurious comfort, as mentioned in some statements",
        "Some reviews described that this shoe has a smooth fabric lining that hugs the feet comfortably",

Not good for my purposes (walking the dog in summer) much less participating in an active sport or going to the gym. The material, \"ASICS motion dry fabric,\" is as thick as a typical winter under layer rather than a shirt for hot weather activities. Good for someone who: 1. Has smaller arms 2. Orders 1 (fitted) or 2 (loose) sizes up 3. Uses the shirt as a cool-weather baselayer (for example: a baselayer for winter sports, cool evening activities in the summer, or for those sensitive to cooler temps).",

      "text": "This is not exclusive to just Asics but to just about every sportswear manufacturer on the planet. A trend started a while back to make everything contour fitting and tight. In general exercise gear has become flat out uncomfortable and this top is no different. I have an athletic build and found myself squeezing into this top and it is a large. Typically an XL is the same fit only slightly longer. The quality appeared fine and that's why I gave it a 3 star rating. The fit would definitely be a 1 star. Last time I buy clothing on-line.",
