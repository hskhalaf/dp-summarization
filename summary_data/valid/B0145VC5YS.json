It feels a little cheap, especially the pushbutton and the plastic part that screws onto the pipe, but we're a month in without issue. I initially installed using plumber's putty, but it leaked. Reinstalling with teflon tape fixed the leak. The magnet seemed gimmicky to me when I was thinking about ordering, but it's actually a really neat, convenient feature--sure beats fitting it into a cradle every time. Others have commented on the pressure regulator being over the top, but I left it installed and the pressure is fine.",

I also think, because it's bigger, it affects the water pressure, as that's not very good either (Yes, I did remove the restrictor, which was pretty easy to do with the right tools). I also didn't love the plastic attachment to the main pipe. So many things I didn't like/love about this, and it's not cheap!

There are a couple of patterns that I'm not crazy about and wish there was a way to permanently exclude, but that would add a lot of money to what is a great showerhead.

No leaks, no need for Teflon tape and no tools needed for installation. In fact, using wrench\u2019s to install this may compress the gaskets making them lose their sealing function. I added an in-line shut off valve to save water while lathering up and what not. If the government wanted to regulate water usage they should have made it mandatory for manufacturers to include a shut-off on all fixtures, this coupled with a public service announcement campaign on how to use a shut off while showering... problem solved.

I don't plan on using it to catch me when I fall, so I should be fine. It was very easy to install. (Thanks to those who mentioned not to used thread tape.) I have used it for a couple months now and it works as you would expect. I removed the flow restrictor to maximize pressure, which is good. My only complaint is I can't get it to completely shut-off. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",

They dropped it. Absolutely the best!! We are buying more. So easy and works great!!!",
