My two cons are: The gaps one lower left and right side to pass the cables through are narrower than expected, requiring me to force certain cables through them. The lid never quite feels firmly seated. If you need to accommodate a lot of thick cabling, there is a chance it will flex above the lid line, and the lid does not 'click' into place to hold it down inside the box. You need to arrange the cables so none of them are pressing against the lid. Pro: The box is big enough to hold six connections (in my case) including two that have beefy converters.",

I imagine the plastic could crack easily if one doesn't take care. This is the reason I'm giving 4 stars. An easy top removal would deserve 5",
