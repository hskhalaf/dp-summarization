With Motorola the ease of use was awesome. I got the camera for when I went on vacation and it did not disappoint. Not a single failure occured for me on this 7000+ Mile road trip. From 100\u00b0+ to low 30\u00b0s it operated with out fail. A few thousand stunning pictures later and I am still just tickled with the purchase and would and do recommend it to everyone I know.",

But back to back photos of a red miniature Pom proved its worth it. The Z3 play took a good looking snapshot, but as soon as you try to enlarge the pic its a pixilated fuzzy mess. Same shot just seconds later with the Hasselblad and I can mag in as far as I want, every individual hair is distinct and sharp. That is an image quality I can use.",

The only thing I don't like is that there is no safety strap to carry out of the case & since the phone has to be out of the protection case, it's a little scary for me as a droping hazard. There is a slight mini handle on the side for good gripping. It also came with a mini carrying case. Great product!",

But to be honest these phones have one of the best rear cameras in tech world. So you can basically become an advanced photographer with just a simple mod.",

It's not mainstream, but there is a market. It may never be your largest market, but it could be the most dedicated one. Less waste. More functionally with backwards compatibility.

I've never put much value in cell phone cameras, although they do a fantastic job if your only going to view images on a phone or a computer screen. But for printing 8X10 or 18X20 images you need more pixels than a cell phone provide provides. The Hasselblad Mod broke the mold and I hope we see more like it. See my review for the proof.",

The only reason I dinged a star (I would have preferred a half-star) is because even with the shutter on the slowest setting low-light flashless pictures have less definition than the on-phone camera. All other conditions are vastly superior, especially the optical zoom.",
