Can't be adjusted vertically, or horizontally. The depth adjustment is a bit shallow so make sure that you install it with the correct depth upfront.

It's not a bad keyboard drawer and is pretty sturdy.",

I like the fact that this drawer/shelf has an adjustable height to accomodate different height keyboards or different user preferences. It's plenty long, almost 2\" longer than my standard Dell keyboard. I used some Velcro tape on the bottom of the keyboard to keep it from sliding side-to-side. I attached my Logitech Trackball to the mouse shelf that same way. I had been hoping that the drawer would fit my Microsoft ergonomic keyboard, but that was a no-go. Before buying, make sure your keyboard will fit into the 20\"W X 7-5/8\"D keyboard well.",
