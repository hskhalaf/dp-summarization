As others have commented - it doesn't stick to itself or the tree - you have to use string or the like to secure the \"wrap\"....otherwise, it simply unwinds and flops to the ground. Also - it's not very flexible - so it doesn't conform to the tree like I thought it would.",

It's a little early to determine if it will last through the winter weather.",
