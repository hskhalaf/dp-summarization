The color is a dark brown compared with the leather duke (top) and composite duke (left). So it's not perfect there. The composite material feels slightly worse than the composite duke. If you were only buying one ball id get one of the Dukes, but if you're buying 3+ balls that are just gonna get torn up from practice get this one.",

These two pros is why I added 1 extra star. Now for the upsetting part of the ball that I received, the outer lining wasn't stitched right and it stuck out of the lacing. What's more upsetting is that this flaw got passed the quality control at Wilson which makes me not trust in their quality and workmanship. I guess I'll keep the ball and take it as it is. It's not like I'm going to play with it professionally. Buyers please beware of the quality.",

      "text": "Surprising quality for the price, used it a lot and there is very little noticeable wear on the ball. Took a bit to throw a tight spiral with this ball, seems to be a little cheaply sewn at the tips of the ball, but after a bit of practice I was back to throwing tight spirals. Ball surface is nice and tacky, easy to catch even without gloves. I would definitely recommend the purchase of this ball, Left one star off for the build quality on the seams. I fear it might not last as long as a better ball but it is holding up perfectly fine for now.",

      "text": "When you first get it, it won\u2019t fly like a normal football. Not something you can take right out of the package and play a game with. BUT, give it time. Break it in. Let it get beat up on the ground some. Cause after that it is an exceptional football for its price. I\u2019ve bought three now and broke them in. Great buy for those who want a high quality football for its price.",
