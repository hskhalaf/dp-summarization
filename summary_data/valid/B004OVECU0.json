It works and controls everything perfectly, but you constantly have to switch back and forth through button sequences to accomplish the simplest of tasks, which can get annoying. Personally, I really prefer the simplicity of the Harmony 350 and would definitely have bought another were the buttons on the 350 not so cheaply made and quick to wear out and the fact the buttons aren't backlit. Still, I think I'd rather deal with replacing a 350 every time the warranty expires than put up with the annoyingly overly complex 650. If you love to push buttons and scroll through menus to accomplish the simplest of tasks, then the 650 is the remote for you.",

I would have not purchased the remote had I known it cannot control Bose speakers. So now I am still left with multiple remote controllers. Disappointing!",

There's an initial menu that familiarizes you with the buttons on the remote and it keeps going back to this procedure even though I've already gone through it. I've tried resetting the remote and replacing the batteries with new ones, but the menu keeps coming up. These remotes are great when they work because they can be programmed to turn on several devices as a group at the same time, but because of this glitch that keeps occurring, I would not buy this remote again.

      "text": "This remote works ok when it wants to; however, it will often reset itself back into its tutorial mode for no apparent reason, sometimes multiple times a day, and make you click through about ten different prompts before it's usable. Searching online I found that this is not fixable. It really isn't worth the trouble and frustration.",

      "text": "I was hoping this would solve all of our families problems with having three remotes, but i would say it actually just created a new more complicated issue. The volume button never \"always\" controls my amplifier, i have to actually select amplifier then change the volume. Ok well you can sit here for hours trying to program it and maybe it will mostly do what you want to do. I cant get it to make Roku navigation simple at all, when the actual remote has only a few buttons. My wife who is technology challenged cant even figure how to to play a show in Netflix, which should be extremely simple and it is much simpler with all three remotes.",

      "text": "I had this remote for 8 years. It NEVER worked properly. Literally, everyday, I would need to reprogram in through it's \"help\" system. I thought it would eventually learn, but it never did. I reprogramed it via the software, but that didn't help either. Why did I keep it so long? Because I paid $60 for it and couldn't return it. I just accepted it's flaws. My wife always hated it though. I just replace it though, with a $7 remote that doesn't have all the BS on it like the Logitech remote. I'd rather have to use two remotes that work, than one that doesn't.",

      "text": "Meh. Not as good as other models (discontinued), falls off things all the time due to odd shape. Then, the batteries bounce, loose contact and it restarts. It's a computer. A slow one and it takes a good while to restart. The weakest IR transmitter of any remote I have had. Never turns on some devices the first time. Ever. Updated: even worse. It power cycles just sitting there. So then you have to restart it (covering the IR transmitter) to do something simple like pause the show so you can get up. Liked their previous models, this is terrible, and not this instance. We've had several replacements under warranty and they are all junk.",

I have a Blu-Ray player, an amplifier with surround speakers and a cable box. All work in harmony (see what I did there) with this remote. The batteries last a month or two. After a few years the buttons will start to stick, though it takes a lot of wear to get to that point. All in all, this is a solid buy.",
