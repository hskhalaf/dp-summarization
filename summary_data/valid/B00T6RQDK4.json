I tried two other options for keeping my rug in place on my pergo floors (mat and tape) I took a chance on this and it was worth every penny. the rug does not budge! and to put things in perspective.... I have a 150 lb great dane and an energetic 7 year old who like to chase each other around the house and roll around on the floor. I am so happy with it. Previously i was readjusting the rug ever 10 minutes when the dog ran through the room, and since putting down this mat I havent had to touch it.",

Obviously stored this way in a very hot climate/warehouse for a very long time because the rubber sides were completely stuck to each other and had to be pried apart. You could hear a ripping noise and see the rubber backing had started to breakdown. Part of the rubber grip was pulled off when I ripped the two sides apart.

My rug was a bit smaller, so I trimmed off some of the pad using regular scissors, put together the pieces using duct tape, and used it on a smaller 2' 8\" X 5' oriental in the hallway, that never stayed put. Well, this was the TRUE TEST, and this small rug stays in place. Order this without fear.",

I was having to rearrange the runner multiple times a day. No more! This thing is amazing! It keep the rug in place, and gives it just a bit of extra cushion. Very pleased with this purchase.",

I had to trim it to fit, and it's not easy; it helps to have someone hold the pad while you cut. A thicker pad would be even more difficult. The wooly felt gets caught in the scissors and you have to pick it out. This is not a complaint - just a warning. It was well worth the effort.",
