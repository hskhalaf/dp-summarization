      "text": "We've been using high quality foam type mattresses for 18 years. Zinus is definitely the highest quality and lowest price mattress we've purchased. In fact, we purchased 1, the were so pleased we purchased 3 more. I would put them at the exact same quality level as the brand 'Purple', except Purple is more than 3x the price. Three of us loved the Zinus just the way they came. One added an additional 'memory foam' to theirs We also added the Handy brand mattress covers to our beds. Completely water proof. A great combination:  I highly recommend the Zinus frames and mattresses. Both are extremely well made. Very surprised...",

No aches and pains sleeping on it. Decided to replace our pillowtop Serta and it was a great decision. I just found out that my german shepherd snuck in the guest room and decided to sleep on it too! Guilty because we found her fur on the cover, so I guess its dog approved too!",

Also, it's medium firm, which is great for side sleepers - I don't feel like I'm in a cocoon and can turn easily on it.
