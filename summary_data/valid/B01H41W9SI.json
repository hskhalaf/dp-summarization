I turn it on it\u2019s side when done and have a bathroom fan that dries everything quickly so hopefully it will last.",

The extendable arms, however, were loose and slightly flimsy so I never trusted anything heavy on it. The arms don't have any sort of non-slip material on the bottom, either, so they would slip off the edge of the tub if I wasn't careful. Overall construction wasn't good, though - rather than solid wood with a channel cut into it, the adjustable sides were smaller pieces glued together. Of course the glue absorbed moisture from the tub and eventually the joints just started to fall apart.",
