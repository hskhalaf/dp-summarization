      "text": "This camera didn't last very long at all. Not the kind of Sony quality I'm use too. The buttons are also too small. Hard to control the options on the camera or even find the on / off button. Then after a few uses something went wrong with the LCD screen. It flickers off then on and then back off. Once it goes off the camera is dead. Power it off and it comes back to life but then the same thing happens again. It was ok while it lasted. It's in the Topeka landfill now.",

She knew that most camera's microphones would distort loud audio such as that encountered in a live performance. After looking through several youtube videos we zeroed in on this model since it was at a good price and didn't seem to lose audio quality. She took it with her to the concert and has been thanking me for it ever since!",

    "title": "Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Still Camera with 10x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom G Lens, 3D Sweep Panorama, and Full 1080/60i HD Video (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nSony DSC-HX7V gets up close with 10x optical zoom. Whether you\u2019re capturing crystal clear video with full HD 1080i, framing that perfect shot with the background defocus, or taking great shots in low light, you\u2019ll find that each moment you capture will be one that you\u2019ll want to hold onto forever.\nSony DSC-HX7V Feature Highlights \n3.0-inch XtraFine LCD \n3.0-inch XtraFine LCD with TruBlack technology gives deeper blacks and more color in the display, all while being thinner than most LCDs.\n\nAVCHD 1080/60i \nRecord movies in Full HD high definition 1080/60i. This provides stunning, smooth motion video with less distortion for playback on Blu-ray Disc players, Sony PlayStation 3 systems and compatible PCs and HDTVs3.\n\nSony G Lens with 10x optical zoom \nThe Sony 10x optical zoom G lens brings distant subjects super close for great outdoors, sports, and travel photos. The compact size makes it easy to take with you in a pocket, purse, or backpack.\n\n16.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS Image Sensor\nThe DSC-HX7V features a 16.2 megapixel \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera\u2019s Sony G lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined \u201cExmor R\u201d CMOS sensor and BIONZ\u2122 image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes7.\nBackground Defocus \nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on your subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\n3D still image and panorama \nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities5. Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\niSweep Panorama \nWith iSweep Panorama just hold the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a panoramic image. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.\n\nSuperior Auto Mode \nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and 44 scenes for movies, making it easy to get the best shot. \nBacklight Correction HDR \nDon\u2019t miss a single detail in high contrast shots. The built in backlight correction analyzes the image and automatically adjusts accordingly to give you a perfectly lit shot. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking three pictures at different exposure settings and processing the best elements of each into a single image for more natural looking shots.\nGPS and Compass \nAn integrated GPS receiver and compass record the location and direction of every shot you take and let you view your images on a map with compatible computer and internet applications, so you can remember where you took your favorite shots.\nDigital Zoom \nCapturing the right shot at the right moment has never been so easy. Digital zoom brings the action up close to get that perfect shot, every time.\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization \nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\nSoft Skin mode \nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. \nNatural Flash \nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\n\nHDMI output \nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). Easily connect your Cyber-shot camera via HDMI cable to any compatible HDMI compatible device to easily enjoy and upload content7.\nSmile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting.\nFace Detection technology\nSony\u2019s Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\nAnti-blink Function\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \nTransferJet technology \nTransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows you to transfer up to ten files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching their TransferJet logos together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing6.\nCompatible with PC and MAC Systems \nThe Full HD video captured with the DSC-HX7V can be used with the provided Picture Motion Browser software1 for PC and iMovie (sold separately) for Mac systems.\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.51\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD using an external DVD burning device (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites (such as Facebook and Sony\u2019s Personal Space). Using the new 5.5 version also enables playback of 3D images taken on the Cyber-shot camera. \nIncludes Sony PMB Portable software2 \nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable 5.5 (Mac ver 1.3) software2 the DSC-HX7V makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites8 without the need for any additional software or install. \n 1. PMB requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7 environments not supported. Not supported by Mac OS. \n 2. Uploading directly to the web requires PMB Portable software and USB cable (included), and PC with internet connectivity. Windows XP SP3 64-bit and Starter Edition and Windows Vista Starter Edition environments not supported. \n 3. Compatible BRAVIA HDTV, and component cable required for PhotoTV HD viewing. Specifications for BRAVIA HDTV shown vary according to market region.\n 4. Movie recording is limited to 29 minute segments.\n 5. 3D viewing requires 3D HDTV, a high speed HDMI cable (supporting at least 10.2 Gbps) connection and 3D glasses (all sold separately).\n 6. TransferJet enabled media (sold separately) and TransferJet technology required in both devices. Interoperability and compatibility among TransferJet enabled devices may vary.\n 7. HD Viewing requires an HD output adapter cable (VMC-MD3) and compatible HDTV, both sold separately.\n 8. Requires compatible wireless access point(s). Some features may rely on Internet services.",
