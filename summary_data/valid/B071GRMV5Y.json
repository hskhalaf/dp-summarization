I do like the various configurations and the kids just like racing trains up and down the platform. The reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because it cannot be taken apart easily for storage. Some of the connections like the sheds and the crane are semi-permanent where the only way to take them apart is with a screwdriver and patience. Be prepared for this to become part of the furniture in your house.",

My kids (3, 4 and 5) played with this for all of 10 minutes and haven\u2019t touched it since. We bought this and the hot wheels super garage and by far the hot wheels wins.",

It's great that it comes with several train engines, since we didn't have very many. It came with several train track pieces and can be configured different ways. The directions easily explained different ways to put it together. It has several connector pieces so that you can connect old/other kids of tracks to this.",
