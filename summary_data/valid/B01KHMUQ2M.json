When it came in the mail, i was pretty interested in setting it up and after playing with volume settings, I am actually pretty impressed. Crisp, Clear and at a good volume I have zero complaints across all VOIP platforms and games alike. Very easy to set up, hardest part was trying to find a good spot on my desk for the boom arm. For the price point, I find this setup to be a steal. Great quality and sound, I am pleased with my drunken self making this purchase.",

If you look closely at the image, you can see the clamp, and then a section that the arm itself slots into in the clamp. Can you guess how the piece that holds the arm is attached to the clamp? Superglue. I'm dead serious. It's a shame too, because the arm itself seems fine enough, but now it's a worthless piece of junk without the clamp to hold it to something.",

I'm very happy with the quality of materials used (again, given the price point, it's a huge surprise as to how durable this thing is). Also, I initially had an issue with the boom stand when it first arrived, but TONOR was absolutely lovely to work with, and made it right immediately. All around a pleasant experience.",

Anyways, it works & sounds great, I'd honestly recommend it to anyone, not to mention it comes with a stand and pop filter. Lastly, I'd suggest getting a 48v box with it. It's not needed, seeing as how the mic can draw power from the pc, but I found that it makes it sound quite a bit better. Hope this helps!",
