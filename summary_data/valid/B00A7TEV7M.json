      "verdict": "The Polo Ralph Lauren Vaughn is an invitation for consumers to go for the preppy look. Not only does it matches well with a buttoned-down oxford shirt, polo shirt, blazers, and chinos, but it is also made to smarten up one\u2019s look with its use of fabrics other than the typical canvas.\u00a0Although there are no wild techs integrated into its rather simple fa\u00e7ade, this sneaker comes comfortably with the use of breathable and flexible textiles, as well as sufficient cushioning around the collar and footbed.",

        "The Polo Ralph Lauren Vaughn low-top sneaker is convenient for everyday use",

        "Well recommended for long walks, brought up by several reviewers",
        "Its stuffed collar and adequate cushioning on the inlay sole provide comfort to the feet, cited by many",
        "Its fabric cover is made of light material which makes the entire weight of the shoe less than expected",
        "The Polo Ralph Lauren Vaughn is a decent and classy shoe design that comes with leather laces",
        "The available colors, excellent, fit, and satisfactory comfort are some of the reasons why many buyers decided to purchase more than one pair",
        "Exceptional value for a signature shoe with outstanding quality",
        "It\u2019s a stylish sneaker which can be easily coordinated with autumn, spring, and summer clothing",
        "Its sole will last for a lot, imparted by several purchasers"

My first thought was \"uh oh these feel cheap\". Maybe my expectations are too high for a 60$ pair of shoes but I am very disappointed that only having put these shoes on for one outing so far of gentle use (walking on pavement), the rubber outsole is already beginning to peel off. It's unfortunate because the shoe looks very nice but has already begun falling apart.",

They are a little long for my feet and feel a little like clown shoes but that depends on the socks I wear.",
