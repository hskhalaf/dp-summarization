(Even with other screws only partly tightened). Took 5 minutes to assemble 3/4ths of the way, and another 45 minutes of struggle and sweat to attach remaining leg! Seems nice when assembled, however. Sometimes warps when you pick it up to move it, but flattens easily with push when you set it down. My dog is an aggressive chewer, but she is afraid of this bed at the moment (doesn't like new things), so it remains to be seen how durable and useful this will be for us.

The weight limit on the medium is 75 lbs, so they don't exceed that. And I would watch the weight limit, it's not the strongest of materials. I would have liked a bit more stronger of a stretch, if my dogs don't use constantly, they become weary of the bed and I have to train them to use it all over again. It isn't difficult, but it's a bit of a process with them.",

It doesn\u2019t retain water due to the material, which is great for keeping my dog off the wet grass My dog lies on it in the sun and likes to take his sticks there to chew, he hasn\u2019t broken it yet, and that\u2019s all I can ask for",

I also bought her two beds (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) so she chewed the one she plays on but when its night time, she curls up and sleeps like a baby! The other dogs love it too when she lets them share so ordered theirs as well.",

      "text": "No joke. Just 14 hours. I watched her on my puppy cam just go to town on it and put a big hole in it. The product is ok though I saw dents in it from their paws within 6 hours. I have a couple 60# dogs and I bought the large. The size was fine. This is my first cot-style bed so maybe I hoped too much regarding the dents. Obviously being dug/chewed inside 14 hours is unacceptable and maybe my dogs simply can't have nice things. On to search for a better bed.",

      "text": "My dog\u2019s trainer uses these beds for training. She gives her a command to \u201cPlace\u201d and my dog immediately jumps up on the bed and \u201cSits\u201d and \u201cStays\u201d until the release command is given. I brought one of her beds home to reinforce training. It worked so well that I bought my own. My dog goes to it immediately when given the \u201cPlace\u201d command. She loves sitting on it and now sleeps on it too. The bed is very well made, sturdy and easy to assemble. I highly recommend it.",

      "title": "Tough to assemble, but mostly solid",
      "text": "Bought this because it seems well-made and Coolaroo sells replacement panels for the bed portion should I need them. The metal components and woven panel do seem well made but I found assembly difficult. I think it has to do with the taut fit of the woven panel, which makes it hard to align the last two holes to connect by screw. I had to muscle the pieces into alignment, and recommend that four hands are better than two for this job. The bed is pretty stable but some angled cross-bars would completely eliminate a tendency for the assembled frame to twist when all four feet are not on the ground.",

      "text": "Absolutely love this bed! My only complaint is that the fabric is kind of scratchy and needs something over it to be comfortable. However, my dogs like a blanket on their bed regardless so it wasn't such a big deal. They even have a pillow cause they're spoiled brats lol. They love this bed! They actually sleep in it instead of in MINE for a change! I have a 60 lb pit, a 35 lb puppy pit, as well as a small shihtzu and they all have plenty of room sleeping together in the large size.",
