Why not just use one of those types? And if you have to rely on the less popular C batteries that most people don't have, why not include some of those? Really, try to think of your customers sometimes!",

    "description": "The Play Circle Home Neat Home Vacuum set is a 2-in-1 pretend vacuum that makes cleaning up with mom or dad so much fun! This colorful plastic vacuum cleaner converts from an upright push vacuum to a removable hand-held \u201cdust buster\u201d and has a hose and nozzle for detailed work. Make the pretend-play much more REAL with realistic vacuum sounds and whirling beads. Pop out the removable dust cup and hear the beads shake as you pretend to empty it out. Toddlers will learn how to keep a tidy house while engaging in mirroring, learning, imaginative play, and developing fine motor skills. The size of the vacuum is perfect for small hands and the wheels let little cleaners easily push the vacuum around. This brightly colored pretend cleaner is a fantastic gift that provides different screen-free, role-play, and learning opportunities at a variety of ages and developmental stages.",
