All that is great, but the problem with this gun is that if you put a dart in it that's ever-so-slightly crooked, it won't make it past the barrel before the chamber rotates, meaning it gets wedged in it, and gets bent up. The only way this toy works well is if the darts you use are 100% perfect, which way too much of a pain to deal with, so unfortunately I can't recommend this particular gun.",

Doesn't shoot as far or as accurate as the Rival guns, but that also means it doesn't hit as hard. It is also a lot easier to pull back the slide.

The darts do thump with some force which will get your attention (but are nothing like being hit with a paintball) so be careful with where you hit someone(avoid face shots especially if they do not have eye protection). They are surprisingly accurate for a \"Nerf\" gun. They have a somewhat limited accurate range of 20-30 yards for large targets and I would say maybe 10-15 yards for small targets indoors (\"Outdoors with wind\" would diminish the accurate range considerably.",

Fyi... this gun fires very fast. However, to shoot a dart from this gun you have to slide the pump back. Its made so kids around 3 need help. Which means you can monitor where the kid is shooting the darts.... please not in the face ;).",

I also have the Disruptor, which is supposedly a new and improved version of this Strongarm gun, but actually my experience suggests that the Strongarm is better. As best as I can tell, the Strongarm shoots harder, is more accurate, and jams less. This is one of my hardest-shooting guns. I like it.",

Just not for her though! :) I have two problems about this Nerf blaster: 1) This Nerf blaster sometimes does not cycle properly if you are shooting very fast. For example, when you are in the middle of a shootout with your kids: sometimes the first foam dart fails to exit the blaster, the blaster cycles to the next dart, and the rotating barrel jams with the first dart inside. This has gotten me shot and \"killed\" many times. 2) Sometimes the blaster does not get enough suction and shoots the dart only a few feet (5-6ft.)",

My son was very excited when he got it, but within 10 minutes he was extremely disappointed with this toy because of the jamming. Returning the product to Amazon.",
