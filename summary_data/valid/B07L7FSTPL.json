It arrived quickly and most of the colors are highly pigmented. Sadly, it arrived with two shades shattered (last two on the right, bottom row). Ironically, when that happens, it's always shades that i am really excited about. They are still useable after pressing them a couple times, just have to be more careful with them.",
