He wanted one with a hood, and this one has it. He is tall and often struggles with the arm length of coats. This coat has long enough arms that he doesn't feel half his arm is exposed if he lifts it up. We would recommend this jacket to other men.",

I've worn it a handful of times and can already notice a difference in how full it was compared to now. I'm not sure if I received a \"dud\" or if Columbia is known for this. I think from now on I'll pay the extra $$ and go for a brand I know won't lose down immediately out of the box.",

I have a doubt that this is a fake one, since it seems to me impossible that Columbia can produce a coat of such a poor quality. Also, the material (feather) that comes out is not mentioned in the product description at all!",
