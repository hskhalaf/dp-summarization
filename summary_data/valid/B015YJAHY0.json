When you read the how to from Xfinity they talk about a \"air gap\" these don't have this, these may be a updated version. They are a little larger than a normal light switch but I had no trouble installing them in the rough-in boxes (single, double and even in a box with 3 switches). I would buy them again if I had any more switches that I wanted to control from my Xfinity home security system.",

      "text": "Very nice switch with awesome features. Along with dimming and energy monitoring capabilities, it can also be used as standalone or as 3 or 4 way along with Add-on switches which costs like $20 each. Integration with SmartThings was flawless. Main switch automatically syncs with Add-On switches and hence no additional configuration needed. SmartThings to Google Assistant (Phone, Wear and Android TV) was again flawless for voice activated commands. Very economical and more feature rich compared to other plain one way and non-dimming switches like from Wemo and TP-Link.",

The look just like regular rocker switches and look fine mounted right next to a regular rocker switch. I also have some wi-fi switches in my house and those are just a flat surface and look out of place when mounted next to other switches. You can install multiples of these Zigbee rocker switches right next to each other in a multi-switch box, unlike the wi-fi switches I purchased.",

So Alexa voice commands were the only way we could operate the switch. About 5 months later, everything stopped working. The lifespan was completely unacceptable for something you have to hardwire into your house. I would whole heartedly recommend buying a smart thing that was easily replaceable as opposed to one that gets hard wired.",

I've tried pulling the spark gap per the manual a bunch of times and it is hit and miss for solving this issue.
