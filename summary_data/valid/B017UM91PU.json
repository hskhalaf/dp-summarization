This company's products are GARBAGE. I have to wonder if these pieces aren't factory rejects that are being bought and resold as every single stool, table or chair I have purchased has been DEFECTIVE. Buy at your own risk! I wouldn't take anything from this manufacturer for free at this point. TERRIBLE!! I want to thank Roundhill for wasting copious amounts of my time, money and energy.

However, if you have boys in your house who tend to be rough or are not too careful this chair may not be for you. It is a very lightweight construction and the back piece is not as firmly on as I would like. I have to tell people to be careful because the chair is just one heavy sit down away from snapping.",

The fabric is soft and the color is just what I was loiking for. The chair does sit pretty low. The pillow has no filling but a bag of filling will fix that issue. I will add a photo later to show how nice it looks.",
