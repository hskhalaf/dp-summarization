I at least expected it to last a year before starting to sink in and become uncomfortable. I\u2019m already looking for a replacement.",

You can definitely feel the frame through the seat, I purchased this in hopes that I could have 2 guests sleep on it, but I'm a little wary that it would be able to support them throughout the night\u2013 the legs that come out of the backrest in sleeper mode seem a bit flimsy. The couch in general feels like I might fall through it... That being said, it's pretty cute and beats an Ikea couch for the same price. It's lightweight and easy to assemble, which was what I was looking for because I anticipate moving in the near future.",

The cushions are kind of light, meaning they are not as dense as I thought they would be, so when you sit and lay down (lay down especially) you can totally feel all the wooden pieces inside that make the skeleton of the futon. Otherwise, it's just a nice hip looking futon. If you have the chance and stuff the pillows with more foam or put some blankets over the seats, then do it for sure. I will have to get a foam topper if I will have guests sleeping over. Otherwise I would suggest the floor before I suggest to sleep on the futon.",

Also, I am 5'4\" and often couches are too high where I cannot put my feet flat on the ground and/or I cannot sit back because the seat depth is too deep. This was great for me.

It was straight-forward to put together, and easily folds down to futon/large chaise mode (upzips in each back half, and you flip out a small leg base before folding each back down). The diagonal stitching pattern adds nice flair, and the gray-specks-with-white material almost has a tweed-like or heathered gray look. I\u2019m really digging the look of it. It has a springiness to it when you sit or lay on it, but you can\u2019t feel the springs. I think it\u2019s pretty comfortable overall, especially at this price point.",
