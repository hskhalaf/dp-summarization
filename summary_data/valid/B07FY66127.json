      "title": "Great fun this helicopter!",
      "text": "First off let me say this RC helicopter has been a lot of fun for me. First you need to understand that this is a product is not a child's toy so the age rating for it sounds about right which is 14+. It takes 6 AA batteries to run the helicopter and the control range is about 32 feet. I've found that it has 6 modes of flight which are upwards, downwards, left, right, forwards & backwards. The instruction manual gave me very clear step by step instructions in several different languages along with diagrams to also help guide a person thru these steps.This was my first RC Helicopter ever and I love it!",

It would sometimes, but not every time. Now (on day two) the remote doesn't seem to respond very well. It didn't respond (wouldn't even take off) and then it would randomly respond again. But when it did respond, it would sometimes just stop in mid air and crash to the ground. In fact, it is currently on top of a building because it stopped working in midflight and just went down...I hope we can figure out a way to get it down...",

I like the LED lighting on it so it\u2019s easy to spot in the air. Great product for kids and adults! I highly recommend this product.",

You are able to stabilize the RC Helicopter, making it easier to fly in any direction. It\u2019s great for indoor and outdoor use. The controls are easy to use, just takes a little practice if you have never flown one before. The whole family is having a blast flying it.",

This was a gift from Santa to our 10 year old son who has prior drone and helicopter flight experience. We were very disappointed and decided to try and fix this by ordering a new helicopter and making a stealthy swap. Upon seeing my initial review, the customer service team at Vatos stepped up and went above and beyond my expectations in remedying my issue. I would definitely do business with them again as they stand behind their products 100%.",
