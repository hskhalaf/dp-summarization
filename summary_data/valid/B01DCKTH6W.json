      "text": "I really like this item assembled and I paired it with some IKEA baskets I had for storage. It was fairly easy to assemble although the directions I got were a little faint so they were hard to read. It comes with this crazy weight to attach to the underneath of the bottom shelf, which I did attach but then removed as I\u2019m only using it for 10-15 lbs of stuff total. If you\u2019re putting a TV and other heavy items on it make sure you don\u2019t exceed the maximum weight and definitely put the stabilizing weight under the bottom shelf as instructed. Really good quality for the money too!",

We live in a two story home so we wanted to have a changing \u201cstation\u201d for down stairs as our nursery is upstairs. So we decided to add this table in our laundry room, instead of a traditional changing table, so when baby is older i can reuse this table. i love the rustic look to it. I will be putting a changing pad on top of this table and all of the diapers, cream, etc in the baskets. So we wont have to go up and down stairs everytime a diaper needs changing. So pleased with my purchase!",

It's very sturdy and gets assembled in about 15 minutes (if you use an electric hand drill). Using a screw driver is possible, but you will be frustrated and your arm will fall off from turning and turning. My living room is gray with teal blue accents and this is a perfect addition (I have the matching 5-shelf book shelves to match)",

I would purchase again!",
