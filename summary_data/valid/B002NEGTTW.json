I purchased this Canon 7d (body only) after having owned one for many years and giving it as a gift, with a complete assortment of accessories to my granddaughter who has demonstrated a unique eye for capturing and framing pictures. The availability is very limited as the manufacturer has discontinued the model replacing it with the Canon 7d Mark II.",

The only thing that hasn't been easy to figure out is the video function.

      "text": "This camera is a little difficult to learn at first, but you grow on it and that's what makes it an amazing product. The features all work correctly, and I have had no problems with the camera at all. I do not recommend this for amateurs as you'll waste more time figuring out the functions then shooting. All in all, I love it :)",

Spend the difference in lenses. the 21 mpix doesn't add as much as quality lenses. The functionality of the 7D is in many ways nicer than the 5Dmkii I use often at work. Especially if you ever use live view (I do for IR photography). I love my 7D and prefer playing with it over the 5dmkii.",
