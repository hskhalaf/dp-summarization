Additionally, mine is super stinky from sweating directly onto the band in the summer months. I am not seeing many better options available though. I am an average sized 5'6\" female.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so glad I found this. It is cheaper than many other bands I have bought that have broke within a year and barely fit my phone. The elastic band is incredibly durable and doesn\u2019t cutoff circulation when you make it tight enough to not slide during a run (and also fits around my bicep without stressing or ripping the seam). It fit my iPhone 8 Plus wonderfully, the rotation device is solid and easy to use mid-run if needed, and the best feature of all is no plastic pocket that goes around your phone. No more unusable touch screen and screens going dark due to the pocket covering the light sensor on to phone.",

      "text": "I purchased this one year ago (actually on my birthday). For the most part, I really like this arm band. However, a year later I am buying it again. The velcro on the arm band is not sticking anymore and comes apart easily. But, I do like it enough, obviously to purchase again one year later. The only other thing I do not like is the bottom where you plug in your headphones or charger (iPhone 8+). It is hard to get the cord into the phone of how they have the rubber that covers that area. They might want to think about redesigning that part.",

I don't really trust the elastic bands that secure the phone either. They haven't torn or anything yet, but I just can't see them lasting longer than a few months. Of course, this is pure speculation. So far, so good.",

It\u2019s a little bit bulky, and I wish it would tighten tighter so I could wear it in my forearm. It definitely is secure and I\u2019m still trying to get use to it, but your phone Is definitely not slipping out, ever.",

The ability to still use the screen instead of trying to get fingerprints to register through a clear plastic, plus the 180 swivel makes it perfect. A great buy.",
