Never had any chains get bound together or crossed or any other problems. The only issue I ran into is the screws included to connect it to wood beam are very cheap. The first one snapped in half when I was drilling it in. I ran down the streeet to the hardware store and bought 2 quality all steel screws for $0.84 total. No problems since. Plan on buying two steel wood screws, but besides that everything else is fabulous and the price cannot remotely be beat. Overall, a great product.",
