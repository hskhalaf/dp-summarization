Tried to center on a 1/4\" bolt and kept slipping off. Tried on a 1/2\" and the prongs wouldn't come back up. Disappointing experience but lesson learned. Just stick with seperate sockets with the right sizing. UPDATE: Company was apologetic and offered a full refund (if I took my review down). While the refund is appreciated, I feel like they should focus more on putting out a quality product. Reviews are what we rely on here and people deserve to know what they're spending their money on.",

For the price, it's a decent enough tool, and it works in a pinch when loosening or tightening an unexposed nut - but I've learned in the end that nothing replaces a decent set of mechanic wrenches and sockets to get the job done right and without scratching the surface coating of nuts that are going to be exposed.",
