He has always done this with his previous chairs, and they either never broke, or they lasted a good long time. The whole chair seems a bit flimsy. On the positive side, it is comfortable to him.",

None of which has been worth my time or money. This gadget is clearly a scam put together to last a few months and by their frustrating you with their appalling customer service, you will give up as they laugh all the way to the bank. It is now several months later and various parts have fallen apart, especially the arm rests making usage very uncomfortable. Avoid this product! Waste of money!",

The legs of the wheelchair and the Velcro to support the legs are sharp and caused multiple cuts and abrasions on the calf and underneath and on the side of the thighs. Both my loved one and myself tested the chair and both experienced the same issue. I recommend you Do NOT purchase this chair, it does not live up the reviews and is certainly not worth the money.",

However we had to return it because it was just a little bit too bulky for her to handle when loading it and unloading it by herself. It also sat a little bit too high and made it hard to transfer in and out of it. She says otherwise though she loved it. it was very solidly built and felt very safe to be in. Somethings have to be EXACTLY right though and this just wasn't the one for HER. She said to give it 5 stars because overall it was a really good chair for the money.",
