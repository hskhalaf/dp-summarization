The only problem with this one is the think metal zipper they used. It does not slide well being such a heave metal zipper instead of the nylon. I'm hoping I'll break it in and it will fix itself or I'll be returning it. That being said the colors are beautiful. I bought the matchup my Glenna bag as well.",

This wallet makes me feel feminine and stylish, and it has plenty of space! I\u2019ve seen reviews that the zipper doesn\u2019t work well or it doesn\u2019t hold their phone well. I just opened it up, but the zipper isn\u2019t hard at all and it isn\u2019t metal like most people are saying. It seems to be genuine Vera Bradley. My phone is a standard iPhone 11, and it fits in the pocket just fine. Very pleased with the product so far.",

The new feature is the cell phone pocket! It fits my iPhone 6s perfectly with a basic silicone case.",

I wouldn't be so picky about that except that Vera Bradley is so expensive and reputable. As well, the zipper is very rigid and hard to move.
