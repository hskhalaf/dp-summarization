      "text": "Purchased April 2, 2014 I've used this product twice on my front yard. Once in April 2014 and again in March 2016. One of the tines has started to bend. It seems like the weld joint has partially failed. I plan to tack it back in place and fill it but I wanted to post photos before I do so. If your yard is bigger than mine you probably want to pursue a faster option. This tool works very well for small yards without the hassles of power equipment. The price is fantastic. Tip: Clean all of the soil out of both of the bores once finished.",

      "text": "I had to stop my aerating and sit down to write this review. Such was my level of frustration. Watered my lawn and began aerating. About every 4 plunges, one or both of the hollow prongs would become clogged. I would then have to sit down and patiently remove the dirt with a screwdriver. Mind you the unclogging was difficult as heck. So after about 45 minutes I had spent 3-5 minutes actually aerating and 40 minutes unclogging this aerator. So it's really a glorified 2 prong garden fork. I have bought a zillion things on amazon but this has to be the most frustrating, useless item of all. I suspect some reviewers have been compensated for their 'opinions'.",

Problem is, first one died before clogging became an issue - it snapped right where the handle meets the tines at what I imagine is a bad weld. The second jammed up badly and after unclogging it with water it never recovered. These are made of a soft metal so they distend easily. Once they become misshapen at all they will clog over and over and over again. So, I went ahead and accepted replacements but I dont have much hope for this brand - at least not in our rather compacted and gritty soil.",

The plugs come out the top easily. You definitely need to make sure you clean all the dirt out when you're finished or it will get packed in there pretty solid. An old screwdriver has worked pretty well for cleaning it. Only suggestion would be to put 1 or 2 spikes between the cores so you get the spike aeration on each step as well.",
