What you dont see is how useless the Android app is in finding those wifi spots (secure on unsecure) and makes it so you cant use the device as a wireless access point. Again, it's due to poor development of the app. You have to scan maybe 15 times before you finally find a wireless signal with it. Its strictly the app that makes me return this.",

The settings for WiFi and SSID is also pretty extensive by allowing you to change the name and set passwords. It also does not need to be plugged into a wall to turn on as long as the battery is charged.

Once you have the accommodating app or visit its web interface, it's not as cumbersome. It's also not very refined, but that's OK because it still functions. All in all, totally worth it if you need a portable routing solution that includes a 5gHz band.",

Learning how to use the filehub was a bit of a challenge, but I found a youtube video that explained everything very well: The Technology Man is the name of the channel and the video is titled RAVPower FileHub setup and review (2019 model). Wireless storage for your tablet or smartphone, and dated 4-20-19. If youre struggling as I did to set it up watch that video!",

      "text": "Took this on a cruise this past summer. It worked perfectly to save the photos from my GoPro to an external hard drive. Only thing I would caution someone of, is when you backup the SD card using the button, it will create a new folder with the date on it. There was a couple of times where the date had reset after I had turned it off. So, if you want the folders date to be correct, just verify the time is set correctly in the app. This will definitely be going with me on all of my longer trips.",

You could then play all your music files from your iPad, which is bluetooth connected to your stereo BT speaker. If you add a \"Visoud\" unit also sold on Amazon, you get a very wide Bluetooth connectivity.. The unit operated flawlessly.",
