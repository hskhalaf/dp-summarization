Use traditional flat bottom mugs that don't have a lot of extra ceramic at the base where it makes contact with the unit.",

Within minutes, butter is liquid and warm feels so good on the skin, plus the heat releases wonderful aroma. To keep surface clean, cover with some folded sheets of parchment paper (like kind used for baking). It can handle the heat.

Decent quality, on/off switch is conveniently located next to the heat plate (as opposed to on the cord). Used as-is it keeps a cup 'warm', but not hot. I've found that placing a large washer on the heater pad helps transfer heat to the cup of liquid. Also I noticed that placing some type of cover over the cup helps hold the heat in, although it's a bit inconvenient .",
