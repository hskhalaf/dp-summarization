The online videos that come with the purchase have also offered a change of pace from what we have been doing. All in all it has been a great purchase for us.",

The arm bungles can be used while on or off the bike and are adjustable to a few different postions. The seat is also adjustable. It feels pretty sturdy, and is easy enough to use. It's small enough to be the centerpiece of my small temporary gym I set up in the study while he rehabs.",
