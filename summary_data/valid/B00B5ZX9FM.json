      "text": "This mic was so much better than I expected from a USB device. So much so, I felt compelled to create a short 6.5 minute video review. I used the mic to record the audio in this review and hope that the quality sound helps you in your search for a mic that delivers way above it's price break. BTW - I suggest you plug in some good headphones to catch a better audio experience when watching this video. In summary, well build, quality manufacturing and really crispy, no-noise mic that's simple to hookup and use. Hope this helps.",

Also using the WindTech PopGard which works well, though in hindsight, could have just gone for a clip on filter.",

Worse, the isolation for the capsule must be pretty mediocre as with the mic on my desk it is absolutely unusable while typing. Mechanically conducted noise is really loud. Nice that it includes this small stand, and the mic is compact and looks sharp, but I tested it against the Blue Yeti and while you could go either way re: sound quality, the practical aspects with the Yeti's better rejection and isolation make it no contest.",

Highly, highly recommend for meetings, capturing audio from guitars and bands, and you can even get a adaptor to plug the USB into a type C for your phone.
