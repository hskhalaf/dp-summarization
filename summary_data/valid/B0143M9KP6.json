Next step turn AC to full blast and not on recirculate!! then sprayed this product into the AC air intake by windshield wipers on outside of car. This took all the cigarette smell out of the air vents!! I was amazed!! i also turned it to max heat then repeated. After that i put it on recirculate and sprayed it into the drivers side floor. Couple weeks later and vents still smell good smoke smell never returned!!",

My suggestion is to leave the room after spraying it - a little goes a long way, hence the high price - as it tends to diffuse in such a way that it gets in your throat, nasal passages, and lungs, and contains carcinogens. But for getting rid of odors, you can't beat it with any candles, sprays, incense, air purifiers, etc. It doesn't just mask odors, it gets rid of them. Better than an air ionizer. And quicker.
