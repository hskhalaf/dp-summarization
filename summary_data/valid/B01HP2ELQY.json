I wore them for about 10 hours that day, after minimal breaking in time (maybe an hour?) Due to the awesome orthotic footbed and wide velcro straps on both the toe and around the ankle, my feet were still comfortable after a long day on my feet. That is the first time ever, in my 65 years, that I kept heels on for the whole day. An amazing shoe!!",
