The speaker has traveled around the world with me and it has survived rainstorms and a banged up life inside my backpack. The only thing that broke down was the adaptor. It stopped working, but I was able to find a replacement online for cheap. The replacement was even better because it was smaller and was easier to travel with. I wish they continued to make this speaker.",

Already have one, bought this because it's the same model which has been discontinued. I would like everyone to know that BOSE TAKES CARE Of THEIR CUSTOMERS! I had to send my old one in to Bose for repair when the pin connection got loose (main problem with these) Not only did they replace the swing out deck, but sent me back a new remote and back up charger; I honestly think they refurbished the whole thing. Not only that, but they also sent me shipping labels and did not charge me a penny for any of this, for a practically new machine!",

Since the Bose is portable I can move it anyplace I want in my home. If I wish I can take it with me in my auto and listen to the music I have downloaded to my I-Pod. Actually since the speaker is portable you can use it anywhere. The quality of sound is the best. I highly recommend this product.",
