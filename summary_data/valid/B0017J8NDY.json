This provides him hours of entertainment and I don't worry about his teeth as with some of his other power chewer toys that feel as hard as concrete. Playing tug-o-war is great family fun and it is hilarious to watch him carry this thing all over the house :) The 36\" size is perfect for a large dog in my opinion. I am VERY happy with this purchase :)",

      "text": "The large nature of the rope allows the dog to get a good grip on it and really pull at it. It also keeps the end a safe distance from your hand so that your dog doesn't miss and catch your hand by accident. The only downside is that it can be somewhat heavy, making it difficult to move around and play with after some time. This same heft allows the product to be very durable though so it's a tradeoff.",

I love these ropes because they aren't expensive and they last so much longer than any other toy he has. When they do start to really get taken apart be careful to watch out that they don't eat the string (it will show up in their poop and it will cause them some grief on the way out). Besides that it is a great value and I will continue to keep buying these ropes for him.",
