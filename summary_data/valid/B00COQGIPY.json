ASUS upgraded the sound card and the battery life in this model over my previous laptop. Very nice looking light weight computer. I seen in previous reviews something about key board issues not sure what that is all about this one is fine I have owned it for a couple months now and it is working great.",

I'm still getting used to Windows 8, and the mousepad is very sensitive, so I frequently unintentionally move the mouse somewhere on the screen that I didn't intend to, but that's all part of getting used to a new computer. It doesn't have a place for a CD, but it does have a card slot on the side, which makes it easy to upload pictures from my camera.",

Then when I was starting to type things that were more than one word in length I found that the space bar only worked about half of the time. I don't know how anyone could work with this kind of issue. After discovering this problem I found, online, that others have experienced the same problem with their ASUS laptops. I'm glad I purchased it from a reputable company that I could return it to.",

It has a great weight and the metal casing makes it seem more durable. However, it is prone to finger smudges.",

I get about 3 hours of watching shows, coding and general surfing. I don't game on it though. Overall I love it. As a software developer, I spend a lot of time on my laptop and I can definitely say this laptop is worth the money you pay for it. I recommend it.",
