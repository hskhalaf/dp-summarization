I loved the harness belt but when she leaned forward the whole back just came forward with her so it wasn\u2019t much help beside keeping her upright. The tray was so high it was about at her shoulders so wasn\u2019t very practical for her to be able to self feed her snacks. I love the idea of this but I am actually returning my item and trying a different one.",
