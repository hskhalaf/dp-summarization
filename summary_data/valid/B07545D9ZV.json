There is growing evidence among nutritional doctors (Dr. Berg, Wolfson et al.) that this combination will ensure calcium is deposited in bones and teeth and not arteries. The current thinking among these doctors is that the K2 with D3 will actually reverse calcium buildup (aka atherosclerosis) in arteries.
