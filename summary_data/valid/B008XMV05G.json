It lasted less than a week before the plug (I was using it plugged directly in to my stereo without the base) was pushed into the unit and it was completely inoperable.",

Luckily, I haven't minded so far w/ a longish commute to turn it on at the beginning of my trip. The piece is TINY and blends right into the car - isn't an eyesore at all.

I cannot hear any compression artifacts from the Bluetooth. There is a half second delay that you'll only notice if watching video. It does have an annoyance in that it starts the audio out quiet and fades it in after there's a break in the stream. This hampers navigation as you'll miss your prompts. I've overcome this by having music playing while I need navigation. It's annoying, but not a deal breaker, for me.",

      "text": "Setup took less than a minute to pair with my phone and I was streaming music and talking call hands-free. The mic does a good job of picking up my voice and the system detects when a caller is to loud and lowers the volume. Mounting was simple. It comes with double sided Velcro and rotates so you can adjust it anytime. They only con is that it has no battery so you do need to keep it powered using your CIG adapter so you need a dual adapter to charge your phone at the same time.",

It powers of some time after the car does and must be manually turned on by the user. Also, the microphone quality is lacking. People I am talking to often mention that they cannot hear me very well. All in all, simple to use and great if you want to listen to music/podcasts/gps directions through the car stereo.",

I tucked it under an overhang in my car and that eliminated most of the light and made it usable.",

I hooked this up a few days ago to try it out and it worked flawlessly. I made a few calls while driving and the quality was excellent. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.",

No opinion on battery life because I mostly plug it in when I am using it and if it's not being used it will turn off automatically so you don't have to worry about the battery dieing with just one use. Would recommend this over the more expensive units.",
