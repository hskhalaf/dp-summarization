My only complaint, and it will be solved when he gets a bit older with it, is the games do not give much time for him to figure him out. By the time he works out what he needs to do, it's making him restart. Especially the mouse game. I've sat with it a few times and struggled to get the cheese and keys in time. Can be frustrating for him, but I figure he will get better as he gets older.",
