Several of the pegs were misaligned with the holes and required bending with pliers and the holes for the screws were of inconsistent size.

All that aside, it is a decent cage and our bird seems to like it. But if you DO decide to tackle this beast you will need at least two people, an hour of time, and probably a few margaritas afterward.",

My 5 year old helped hold the pieces together while I assembled. It's an excellent buy for small birds. The couple things i don't like is the wires on the cage are vertical not horizontal and the side openings are spring loaded which i remedied with a few clothes pins. Overall it was worth it with the sheer size of the cage.",

I feel like the other small cages they had were too small. This is a nice LARGE cage. The side doors do not latch shut, they are on a spring and swing shut if you are afraid your bird may figure out how to open the doors and do not want that to happen, you could put a zip tie on it black is almost unnoticeable",

Parrot is out of cage most of the day and can go in or out as they please, so that might be a factor in whether this would work for you.

      "text": "this is a great deal. Its definitely made cheap, but its still sturdy. Something like this would easily be 300 dollars in a chain pet store, this same model goes for 180$ at my local country max so you are definitely saving some money. I am using it for my juvenile ring neck dove. It could also easily be used for some parakeets, canaries or finches. A larger parrot would definitely break out. Its not necessarily hard to put together but takes some time and is easier if a second person is there to help. definitely would recommend.",

I purposefully installed mine to where the door swings inward. Either way, I recommend adding a latch of some sort (I'm thinking small carabiner clips). Instead of birds, I'm housing a juvenile iguana. I hope it can take the humidity for a couple years until she's full grown. Also, it'd be super cool if the company sold extra perches for this size!",

In my opinion this cage deserves 4 stars for sure. And I would recomend it for any bird owner who doesnt want to go with very expensive cages but is searching for decent quality at the same time.",
