The truth is that the documentation that comes with the machine is very poor and Gamma could have provided a more detail manual. Fortunately, there are YouTube videos online available to learn from.",

Your racket may break if you used tension on the higher end and your racket is not strong/fresh enough.",

I wouldn't describe it as rock-solid, the racket table leans a little when you drop the weight. That doesn't affect the tension, so it's not a big concern. The fixed clamps are pretty solid. It's pretty easy to use. Obviously a drop weight is a little more work than an electric, but it's not bad once you get the hang of it. The price seems a little high for what it is, but you can't really find anything with the same features for less. Overall, a pretty good product.",

The tension winder is awesome which helps you set the tension's accuracy before dropping the weight. I thought getting the drop weight horizontally(to get the desired tension) is faster with it. The storage space works perfectly too where you can organized the tools. Im a first time stringer so my first racquet with this took me 4.5 hrs then 1.5 the 2nd time.",

      "text": "Great product. This is my first stringer so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but, it is quite easy to use. I bought this because I wanted to start experimenting with different strings but didn't want to waist $40 per string job to find I didn't like the string. This way, all I'm waisting is time. I would say this is great for personal stringing, but if you were trying to make money stringing for others, this one takes a bit of time and in the long run may not be the best return on time. Great price!",

I feel confident that I'll be able to restring all future racquets within 40 minutes. I recommend this machine to all tennis players. It's a relatively easy way to restring your racquets at a very reasonable price. You can buy top of the line tennis restringing machines for over $3,000.00, but why?",

You can do a pretty good string job on this machine, but if you are picky you will want a machine with fixed cramp, which cost $500+. Make sure you order a starter cramp too.",

Had never strung a racquet before, and had my racquet strung at the correct tension within an hour and a half after removing the stringer from the box (it helped that the stringing example used the same string pattern as my racquet). If only I had purchased this sooner, I could've saved hundreds of dollars! Just one piece of advice: when stringing through the tensioner, don't get too much string wrapped around the clamp, or it will be difficult to get the clamp to release when you raise the arm to release tension.",
