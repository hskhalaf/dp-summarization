I apply with a brush so I don't put my germy fingers in the jar. It takes a smidge bit of effort to get enough to spread on, because it's thick, but most masks are. It spreads nicely, it doesn't come out of light colored washcloths (use a dark one for sure-yellow isn't dark, btw). It leaves a bit of a tingle, but not in a burning way-more of a \"wow, I feel super clean!\" way. Thanks, friend, for sharing your secret!",

It\u2019s much better than my pricier Dirty Girl PUR mask which gets itchy if I touch my face with it still on. But this mud mask is much better! It\u2019s so smooth and easy to apply, doesn\u2019t make my face itch at all and my larger pores on my nose and sides of my nose have been greatly reduced I could hardly see them in the mirror anymore. I\u2019m really impressed and for the price it is such a great deal. I high recommend it if you want a good mud mask.",

However, it isn't that bad. I have very deep acne scars and lots of blackheads. I will keep using this product for 3 months and will give a actual rating and review then.
