Stitching accents are quality and set the boot apart, impressing a much more expensive boot. Pictures dont do the leather justice on these. Amazing value, I will buy another pair of Ariat boots.",

It seemed well-built and sturdy - it was a bit stiff out of the box like most boots. The materials seemed solid and durable. For me though, I ended up sending them back and ordered another pair of Blundstone 140's.",
