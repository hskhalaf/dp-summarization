      "text": "Poor construction, including very thin metal blades. The rheostat [speed control] that was supplied was enormous, and unless you wanted to have it sticking out into the room about five inches, required cutting a hole in the wall and installing a electrical box. No excuse for that in todays available technology. A quick visit to big box store provided a switch that replaced the wall on off switch for the fan. Also, I need to clarify that this unit does not come with a light kit, the web page suggested that it did.",

      "text": "Put 2 of these in my workshop. They arrived in good condition, with no issues - were packed well. Great price, look good installed. The reason for the 3 stars is that they spin fast, but don't seem to move a lot of air. Standing under them you can feel a breeze, but there is zero danger in them kicking up any dust. :-) Mine are mounted with the blades about 9' off the ground. Fan speed controls worked fine though they are pretty big physically. Mounted mine in their own boxes, so no issues with trying to fit them into an existing switch's spot. They do seem to stir up the air but don't plan to be 'blown away'.",
