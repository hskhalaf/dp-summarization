I like the light taste however its a bit chalky. It is aslo very easy on my stomach. I will continue to purchase",

The amino acid profile is not good and the absorbability is not good which means that what you're ingesting is not getting metabolized so that your body can use it. If you want a vegan protein powder, I recommend buying one that is fermented so that it doesn't cause bloating and is more absorbable.",

There are complaints in the reviews here that it doesn't taste good, but this is unflavored protein powder. What do you expect? It's on you to either power through it or go through the effort of making it tasty through additions. The tastiest way I have fixed it up is blending it with milk, frozen blueberries, cocoa powder, and stevia. Makes for a pretty tasty blend. I have also done some cooking with it, mainly pancakes. I'd recommend it, but know what you are getting. This stuff is not ice cream, it's a building block for your body.",

After using this 1-2 times each day for a couple week, began to develop GI issues. Of course, this is my own personal experience, I'm not saying this will occur for others. Besides that, really, the taste & unblendabilty (is that a word?) just didn't work for me. There is a very strong chalky taste that made it difficult to choke down. I wouldn't purchase this again.",
