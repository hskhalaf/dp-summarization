      "text": "Very pleased with these things! Getting more lumens of light than I was expecting. Previously had two incandescent fixtures in my garage... each bearing 2x100w. Would occasionally leave (by accident) these 400w on overnight. Unacceptable. These new fixtures burning a measley 80w total were just the ticket. And lightwise these babies are outdoing the old ones! I did one thing: I added as an attachment to each one a toggle bolt at each end for added support. I think in the long run I'll be glad I did. Yeah, I can recommend these fixtures. Only one con I can think of: The plastic canopy (cover) can be a little obstinate to remove. Get the hang of it and you're OK!",

Luckily, all my ceiling lights have electrical boxes, so I'm good to go.",
