I was told that to acquire the combination I had to pay $25 online or $35 over the phone. Unfortunately, the safe is now just a heavy box that needs to be discarded. I will never purchase another SentrySafe product.",

I like the door sleeve that is great for passports and the key hangers too. Bottom line is that for a modest price I could get a sturdy and secure box (not looking for burglar-proof) that is fairly water tight and most of all has a HIGH and fairly LONG temperature protection for things stored there.",
