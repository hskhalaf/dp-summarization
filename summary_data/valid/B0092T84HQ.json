For long sessions, I would prefer open cans or earbuds/iems if it's more appropriate. I do really like the sound, but the pressure on the ears/temples is a bit much for extended listening, and I think that comfort is really important in a headphone, because I could see it being a deal breaker here for a lot of people :- /",

The drivers incorporate a new Yamaha-proprietary design featuring neodymium magnets that provide maximum efficiency when used with mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and other portable music players. The over-ear cup shape offers excellent noise isolation, while the ultra-premium ear cushion materials insure a crisp, clear sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nULTRA-COMFORTABLE AND BUILT TO LAST\nBuilt to handle the rigors of everyday use without wearing you down, the PRO 500 features an adjustable, reinforced headband with ample padding textured for a pleasant feel. The band is shaped to apply just the right amount of pressure \u2013 snug enough to provide noise isolation, yet light enough for long listening sessions. Its ear cushions are extraordinarily soft and smooth, with a feel so natural you\u2019ll never want to take it off.\n\n\n\n\n\nFUEL-INJECTED DESIGN\nDrawing inspiration from the world\u2019s finest musical instruments and motorcycles, the PRO Series headphones get your heart racing before you even plug them in. Gorgeous geometry and ultra-clean design curves are matched with premium color and finish materials, and emblazoned boldly with Yamaha's iconic tuning-fork marque, conjuring the power and energy of our high-performance supersport bikes. The PRO 500 is available in Piano Black and Racing Blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nVERSATILE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONNECTIVITY\nThe PRO 500 comes with two detachable, tangle-resistant flat cables: one in a 4 ft length with an in-line remote/mic, ideal for most mobile applications, and one in a 10 ft length for use in the home. Both cables are made from a material that is durable and designed to reduce \"touch noise\" transfer effects. The flat construction keeps the internal cores separated to minimize interference and terminates to a low-profile right-angle connector. The PRO 500 offers dual input/output ports, one on each earcup, providing flexible connectivity. A gold-plated \u00bc\" adapter is included in the box for connecting to professional-grade audio equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTROL AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\nThe 4 ft cable includes an in-line remote/microphone optimized for use with Apple iPod, iPhone and iPad devices. The \"+\" and \"-\" buttons control volume for both music and phone calls, while the center button allows you to play/pause music, skip to the next song, skip to the previous song, or answer/end phone calls. The controller buttons provide a tactile click-response, enabling intuitive operation without need for visual reference. For non-Apple devices, control behavior varies due to differences in applications and pin configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTAKE YOUR LISTENING ROOM WITH YOU\nEngineered to move you and keep you moving, the PRO 500 folds into a compact size for traveling. It also comes with a semi-rigid protective carrying case. Plug it in anywhere and escape to an auditory utopia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHICH YAMAHA PRO SERIES HEADPHONE IS RIGHT FOR YOU?\nYAMAHA PRO 300\nCheck out the Yamaha PRO 300 YAMAHA PRO 400\nCheck out the Yamaha PRO 400 YAMAHA PRO 500\nCheck out the Yamaha PRO 500 Design On-ear, closed back Over-ear, closed back Over-ear, closed back, rigid aluminum alloy earcup Driver Type Dynamic, neodymium magnet Dynamic, neodymium magnet Dynamic, neodymium magnet Driver Unit \u03a61-5/8\u201d (40 mm) \u03a62\u201d (50 mm) \u03a62\u201d (50 mm) Impedance 53 ohms @ 1kHz 23 ohms @ 1kHz 23 ohms @ 1kHz Maximum Power 300 mW 1,000 mW 1,000 mW Sound Pressure 107 dB \u00b13 dB (1 kHz, 1 mW) 106 dB \u00b13 dB (1 kHz, 1 mW) 106 dB \u00b13 dB (1 kHz, 1 mW) Frequency Response 20 Hz \u2013 20 kHz 20 Hz \u2013 20 kHz 20 Hz \u2013 20 kHz Weight 7 oz (200 g) with attached cable 10.2 oz (289 g) without cable 13 oz (369 g) without cable Ports -- 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) on left earcup Dual 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) input/output, one each on the left and right earcups Cable Length 4 ft (1.2 m) attached, tangle-resistant flat cable with remote/mic optimized for Apple devices CABLE A: 4 ft (1.2 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable with remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; CABLE B: 10 ft (3 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable CABLE A: 4 ft (1.2 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable with remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; CABLE B: 10 ft (3 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable Connectors Gold-plated 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) L-type mini stereo CABLE A: 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo with L-type on one side; CABLE B: 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo CABLE A: Gold-plated 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo with L-type on one end; CABLE B: 1/8\" (3.5 mm) male-to-male mini stereo In the Box Soft carrying case; gold-plated 1/4\u201d adapter; cleaning cloth Semi-rigid carrying case; detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable (4 ft/1.2 m) with in-line remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; 10 ft (3 m) detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable; gold-plated 1/4\u201d adapter; cleaning cloth Semi-rigid carrying case; detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable (4 ft/1.2 m) with in-line remote/mic optimized for Apple devices; detachable, tangle-resistant flat cable (10 ft/3 m); gold-plated 1/4\u201d adapter; cleaning cloth",
