We have had the bone shaped pools for years and they are still perfect. All pools have been enjoyed by over a thousand dogs a year while being used for about 3 hours a day and no damage at all. These could be used for anything including a awesome kiddie pool for kids.",

      "text": "This is definitely a sturdy, rugged dog pool. My dog isn`t a digger or a chewer, so I don`t know how it would handle that, but it isn`t a cheap kiddy pool. I bought this size so my 60lb boxer could cool off and splash around with her toys & maybe some ice cubes. There is room for her to do that & to lay down, but she can`t do a full body stretch. She has room to lay down comfortably. I`ve seen 3-4 husky/lab dogs fit in the bone shaped pool, so i figured that might be too big for her alone. This will meet our goals if I can convince her it`s not a giant water bowl, ugh!",

      "text": "I have a 250 lb pot bellied pig who I have had a very hard time trying to find a pool for that would last him more than a week or two. He punctures the bottom of most pools with his hooves and, because of his short legs and low hanging belly, the pool has to have low sides that are both sturdy and flexible so he can get in and out easily without hurting himself or crushing the sides. This pool is awesome!! I'm going to be able to clean it up, store it away and use again next year, and probably many more years after that!!",
