I would reccomend wearing thinner socks. My cotton under armour high socks sort of bunch up. But to each their own. ***update 9 months later*** I would suggest wearing slightly higher socks than ankle socks. When I wear ankle socks with these,my heal always gets rubbed and ends up with a sore or bloody. I will be buying more of a show socks now.",

The bottom of the shoe is too flat and stiff. They look nice but would not recommend for running. They would work for casual wear or exercises such as squatting since the bottom is flat. I can barely walk in them due to back of shoe rubbing on ankle and giving me blisters.",
