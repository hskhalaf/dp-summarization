      "text": "This camera is fantastic. It's so small but yet takes great pictures. You really notice the wider angle lens vs. previous generations, especially when in small tight spaces like taking a picture of a room. It starts up really quickly so you hopefully won't miss too many shots. It doesn't take great quality low light pictures and has a weak flash, but every compact camera has those issues. The HD video mode is a nice feature on such a small camera and perfect for impromptu video moments or times you can't carry something bigger (for example: skiing/ snowboarding). Overall, it's a great camera that can be carried anytime due to it's size.",

I am extremely nearsighted and the 2.7\" screen was better than the 3\" widescreen on the SD980 IS. This camera is perfect in every way. It embodies just the right stuff!! Other camera, more expensive and some not, had too much unnecessary features. I wanted a camer that had some weight to it, took great pictures, great video and was compact. This camera fit the bill and was perfect for me. I recommend this camera to those who want a great digital camera with simplicity, yet a lot of camera.",

I was sceptical in buying an ultra compact camera, and of the Canon brand after investing $1,500 into my Nikon camera. This little camera has been awesome, takes great pictures, and very easy for my wife to use as a basic point and shoot. Perfect size for carrying in a pocket, although it is almost too small, in that holding in your hand and using the shutter button can be a little difficult if you have large hands or fingers. I'd buy this camera again and would recomend to others!",

She isn't very good with gadgets so I wanted something that would basically do all the adjusting automatically. Her pictures are no longer blurry or too dark. The quality is satisfactory to me, but then again I am used to using a dslr. It fires up pretty quick and snaps the first photo within a couple seconds. It also has a decent wide angle perspective.",

Since I've had a Canon before, I could easily understand the menu. People admire the large screen. It does hesitate before actually taking a picture, but not as long as some I've seen. I've really enjoyed the wide angle setting - could fit quite a large group in one shot. Battery life lasted through over 100 photos over two weeks.",

There is a longer then average saving time when taking pictures when a flash is on. Also do not expect DSLR photo quality or anything like this out of the camera, you won't be gracing the cover of photography magazine with it anytime soon. However if you need a solid, high quality, ULTRA compact point and shoot this is it!",

It is definitely better than SD 780 because of 4x zoom, bigger lens and display size, and i feel also a bit more sturdier. However, the picture quality though better than 780 is lesser than older 790 The menus are quite nice and usable, and camera is definitely more faster and responsive. It stays nicely in pocket, and good enough to take all types of shots. The video quality isnt bad at all, hdmi o/p is cool and I am wondering why I need my Sony handycam anymore.",

So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. Even if your subject is moving, Canon\u2019s advanced detection technologies capture the action as it happens. \n\nShooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 20 Shooting Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nEasy to use with built in hints and tips\nPowerShot SD940 IS lets you focus on the fun and creativity of photography by making your shooting experience easy and intuitive.
