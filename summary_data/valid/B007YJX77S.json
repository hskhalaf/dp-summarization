I pulled the HD from the case (it was out of warranty anyway) and hooked it up to multiple computers using multiple cables, connectors, and software programs...none of them could read it. Sent HD to iosafe for free analysis; was a major HD failure. Was quoted $1200+ for them to attempt data recovery on the 2TB drive (they would have to send it off to a forensic type of recovery service). Recommend either having multiple, repetitive backup devices to go with this or an extended data recovery plan.",
