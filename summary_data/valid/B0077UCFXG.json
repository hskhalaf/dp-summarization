It got here quickly, and it wasn't hard to get up to second floor with stairs, it was easy to navigate up my rather narrow hallway, and all I had to do was slide it outta the box and unfold it,boom that simple. It's strong and sturdy. Im ordering another one next week! And it's metal so it'll last forever! And it folds in half so it'll be easy if I need to move it anywhere!",

This one is perfect and being that it was shipped folded it was very easy to transfer. Very affordable box spring and we highly recommend it!!",

But, my husband and I got them out, unfolded them, zipped up the covers, and voila\u0300! Best box springs ever! Super sturdy metal frames, strong fabric covers, AND they fold up for transport. Who came up with these? Because they are genius!",

Our Jayanna BiFold Box Spring is not your average foundation. It features a structure made of thick and durable steel, meaning that frames and mattresses may come and go, but this box spring will be with you for the long haul. What\u2019s more, its folding design not only makes set-up insanely easy, but it also comes in handy on moving day, maneuvering easily in and around tight hallways and corners. Once unboxed, this brilliant foundation practically assembles itself by taking shape once unfolded. Essentially, deciding where to place the bed will take longer than setting up this box spring. Backed by both our 5-year worry free warranty and hundreds of positive customer reviews, the Jayanna box spring is about as easy as decisions get.",
