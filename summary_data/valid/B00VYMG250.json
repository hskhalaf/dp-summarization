I have plans in the near future to buy one of these little action cameras also and the accessories pack like this one and really put every thing through its paces in a more in-depth review.",

It's also good because it gives you several mounting screws and quick-release clips. You may not use all of the components. I wore the body component like once, and we're never gonna use the bouyancy attachment. So far we've mainly used the swivel clip and the selfie stick. Selfie sticks are normally for squares, but they're SUPER useful for GoPros because you can reach high places, carry it in front of you for videos that don't look like crap, and it's probably the best thing to have on you if you are gonna take the thing underwater.",

The top two joints are very sensitive to movement, and the weight of my GoPro Hero causes it to angle downwards sometimes. Overall, this accessory pack is perfect. It has the same types of accessories as a GoPro brand, but for an incredibly affordable price",

This creates the risk of the plastic cracking while in use and filling with water. - Provided bag won't even fit half of the items included (in case you thought it would fit everything).",

I haven't tried some of the products out on the car/motorcycle yet but will try inside on glass before outside if things fall off. You need extenders for the chest unit to work properly as the basic clamp on piece makes the camera point down, which happens with many of the mounts.

This has enough accessories to keep him entertained for awhile.",
