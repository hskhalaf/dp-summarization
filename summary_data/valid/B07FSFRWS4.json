I haven't come across a situation where I needed a PC or different system. I'm very pleased with getting a 2018 model for under $200, especially with the screen size. The speakers are nicer than the last Chromebook model I had as well. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

It's slow, ponderous, and takes forever to update. The price of this computer was a definite plus. It's quick and agile, and I'm very comfortable with the Android OS. It took fewer than 5 minutes to set up this computer, from the time I plugged it in until I turned it off. For the big stuff I still have my desktop computer (also Acer), but I can see myself using this laptop gem for a lot more tasks. I feel this was a wise decision and purchase.",

I am very impressed with the quality of it and the performance for basic functions such as email, web surfing, YouTube videos etc. Setup was a breeze! ChromeOS found the local USB printer and got it working right away automatically. The build quality is solid for a basic 15.6 inch laptop. The battery life is great (12 hours). The screen quality is perfectly good as well. Nice snappy little laptop!",

But definitely not enough to be a deal breaker for me and I'm finicky. Also, I wish the keyboard was back-lit. But also, not a deal breaker for the price. I couldn't see using this for gaming.

Compared to the Windows 7 laptop we bought for about $300 back in 2011, it boots quickly of course, but is noticeably slower once you are in Gmail.

My son called it a \u201cgiant portable phone, passing itself off as a computer!\u201d It literally operates like our cell phones, do include needing to download the android version of MS applications. You can use Google docs; however, you can\u2019t use any word processing applications unless you\u2019re connected to the internet. It also lacks certain familiar keys on the keyboard, so you will need to Google the keyboard shortcuts. The Chromebook was frustrating to me. Thank goodness Amazon let me return it!",
