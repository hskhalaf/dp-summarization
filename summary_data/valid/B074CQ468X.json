      "text": "If you like flat, perfectly cooked bacon, buy these. Lay out all your strips on your grill, place each press across 4 or 5 strips of bacon, move periodically pressing on where the bacon is curling or waving. Give a little extra pressure here and there as required and your bacon will be the best you've ever done. I personally have found 325 degrees F, is the perfect temperature for my grill, cooks a little slow but the end product is worth it.",

Use this steak weight to lightly press steaks and other meats flat to the grill while also using the heat stored in the weight itself to cook the other side! This 8 1/4\" x 4 1/4\" cast iron steak weight comes with a wood handle. It is for use on grills to speed up the cooking of meats by pressing the food flat against the hot grill, or for cooking bacon without curling. Utensils with wooden handles are not dishwasher safe; exposure to hot water can cause the wood to warp or splinter. These items should be hand washed and dried thoroughly. For optimal results, use a wood conditioner periodically to prolong the life of the wood.",
