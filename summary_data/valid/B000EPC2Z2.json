Update: I'm very disappointed in this shoe after wearing it for 3 months or so. The rubber sole has separated from the leather upper - the stitches have torn out. I don't wear them everyday but maybe 3 out of 7. I've tried contacting Sperry to return and replace - but apparently they don't do that.",

These shoes are very comfortable, provide a tad arch support, but not much, and are very durable. I recommend to anyone who loves sperrys and to those needing some dependable boat shoes.",

Frankly, I ma a little disappointed in the quality of materials on these new pair. The padding is a bit thinner, the leather seems not as pliable, and overall construction quality seems to have dropped. I am hoping some of this improves with break-in, but it would be a real shame if Sperry decides to go the \"Made in China\" route on all its products, and cheapens the build quality.

So, last chance ordering online. Tried the Amazon Choice Sperry Mako. Right out of the box they were the most comfortable boat shoes I have ever had and they look way better than the others. Yeah they were more money but well worth it! Highly recommended!!!",

The only negative I\u2019d say, which really isn\u2019t a negative at all, is the Sperry lettering on the rear of the shoe on the tan leather did not have black coloring in some letters. I solved that issue with taking a black ink ballpoint pen and coloring in the letters to have it match. It looks fine after 2 weeks of wearing it on a boat. Definitely recommend these, they\u2019re aesthetic and work with many outfits/colors.",

I still have the first two pairs you cannot wear them out. Use them for working in the yard and fishing and such. The new ones look great with Gap or Cinch jeans.",

This stylish shoe, while somewhat heavier, combines the advantages of the original with a thick cushioned sole that make it a good choice for walking and daily wear.",

I had to put on a pair of thick sweat socks and the street shoe socks on top to get them to fit. No socks, as some wear these, is out of the question. BUT.....they look good.",

    "description": "With enhanced comfort and support, the Mako is the worlds first boat shoe as rugged as a shark.\n\nBest known for boat shoes that have logged more miles of open ocean than any other brand, the Sperry Top-Sider story began on a raw winter day in New England. When avid sailor and hobbyist inventor Paul Sperry let his dog Prince out for his daily exercise, he noticed that the cocker spaniel was remarkably stable, even at a full run on the snow covered, icy crust. Paul raced back to his laboratory to begin working. Using pieces of rubber, a razor blade, and an ordinary sneaker, Paul had soon pieced together the prototype of the world's first boat shoe. Subsequent designs yielded the original Sperry Top-Sider now known as the Authentic Original. Since 1935, Sperry Top-Sider has been the leading brand of footwear for those who love the water. From its introduction of the world's first siped rubber outsole for non-marking traction, to its advanced technical fabrication to combat the elements, Sperry Top-Sider remains the vanguard of high-performance amphibious footwear. Available around the globe in fine independent, marine, and department stores, Sperry Top-Sider is the official footwear of the U.S. Sailing Team, Zodiac Academy, the World Billfish Series, and the Shimano Fishing Tour.",
