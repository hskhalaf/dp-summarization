My only complaint is that it's a little noisy but I'm not terribly surprised.",

My recommendation to LG is to make the cord longer and have it on a automatic rewind So you can use as little or as much length as you need. I'm really happy l got this today.

With negative air pressure, the hot air outside the room rushes in through doors etc., which greatly reduces cooling efficiency.

The exterior of the box is fine (no dents), so is the packing material it came in. This AC had to have been packed broken. The whole front piece is sticking out because the clip that holds it on is broken. Sure, it still blows cold air (for now), but an item this much still shouldnt be delivered damaged. Save yourself the money and frustration of spending so much on an item to have it be delivered broken.",

However, I'd say all it does is take the edge off. For the price, It is not much better than the $40 box fan I purchased at Target. I set it to the lowest possible setting, and it is still quite the disappointment.",

Ft.| Style:Cool OnlyRoom to room, house to house or home to work, LG\u2019s portable air conditioner is the ideal climate-control solution for when you\u2019re on the go. With a sleek contemporary design, this free-standing portable unit blends in with any room decor. Our auto-swing air vent technology makes sure you enjoy every bit of cool air by circulating the cool air more efficiently so no hot spot will be left untouched. The auto evaporation system allows for continuous use and with the programmable 24-hour on/off timer, you can control the temperature even when you\u2019re not there.\n\nIn October 2017, the Department of Energy implemented a new test procedure to determine the BTU rating of portable air conditioners. The procedural change has adjusted the amount of BTUs allowed to be claimed downward by as much as 50%. There have been no internal changes to these units, and the functionality remains the same.
