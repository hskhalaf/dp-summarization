Unfortunately the blade didn't fit. It was for a different model.. I called again. They recommend I return mine and get an adjustable unit from another company. That was great advice.

I can\u2019t wait to experiment with more. If you have been thinking of getting a spiralizer but were not sure of the quality of the affordable ones that are available, this one is for you.",

I bought this as a lightning deal after purchasing already spiralized zucchini at the grocery store that I thought were expensive but wanted to try. This product is well worth the price and I plan to use often to provide a healthy alternative for traditional pasta.",

What other food items can I make into delightful little spirals with this? Fourth was annoyance as I had to untangle my ravaged T-Bone steak from this appliance. Finally, I reached the acceptance stage. As long as I'm going to be forced to eat vegetables, they might as well be in weird little connected circles. At that, it excels.",

If you do this you save a little bit of the vegetable since you get to spiralize the end of the half you would have lost.

For the spiralizer, it works great provided your veggies are uniformly circular. Odd-shaped items will not work well with this unit. Also, the little tray to store the extra slicers is great, but there isn't enough of them so you still have VERY sharp slicers laying around. Not good if you have small children around.",

This spiralizer is very easy to use and washes up beautifully. I've only experimented on raw zucchini, sweet potatoes, and turnips, but very little effort was required to spiralize them. I was a little surprised by the \"core\" of vegetable that is left, but I am a novice spiralizer. Giving it more thought, though, it does seem logical. When in use, it is very stable on my kitchen counter and a cinch to remove when finished. As recommended, I washed the blade portions with a brush, which made it extra-easy to clean. Glad I bought it!",

Aside from that one attachment claiming to be for something it shouldn't, the item is of good quality. It was so easy and fun to spiralize things, easy to store and wash.",
