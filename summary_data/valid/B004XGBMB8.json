I ordered another one from a different site, and it is great! Perfect cup of coffee with minimal sediment. Easy to throw in the dishwasher.",

I don't understand why this is this way. It also does not stay hot as long as I would expect a vacuum insulated device to maintain heat. Even after presoaking the coffee press with a fill of hot water it still cools more quickly than expected. Other than that, it's built like a tank, durable, and easy to clean.",

The Frieling press is gorgeous but if you want a press that works consistently for years, I'd suggest the Bodum instead. Update: After I posted, Frieling agreed to charge me only $3.50 to ship the plunger. That's a far more reasonable price.",

Far better than a $1,000 expresso maker. taste great (buy dark roast coffee), and can't be simpler.",

What really sets this apart though is the constuction of the plunger.

      "text": "Okay, it's necessary to spend a significant amount of money if one wants to have a good, plastic-free French Press. This is such an item. My only issue is that the screen is permanently riveted in, and thus harder to clean/replace versus some other models. I am just hoping that there is a replacement available for the top piece individually, should it wear out. The insulating function works fairly well. Nice ergonomics.",

I just made my first coffee with this new press, and I love it! It is beautiful, feels wonderful to handle and makes the BEST coffee ever. Before I finished my first cup I went back on line and ordered another one, the 32 ounce size. Our employees, 6 of them, make coffee in our kitchen all day. This is the new way. They will love it too. If you are thinking of buying one. Do it. You will not be disappointed.",

I took suggestions from the reviews and made certain not to grind the coffee too fine - and wow! Delicious coffee every time. Not to mention the beautiful design and the hardy stainless steel Thanks to all the hints and tips it made this purchase tremendously worth the money.
