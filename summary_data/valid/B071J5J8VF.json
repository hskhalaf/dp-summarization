The unit has worked far better than anyone I have used, and I have used several. The only issue with it is it's small size and lack of weight. When you connect HDMI cables to it, the weight of the cables pulls it around tilting back at an angle, so don't plan on it sitting in one place; display perfect; it won't. By the way, most all of the other units have this same problem.",

Tried everything, switched the port, off and on, got to the point where I just disconnected the PS4 and ran it straight to the tv and cable box to the switcher. Then my Xbox One exhibited the same issue. Just came down to too many issues with a brand new product and requested a refund.",

It\u2019s super fast and the output looks beautiful. The second I turn off say my Nintendo Switch, it will immediately switch inputs back to my cable box.

Our couch is about 13 feet away from the tv and I have to lean forward to about 10 feet to get the remote signal to reach the unit, not a deal breaker for me just letting you know the remote's reach.",

I have to point the remote directly at the switcher, if a little off, it will not switch to the next source.
