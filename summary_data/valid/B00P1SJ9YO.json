It's not cheap but not overly expensive either. Increasing in age sometimes brings on unwanted effects. Bleeding lipstick unfortunately is one of them. I read the reviews on this product and decided to try it. WOW it works great! It is not greasy nor waxy. It feels smooth on my lips. The best thing however is that IT STOPS LIPSTICK BLEED! If you have the same problem, this is the product for you!",
