      "text": "I use a lot of limes--bought this because it was very cool looking. It dances across the counter because it sits on little legs--if the counter gets a little damp--the juicer is does not stay put. Also, it only has one size reamer that is really too big for small limes. It is now in a box in the closet and I am back to using my Epica-not nearly as attractive but it works faster and has a smaller reamer that works well for limes. I really thought this would be great--and it got good reviews. Did not work for me. 4 stars for esthetics though.",
