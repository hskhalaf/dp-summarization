Overall the Chromebook is very good for the money I spent. Just a disappointment that there is no backlit keyboard. The keyboard has been put down on some reviews on youtube but I quite like it. The keys press really nicely. The mouse pad is really nice too. Its so easy to use and this is my first chromebook. So far I'm very please with it!",

The wifi was also poor, inferior to a cheaper 5 year old chromebook we have in the house. I cannot in good faith reccomend this to anyone and it is being returned straight away.",
