The mesh upper and perforated tongue provide a light and breathable environment for the foot. It\u2019s bolstered in areas that need support to keep the foot stable without the extra weight. This hard court option is treated with a track spike-inspired tread for traction.",

        "The bulk of the reviewers claim that the New Balance 896 v3 is light and fast",

        "This trainer provides sufficient room for custom orthotics, several users describe"

      "text": "This was a great purchase. The shoe fit perfectly out of the box and required no breaking in whatsoever. It's so nice that New Balance has the option to get wide and extra wide sizing for their shoes unlike some other companies. Also, the price point of $43 before I used points was killer. I noticed the shoe shot up to $110 in the last month--talk about a price difference.",

      "text": "After dealing with plantar fascia pain several years ago, I've learned to go no higher than a 6mm heel drop in my running shoe. It's hard to find a tennis shoe without significantly larger heel drops. This one hits the mark. There's not a lot of cushioning here, but the shoes are really responsive, light and quick on the court. I'm pleased with the breathability and durable materials. Based on the other reviews, I ordered my usual size (11.5 M) but went with 2E I'm really glad I ordered a wider shoe. This model does seem incredibly narrow. I've still got plenty of room in the toe to protect the nails on hard jump stops.",

I do question a little the long-term durability as they are super light, but they have held up well so far and would say they are more durable than the typical Nike sneakers would be. They aren't as sticky as some sneakers, so if you like a little slide in your shots on hard courts and you like a light game-day sneaker, this may be the one.",
