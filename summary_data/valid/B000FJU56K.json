I gave it a 4* because in comparison to the previous one I owned (had to replace because I ran over it with my car in the garage), this seems to have a smaller capacity and just isn't quite as good. still it works well enough and the price was good; and I'm not going back to lighter fluid. also you can add more charcoal aroung the base before you light it or after you poor the coals before puttimg the grill over it.*** caution: use an oven mit, the handle gets very hot.",
