We really didn't care if they talked, and we liked the idea that these smelled like cotton candy. Overall, it was worth the money. My son brought Bunny to me a week later and showed me a small hole in a seam under the arm and another one on the bottom of his foot. Not super happy about it, but not worth returning. I stitched it up. Two days later... Another small hole in the other foot. It's not noticable, but he knows. I'll be doing some more sewing! However, they are soft, smell great and super cute.",

There is a faux strawberry scent which isn't overwhelming but not overly pleasant. Overall, very pleased!",
