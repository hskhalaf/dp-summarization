Apparently there are differences between X and X compact Even worse the fingerprint sensor has a dead slot and certain times simply does not work My recommendation? XPERIA X is a good phone but you might find far better deals",

Only reason I didn't get the Moto G compact is because the tech spec was not great. Hope this helps. But all-in-all the Sony Xperia is a very good standard Android phone (there's probably a lot cheaper that work as well i.e. Moto G compact et al)",
