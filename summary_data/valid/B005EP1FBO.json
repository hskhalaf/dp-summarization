I returned the first pair for this reason, and foolishly requested a replacement pair. On the second pair, the noise didn't start until about 4 weeks in, but now it's non-stop. It's like a suction cup noise when walking on carpeting or flooring, which can be quite irritating. And it only happens with the right shoe, same as last pair. Weird.

      "text": "My husband complained of his hips and back hurting every night so I decided to buy some expensive work shoes for him. It's very difficult to purchase shoes without trying them on, especially for another person! I bought slightly larger, since he usually wears a 12, but his feet seem to have gotten bigger lately. He wasn't sure about them at first, stating that the soles seemed too hard. The most telling evidence, though, is that he hasn't complained about his back, hips or feet since starting to wear them. Kudos - I think we have a winner.",

Bottom line - for less than a-buck-and-a -quarter, these are are pretty good buy - spending more? - there are US manufacturers that make a better hiker.",

I like that the shoelace loops aren't just nylon straps that can break unexpectedly, not that the leather loops can't but I'd think these are more robust. I also like having the metal top loops- a sign of quality if you ask me. I would not hesitate to recommend these or buy another pair.",

Grass kills shoes! This business should be a proving ground for shoes. Day in and day out always wet and covered in grass and mud and rain. Even the laces are in tact! These are still going strong half way into the second year. They got a little long but just barely. Very comfortable and zero break in time.",

It is comfortable, but relatively narrow or snug width (typical of Vasque), which I like better for my feet. I was debating between this and the Patagonia Drifter GTX, but found the Vasque to be more attractive/subtle, and without what seems to be an anti-friction material inside the Patagonia which makes it feel a little bit slippery. Also, this one has a gusseted (sp?) tongue which prevents material from getting inside. Unfortunately this and practically every other hiking shoe is made in China nowadays, not the US, but then again the price is right (here at least!). Thanks Amazon!",
