After years of cooking with nonstick pans; I've went back to stainless steel for the culinary benefits. It cleans practically as quick as nonstick, does not scratch or peel, and sauteed foods come out so much better tasting and looking. Those who have trouble with food sticking need to browse the internet to learn the best technique for cooking with stainless steel.....yes, there IS a technique!",

Farberware said they will look into (with no guarantee that they will replace it) it if I send it back at my expense, which is nearly a third of the original price. I'll be sure to research my next pan purchase to see if it has recurring complaints, as this one does.",

    "title": "Farberware Classic Stainless Steel Saute Fry Pan with Lid, 2.75 Quart, Silver",
    "description": "Size:2.75 QuartThis Farberware Classic Series Stainless Steel Saut\u00e9 Pan with Lid goes instantly from cooking a fast breakfast in the morning to preparing family frypan meals at night. Farberware has been trusted for over 100 years, and this frying pan continues that tradition for a new generation. A full cap base featuring a thick aluminum core surrounded by stainless steel provides rapid, even heating, whether basting eggs or saut\u00e9ing zucchini and squash. The frying pan is constructed of heavy-duty stainless steel polished to a mirror finish for a classic touch, and the comfortable handle with iconic styling provides a confident grasp. This pan works perfectly for making a weeknight dinner of Sloppy Joes or caramelizing onions and peppers with Italian sausage. A self-basting lid helps seal in heat and flavor, and the fry pan is dishwasher safe and oven safe to 350\u00b0F. Cooks who love the versatility and durability of other pots and pans from Farberware will find all kinds of uses for this big frying pan with lid. Prepare tried-and-true family favorites and create enticing new dishes with this Farberware Classic Series Stainless Steel 2.75-Quart Saut\u00e9 Pan with Lid.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFunctional as well as beautiful, this 10-inch frying pan is made of heavy 18/10 stainless steel polished to a mirror finish. The pan has an aluminum core in its base to spread heat quickly and evenly. The core is completely clad in stainless steel so, like the rest of the pan, the bottom resists corrosion and discoloring and cleans up easily. Thick rolled rims add durability and make it possible to pour from the pan without dripping. Because the pan is 2-1/2 inches deep and comes with a tight-fitting, domed lid, it is roomy enough to fry chicken and saut\u00e9 vegetables but can also be used for braising red cabbage and pork chops or for cooking chili on the stovetop or in the oven. (The handles are oven safe to 350 degrees F and stay cool on the stovetop.) The pan is dishwasher-safe and comes with a lifetime warranty against defects. --Fred Brack",
