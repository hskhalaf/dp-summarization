The 3 scopes that are not working and now just taking up space is because the LED light doesn't seem to have a good connection to receive power. I can remove the lens and push down on the light bulb and the led will flicker. This is definitely a mechanical issue with the scope. I will not be purchasing anymore of these scopes.",

Our 4 year old loves picking thing up from the house and yard and checking them out under the scope. So much fun and such a great value for the price. Overall it's been a great addition, and well worth the price.",

The stage is good. It's a little (very little) hard to focus perfectly at greater magnifications than 1000x, but my no means frustrating or unusable. This is really the only con, but at only $210 and free shipping with prime it's a great deal. Comparing this to other microscopes I've used it's probably a 4 out of 5, but a whole lot less expensive.

      "text": "I got this microscope for my Son for Christmas. He is a Senior in High School and getting ready for College so, he knew this was something he could use for a long time. We absolutely love it, it is amazing how things look under the scope. As for the negative part, I was really shocked that the microscope didn't come with any glass slides. These are what you need to be able to look at anything. So, you have to buy the glass slides seperately. To me, that is like buying a car with no tires, these are the things that you need to make the item work correctly!",

The others work fine, but focus is quite delicate and you may spend an hour getting one good shot at the 300x magnification.",

I am glad, however, that i found out before Christmas morning that it doesn't come with any slides. Even though the price is good still without the slides, most people would assume it would come with a couple and the description isn't very clear that it doesn't, but all in all, A+++",
