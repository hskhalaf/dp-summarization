However, I placed a 24 ounce glass bottle of beverage in the cup holder and by the end of the first day the cup holder had cracked and was no longer usable. Not worth sending back and so I'll keep it. But you would think that the guy that created, patented, and clearly takes a lot of pride in his creation (check out the product website) would have spent a bit more time making sure that the cup holder wasn't such a worthless piece of junk.",

The slide away cup holder is ok, but does not have a lot of flexibility to hold something a little large. The folding mechanism to fold the table down works well and it is easy to fold it and put it away. My biggest complaint is this is not a very sturdy table",

The height is easily adjustable, as are the different angles you can set it at. It is not the most sturdy table out there, but for the price and how much we have used it during coronavirus lockdown, this is a good little purchase. And it folds flat for storage.",
