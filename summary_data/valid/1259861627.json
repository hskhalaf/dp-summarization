As a matter of fact after reading that book, I gave up the idea to write PMP exam, as it was giving me a headache!

ITTOs were mentioned throughout, but not to the extent I felt they should have been. Also, the Total Tester practice exam content isn\u2019t available on Macs, so I had to pay for a separate program (Pocket Prep, would recommend) in order to take full practice tests.
