But, as I said, I\u2019ve only used it a handful of times. The light should last longer than that. It was a great design.

      "text": "Loved this lap top desk! It is just the right size, and I love all of the pockets to put a pad or a cell phone! The pull out mouse pad is super handy as is the light. The only small thing I would suggest is that they had in either their description or instructions that there is a pocket for the light storage, and also that it has a zipper pocket that contains the battery to run the light. It was not hard to figure this out however, and it is really convenient to have the ability to detach the light and store it.. Great product!",

I haven't purchased the AA batteries needed for the light yet but I anticipate that it's a great addition for people that need it. I will say I'm in no rush for the batteries because I don't see myself using the lamp very often but it is a nice option to have. Super impressed with this and already emailed my co-workers to tell them they need to get one as well!",

Most laptop desks are cheap and uncomfortable, and the bottom cushioning breaks down easily (like the one I am currently using). This looks and feels solid - both on the top and the bottom. The only reason I did not give it 5-stars is that my daughter has not used it much yet (she leaves for college is a few weeks). I will update this review after she has had a chance to use it a while.",

The lapdesk itself is angled, so even when resting on a flat surface, it slides off. I've used it for a couple of days trying to make it work... it just won't.

      "text": "The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because when using the mouse pad feature the mouse slides off if using the desk at an angle. I really like that you can use the mouse pad on both the right and left hand sides, but it would be nice if it was adjustable to keep levl to prevent from sliding. Other than that, this lap desk is very comfortable to use.",

Not only is it a wonderfully perfect size--made of quality material-- a sown on handle for transporting--both a tablet and phone holder built ins-- extra surface space tucked away underneath the desktop---AND THE COOLEST PART... The portable light---which is discretely hidden out of the way for safe travels!! I love this lap desk!!",

I only mention it because it is noticeably heavier than the regular lap desk I already have.",
