We have ordered this product for the past 3 years and both dogs can't get enough of it. The picky eater has never gotten sick and continues to eat her dog food! They are both in great health and for the amount we order it lasts about 2 months. So it is perfect for using the Amazon Subscription.",

In addition, I give him raw chicken hearts (cringe) from whole foods to further supplement his taurine intake.",
