Seems sturdy and fit all kinds of shoes including: ankle boots, tennis shoes, flats, high heels, kids shoes, and high boots (folded over), etc... It worked perfectly for the space saver and organizer I was looking for. It did measure a few inches taller than measurements gave in description but still worked for us. The bottom isn't as sturdy as we would like but it does look like it will hold up as long as it doesn't have to much weight. Will definitely be buying more.",

Also, it CANNOT hold the weight of one pair of shoes (nevertheless 5 pairs per shelf as advertised) without sagging. Shoes such as heels fall over side ways because the shelf material sags. I will have to buy some thin wood composite pieces to place atop of each shelf so shoes can sit on shelf without falling over.",
