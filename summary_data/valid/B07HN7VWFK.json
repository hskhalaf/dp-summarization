Regardless, industrial vacuum seals deprive anything living in there of oxygen and not many things can live without oxygen including bed bugs and their eggs... so! Got it out of the bag and it was like a science experiment where I had a small thing that turned into a monster rapidly in my living room once air rushed back into it. Sleeps like a dream! Got the 10\u201d and I am not disappointed. It\u2019s slightly firm for the stomach sleepers but still cloudy enough for the back sleepers. Love this mattress",
