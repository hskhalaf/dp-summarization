I am a neutral pronator wiht a high arch, I don't need stability or motion control, i just need good cushion. The sole of these shoes is stiff, not bouncy at all. I've never had knee issues and in the 3 months i've been wearing these, i've developed persistent knee pain. I'm regretfully going to buy another pair even though i cannot afford to do so. i think these are bad for my health.",
