The colors are perfect -- rich red and pine green -- with traditional patterning. They look great hung up, and they have plenty of room for toys, candy, etc. If folk-classic is the look you're going for, these will do nicely.",

And clearly one of the best things about getting gifts in your stocking is being able to reach in and pull it out. Not recommended for young children.",
