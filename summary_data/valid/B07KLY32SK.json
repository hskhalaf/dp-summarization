Machining around the camera could have used a little more love as well as the elastic bands, but overall I\u2019m very happy with my purchase. The iPad feels more secured and I love the concept they created with the larger band being able to hold the case closed. The pocket at the front is also magnetic, however i don\u2019t suggest placing anything heavy. I do recommend purchasing a screen protector before putting your iPad in as a leather strap on the inside touches the screen.",

So good customer service and now works as advertised. Changing to 5 stars. the pencil sticks to the folio through a cut out but it's not big enough to charge it, which was whole reason I got it. Pretty annoying.",

For the price, you really csn\u2019t go wrong with this. Great protection for travel. Based upon the quality of this one, I just might purchase the very thin Smart Cover by the same company as well. The cost of both is 1/2 the price of one genuine Apple Smart Cover. I strongly suggest giving this one a try. There is one thing to note. If you are use to the trifold smart covers, that offer a typing angle. This case does not offer that option.",

The upright positions are good, just wish there was one more, but that is such a minor nitpick. Fantastic, and kudos to them on this new case!",

This case has a hard plastic where you mount your iPad, then is covered with premium leather. Best part is, it supports apple pencil 2 charging and has a pencil holder so you don't have to keep on charging your pencil on the side",
