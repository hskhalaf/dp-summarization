I treat it like gold, I won't share it either. It was such a great surprise to be able to have & actually enjoy a protein powder. No bloat or poor taste left over. I mix it with vanilla almond milk, Maca & pearl powder & it feels like I'm drinking a dessert instead of a meal. I'm always sad when I get to the last sip. I will tell everyone I know to purchase this as well. Thank you s much for making such a great tasting high quality product!!",

      "text": "Probably the most excellent source of supplemental protein out there. I am not a vegan, but that said, I am a puritan and the majority of my diet is vegetarian and organic. Although, when it comes to protein, I want the real deal. Not pea protein, not whey, and not any of the wacky soy based or synthesized proteins. I want real protein, with naturally occurring collagen, ATP (creatine), and amino acid complexes. Bone broth protein is about as good as it gets. And the fact that this company uses beef and not chicken makes them the elite supplement in my mind. Flavor and mix-ability are spot on too.",

I don\u2019t have the foam problem that others have mentioned but I don\u2019t add the powder till the very end of blending my smoothie (banana, almond butter, rice milk and protein powder).

The vanilla flavor masks the offensive bone broth down to where it is more of an undertone than an overwhelming \"taste\".

It blended well however after blending you have to let it sit for awhile because it froths up so much. It does warn you about that on the container so I didnt mind that part as much as the bad taste. Nothing masks that taste. If I ever bone broth protien again, I'd get a natural flavor and just drink it as bone broth or add it in my dinners and soups.",

Today I am going to add banana and avocado and see how that tastes. Overall I am very happy and will continue to buy the product.",
