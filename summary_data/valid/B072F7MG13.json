It's been too soon to determine how they will hold up or if they will rust until use at the lake and beach, and on the patio. I've put on in the kitchen, one on the patio and one in the truck. I'll probably get another one for the boat when I start using it again.

I rounded the edges and the ruff sides as well as the edges around the opener end and the circle on the other end. Made for a smoother feel and a more finished look. Then i wrapped them in paracord so they can be placed on the bar without clanking and are raised off the surface so they are much easier to pick up!",
