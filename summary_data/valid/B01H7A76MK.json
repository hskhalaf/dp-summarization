My only complaint is that the shoulders are too narrow for me. When I lean forward on my road bike, the sleeve seam is well above the edge of my shoulders and it hurts the aerodynamics a bit. I wish the shoulders were a bit wider as a guy who has 42\" shoulders and ordered a large. It's also stinking hard to get something that fits my waist, as I'm a 34\" waist. It is surprisingly long enough for me, despite my 6'4\" height with a disproportionately long torso.",
