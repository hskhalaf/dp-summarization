The side grips are not ergonomic, they don't make it easier to hit the buttons naturally. Moreover, the grip does not really fit on the switch in a way that stabilizes the system properly. The biggest problem that this creates is when you try to press down on the the upper left joy-stick, there is nothing pressing against the back of the system to support it so it won't press down without extreme effort.

I decided to try the Gripstand and even after a few hours, I didn't feel any discomfort. In fact, I feel like this is the most comfortable of the three. I think this the best grip case for smaller hands. The only thing I would change is adding a slight lip over the sides of the joycons so they can't lift towards you. I think this would keep them in the case more securely while still allowing them to slide up for removal (sort of like Satisfye grips).",

It worked quite well while it lasted which is why it still gets two stars, but moderate use after six months has rendered it broken. Disappointed, and not likely to purchase again.",

Also, the ergonomics feel weird: I have relatively small hands, but the finger placements for these are SUPER small, giving me the impression they were meant for children.

I had tried a couple other grips, but this seems to be the only one that is truly large enough. The only downside I find is that when it is clipped on to the Switch, it does allow a little bit of wiggle, so it doesn't feel truly solid.

If it helps, have the hand size of an adult woman, about 3 to 3.5 inches across horizontally. The grip is very comfortable. My husband thinks the grip is pretty good too, but prefers the larger daemon x machina joycons (both the different grip and button placement on those controllers.)",

Also, the grip isn't spaced properly, so you have to add some kind of material near the joycons, otherwise it will creak.
