As with all painting projects, you'll want to make sure that you're not painting in 20 degree weather -- we picked a particularly cold weekend for this project and it definitely took 3 coats even with heavy sanding. I do like to use the spray as a top coat of paint before you seal it - gives a really nice smooth finish. Would definitely order this paint again from Amazon - it came with special clamps on the top to ensure that the paint would not bust open in transit.",

It really goes far and now I have cute matching furniture pieces in my house. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anything that you want to wipe with water, though, unless you put a protective coat over top (my kids spilled water on their table and now it has stains in spots). One can covers a lot, and I highly recommend this paint!",

Then poly it with minwax till it is hard as nails. Extremely easy to work with, no odor and washes off skin, clothes etc. This is so much easier than paint and It went a long way. FYI: using the roller at the end gives it a smooth finish. This is the Linen White. A true white. Update: finished quickly and easily. Very pleased.",

I ended up needing 3 coats instead of 1 (you could still see the wood underneath after 1 coat) but it dries quickly so I was still able to get this done in a couple of days. The paint is thick and really easy to use. I just wanted a clean look which is why I used 3 coats, but I could see this being very easy to distress and to give an antique type look with less coats. Great product!",

It took me a time or 2 to figure out that the more you brush to smooth out, the more you'll have brush strokes(good or bad depending on look your going for) but nothing a chalk brush(worth it) and spray bottle of water can't fix! My only negative would be that it's sometimes hard to find more then 2 or 3 colors in stores! Luckily I can now buy on Amazon and get the next day!",
