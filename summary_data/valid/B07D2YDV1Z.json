I would not even recommend starting with only this set because you will learn some bad habits. Buy a GOOD diamond awl, and pricking punches are also cheap and much easier to use than the wheels once they are sharpened. The cutting mat is a cutting mat. The stitching pony is where this kit shines. Update. The screw holding the back of the mechanism stripped out and it wouldn't lock. I drilled through the block and replaced the screws with bolts, much better now.",
