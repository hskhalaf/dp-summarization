In the first one, she used her camera flash (my back towards the camera), and in the second photo (me facing forward), she had the flash off and used a flashlight pointed at the floor in front of me. 5 Stars for its super brightness! Good length for me, except the arms and chest are really tight. If you spend any time at the gym, this may be way too tight for you. Wish it was looser in the arms and chest area. -2 Stars for the fitment issue, but it's still a really good jacket for being out at night .",

The side pocket openings are a bit small, there are no inside pockets, and the front zipper is not a pocket, it's just for show. That said, the fabric is very reflective and reasonably waterproof. I just wish I'd bought a Medium!",
