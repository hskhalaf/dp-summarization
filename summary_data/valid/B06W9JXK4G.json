I know that I could count with an amazing performance, but the most important aspects that really surprise me were, heating and energy consumption. The processor is a lot colder that the last generation of AMD and even than many similar Intel processors, and spends in some cases half the energy that the old FX series.",

As a developer running lots of tasks locally, using docker etc, a higher thread count is ideal. I switched from Xeon to Ryzen and have noticed no difference in reliability and no issues with compatibility. The only thing around that's any better is Threadripper which is so much more money and is 2 of these stuck together and do you REALLY need THAT many threads?",

Second, I picked this because it's Passmark to cost ratio was fantastic. I paired it with an AS Rock Taichi board for an Unraid server build. Initially I had stability issues, but that was mostly fixed by changing the c state settings in the BIOS. Performance has been stellar. I have run a couple instances of Plex transcoding and a virtual machine with GPU passthrough with plenty left on the table. Stability issues are annoying, but I'd definitely buy again over other available products for another server build.",
