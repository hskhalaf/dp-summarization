Ultimately, they were not all very hard or very great quality but some were better than others. Given the number of puzzles included, it is well worth the cost. Fun will be had!",

    "description": "Edition:30 in 1This puzzle has a history of almost two thousand years. Are you ready to solve it? Disentangling those pieces without bending or cutting the wires to win the game. More pieces, higher difficulty. Do not miss it \n\nAbout the Product \nA disentanglement puzzle is a type of mechanical puzzle that involves disentangling one piece or set of pieces from another piece or set of pieces. The reverse problem of reassembling the puzzle can be as hard as\u2014or even harder than\u2014disentanglement. There are several different kinds of disentanglement puzzles, though a single puzzle may incorporate several of these features. \n\nPlate-and-ring puzzles \nA plate-and-ring puzzle usually consists of three pieces: \n*one plate or similar displaying many holes and/or indentations \n*a closed or nearly closed ring or a similar item. \n\nWire puzzles \nWire puzzles consist of two or more entangled pieces of more or less stiff wire. The pieces may or may not be closed loops. The closed pieces might be simple rings or have more complex shapes. Normally the puzzle must be solved by disentangling the two pieces without bending or cutting the wires. Early wire puzzles were made from horseshoes and similar material. \n\nWire-and-string puzzles \nWire-and-string puzzles usually consist of: \n*one piece of string, ribbon or similar, which may form a closed loop or which may have other pieces like balls fixed to its end. \n*one or several pieces of stiff wire \n*sometimes additional pieces like wooden ball through which the string is threaded. \nOne can distinguish three subgroups of wire-and-string puzzles: \n*Closed string subgroup \n*Unclosed loose string subgroup \n*Unclosed fixed string subgroup \n-by Wikipedia \n\nProduct Content \n1 x Set of products(including 30pcs) \n1 x Plastic box \n1 x Instruction",
