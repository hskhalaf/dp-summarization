      "text": "Love this little sewing machine! Back into sewing after a 30 year hiatus, I was looking for a simple machine to replace my old, heavy one. I first bought a lightweight Brother, but it made me want to throw it out the window. I love the smooth action, the small size, and ease of use. The tension was correct right out of the box, unlike the Brother machine, which I could never adjust correctly. There are only 6 stitches, but that is more than adequate for my needs. A truly great basic sewing machine.",

Plus, they've changed ever so slightly the size of the new bobbins so you have to buy all new ones. After all these years, and with competition from other brands, why on earth change from a visible drop-in bobbin to something requiring an engineering degree? I've had more trouble getting this machine to function without exhausting every dirty word I know. I would trash it & buy a decent machine if I trusted Singer again. DON'T BUY ONE!",

Needed something basic, easy to understand and get through some thick material like denim and canvas. Worked like a charm. Already came threaded out of the box. Did a couple test runs - good thing she did because there was some residual oil on the needle. Boom! Finished her heavy drapes in about 15 minutes. Also nice and light compared to what we replaced. We know next to nothing about sewing but if you need something basic this sure fits the bill.",

It was easy to set up and I found by watching youtube videos, it was easier to thread and use instead of the written instructions. After I do the masks I will attempt curtains. That was the reason I decided to order one but it seems like it was meant to be for the masks, which there are such a need for.",

Instructions are easy to follow ( I watched a little video before I even received the machine).

I would definitely recommend this machine for just a basic inexpensive machine. It would be great for a beginner too",

      "text": "I hate sewing however it may have been I never had the right machine until now. The machine is easy to tread and setup however I would recommend you going on YouTube to watch the videos on setup because the instructions included skip important steps and things you need to do to get your machine running right. After setup, it runs great. I would highly recommend to anyone trying to get into sewing.",

So, yesterday I used it for the first time. I watched a tutorial online, set it up and my first jeans project is done! The needle was sturdy enough to sew on thicker parts of the fabric. It was very gentle, not too loud, and the stitches are really pretty on my jeans. I'm ready for my second project!! Thank you! This machine is a must have!",

You do need a light touch on the foot pedal, so you will need to practice to get the hang of it. Drawbacks: the manual was on-line only, and the storage compartment is not easy to detach from the machine (I will just leave it off in the future). Also, the twin spools are not really useful, as there is no twin-needle accessory included or instructions for how it's used in the manual. Still, I am generally pleased with this purchase for simple sewing.",
