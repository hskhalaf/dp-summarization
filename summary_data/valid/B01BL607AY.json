      "verdict": "Ariat engineers have been taking strides in improving their hiking products over the years, and their advancements couldn\u2019t be more evident in the Terrain Pro. From its excessively comfortable build and eye-catching design to its satisfying fit and wallet-friendly price tag, this day hiking boot is clearly intent on making the competition have a good run for their money. That said, Ariat\u2019s baby is not the juggernaut it wants to be as it failed to power through the wall of criticism of those who wanted a lasting lockdown out of its laces. Overall, if people would just tie the boot\u2019s laces tighter\u2014or, perhaps, replace them with ideal ones altogether\u2014there would be no stopping the Ariat Terrain Pro from ending up on their feet and be perfectly happy about it.",
      "pros": [
        "The overall design of the Terrain Pro captivated the hearts of many",
        "A lot of purchasers flat-out praised this boot for its reasonable asking price",
        "The Ariat Terrain Pro had a level of comfort that amazed dozens of reviewers",
        "Some users were more than impressed with the boot\u2019s excellent fit",
        "Based on a handful of Terrain Pro reviews, this hiking footwear had a highly supportive ankle collar",
        "This boot effortlessly received 5-star ratings from several users for its towering durability",
        "Boot lovers by the handful concluded that this hiking gear had no break-in period",
        "According to a few Ariat loyalists, the Terrain Pro\u2019s traction was nothing short of brilliant whether over dry land or wet rocks"

      "cons": [
        "A very small percentage of users disliked the boot\u2019s laces for being too slick",
        "One particular wearer had to do a double knot just to achieve a more reassuring lockdown"

Well, I absolutely wasn't disappointed with these hiking boots. I think true to fit and very comfortable out of the box. I used these daily on a recent hunting trip in relatively rough and rocky terrain and remained very comfortable. I would totally recommend.",

Unfortunately these did not fit me (usually a women's size 10, ordered an 8...should have gotten an 8.5) they were just a tiny bit too small and rubber my toe and slid around on my heels. Maybe it's because I'm a woman and these are more fit for men's feet...I just couldn't deal with the choices of pink or purple cami for the women's Pro Terrains. Come on ariat, not every woman loves pink and purple! The color is true to the image, and these are great quality..I'd recommend ordering half a size up though.",
