Highly recommended at this price. Next size up is double the price for an extra 56gb. Typical Sandisk ultra speed, would not work so well in a go pro or a fast camera. Ideal for phones and tablets or even laptops with media or game storage.",

It very easily holds pictures, text documents, and even movies which play from the card with no problem at all.
