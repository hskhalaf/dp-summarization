I was using it with a couple of different apps but primarily notes plus and with it set to palm rejection/stylus mode, numerous times per sentence, the stylus would not register on the screen. I ended up sending it back and gave up on these expensive bluetooth styluses in favor of a basic rubber tip stylus (the Elago slim) which works perfectly and is super affordable and comes with an extra tip. I will say though that when the Adonit worked, it was really good but it was FAR too inconsistent for me to deal with on a daily basis.",

Adonit's website says the problem is with Apple's new thinner screen technology, and that they are working on a SDK to fix the issue.

I had great success with Noteshelf: no lag, accurate line placement, and perfect palm rejection. Penultimate and GoodNotes on the other hand, while ostensibly supporting the stylus had terrible issues with palm rejection and inaccuracy. If you want to use this stylus, make sure you use Noteshelf or Adobe Sketch/Line which work perfectly with it.",

The shape of this allows it to roll in your hand so the buttons get away from you. There was about a 1/8\" off set from where the tip really was and where your mark-line-drawing was. Left handed, so set software up for lefty palm rejection which sort of worked, sometimes. For a product at this price point I expect much better results then what I was able to get. Returned it and in the hunt something better.",
