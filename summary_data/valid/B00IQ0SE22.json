Paid authorized Onkyo servicer to look at they said it only needed firmware update. A few months later it started randomly shutting off again. It's going into protection mode, apparently there's a internal short somewhere. Some of the time. Once in a while I can get it to stay on. Lots of complaints on AVS Forum about this model just randomly going into protection mode (random shutoff). It's great when it works. But if you buy it, make sure it's still under warranty!",

PS, Onkyo's customer service was not much better. Now I have to ship it out of state for warranty repair at my own expense.

    "title": "Onkyo TX-NR636 7.2-Ch Dolby Atmos Ready Network A/V Receiver w/ HDMI 2.0",
    "description": "View larger BRING THE NEXT-GENERATION ENTERTAINMENT TO YOUR HOME\nThe TX-NR636 serves up revolutionary Dolby Atmos surround-sound complete with liquid 4K video at 60 frames per second. Dolby Atmos moves the sound around your theater more realistically to place you in the center of the action, creates a plane of sound over the listener\u2019s head, and more accurately locates surround effects mixed for discrete channels. This receiver has HDMI supporting 4K/60 Hz and 21:9 display format and HDCP 2.2 copy-protection compatibility. Qdeo upscaling technology also converts low-res DVDs and games into pin-sharp Full HD or 4K (if you have an Ultra HD display). TX-NR636 paves the way for Ultra HD video playback at a liquid-smooth 60 frames per second. This is great news for PC gamers who can now add wall-shaking surround sound to their 4K/60 Hz experience.\n\nUNSURPASSED BUILD QUALITY\nOnkyo\u2019s acclaimed WRAT (Wide Range Amplifier Technology), which provides the backbone that delivers Onkyo\u2019s classic sound, is coupled with Three-stage inverted Darlington Circuitry to the LCR channel to provide a big soundstage, superb timing, brilliant definition, and enough low-end grunt to make your speakers sing. With 165 Watts/Ch (6ohms 1kHz, 2 Channels Driven, FTC) the TX-NR636 packs a colossal punch for movies but still retains the pure musicality you need for two-channel playback.\n\nIT\u2019S GOT ALL THE CONNECTIONS\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi for universal hi-res streaming from PC, NAS, and smartphone is just the beginning. You can select from a wild variety of music streaming services and locate your network-attached libraries using the remote app, or stream almost any audio via built in Bluetooth. An HDMI/MHL terminal connects smartphones to display 1080p video with 7.1 channels of surround sound. Throw in a dedicated phono input, room equalization, and powered Zone 2 and you\u2019ve got a value-packed 7.2-channel powerhouse ready for the next wave of high-resolution entertainment.\n\n\nFirmware upgrade available now DOLBY ATMOS MULTIDIMENSIONAL SOUND\nOnkyo is among the first to introduce the exciting Dolby Atmos surround-sound format to home theater environments. Dolby Atmos uses object-oriented mixing to layer independent audio elements through discrete channels, moving three-dimensional sound effects around the theater with astonishing realism. The format adapts to any home theater layout incorporating height channels for a more enveloping soundfield with extremely accurate directional and overhead effects.\n\nHDMI 2.0 for UltraHDView larger SUPPORTING NEXT GENERATION HDMI 2.0 AND HDCP 2.2 COPY PROTECTION\nThe TX-NR636 is the first receiver to boast not only the latest HDMI connections supporting 4K/60Hz and 21:9 format but also the latest DMR copy protection compatibility, HDCP 2.2. By implementing the latest HDMI connections, supporting 4k/60Hz with HDCP 2.2, latest DRM content-protection method adopted for future premium 4K studio releases, 4K streaming via internet service providers, as well as for UHD terrestrial and satellite broadcasts, the TX-NR636 paves the way for Ultra HD video playback. Even if you\u2019re not planning on upgrading your current display right away, your Onkyo receiver is ready for the future of gaming and video entertainment.\n\nBuilt in WI-FI AND BLUETOOTH BUILT IN\nThe TX-NR636 has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies built in. No wires, no dongles, no mess. Complete the one-time Wi-Fi setup, download our free control app for iOs and Android devices, and you\u2019ve got a full range of remote control and audio streaming features in the palm of your hand. You can also pair your Bluetooth-capable device and stream direct to your home theater. With Advanced Music Optimizer DSP compensating for compression, music via Bluetooth has never sounded better.\n\nView larger BUILT-IN INTERNET RADIO AND STREAMING\nIf you can think of it, you\u2019ll most likely be able to stream it on your TX-NR636. The receiver comes loaded with Spotify, Pandora, SiriusXM Internet Radio, Rhapsody, AUPEO! and TuneIn, You can select a station and search for music available on these services via the free Onkyo app on your phone so you\u2019ll never be short of your favorite music to enjoy.\n\nCustom audio partsView larger HI-FI POWER AND FIDELITY\nWRAT (Wide Range Amplifier Technology) is all about current. Receivers need a lot of current to not only handle the sudden explosive actions scenes but also to reproduce the detail of quiet passages. We use a massive high-power transformer to drive discrete amps that help eliminate distortion and preserve the energy of music and movies. Delivering 165 watts per channel, the TX-NR636 packs a colossal punch for movies but still retains the pure musicality you need for two-channel playback. Also, Phase-Matching Bass Enhancement optimizes low frequencies while preserving mid- range clarity. It counters phase shifting by synchronizing the timing of different frequencies. The result is deep, well-defined bass that won\u2019t blur vocals or strings.\n\nEXCLUSIVE ACCUEQ ROOM CALIBRATION\nCalibrating the sound to suit your room\u2019s acoustics is simple with AccuEQ. Once you\u2019ve connected your speakers, plug-in the included mic and wait a few moments as the TX-NR636 measures things such as speaker distance, type, crossover, and output, taking into account any reflections from your walls and floor. The system is designed specifically to by-pass your front left and right speakers. The system then optimizes the frequency response of the remaining speakers so you can enjoy balanced surround sound regardless of room shape or furnishing while retaining the characteristics of your front left and right speakers for optimum enjoyment.",
