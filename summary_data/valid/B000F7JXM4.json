If you are processing large bundles of tomatoes, you might want something else that has a motor, or can easily handle larger quantities. But, for a typical batch of seven or so half pints, this is a very economical product that works well.",

The white plastic body is actually quite tough and we have had not cracks or chips after more than a month of daily use making meat and vegetable purees for baby food. There is a small card with a few rudimentary instructions, but no real manual. Assembly is easy if you remember that the screens must be installed concave side down. Also, we have found that it is helpful to give 3 or 4 turns in the normal direction, then half a turn in the \"wrong\" direction, to clear the screen.",
