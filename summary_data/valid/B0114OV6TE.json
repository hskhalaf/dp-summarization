I was not only shocked about how much lint the removable tray caught, but how clean (and new) my worst pieces looked. I ended up de-pilling every sweater & knit top in my closet just to see how powerful this little thing is --and it has not let me down. I also love that they included another blade and cleaning brush. I make sure to clean it after every single use to prolong its life.",

I had tried other products which worked marginally well. However, with the first use of this product, it worked without a hitch and actually filled up the collection container. The one potential \"negative\" is being restricted by the length of the cord. However, a \"pro\" would def be the fact that the machine uses electricity instead of battery power. This gives you the same strength and results from start to finish. It also worked equally well on wool sweaters as well.",

      "text": "I had a small sweater shaver a while ago and this was by and far a much better product. I had 3 sweaters that were just too covered with fuzz balls to save until I gave this product a shot. I now have three more sweaters that look great and are back in my closet. This saved a lot of money in a few minutes. Thanks. I love it!!",

      "text": "It takes a while to learn how to properly use this w/ heavy pilling. Basically you need to stretch your garment so it's very flat to get a really good shave and this can lead to holes if you aren't careful. Granted I used this for an hour or so here and there on the first go, but I wouldn't expect a product w/ a satisfaction guarantee to have a significant power loss after just a couple of hours of use. I was using the power cord, not the battery. Currently it functions w/ intermittent full power and decreased power. Disappointed.",

The fur balls are collected in a a front panel which was easy to remove, clean and pop back on. Highly recommend this product, well worth the price.",

Then, I spent about 30 minutes on my daughter's favorite hoody - again like new. Be aware, you really need a flat surface such as a counter or ironing board. It works better, won't take as long, and you'll have better results. Using an ironing board and situating the garment on the ironing board as if you were ironing it works best.",
