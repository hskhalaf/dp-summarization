Saw that the spikes were 3 inches in length but didn't check the diameter. It's really not enough to penetrate in order to aerate the lawn - especially, if hard clay. Recommend you purchase some 2x4's, cut them off to one foot, drive some 16 penny nails into them, and strap them to your feet with some bungee cords. You'll likely get the same outcome, if not better results.",
