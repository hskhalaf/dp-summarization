I have numerous waist trainers that I paid GOOD money for, the price for a product of this quality is absolutely crazy but WONDERFUL nonetheless....Thank you for a great product at a reasonable price",

I ended up wearing my old waist trainer around my lower half in an effort to work on the mothers-pouch.

I did buy my correct size, so it's just the model of it. It doesn't cover the top or bottom.

      "text": "I got this waist belt to help my rib cage back in shape post pregnancy. I also use it while I am cycling and doing Chloe Ting workout. It's only been a couple days, but so far so good! The Velcro is really strong, and there is a lot of flexibility in how tight or loose you would like to go. Cycling with the belt was great, because it helped me to keep a nice straight back. I even wear it when I am not working out, just to keep a nice posture and tighten my ribs&waist. Overall, good purchase!",

I probably could have gone to a large instead, but I don't like the look of a corset straining in the back and prefer it to be tied in a straight line without any gaps, so this was a perfect size for me. It was comfortable to wear all day long and very flattering. I would highly recommend - It was a perfect addition to my renaissance fair costume.",

It seems very sturdy and it is comfortable to wear but I do not recommend to women with a significant amount of lower belly fat because your lower belly fat will just hand and upper belly fat and extra skin will stick out too. If I had gotten a medium I would rate 5 stars",

I've had it for quite a while and it is still like new, so it is made very well! Highly recommend!",
