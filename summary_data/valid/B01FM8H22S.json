Initially (when this keyboard used to cost 50% more), I was concerned about the value, but after a couple years and many other chiclet style keyboards purchased on the side, I can say it's totally worth it. The frame, the buttons, the functionality. All premium. The key feel is perfect. The buttons don't wobble at all and there's a very nice affirmative \"give\" once you reach the right pressure. The keys also seem to be coated to give a bit more grip as it's definitely an upgrade over some basic keys that can get slippery.",

      "text": "I'm a PC Tech for a medium sized organization. Wireless keyboard/mouse combos used to be large and noisy. Dell is an expert on ergonomics and this keyboard demonstrates good design. The keyboard doesn't waste extra space and add useless keys like other keyboard/mouse combos. It takes up little space and works well. Hey everyone, keyboards are supposed to make noise when you tap them! It's called tactile feedback. If it made no noise you wouldn't know that you typed. Our staff write thousands of emails, and reams of documentation every year, and I've only replaced two in heavy use environments. For the price these keyboards are a real bargain. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Mouse and keypad work great BUT......you have to look very closely to find the Universal receiver (USB) that makes them work. You would think it would be included in the small package where you find the batteries but instead it is attached to the cardboard insert in a small flap on the right side of the box! It is very small and easily overlooked!!!! Dell needs to change their packaging on this. If you accidentally throw the receiver away, you may as well throw both the keyboard and mouse out. I've been told be reliable techy folks that each receiver is specifically programmed to the mouse and keyboard in the package.",

Dont waste your time buying the bundle. Just buy the keyboard itself (WK717). The mouse, although very sleek design, the tracking is mediocre. Because the sensor is located at the front of the mouse instead of the middle. Cursor tends to jump around sometimes. Not smooth.",

I initially had the same issue many other reviewers had reported... jerky movement with the mouse, and missing letters while typing followed by repeated letters... one keystroke of \"g\" would display diddly, then \"ggggggg\" after a delay. However, this problem was easily corrected by moving the dongle from the usb port on the far side of my laptop to the near side... and voila, worked perfectly. The \"workable\" distance is short, in my opinion... mouse to dongle distance of > 24\" created problems; within 12\" and my problems disappeared. Other than the above \"feature\" I think the build quality and usability are excellent for this $20 product.",
