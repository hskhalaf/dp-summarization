      "text": "Purchased the camera for my wife, who was going to Thailand on a University trip. She came back with 500+ photos, taken in all kind of light conditions. All except two or three were in sharp focus, and the best of the lot are good enough to put on the wall. She had to recharge the battery once a week, she says. We uploaded her photos to our computers, no problem. I would recommend this for any casual photographer, including the one that is technically challenged.",

This is the fourth PowerShot I have owned and it has the highest photo quality. I especially like the image stabilization and the face selector! These help make sure the pictures come out in focus and everyone's eyes are open! There is a slight delay after you take the photo while it processes. I cannot find anything wrong with it other than that. This camera is an unbelievable value for the low price. If you care about your pictures then you owe it to yourself to put down the smartphone and use a real camera like this.",

This camera's picture quality was so bad that I returned it and purchased a 300HS. 300HS has excellent picture quality and great video and features. I have several cameras and the small one is used for travel/small events. The 300HS is well worth the money compared to this camera. This camera takes pictures that are barely in focus, colors are terrible no matter how close you are to your subject. I am a huge fan of Canon, have a 30D and now the 300HS. This one simply falls far short of delivering quality pictures at any price.",

Not only did I have to purchase a more expensive one (and now have to use a converter every time I charge it) but I also had the blessing of carrying around the camera as a dead weight (boo!) Thanking my lucky stars for Amazon's fantastic customer service policy, though!",

Another minor problem with the video is that the zoom is digital and when you use it the picture's quality goes down. Overall, this is not the best camera for you if you want a camera which has better quality than the average mobile phone camera.",

I should have taken more time prior to the trip to get to know more about it. I took over 464 pictures. I was surprised that the battery needed to be charged more often than I had expected. Luckily I took the charger and the converter with me",

    "description": "Canon PowerShot A3000 IS Point & Shoot Digital Camera - 10 Megapixel - 2.70\" Active Matrix TFT Color LCD - Silver 4254B001 Digital Cameras.This item comes with a battery and a charger\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n There's nothing more satisfying than taking great pictures! And with the sleek and silver Canon PowerShot A3000 IS, it's so effortless. The 10.0-megapixel resolution and 4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer ensure radiant, detailed images. Plus, you've got an advanced DIGIC III Image Processor with evolved Face Detection Technology and the Face Detection Self-Timer for extraordinary control and performance. Smart AUTO lets you handle challenging conditions with ease. \n\n\n\n10.0-megapixel resolution Canon PowerShot A3000 IS Highlights \n\nPowerful A-Series camera with 10.0 megapixels, 4x optical zoom and Optical Image Stabilizer\nWith the PowerShot A3000 IS, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 10.0 Megapixel digital camera lets you create impressive large photos of family and friends you'll be proud to display. The high-resolution images taken by the PowerShot A3000 IS can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches. \n\nThe PowerShot A3000 IS has a 4x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a shot of a sweeping landscape, or a child's big smile. \n\nThe PowerShot A3000 IS is also equipped with Canon's acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nLithium-ion battery\nThe Canon PowerShot A3000 IS uses a newly developed rechargeable lithium-ion battery. This compact, powerful battery helps make it an incredibly lightweight and slim camera. Charge-up is quick and easy, so the PowerShot A3000 IS will be ready and waiting for those special moments. \n\nNew Scene Modes deliver more creative freedom\nThe Canon PowerShot A3000 IS gives you even more creative freedom by including new modes made to get the kind of images people talk about. Super Vivid captures the colors you see with your mind's eye, saturating the scene with intense colors. Turn drab scenes into exciting compositions, when dull pinks blaze into brilliant fuchsia and off-yellows suddenly burn bright and hot. Even dark colors become richer with Super Vivid. Sunsets and floral scenes turn into bursts of color, and get your photo noticed. \n\nPoster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations of color into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts across your image for a unique artistic look. \n\n18 Shooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 18 Shooting Modes including Scene Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nSmart AUTO will do the work for you by intelligently selecting the proper settings\nLow Light mode in action Just set the Canon PowerShot A3000 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nLow Light mode for improved shooting in dim lighting\nWith an ISO of 500-3200, the Low Light mode takes the Canon PowerShot A3000 IS where no A-Series has gone before--into the shadows! Now even scenes notorious for having insufficient light, such as those lit by candles, fire, or street lamp, come through in fantastic color and clarity, with less noise. You can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light, so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy, depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera. \n\nLarge, bright 2.7-inch LCD\nThe PowerShot A3000 IS's large 2.7-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear and bright picture. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light.",
