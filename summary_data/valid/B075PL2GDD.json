Oh boy, does it have a good sucker. I have hardwood floors and bought an extra brushy floor attachment, the best part is the heads can flex around corners so I can easily pick up the hose and put it anywhere! The old vacuum I'd have to switch between floor & hose mode constantly, this way I can just get everything at once! The best part? It's small, easy to clean, and it has a retractable cord.

This should clearly be advertised as a vacuum for bare floors. It is too much of a hassle to ship it back at this point. So, I'm setting it out by the dumpster for someone to take...if they wanted.",

If you prefer vacuuming standing straight up and can spend more, consider another vacuum, but for the price this little machine gets the job done.

It's small and light, so I could have just stayed with the one, but having a second is really convenient. These work great on bare floors, but also clean carpets better than uprights. For carpets, you have to pull it towards you because it's really hard to push against the carpet. The wand pieces don't interlock, so they can slip apart. You have to really push them together to get them to stay connected. Very easy to empty the canister. The canister also comes apart so it can be easily washed when needed.",

The other thing I noted was a few people complaining that it tended to lose suction. Might help if you actually clean the filters out, and I mean removing them and washing them out.

      "text": "What can I say, best spent money in a long time! It does feel a little plasticy, but the suction and how easy it is to maneuver and clean easily overcompensates the plasticy feel of it. Absolutely fenomenal om hardwood floor. I was loosing my mind with those stupid vacuums that has the brushes in the nossle, big and klunky and so inconvenient.. This one is light and easy even when doing stairs with carpet. The only negative I can say is that the cable is quite short and if you dont have many outlets you may need an extension cord but that's the only negative thing I will say about the little beast!",

The container is easy to empty. It helps me manage the hardwood floors and I can simply suck everything up instead of sweeping corners and under furniture.",

My old vacuum left me in pain and \u201cdone\u201d for the day. Only complaint is that the part you push on the ground does not have wheels, it just slides...which works wonders on my wood floors and base boards but doesn\u2019t move to easily over my rugs. That being said, it does work well on rugs, just a little hard to maneuver on carpeted areas.",

Old button was large and easy to push while you were carrying the vacuum and motor would go crashing to the floor - not good. New button is placed so this is much harder to accidentally do this.
