REMOVE THIS PIECE and throw it away to avoid that happening. The lamp is fine without it. Otherwise if it gets hot enough as mine did, the plastic will char and do a slow burn, and either start a fire or - if you're lucky - slowly burn out and just make a mess.

But shouldn't the manufacturer know better to begin with. If you buy this, be prepared to make some safety modifications and you'll still have a nice lamp. I guess you get what you pay for. Maybe they should lower the price for this cheap shade material.",

Likewise the plastic, make-believe mica has also warped. This lamp is simply cheap junk that looks okay from a distance but does not perform well or hold up.",
