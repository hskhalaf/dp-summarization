I wore these under my duty pants throughout the winter, standing outside for hours at a time moving traffic along. Between the cold temp and blistering wind my legs never became cold because of the spun cotton and merino wool. I wore these till it wore thin around the legs where the pants rubbed. Glad I found these here. I purchased 2 this time. Definitely worth the money if you are outside in the dead of winter overnight.",

I wash them inside out in hot water and dry hot; their shrinkage is minimal, as is the pilling effect of the fabric. I have been wearing these now for two years, first in freezing Minnesota and now in the cold and damp of maritime Washington state; and I can't recommend them enough. Reasonable price, high efficiency and easy care. Who could ask for more?",
