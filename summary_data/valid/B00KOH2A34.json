After just a week of using the tails properly according to recommendations, one of the tails got small holes in the fabric. After just a month, one of the inserts cracked while my daughter was swimming. The inserts that came with the fins are not made from very durable material. Fin Fun folks replaced both inserts but we had to pay for shipping.",
