What I did not understand is that this lamp only came with one bulb, which is used for Heat and Light Therapy. Is that correct? Other suppliers use a bright light for Light Therapy. I wish that it was clear there would only be (1) bulb sent and it does or doesn't provide for the bright light (Light Therapy). If it does not provide for both than I think it is too expensive for only the red bulb. I think it is positive that it does come with a 6 month guarantee, which is why I also chose it.",
