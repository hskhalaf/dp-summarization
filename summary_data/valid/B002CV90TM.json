I now leave it on my counter ready for the next bottle of wine as I prepare dinner. The aerating is essential to allowing the wine to BREATH and helps to remove any sediments! Highly, Highly recommend this product for its quality and its price point too which is an added bonus!!!!",

It would be GREAT if it had come with a cork or something from the same material to put it on once you are not pouring any more wine. But, maybe the answer is: \"do not ever leave wine in the decanter, drink it ALL\". The taste of the wine changes a bit, for better. So it serves it's purpose. I do believe that is best to pour it through the aerator, and leave it there for a little while to get the most of it, before serving. I am happy with it, overall",

I would recommend a second filtration for older wines as there is still some sediment after a single filtration, although a careful pour will leave most of it in the decanter.",

Aerator doesn't filter wine through the bottom, but through tiny holes on the sides of the stem. This leaves a lot of wine in the aerator itself, as others have commented (I wish I had fully read these reviews before purchasing!). Terrible quality. Not worth the $27 I paid on Black Friday.",

It's also puts on a bit of a show for guests, as the wine trickles down the side of the decanter. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a cleaning stand and is a bit of a pain to clean but I would highly recommend this product to any wine enthusiast.",
