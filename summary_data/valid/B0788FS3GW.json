Wish they would offer a power handle on this model like they do on the larger versions of this same reel line. These reels come with clickers for guys who bait fish. Just push the thumb release and turn on the clicker. When you hear the clicker indicating that a fish is on just turn the handle to engage the reel.",

These baits are anywhere from 1.5-4 ounces so I needed a reel that could handle the stress of throwing large baits over and over. I made a great decision getting this Chaos. Oversized gearing and slow gear ratio makes chucking and winding big baits a breeze all day long. Also been a great reel to use for catfish and dead baits!",

I will be using this reel for Kokanee fishing and have it paired up to a blue rod with blue mono and it looks really sharp. If the drag works as well as the reel looks, it will be one of my favorites. Excellent value. UPDATE: Paired it with a Blue Velocity rod for Kokanee and it not only looks great, it worked flawlessly. Caught at least 10 kokanee and a 24 inch Lake trout on it and it performed without a hiccup. Drag is smooth and like the micro adjustments for line release. Excellent reel and will buy more.",

I could look passed the \"clicking\" tension knob that barely lets you know it's clicking with the moving numbered guide behind it. But the thumb bar locked up, then bent (internally) leaving the casting and retrieve toggle unusable. It looks like where the thumb bar fits into is broken or stripped, so I'm not sure if even trying to bend it back would work. But I shouldn't even have to be trying to fix this anyway.",

Piscifun products are very cheap, & with that, you pay for what you get. I would strongly recommend that anyone thinking of trying Piscifun not do so & spend their money on a tried & tasted company.
