This tent is great to sleep in without the rain cover and just sleep under the stars. It is extremely easy to put together and take apart and super durable. I couldn\u2019t have made a better choice. I literally sent another tent back and ordered this last minute.",

I set this tent up in less than 5 minutes (including the rain fly). It looks to be pretty durable and high quality. After setting it up in my backyard, I kept it up for a few days, where it went through a pretty significant rain storm; the inside of the tent was dry the next morning. I'm going to take this tent on a few long, AT section hikes, so I may adjust this review based how it performs once I'm out on the trail.",

The zipper seems of decent quality and the polls look as good as those that came with my bigger tent. It's relatively light and could be carried while backpacking with no problem. Rain flap and rope included. TNH makes some nice affordable products and I am proud to add this tent to my \"collection.\"",

With tent and rainfly the TNH weighs in at 63.6oz (Marmot is 87.5oz). The stakes and guylines add 7.4oz (not included w the Marmot). The TNH is slightly smaller (comfort for 1 adult or 1 adult and 1 child), and feels like it is less reinforced (e.g. slightly less rain protection, thinner stitching, lighter duty zippers, etc), but ultimately I think it will hold up fine. The TNH will be my choice for 1-man backpacking trip in fair weather. I'll use the Marmot if I expect more room is needed or worse weather is likely.",

All of the seams were taped and the material is high quality (210T Polyester (Tent fly and sides), 210D Oxford Material (Tent Floor), 5000mm waterproofing, 7075 aluminium poles). It weighed in a little above 4lbs and packed down pretty tight. I am looking forward to taking the tent in the white mountains when the weather warms up a bit. I have several other TNH products and have been very happy with the company. The deliver good gear at an affordable price.",

I also love that it is a single pole system - no sorting through multiple poles of various lengths to figure out where they all go. There was one spot on the door where the zipper got stuck a little, but after trimming the threads that were causing the problem, it seems to be better now. I have been very impressed with everything TNH puts out. So far I have 2 hammocks, 2 camping pillows, 3 sleeping mats, and now this tent. Their products are great and, for the price, they can't be beat!",

The pole for the tent is a single long pole that snaps together seamlessly (you literally have a hard time knowing where it snaps together). I will say the one downside is that there is no footprint for the tent, but I'm sure TNH will release one soon. When they do, I'm definitely getting it, too.",
