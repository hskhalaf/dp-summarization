The big letdown was the durability of the plastic band. I'm babying all of my electronic equipment, but those got extra care since they are dazzling! The thing is that after a couple of weeks the side of the headband, which stretches a bit in order to fit them on your head, started to show cracks on the paint.That messes with the amazing appearance of the headphones, so I'm pretty disappointed in a big brand as Monster!",

Honestly the beats by studio (1st gen) give you more of a thump than these. Keep in mind that the two cords that it comes with are going to give you two different sound qualities. The remote talk cord is a joke. The Dj cord is the best but you need a good enough output (macbook pro) to actually get the full potential out of these.",
