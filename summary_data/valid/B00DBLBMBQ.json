      "text": "While I understand the complaints some have of the game being short and it not being open world, I sincerely appreciated the beauty of the atmosphere and the story. Its a gorgeous game and being a fan of steampunk and the Victorian London era, I absolutely loved the game. The story is so well executed and the voice acting is one of my favorites, standing right alongside the acting in The Last of Us. If you're looking for a shooter game with constant obstacles, then this is not the game for you but if you would like to enjoy a well thought out story with believable characters than I highly recommend The Order 1886.",

While the actual gameplay is very well done, feeling just hefty-enough, while not feeling too sluggish, there's a lot of surprisingly unpolished cut-scene in this game. Maybe it's worth it if you're really deep into steampunk, but other than that you'd probably give this one a miss.",

Great voice acting and sound wrap around a low budget and paper thin story. Somewhat inventive weapons fall pray to a dull cover shooter, making using them boring. Plus! Stupid QTEs all the time! Awful stealth segments! Unfinished story! Incredibly short! No replay value! I don't like giving 1 or 5 stars unless they're deserved and while this game is not truly bad, it only receives a second star because I played it to completion.",

Shooting works like an Uncharted game/most 3rd person shooters. The story kept me engaged the whole time I played. The beginning might be a little slow, but didn't bother me. And yea, the current price when I bought this on Amazon was 39.99. At this price I say buy it.",

Or should I say try to feel like uncharted. The fights are similar to uncharted and the controls are also.

The ancient lycan/vampiric lore is intriguing and ambitious as well. Too bad I beat it in 2 days. Anyone who is on the fence about this game, it is worth playing, but not for $60. Don't make the mistake I did and wait for that $20 price tag.",

      "text": "JACK THE RIPPER MEETS DRACULA MIXED WITH SPLINTER CELL!!! I love this game. I was a little hesitant from reviews, but.. This game has amazing graphics and a splinter cell/ gears of war type shooting platform. It is easy to get used to. This game is the must have for the gamer that is sick of the futuristic lights and fluff b.s. that Advanced Warfighter and Halo brought to gaming. The shots to body part reaction is great and fatal shot areas of the body are weighed in. This game is Dark, Cinematic, and well written if you like Bramstockers meets Jack the Ripper.",

I want to finish my games in a decent amount of time, not play for 100 hrs to be able to see the story end. Having said that, I think this game is a wasted opportunity and half baked. The cinematics are amazing but the game play could have been way more rich. I just wonder how this game would be with the Tomb Raider gameplay...? it would have been a master piece. Hopefully there's going to be a 2 installment.",

If a sequel ever comes out, please consider giving the player some freedom. Simple things like open environments, multiple ways to approach an objective, and the ability to use all of the weapons you collect would go a long way towards making an engaging experience. Please trust me to operate your game without hand holding and strenuous restrictions. Also if you're going to do a movie-driven game, get better writers and don't end it on a cliff hanger.",
