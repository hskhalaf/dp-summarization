This was the cheapest, fairly modern Office product I could find for Mac. Overall, a good buy. Only other complaint is that 64-bit versions of Office weren't available until 2010/2011, I think, so if you're doing large Excel computations that require a lot of memory resources, you might need to go with a later, 64-bit edition of Office for Mac.",

The cost difference between 2008 and the most recent 2011 is substantial, so I decided to take a risk. I have used Word and Excel regularly, and have had no problems. I have opened a powerpoint presentation and made a change once, but had no problems with that either. Highly recommend this to those who just shelled out $1200 for a new laptop, but don't want to fork over another $100 for Office.",
