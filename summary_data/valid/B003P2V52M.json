I couldn't be happier, all of the input and output option are there to play with as you see fit. The sound stage, especially with the front presences hooked up, is fantastic, clear, crisp, and incredibly wide. Initial impressions were neutral, due to the limitations in my original system, but the more i've added to the setup, the more I've found the 667 can handle anything I want it to. Very impressed.",

Amazing sound. Only thing missing from this unit is a built-in PC-VGA input. I can deal with that.",

Also, if I go from CD/DVD player to TV viewing, I have to turn the receiver off and on again for the speakers to work. Not sure if it is the way I hooked it up (doubt it)or just the receiver itself.

Yamaha CINEMA DSP is much more advanced, actually creating richly realized independent sound fields that envelop you in an unmatched surround sound experience. With dialogue, music and effects from ideally located in these separate sound fields, you will hear sound with accurate placement, smooth movement, exceptional clarity and richness, and startlingly realistic presence. \n\n\nHear large-scale sound through\nheadphones with SILENT CINEMA SILENT CINEMA and Virtual CINEMA DSP\nSILENT CINEMA makes it possible to hear large-scale surround sound through ordinary headphones. This variation of CINEMA DSP technology lets you listen in private to movies and other multi-channel sources for hours without listening fatigue.

It can be used with the front / center / presence speakers or even with just the two front left and right speakers. \n\n\nSCENE buttons automatically launch an operation \nthat will play the source controlled by that button \nYPAO uses this microphone to analyze room acoustics and\nautomatically set the best sound for any room SCENE Buttons for Quick Control of Your Home Theater\nFour SCENE buttons make operating the receiver easier than ever.

Browsing and selecting the settings is quickly accomplished by changing Input via the front panel and watching the on-screen display. The settings can be selected for one-time use, or they can replace the original default settings. The SCENE names can be changed also. \n\nAutomatic Speaker Setup and Calibration with YPAO\nYamaha\ufffds YPAO system uses a small microphone and sophisticated equalization to automatically set the best sound for any room, no matter where the speakers are. First it checks the speaker connections and phase of each speaker. Then it sends out tones which are captured by the microphone to analyze the room acoustics and sets a variety of parameters, such as the speaker size, the distance of the speakers and even the sound pressure level, until it achieves the best sound conditions for your room. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n>  The Yamaha RX-V667 Receiver Unit YPAO Microphone Radio Antennas for AM/FM Preset Remote Unit \nOptional Accessories for Added Connectivity (Sold Seperately)\n>  Yamaha YDS-12 Universal Dock for iPod and iPhone--The optional YDS-12 Universal Dock lets you connect your iPod or iPhone to compatible Yamaha receivers.
