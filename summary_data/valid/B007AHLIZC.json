The non-stick is great. I only sprayed oil on the first waffle and the following did not stick. Easy to clean plates. Love that they come off. Wish this waffle maker would have a beep alert for ready but it only has a ready light. Also doesn\u2019t have automatic shut off. However, I did leave the waffle in about a minute past ready indicator and the waffle was still good. So far I am happy. Will update post if any of the negatives occur.",

It\u2019s nice that the plates come out, but there\u2019s an area in the back that holds dried batter and cooking spray hostage. It doesn\u2019t respond to any sort of negotiation attempts.

I had no problem with the waffle sticking to the grills. I used Krusteaz pancake mix and followed the recipe on the bag. I set the waffle maker to 1 1/2 and when the ready light was green, poured almost 1 cup of batter. 5 minutes later, we had beautiful waffles. One recipe made 4 whole waffles. Very happy with it!",

Why, oh why, would you ever manufacture a waffle maker without removable plates. It's just stupid. That aside, the con to this thing is once it's on, it never stops heating up. It doesn't run up to a temperature and then shut itself off to avoid burning itself out, this thing will gladly run and run and smoke off the whole non-stick coating if you let it. It'd be better if there was a safety thermal switch in the device. Other than that, I don't believe you'll be disappointed.",

      "text": "I'd been wanting a waffle iron for years. We had a few similar to this in my college dorm. When I saw this for 50% off during black Friday, I HAD to have it. I have since gained about 10-15lbs because waffles are delicious. In more seriousness, this is great. If you can find a good malt that doesn't have excess sugar, you can try a few interesting things with it. I like using waffles to make things like sandwiches because they're really crisp flavor prisons. So you don't always have to slather it in syrup - you can add in some meats, some vegetables, and call it a party.",

My advice is as follows: If you like waffles less crispy turn the setting to low and take them out as soon as you notice the steam almost gone. I was able to achieve soft done waffles. If you like them crispy then leave them in until the \"ready\" button appears. Very light weight, easy to store and appears well made.",

    "title": "Hamilton Beach Flip Belgian Waffle Maker with Non-Stick Removable Plates, Browning Control, Drip Tray, Stainless Steel (26030)",
    "description": "Style:Non-Stick Removable Plates\n\nHAMILTON BEACH FLIP BELGIAN WAFFLE MAKER 26030\nImagine tasting fluffy, Belgian-style waffles for breakfast every morning.

Make your waffle just the way you want it \u2013 lighter or darker \u2013 in just minutes.

Even better, the nonstick grids are removable to go in the dishwasher for easy cleanup afterwards.\n\nFLIPS WAFFLES LIKE THE RESTAURANTS PROS\nWith a little flick of the wrist, The Hamilton Beach Flip Belgian Waffle Maker lets you effortlessly bake, make and flip perfect waffles just like a gourmet restaurant chef. Best of all, the adjustable browning control makes waffles golden brown and crispy on the outside and meltingly tender on the inside. To cook waffles like the best restaurants do, simply preheat the waffle maker until the READY light comes on. Then, pour in waffle batter and flip to lock in place. Waffles are done in 5-8 minutes, depending on the setting and the recipe. Using an oven mitt, flip the waffle maker back and open the cover to a perfect waffle. \n\nMAKES DELICIOUS WAFFLES 12 DIFFERENT WAYS\nIf you're craving the sweet and mouthwatering taste of a waffle, but can't decide the flavor or ingredients, you're in good company. The Hamilton Beach Flip Belgian Waffle Maker fits you like a glove. Its deep-grooved waffle grid design is built to handle any type of batter you pour in. Simply choose your recipe and it will handle the rest \u2013 effortless flipping, fast, even cooking and browning control. \n\nPRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS\n 1. Flips easily for thick, fluffy waffles \n 2. Cool-touch, easy-flip handle folds for easy storage\n 3. Brushed stainless steel exterior housing ensures long-lasting durability\n 4. Advanced heating technology ensures consistent baking and browning\n 5. Nonstick finish allows effortless release and trouble-free cleanup \n 6. Removable grids & drip tray are dishwasher safe\n 7. Drip tray catches excess batter \n 8. Browning control \n 9. ON and READY lights indicate when power is on and when to add batter\n\nBREAKFAST TREND ON THE RISE\nBreakfast isn't called the most important meal of the day without good cause. Jumpstarting your day with a nutritious breakfast has shown to improve mental performance, give you energy and healthy carbohydrates, and help reduce mindless snacking. What's more, where breakfast is prepared and bought has changed over the years. Instead of traditional breakfast meals and times anymore, consumers are now having breakfast at all times of the day, reinterpreting breakfast foods in creative ways and cooking at home. \n\nSIMPLE CLEANUP\nThe removable waffle grids are dishwasher safe. To clean the drip tray, rinse off excess overflowed batter with hot water. For easy cleanup and storage, wipe down the exterior with a damp, soapy cloth and fold the handle. Do not use steel wool, scouring pads, abrasive cleansers or sharp or pointed objects on any part, as this will tarnish the steel exterior. \n\n COOKING TIPS \nBefore pouring batter into grids, always spray them with a small amount of nonstick cooking spray. Waffle color and crispiness are determined by the temperature of the grids, so the higher the temperature, the browner and crisper the waffle. If the cover of the waffle maker doesn't lift up easily, let your waffle cook a little longer before lifting the lid again. To store waffles for later reheating, pack in airtight container and keep in the refrigerator or freezer. \n\nMIX IN YOUR FAVORITE TOPPINGS & SPICES \nDon't care for plain waffles or need a snazzy new breakfast recipe? Tasting is believing with Hamilton Beach. To mix things up, reduce the amount of batter that you're using and stir one of these sweet treats into the batter before cooking: \n\n * Chocolate\n * Maple syrup\n * Cinnamon sugar\n * Fresh or dried fruit\n * Pecans or walnuts\n\nTIP: If using nuts in waffle batter, use chopped nuts and/or evenly spread batter to allow lid to fully close. \n\nDo not let cord hang over edge of table or counter or touch hot surfaces, including the stove.",
