To my surprise, the Powerbuilt Jack could only jack up my car for a few inches (less than 5 inches) because the hydraulic jack could not hold up pressure. When I reached out for the instruction booklet, I found that the box was filled with oil (see photo). It is a clear indication that the product was shipped with a leaked hydraulic jack. I am disappointed and expect the product to last at least one emergency use.",

It also solves for a conundrum we all face when working without a full lift: how to raise the vehicle and safely set it on a jackstand so you can work under it. Do you lift from a less ideal point so your jackstand is at the manufacturer recommended contact point? Or do you lift there and set the jackstand elsewhere? This lifts and supports the vehicle with a jackstand right where the manufacturer intended. That all said, I got two good copies. I recommend reading the other reviews here as well.",

It's annoying to lift a truck and it doesn't come down! One thing I would like better is if this jack had a rotating pump, rather than an up and down pump lift. The jack that came in my pickup has a rotating long handle which is much easier.",

When lowering the jack, like most Jack's, you release the hydraulic pressure with a twist but this jack in particular will not decompress unless there is significant weight on it. The only way I can get it to go down after loosening the pressure is to step on it with all 260 lbs of me. I hope that if he ever has to use it that it doesn't get stuck under the frame.",

Bottle jacks are more complex machines than scissor lifts, and while that complexity generally yields greater capacity and efficiency, it also yields more points of possible breakage (namely, those pesky seals).

My complaint is lowering the bottle jack. Without weight of a vehicle, it requires quite a bit of strength to lower.",

Note: The automatic locking feature of the stand works well once some of the paint at the friction-points wears. The jack and stand are now consistently working together exactly as described by Powerbuilt. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. This jack stand was a bargain, and I feel safe using it.",

You really have to push down the post to get it to descend when turning the release valve. That makes it a bit safer, actually. One functional disappointment: It is advertised to be lockable so you can work without adding a stand. However, you usually end up jacking something to a specific height for your repair, and it never is where any of the the locking notches are located. Not a huge problem, just a let down.",
