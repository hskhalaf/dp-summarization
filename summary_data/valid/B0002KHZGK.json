When attempting to use the printer the ink did not distribute like it should on photo paper. Could that be because the ink cartridge expired 09-2006?! So that means this printer sat around for 14 years! I would expect a new product when ordering it now and not something that is 14 years old! Couldn't call Amazon fast enough to request a return and refund!",

Epson support was very helpful but they do not deal with 3rd party and had to return the printer. Amazon honored the return. Have always been happy with EEpson, therefore I will purchase another model.",

With its simple one-touch printing, 5,760 x 1,440 maximum dpi resolution, and convenient PictureMate Print Packs, this printer is a remarkable combination of quality, ease of use, and affordability. \n\nWide Compatibility\nSlots for digital camera memory cards in several formats  The PictureMate prints JPEG or TIFF photos from any USB digital camera and is compatible with both Mac and PC operating platforms. A wide variety of card types are also accepted, including CF Type I and II, SmartMedia, Sony Memory Stick/MemoryStick PRO, Duo (requires adapter), SD, MMC, and xD-Picture. \n\n The printer initially comes with a starter photo cartridge and 20 sheets of paper. Thereafter, you'll purchase PictureMate Print Packs, which contain 100 sheets of paper and a photo ink cartridge with an approximate 100-page yield. \n\n \n\nPrints That Last and Stay Beautiful\nOriginal print (left), then a spill-and-wipe test on leading glossy and semi-gloss papers (two middle) and on PictureMate (right)  The prints resist water, smudging, and most notably fading. Epson estimates an archival lifetime of up to 200 years if the photos are kept in a relatively dark place (such as a photo album) or up to 100 years in a frame (see Epson's web site for details). True borderless printing (or bordered, if you prefer) combined with sturdy stock help to give your prints a professional look and feel. A cartridge level indicator lets you know how much ink you have left. \n\n \n\nEasy Operation\nSimple menus and one-touch buttons make printing a snap!  Other features include a multiple print function that lets you make up to 100 copies of a single picture. A Save Photo button lets you back up digital files directly to an external CD-R, Zip drive, or USB Thumb drive. \n\n The small 10-by-6-inch footprint fits neatly onto your desk or countertop, and the convenient handle provides true portability. An optional Bluetooth adapter lets you print wirelessly from Bluetooth enabled devices. The PictureMate is backed by a one-year limited warranty.\n\n What's in the Box\nPictureMate Personal Photo Lab, power cord, starter PictureMate photo cartridge, 20 sheets of PictureMate Photo Paper, CD-ROM, user manuals; Epson Software Film Factory 3.05 (PC and Macintosh compatible, P.I.M. and Exif Print-enabled); USB cable not included \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWith quick, one-touch printing, PictureMate is like having a personal photo lab in the comfort of your own home.

But digital photos are lost every day to hard drive crashes and other mishaps. Epson created PictureMate to help you preserve your memories so even your great-grandkids could enjoy photos of your most loyal companions.\n\n When displayed, PictureMate photos resist fading as much as two to four times longer than the leading photo lab brands, and about four to 20 times longer than other dedicated 4-by-6-inch photo printers. Made to share for generations--even centuries, PictureMate photos last approximately 200 years in a photo album and up to 100 years when displayed in a glass frame. They are also water- and smudge-resistant for worry-free handling. (See Wilhelm-research.com for test conditions. Actual print stability will vary according to image and storage or display conditions. Epson does not guarantee the longevity of prints.)\n\n Affordable 29-Cent Prints\nFor the first time ever, you can print 4-by-6-inch photos at home for the same price as some of the most affordable photo labs. PictureMate photos are also less expensive than most kiosks and online services, and about half the cost of other 4-by-6 photo printers. At around 29 cents a photo, you can finally print to your heart's content. (Actual yields and cost will vary based on images, color balance, environmental conditions, and frequency of use.)\n\nSee more",
