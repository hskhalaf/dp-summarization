It was easy to assemble (push the spring down and connect the tabs) and turns freely. The problem is that when ricing potatoes, the potatoes break up and get stuck to the sides. I spent more time pushing potatoes down with a spoon than I did ricing. It however does rice incredibly and I was able to make the smoothest, silkiest potatoes ever. Easy to clean up. Maybe the next version will take into consideration the gap between the blade and the sides and this will become a quality product.",

One other complaint is that the tripod setup tends to make it unstable when milling, I believe four legs would be more appropriate.",

For anything of significance, save money and get a bigger mill. You get what you pay for, I wish I could return this thing.",

The slight lack of helpful operating information is why I gave this only 3 stars.",

It's large enough to add a lot of food for quick milling. You need to remember to turn the opposite direction every once in awhile. Going the opposite direction lifts the food up and allows the blades to mill the food through the holes. Great for making applesauce, pasta sauce and baby food The OXO mill legs fold in for storage.Totally worth buying!",
