The extra NO it releases does cross over the hormone barrier and release the N-HGH or Natural Human Growth Hormone you produce in your body at the pituitary gland. No you cannot feel the N-HGH coursing through your body but you can feel the difference in your workouts though when the NO (Nitrous Oxide) starts running around in your body to the muscles you are working during that particular workout. Very good price so you get your money's worth by far with this product. I will be buying it again too.",

I\u2019ve found so far that this gives me a good pick me up especially in the morning and my performance has improved for lifting sessions, especially with ability to perform on shorter rest periods. Side note of honesty, it does make me pop way more erections. Likely from the i creased blood flow all around, as many men use this for ED treatment be aware of that. The erections are fuller though so you got that goin for ya.",

Argenine is one of the small amount of Vitamins a choose to take.. I just didn\u2019t notice a change, over past few months I would say decrease in sex drive, I\u2019m hoping the normal Walgreens brand I was taking religiously prior to me trying these helps as well as it did in past.. nothing great to say ... wish I had better news:(",
