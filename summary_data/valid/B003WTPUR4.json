I can hook up one to a sound system in the back of the second hash mark and trigger it to start from the sideline. I have even triggered it to start all the way from the press box. It has multiple sounds for you to choose from.",

The first day I got it I accompanied a 50 piece choir that tends to speed up and slow down quite a bit. With the vibrating clip I was able to hold a steady tempo and not lose a beat when pushing and pulling against the big ensemble. I am very excited about buying another one and using it in some duo gig situations.",
