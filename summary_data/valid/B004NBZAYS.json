If you are studying Algebra or Calculus, I suggest you get a non-CAS calculator for your homework and for use during quizzes and tests, but if you want a fuller understanding of the material, use the CX CAS for additional study in your subjects. My main calculator for doing homework is my TI 84 Plus CE graphing calculator, but there are other good choices. Using it forces you to learn the material better. The CX CAS model allows you to cheat, which is why I recommend you only use it for double-checking your work after you do it.",

I am a mechanical engineering major this is great for anyone going into physics, engineering or math majors. I have also noticed it could be helpful for accounting/statistic/finance major and maybe many more. The different formulas create so many possibilities.",

That feature alone saved my grade during my final for when I forgot how to take limits that produce an indeterminate answer.",

This calculator can take a 5 part equation and, using the SOLVE function, rearrange the equation for any variable you need. In chemistry this is a godsend, and I don't think I could survive the class without it. I would recommend this model calculator over every other for that feature alone.",

Would recommend to anyone in higher collegiate math or a math-heavy career (like physics, my dream field). If you aren't going into at least Calc 2, I wouldn't recommend it as it's more calculator than necessary for that level, a TI-84+ Silver would be better. But to anyone in high maths, it's perfect.",

      "text": "I purchased this product solely for the backlit display and integrated rechargeable battery pack. I noticed that typing numbers and operators is somewhat slower than the previous generation NSpire with the oval-shaped number buttons. And also, this may be a minor annoyance to you but this new calculator's buttons make noticeably more noise too. Finally if your hands tend to get sweaty, the touchpad becomes very unresponsive: this has generally been an issue with the previous-gen NSpire too. Honestly, I would probably purchase the previous generation NSpire. I don't think I need a backlit display since I'm not going to do my mathematics homework in a dark room. Keep in mind of these drawbacks before purchasing this calculator!",

It takes a little adjustment if you have had a TI-84 or 89 in the past (like me), but once you catch on you realize how user-friendly this calculator really is. With the CAS system, this calculator is extremely powerful, the sky is the limit. I have already learned how to do far more with this calculator in the first few months than I ever did with my TI-89.",
