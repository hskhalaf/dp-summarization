The fit is snug as it\u2019s a sock type shoe but much thicker material than say some of the same type of Nike, The split sole took me a few runs to get use to, not uncomfortable just a different feel, I\u2019d suggest a few jogs to get your gate use to the dynamics of the sole before going for a full run out of the gate but now they feel/function great. I only have 20+ miles on them so I can\u2019t speak to longevity but at the price I paid (yes I bought them). I have no complaints.",
