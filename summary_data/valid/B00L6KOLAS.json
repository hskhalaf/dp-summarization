      "text": "This bear was purchased as a prop for a musical and also served as our daughter's break-a-leg gift. She was able to see this bear every rehearsal and performance, and take it home at the end of the run. While there are less expensive oversized bears available, many had negative reviews of not being well-stuffed, poor stitching or other noticeable flaws. This bear is huge, well-stuffed, soft and quite the cutie. He arrived quickly, in a vacuum-sealed bag so releasing him is entertaining. More than I would typically pay for a stuffed animal, this giant bear was and continues to be a huge hit.",

Unfortunately when we took the bear out of the box it had several holes in various places. I contacted Yesbears right away and they replaced the bear at no extra cost and very fast. The new bear is perfect - very soft, good quality!! I would highly recomed Yesbears if you are looking for teddy bear for someone.",

However, I don't blame the makers for this; I don't think the bears were made to be wrestling opponents. :-) Regardless, it turns out it's a great one for my little guy.
