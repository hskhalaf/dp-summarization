I guess I expected a little bigger -They come packaged with a wick Dipper and present very well as a gift -The initial scents upon opening are very concentrated so you need to let them breathe for a minute before you can truly smell them",

The pumpkin candle is advertised as \"spicy pumpkin\" but really it's just a normal pumpkin, no spice (which is fine by me I'm not picky). I love that they came with a flame extinguisher - I now use that for every single candle I own! I know that's just a simple device but it works so well for preventing that smoking smell you get from blowing out the candle. I'd love to try out other candles in this line but it is a little expensive for my budget.",

The other thing that upsets me? Candles that burn \"unevenly\"! $20/$30 wasted on a candle that burns directly down the center...and goes out. Or candles that the wick burns hot & fast ~ majority of the candle \"wax\" left, but the wick is buried deep in the wax. This company & their candles are Amazing!! Folks?
