They could not pair to each other over 80m of 25mm2 cable with no heavy loads, this is far bigger than the cable you would see in your house. If you want good speed over a short run they could do you fine but if you have any interest in range look elsewhere!",

Easy to set up but you must follow the instructions and do not plug anything else into the second socket if it\u2019s a double. One last tip, make sure you do the firmware update straight away to ensure you have the latest version. In my opinion worth every penny for the super fast three port version.",
