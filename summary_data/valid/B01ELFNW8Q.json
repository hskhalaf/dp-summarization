      "title": "As cheap looking as the price suggests",
      "text": "I was wary of these sneakers because of the low price, but I decided to give them a shot based on reviews indicating that they are much nicer than the price implies. My first instinct was correct, however. These sneakers look and feel very cheap, like something you would find on rollback at Walmart. They weigh so little you'd think they were made out of styrofoam. I suggest spending another $20 for something a little more durable and of better quality.",
