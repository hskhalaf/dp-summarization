The games would need to be paused regularly for players losing their shoes, but my son never once lost his. For that, I think these are great shoes.",

When my daughter was walking and running funny during a soccer game and complaining of her legs and feet bothering her I checked her shoes and discovered that the bottoms were very flexible so much that the stubs on the bottom bend in causing my daughters feet to go in and which causes problems walking and running. Also where it laces it is off set which might also cause part of the problem too. I wished I would have noticed sooner. I ordered them because of the excellent reviews. I am very disappointed! Now I have to go out and buy here a new pair.",
