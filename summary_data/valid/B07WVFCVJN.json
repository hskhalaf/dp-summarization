The setup is pretty easy and FREE, I have seen some reviews where people are saying they are being asked to pay. Any paid services can be bypassed when setting up.

I'm at wit's end; I've gone into the 'secret' menu and disabled/enabled network ping. I've moved it up, down, around the room. Doesn't matter. Slow connection to the internet; yet every other device I test gets between 80-90 Mbps. So wishing I had purchased one with an Ethernet port.

If you already own a Roku and you're on a \"basic\" plan, whatever that is, if you buy another Roku before you can activate it you have to pay $100 for 3 years of premium service or $149 for a lifetime premium service. I am returning this and will buy a firestick. New Roku will fail to activate, telling you to call support. When I called they said they would upgrade my account to premium. When I asked if there was a charge, i was told the price. When I said that I didn't want to do it, I was told that it was already done. I was mad that I was tricked into extra charges.",

We installed it on the TV in our office and it works fantastic and lets us stream all our favorite apps and yes that includes the Spectrum app which I wish was included on our FireStick. The only downside of the Roku is that the remote doesn't control the TV like power or volume which we love about the FireStick, but I guess it's the price we have to pay to get the Spectrum app. Other than that, it's a great streaming device and at a really fair price.",

I have used the Roku brand since 2008 when I finally ditched satellite and went with local channels. I not only enjoy the local offerings, but the many free channels provided by the Roku, along with a couple of pay-to-stream channels.",

There are more options available on the Roku and it solidly integrates all of your accounts across the devices.
