The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but I think that depends more on the person riding it. Also, I was a little disappointed that this bike doesn't come with a kickstand. We had to buy a separate one and put it on. Either way, great bike, and you really can't complain with this price!",

Some people may want a bike shop to put it together and get the brakes and shifting dialed in. I was able to get it put together with the tools included but I've built and maintained road and mountain bikes for many years.",

      "text": "This bike is nicer than the really cheap bikes that are on the market. We like to buy bikes that can last for both of our kids to use, and so far this bike seems like it will. It's more of a road style bike and not really a mountain bike, so just be aware of that when purchasing. It's hard to find kids bikes with alloy frames that are in this price range so if that's what you are looking this one will work nicely.",

      "text": "We bought the Insight and Clarity for our 8 year old twin grandchildren. They shipped for free and arrived on time three days later. (The Insight actually arrived a day earlier.) Assembly was straightforward and easy. The only issue was the assembly manual wasn't very clear on balancing the brake pads, but it worked itself out with a little trial and error. The bikes appear well made and very little adjustment was needed, The kids love the bikes! We rode almost 10 miles on the bike trails after a little instruction and practice in our driveway. Now our son-in-law wants a bike to be able to ride with the kids!",

      "text": "We bought this for our 9 year old and after a minor collision, in which she didn't even fall off the bike, some spokes broke and the rim bent. I question the quality of the rim but the real issue is Diamondback doesn't sell replacement parts! It is impossible to match the color and the size is uncommon as well. I'm left to special order a rim from my local bike shop for $65 (1/4 of the total bike cost) for a rim that doesn't match. No reason to spend more than you need to if the quality and service isn't any better.",

This bike is a step up from a sidewalk or learning bike, with 24 inch wheels and a 14 speed drivetrain that open up possibilities for longer journeys. The clarity's frame and fork are made from lightweight aluminum, making it easier to manage. It's easy to get on and off due to its low stand over height, which drops the intimidation factor dramatically. The parts on the clarity 24 are very similar to an adult bike, with quality drivetrain parts from Shimano and wide tires for traction on all surfaces.",
