I saw a couple of reviews about the blanket getting ruined after washing, but I washed it and it\u2019s fine. The directions say to wash with cold water and hang dry. I actually ended up just throwing it in the dryer on the \u201cair only\u201d setting (no heat) and the blanket is still soft and intact. It fits perfectly for a queen-sized bed and the color is pretty true to what is shown. The stitching on the trim is of pretty good quality, so it should hold up pretty well in future washes.",

It is super-soft, and the edges are finished with 1/2 inch border, which looks like it will hold up well. I have fibromyalgia, which makes my skin extremely sensitive. I am very picky about having super soft blankets. This one fits the bill quite nicely, in fact I'm going to order another one.",
