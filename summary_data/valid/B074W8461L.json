I have since found a similar look from a different mfg here on Amazon and those arrived flat! Much better, and better quality. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product.",

These are decorative placemats as they have tight meshlike holes in the weave so that any gravy, or small food particles will go through to the table and need to be washed out of the placemats. Suggest putting a paper placemat over them for children that spill alot of food. Basically just wash them in a sink of clean soapy dishwater, rinse, shake and let dry before putting them back on a wood table. Generally they can catch most foods and can be shook off and lightly wiped clean.",

The only reason for the 4 stars is they are smaller then my current ones. I would about about 4 inches total in length smaller. Overall great product. Easy to clean and looks amazing.",

Since they're vinyl they're very easy to clean and they also stay in place and help keep dinnerware in place on top of them. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is.... c'mon, it's vinyl. Way overpriced, but the only placemat I could find that met my needs. I'm happy with them.",
