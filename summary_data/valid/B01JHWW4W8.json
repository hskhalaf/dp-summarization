They are much more study than I thought they would be when putting them together. It's nice how the bars adjust a huge distance so as your child grows or advances you can up the bar height and they will last a while. It says the weight capacity is 130 lbs but my husband who is 165 lbs even flipped on it without a problem. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is the instructions it came with were horrible. Not very descriptive and no pictures. We eventually figured it out though.",
