Here's the information you'll need (from an Amazon question I submitted): Replacement parts are available and can be ordered through our Customer Service Department. Our Customer Service Team can be reached at 800-225-3865 or by email at customercare@lifetime.com.

Filling the stand with sand was the hardest part. Pouring sand through the small holes took a while! A hand pump was provided to inflate the ball, but no needle for the pump was provided. Fortunately, I had one on hand. Once assembled the wife and I tried it out. It worked just fine.",

      "text": "The reason being is we move it on and off the driveway daily for 2 weeks, it is full of water, the carriage bolts stripped the plastic seating that keeps them from backing out. I had to go to Home Depot and buy hex bolts, lock washers, washers, and a second set of nuts to keep the first set from backing out by doubling them up. Looking back on this filling the base 100% full probably contributed to the problem so I don't recommend that, too heavy for daily moving. I think the manufacturer should have taken this into account and designed the mechanical fastening system differently.",

The only drawback is that you can't really lift it without emptying the water out of the base. All the neighborhood kids come to play tetherball at our house now! One of the reviewers had mentioned not to overinflate the ball, so we made sure not to do that. So far so good.",
