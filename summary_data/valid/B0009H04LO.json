This product is good for all lighter skin tones. I put a bit of the bronzer (Laguna) around my outer forehead and my upper cheekbone and then brush the blush (orgasm) on my entire cheekbone in a sweeping motion and it just gives a slight glow without going overboard. It looks like you were kissed by the sun! And that's good as I have a light complexion. Use in conjunction with Benefit's High Beam on the upper cheekbone and eyebrow ridge for a lovely glow all year round!",

Orgasm pairs beautifully with laguna and is probably the best blush I've ever used. It gives a radiant glow and touch of color without being too overdone. This is definetly a must-have product, one that I can't imagine being without now. Well worth the money and love the free shipping!",

The duo is a good deal, the well's are larger than I expected and a little goes a lot way especially with the Albatross.
