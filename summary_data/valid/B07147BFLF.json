Not limited to kitchen serving cart & laundry supplies. I will put it in my industrial themed room. This not only gave me plenty of counter space, but it gave a storage solution as well. It has deep enough basket so my thread isn't falling out and the wheels run so smoothly. Thanks for this very nice and functional cart !",

It's the perfect height-width-length. And it was so easy to put together. I have 2 more of these rolling carts, from Amazon, ( the 2 tier ones ) and these things are really good quality and look very stylish. Super happy with all of them. Friends love how I have used these carts in unique ways.",

Will be back for more. Highly recommend.",
