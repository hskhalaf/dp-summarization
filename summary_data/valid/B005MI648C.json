It gives IMMEDIATE relief and lasts forever. The best part is that you don't need to use a lot at all! My nipples are so sore but as soon as I put this on it somehow goes away! The weird thing is that t doesn't just take away the surface pain it clears some of the \"Aching\" too. I'm so happy with this! If you find my review helpful please mark it so. Thank you!!",

Even though the tubes seem tiny, a little dab'll do ya. It is very thick, like vaseline, so it doesn't spread terribly easy, but that thick coating is what you need. It'll heal cracks, soothe discomfort, and baby can safely consume it without any worry or regard for it. If you're a breastfeeding momma (or even a pregnant woman experiencing early dryness/discomfort), grab yourself a tube.",

No, I\u2019d advise looking into an alternative. I think there are better products that will spread easier and are more nourishing. Also, this product is oil so it will damage your clothes. I have ruined several blouses because of the lanolin oil. I suggest looking at a nipple butter instead.",

Now that my little guy and I have our technique down I use it to lubricate the flanges on my pump to make that less painful as well. Since then, pumping has been so much easier! The only downside is that when I was using it directly on my nipples a lot when they were chapped I would notice a buildup on my little\u2019s lips after a feeding. I don\u2019t think he liked that very much but I could have also been using too much.",
