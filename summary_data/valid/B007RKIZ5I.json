Ugh, we put three sides (top, left and right) on and struggled, then gave up. I asked my husband to help and he didn't want to redo everything that we had done after what I read on the other reviews that we did wrong. One look and he said \"I've got it\" and he grabbed a ratchet tie and used that to pull the net down. My son and I never thought it would fit, but it did. My boys love it. Been playing with it all afternoon. See of the photos of how he did it.",

Pulling these bungies to the maximum stretch, besides being dangerous, must put too much strain on the net. I expect over time to see some failures. I had to pull with the hook tool I made, while holding a foot against the frame, and pulling hard with my other hand on the net, to get the bungy hook on the net. These cannot be the right length.",

The instructions are poor, The bungees are difficult to attach (it took 2 adults with pliers to accomplish). They give you no instruction as to what order you should attach the bungees. If you just work your way around by the time you get to the 4th side they are absolutely impossible to attach. Had to go to another manufacturer's website and instructions to learn that you should attach the 4 corners first, That worked and our 8 and 10 year olds are enjoying it but it was quite a struggle to assemble. It would have been much easier with decent instructions.",

However, once attached, the net is top notch, and you will be extremely pleased with the pop off it. My 11 year old son uses it to warm up his arm before pitching practice into a pocket net. Now, he can practice by himself. He loves it; he can stand 25 feet back and the ball pops back to him. high recommend...just need strong arms/hands to put together.",
