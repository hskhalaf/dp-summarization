The packaging is annoying too because it's difficult to remove the plastic cover as pieces are still suck on the sides of the machine in my case. Where the plastic is stuck does not really intercept the rollers.",

The rest of the strip broke off into littler pieces and got mixed up into the dough I was using, gross and dangerous! It is easy to set up and use so it keeps a star for that.

Now that i have the negatives out, The positives are its simplistic in design, albeit too simple. No need for soap, instructions say literally use only warm water on a paper towel, no running water when cleaning. Has nice depth of thicknesses so you have versatility, and the cutter is very smooth, little to no trouble at all. OVERALL: Great pasta maker for a Good Price.",

This machine was easy to use and allows to make different kinds of pastas. You must use the clamp for the machine to be stable. We use it on our dining table. We make spaghettis most of the time but tagliatelles are really nice too. The Ingredients we use for our recipe is: 200g flour, 2 eggs, 1 spoon of olive oil, water and salt. Result (see the picture) is amazing as you can expect from fresh pastas. This is a great machine. I recommend",

First, the crank is easily inserted and consequently easily comes out. So while turning, I occasionally have to reinsert it. Second, the clamp which holds the maker to the counter just slips into a hole on the side of the unit which is larger than the clamp arm. A tighter fit or a kind of key, slot arrangement would have been better.",
