It frequently falls/slides out from under me. As a whole the bench does not snap into any position. So its really just a balancing act; using your body weight to hold it in place. If I had known this I wouldnt have made the purchase but now that I have it, I'm going to make some warranty voiding modifications to make it a little more stable.",

I had 2 disappointments: one- I did not realize how tall in ends up being so I had to change the location to a room with a taller ceiling. Second, when it was delivered they left it out in the driveway. I made it home just in time to get it in the house before it started pouring out. NOT happy about that.",

But when I was lifting heavy back in the days the machine may be to basic. Not necessary the weight portion since it's resistant workouts but the features that it offers. The rowing portion is pretty much not working for me since I am under 6 feet but works great for the wife since she is 6 feet. I think the stride and the length of the cords are an issue. But overall love it.",

I was able to overcome that conflict. I checked out the space needed on the Bowflex and Amazon websites but that information only shows the gym at rest or in storage mode. The manual that comes with the gym tells you the working space needed which is 103\" L and 80\" W. I was a little skeptical that plastic bands could get you a workout but they do. I would suggest purchasing this gym if you want an all-in-one piece.",

I've done free-weight exercises before, but all I ever got from that was sore muscles. To be fair, I'm not ripped yet ;), but I can already see some definition in my arms. Based on the weights we are using now, the 210lb max leaves plenty of room for growth and shouldn't be a problem unless you're trying to be a bodybuilder.",

This unit is fun, and makes working out pretty easy. The manual is excellent, you get one manual for assembly and another for the workouts. I do see us buying a rod pack upgrade in the future, but 210 is fine for getting use the workouts and the machine.",

It came lose after just a week. I used some Gorilla glue on it and still holding after three weeks. If your on a budget (who isn't) and don't like gyms, this is the way to go!!!",
