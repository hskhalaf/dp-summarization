I had originally planned on securing my Ulock to this strap, but the two vertical straps under the clips on the front work perfectly for this function. Overall very comfortable, looks awesome, and the pricepoint is perfect.",

I've had this bag for more than 1 year and the shoulder straps still feel nice, sturdy, and comfortable. There is a convenient, small compartment inside (approx. 6 in. x 6 in.) which isn't shown in the pictures where I keep bandaids, ibuprofen, headphones, etc. There's also a side, elastic water bottle compartment too. Great backpack!",

The only small gripe I have with this bag is the limited amount of small pockets, other than that it's a nearly perfect backpack.",
