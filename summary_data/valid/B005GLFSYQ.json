      "text": "I ended up giving this to my brother for his motorcycle riding. The lack of any way to realistically hack it for live-streaming to pick an appropriate view angle on your helmet and the limited controls make it a little underwhelming. Good video quality, battery life, and storage size, but it's just not super convenient to use for patrols or motorcycle rides. Better than a lot of the competition though, especially in its price range. Excited to see what the company puts out in the future!",

Still films as great as day one. The lens has very minor scratches but doesnt affect the image recorded. Worried putting something on it now would make the image worse but for those just buying it some thin durable cover might be a good idea since this model doesnt have a replaceable lens sadly.",

Cons: internal battery is not replaceable, so if you're out with it and it dies, that's it. Battery life at 720 was about 75 minutes for me. Inability to change settings without a computer. I'm pleased with this. It works well and is much cheaper than a gopro. If you're just looking for a commuter cam, it's fine, although a hero2 will offer better quality and the ability to switch batteries.",

The battery got charged every night, so I'm not sure how long it would have lasted. Only thing I would change would be a removable lens protector.

If you are looking to edit down your video to do some super slow motion then the framerate is a little low (I think its only 30 fps at 1080 resolution) but other than that you will get some excellent action video!

I had to upgrade the firmware of the SD 32gb card using a different computer and everything run smoothly afterward. The videos are really amazing. A piece of advice if using the head-band mount: make sure you are shooting at the right angle. The pointing laser, especially in open spaces and under the sun, can be difficult to see.

The only reason I didn't give it more stars was because the free software that's available for \"editing\" the videos is pretty limited. Other than that, the camera is great. It's literally easy to use with just a flip of a switch to start recording. It even gives you audible sounds to let you know the camera has been turned on and then off (with the same easy single switch).",

Too bad the company is now closed. My advise would be hurry up stock some of them before they are gone from the market.",

The hardware is quite durable and watertight -- no problems after multiple collisions with branches or submersion into deep powder.

IPX7 is a technical definition of waterproofness, in everyday terms usage ContourROAM\u2019s low-profile design withstands everyday bad weather and swimming. A waterproof case is available for more extreme water sports such as surfing and scuba diving.\n\n\n3: IS THERE A WATERPROOF CASE FOR CONTOURROAM, AND HOW WATERPROOF IS IT?\nYes, a waterproof case has been specifically designed for ContourROAM. This case is waterproof to the following ratings:\n\nPX6:\nThis means the case can withstand high pressure water jets. In everyday usage terms this means the case is resistant to water pushing on the housing, such as would be experienced in kayaking, surfing and other active water sports.\n\nIPX8-60M:\nThis means the case can withstand the pressure of being underwater to a depth of 60m. In everyday usage terms this means the case can be used for recreational SCUBA diving.\n\n\n4: HOW DOES THE INSTANT ON RECORD SWITCH WORK?\nContourROAM has no dedicated Power button. Instead, the Instant On Record Switch powers the camera on and immediately starts recording. This helps to conserve battery power as the camera does not have to be powered on in a \u2018standby mode\u2019 to be ready to record. The result is better battery life, and an easy-to-use camera. Best of all, there's no guess work in whether the camera is on or not.\n\n\n5: WHAT IS THE 270 DEGREE ROTATION?\nThe lens-ring will rotate from -90 degrees to +180 degrees. This means ContourROAM can be mounted on its side or upside down, greatly increasing the places the camera can be mounted.\n\n\n6: WHAT IS THE LASER LINE?\nThe Laser Line is a single laser beam that is projected as a horizontal line from the camera\u2019s rotating lens. It lets you make sure the rotating lens is aligned with the horizon to give you the best shot.\n\n\n7: HOW WELL DOES THE BUILT-IN BATTERY PERFORM?\nBy building the battery in, our engineers could maximize battery size, reliability, and waterproofness. Because the camera is not powered on until the Instant On Record Switch is slid forward, ContourROAM maximizes battery power. Recording at 720p our tests show the camera can record 3.5 hours of video. Length of charge will depend on how you use the camera. Connected to a computer via USB, the battery will reach approximately 80% charge in one hour, and a full charge in 3 to 4 hours.\n\n\n8: HOW DOES THE STATUS BUTTON WORK?\nWhen you press and release the Status Button, the camera will power on briefly and display its Battery level and available Memory. The Laser Line will also light up. After 15 seconds, the camera will power off again to conserve power.\n\n\n9: WHAT SORT OF THREAD DOES THE TRIPOD MOUNT HAVE?\nThe tripod thread mount is a 1/4-20 thread. This is the standard one used on most consumer cameras.",
