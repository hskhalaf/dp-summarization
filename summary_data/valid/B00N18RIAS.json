I was unable to curl the short hair at the back of my head around the nape of my neck. That will still need a conventional iron. With practice, i'm sure my results will be better.",

It heats up in split second time, and makes curling really fast. I have long, fine hair, but it's rather thick. The curls turn out really nice. I'm giving it four stars because it can't hold larger sections of hair, which on my hair, makes the curls look a little weird cause they're small. However, if I comb them out, the beach curls that result are pretty great. I was kind of hoping this would replace my wand, but it doesn't.",

Also, if you are not used to curling your hair, it is not as easy as those demonstrating it on video. Definitely would take practice.",
