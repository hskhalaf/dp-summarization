Push the belt just a hair tighter to ease the pressure on the latch and the belt opens easily. However, the first time I tried I couldn't do it. I absolutely love these belts and I have bought several. I have several different brands and I like this brand the best.",

And each one is extraordinary quality, construction and ease of use. Best men's belts I've ever owned! Would definitely buy again if I need another, or more belts in the future.",

First, who needs it to look like a regular belt when this is far superior? Wear it, flaunt it, and if you are the manufacturer, advertise it. Second, that piece puts little dents in the leather. No one wants that. Give me a square, stainless buckle without that piece and I'll buy that buckle and more belts!",

There is definitely much more flexibility with this belt as well with the waist size which I also like.",

It allows for slight/minor adjustments when needed (i.e. after a big meal, haha) instead of too tight or too big. It's also more convenient to put on and take off. If you have been considering switching, DO IT. You won't regret it. As far as this specific brand/seller, I had zero issues and the belt looks fantastic both as a casual and professional attire accessory.",
