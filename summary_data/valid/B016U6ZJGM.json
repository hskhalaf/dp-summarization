I was relieved when it came and I found the clamp easily fit. The light has I think two settings? The blue is soothing, the white I use most because it puts off good reading light. I should also add the metal neck that bends is sturdy and firm yet flexible. Better quality than I expected.",

Instead of the included AC/USB adaptor [5V-0.5A] which is big, I am using an old Mac adaptor [5V-1A] which is much smaller. (Both are working equally well.) By the way, you may connect it to your PC USB2 or USB3 plug as they produce 5V 0.5A and 5V 0.9A, respectively. It seems the lamp requires 5V and at least 0.5A. I hope the arm is a bit longer. Some people may find the the length of the electric cable is short.",

      "text": "This lamp is actually a better quality lamp than I expected. It is metallic, and the flexible neck and lamp head hold their shapes. So far, there is no drooping or sagging in positioning the lamp head or the neck. The clamp is all metal and has a tight spring, so it provides a sturdy grip on the edge of the table, desk, shelf, etc. The light is bright, making it perfect for reading or any task requiring attention to detail. A flip of a switch will reduce the brightness once, making the lamp perfect for ambient room lighting. I'm very pleased with this product, and I do recommend it.",
