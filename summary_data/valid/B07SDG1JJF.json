This coverup fits nice and loose like you would expect a coverup to fit, also it has a good length to it. I am 5'5 and it comes down to my knees. The fabric is sheer polyester and usually these fabrics are somewhat itchy but this one is not. All in all, I like it so I gave it 5 stars!",

I always get really burned on my arms, even after applying Sun block, the sleeves fall perfectly on my arms and provide just the right coverage. I Will definitely recommend.",

The garment itself is pretty much a rectangular piece of fabric that is folded over and stitched up the sides in such a way that leaves openings for arms. I personally would have liked some sort of actual sleeve allowance on the garment like other kimino-style cover-ups, however due to the feather weight of the fabric it does drape nice enough around the body to detract from the simple \"boxiness\" of the cut. Over all it's a nice garment, pretty enough for throwing on as an accent piece over a swimsuit, or tank.",
