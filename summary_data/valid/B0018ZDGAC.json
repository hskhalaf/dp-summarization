This is a portrait lens so there is no zoom at all and getting large family group shots requires positioning myself at the alternate end of the country. However, for everything in-between, this thing is the greatest lens I have ever used. The shots are crystal clear and the low depth of field scrubs on the backgrounds giving each shot a professional 3D look. Low light, action, closeups... Everything came out incredible. Each time I showed someone the shot I took of them they all said the same thing.. \"Wow that is an awesome camera.\" Best investment I have made.",

It's also a bit slow to focus, so I've missed some good shots because of it. It's a bit frustrating overall and I'm wondering if it's because it's used. Any pros out there who could tell me if this is normal? Anyways, considering it's $700 less than the new, I've got to say it's totally worth getting if you're on a tight budget. If you have the money, get the new one!!!",

The way this lens renders bokeh is different than the Nikon lens. It gives a nice character to the picture. The AF on this lens is hands down faster then the Nikon 50mm 1.4g. At the same time the Sigma is bigger, heaver, and the glass is more exposed, BUT it is completely worth it. Don't hesitate to buy this over the Nikon 50mm because of the brand.

I had a 18-55 kit lens before and I cannot imagine probably ever putting it back on my camera after seeing the difference. The lens focuses very, very fast and quiet. The depth of field with the lens wide open is so small that if you're shooting an even slightly moving subject, you may mistake the lens for being soft or slightly out of focus when your subject simply moved an inch or two after focusing. By f/1.8 the glass is super sharp. I would highly recommend to any once needing a prime 50.",

I've traveled the world with it, been to Burning Man, camping, and more. I could bore you with technical details, but others have done it and for the most part they are accurate. This is an awesome lens. If I had to complain, I wish it could focus closer, but there is no such thing as a perfect lens.",

However with the Sigma, I can open it up to f1.4 which makes the background a little bit creamier. But keep in mind that at f1.4 it can be a bit harder to get sharp focus due to very shallow depth of field. Overall, I like it and intend to keep it as long as I'm not encountering any quality issues with it. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to shoot at wider apertures.",

I'm very pleased with the lens. Very sharp. Bright colors with good contrast. Good bokeh. Fast focus. I've had some out of focus shots at f1.4 in poor light and with low contrast subjects, but this is very difficult for any camera/lens combo. Overall a great lens and highly recommended.",

The bokeh created when aperture is completely opened is amazing. The Canon starts to get the distinct octagon shape when fully opened but the Sigma is nice and smooth. Well worth the money and then some. Product shipping was fast as it only took a week to receive here in Japan.",

In the past few years, camera manufacturers have overlooked the need for a reasonable fast prime lens that is compact enough for everyday use, yet provides the necessary image quality to meet the highest expectations. Now, with the advent of the APS-c cameras, the long popular 50mm focal length takes on double duty as a portrait length lens of approximately 90mm on most of the small chip cameras. At a fraction of the size, weight and cost of comparable lenses, this is a lens you might want on your digital SLR camera at all times.Browse our Sigma Store online to compare all Sigma Lenses.",
