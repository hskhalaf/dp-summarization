Cutting out breads and sugar really did make a difference!",

Was easy to follow, meals are simple, and the recipes are pretty good. You probably have most of the ingredients already, nothing exotic to buy. The first phase is to jump start you with low carbs for two weeks, then into phase II with some carbs, so it is doable. You truly don't have to do the time I did walking at first, but it did help me. Not too hard to stick to.",

Canadian bacon, avocados, laughing cow cheese, sugar free products, etc. I am thankful for the jumpstart, but did better (weight loss) when I ate only fruits and vegetables.",

For most people the initial weight loss is probably due to the salt decrease AND the carb restriction (water loss NOT fat loss). For me, a Type II diabetic, there seems to be too many carbs in the diet to maintain good blood glucose control. Nevertheless, for non-diabetics, this diet may be suitable. The book is well done with lots of useful information.",
