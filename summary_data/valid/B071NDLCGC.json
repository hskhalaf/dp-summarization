I just plugged in the male end of headset into the female end of this adapter and then plugged the two male ends of the adapter into the microphone and speaker jacks on the back of the PC and that's all it took. Saved me the money of having to buy another gaming headset. The quality of this adapter looks very good as well. Very pleased with this product!",

Sound quality is as good as the earbuds allow, iow sounds the same as if I wasn't splitting out the mic. The one limitation is that it does not work with Apple's supplied earbuds for the iPhones.

Glad I went with the longer cord too as it gives me some room to maneuver without ripping the headset out of the adapter. Wire feels well made and sturdy. Obviously you can get these for much less than what I paid (about $8) but these seem like better quality compared to some of the other ones I\u2019ve seen. Not to mention, if your current headset is working fine, the price of these is still much cheaper than buying a new headset.",
