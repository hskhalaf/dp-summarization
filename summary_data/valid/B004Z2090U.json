And I sprayed 22 gallons of Behr Premium Plus Ultra exterior flat latex, unthinned. This took place over a 3 month period as I worked my way around the house doing repairs, caulking, and prep. A few times I left the sprayer filled with paint for a couple weeks instead of cleaning right away and had no problems. Spray tips and gun filter are easy to clean. Paint job turned out well, and I'm getting complements from the neighbors on a professional looking job.",

I was kinda nervous after reading some of the 1 star reviews (competitors perhaps). Cleanup was not difficult and the garden hose adapter made the process very easy when using water based paint.. For my first time ever using a paint sprayer today I'm quite pleased with Graco's product and will be spraying some paint tomorrow..",
