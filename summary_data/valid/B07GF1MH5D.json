The shackles are sent in a box with pre-cut foam that fits perfectly around each shackle. You have 6 total washers (rubber type material) per shackle. This allows you for a snug fit on each recovery hook as well as keeping the shackles in place and not allowing them to make any noise. Installation is easy even for one person. I used threadlock just to make sure that the pin on the shackle does not come loose. The look of them really pops and each shackle is a work of art. Highly recommend for anyone looking at these.",
