I only needed to drill a couple of holes through 1 1/2 concrete. With considerable effort the first 1/4\" hole punched through. On the second hole the drill wouldn't even start, a second \"new\" drill from the set was no better, complete junk. Don't waste money on this cheap made in China junk. Get the real Bosch bits made in Germany. Since I needed to finish the job I made a trip to Lowes and bought the German made Bosch 1/4\" bit. Drilled the other three holes with no problem.",
