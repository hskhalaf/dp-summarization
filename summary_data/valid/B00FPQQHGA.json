      "text": "We bought the expert set with screw-in brass fittings on the mallet heads and mallets. Unfortunately, the screws that hold the brass fittings in place on the mallet heads are only about 1/2\" in length and the wood in the mallets is very soft. So, the first time our family of responsible adults and small children tried to use the set, the screws on two of the mallet heads ripped right out of the heads, leaving those two mallets useless. The wood in the stakes is also very soft and one broke at the base when hit with a ball. See pics.",

I have to cut my grass as low as my lawnmower will cut to get the proper roll of regulation size balls struck by regulation size mallets and am certain this set would make it impossible to play the game as it is intended to be played on lawn grass. When you spend $35 for something with a price range of $35 -$200, you should expect there is something wrong - dumb me.",

It only took my wife less than one minute to have the mallet fall apart. The screws holding the handle to the mallet head ripped out as soon as she hit the ball. She did not hit hard. It is obvious that they all will fail in the same way. The design and appearance was nice. If the set was made of quality materials, I would have paid $100.00 more for it. Instead, it is only good for decoration. Returning, thanks Amazon.",

The mallets themselves are made of poor quality materials. The heads are loose on the shaft because you can't screw them in tightly. After 3 games we had one of the heads break off.

The plastic caps are so cheap it is sad. the painted stripes look like they were done by a child (perhaps they were). The heads screw with a wooden thread on to the handle but it is lose and wobbles.

The shafts are attached by screws which are not secured well into head. This product is poorly made. If I didn\u2019t miss the return window I would be returning this today.",
