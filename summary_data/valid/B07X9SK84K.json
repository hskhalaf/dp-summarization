This seemed a great choice for very sensible money. If you don\u2019t put a cover on it every time you hold it, some app or page opens due to the edge to edge screen. That was annoying rather than a fault.. It also comes with Android 1 which basically strips back all the pre installed apps some of us rarely use. If you\u2019re after a sim free smartphone and being able to remember when Nokia made fantastic phones you will not be disappointed with this choice, just get a case for it!",

      "text": "The phone is good but, despite being Android One and only just released, it is not getting timely system updates. Nokia claim the problem is with the mobile operator (Virgin). My wife has an old Nokia (> 1 year old) and it has a more up to date version of Android than my brand new phone. I bought this because I wanted a phone that was regularly updated (unlike most Android devices) and because Nokia boast about regularly updating their devices. Clearly that is an empty boast. So, if you want timely security updates, and perhaps if you are with Virgin, don't waste your money on this phone.",

Or maybe I'm just out of touch. Mentioning touch, the only better feature on the 8 was its fingerprint sensor on the front rather than the back. A very minor point.",

I spent far longer watching reviews than I care to think and narrowed down the choice to Moto G8 plus, Nokia 8.1, Samsung A41/A51 all of which were more expensive (A51 perhaps nicest but a third more). We've owned Samsung's & Nokia's before and purchased this Nokia 7.2 on the price drop (model is being superseded). Loaded it with a stack of apps and a nano 64G A1 RAM card for the photos/Vids, seems to work fine so far and it seems nice to use.",
