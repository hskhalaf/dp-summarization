I dont know if spending the extra money for the national parks is worth it for the game - but it is a nice feel good moment for the support of our National parks. Would be cool if these blocks were biodegradable. But it is better than plastic.",

The facts are interesting, however if you're used to fast game play, you may not care to read out the facts when playing. The text is pretty clear and looks like it's been placed with a branding iron and burned into the wood. This version also does not have the plastic stacking sleeve like older versions of Jenga once had, just the ordinary, flimsy cardstock sleeve like in all the newer versions. However, the box is at least square, unlike the classic version that is now being sold in a rectangle box for some reason.",
