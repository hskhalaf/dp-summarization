We took him to the vet and put him on allergy meds for seasonal allergies, but later realized that it was the dog food. We thought that he had seasonal allergies because he would go outside to potty right after he ate and would come back inside swollen. One day I saw him normal, and as soon as he finished eating, he was blind again because his eyelids swelled so much he couldn't see. I took his bowls away and washed them along with changing his dog food and he was fine again.",
