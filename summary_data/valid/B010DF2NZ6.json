The bag the whole set comes in is flimsy and tore before I even left. The only other big thing is that the plastic the water pouch is made of is pretty robust, which makes it really hard to fill in a creek or lake.",

The only problem I have with this filter is that it does fit properly on every bag or bottle I have. The included bag is too small if you are filtering water on a long hike. Despite this, I always carry this filter and use my other brands as backups.",

I would back wash (clean) the filter, blow LOW pressure air through it (by mouth or bicycle pump) and leave out to dry before putting caps back on. I believe this will reduce the possible musty flavor you can experience next time you camp with it. Good product.",

Reasonable amount of suction required and no discernible difference in taste between the two waters. 24 hrs since we drank the stagnant water from the pool. Must be working, Thank God! I'd rather find out now than out on a backpacking or camping trip. Back flush was also easy. I've never used anything like this, but it appears to be a good product. I will get a small ditty bag to keep the accessories.",
