With his prior dry food he ate 2 cups a day. With this food, he appears to be more satisfied with eating less. I\u2019m still hoping that in time we will see a drop in weight.",

(Yes, he was a BIG cat.) I don't think he likes it very much, because he doesn't clean his bowl anymore, but since this is all he gets, he deals with it. Plus, no barfing. Yay!",
