I guess it does say clay based but I didn't expect it to smear/smudge even after setting it with setting spray. Well you can't win them all. Great concept though!",

Best decision ever!!! Apart from being really black, its is so smooth, which helps a rookie like me when it comes to applying. The brush is not flimsy like other eye liner brushes, which helps a rookie like me keep the line straight. It literally feels creamy when applying. Its the best eye liner product that I have ever owned. Watch you tube, see for yourself.",

It's unfortunate because I love the eyeliner product, but because the packaging is so frustrating ..... I won't be purchasing this again. Plenty of other good ones out there without the hassle.",
