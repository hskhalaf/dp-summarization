I'm not sure if they're advertised as 'noise cancelling' but they do appear block out all surround sounds, due to their snug fit. Taking the right earbud out and lowering it, automatically pauses the music - which is an amazing feature. The earbuds are a fantastic price - I would have paid twice as much for them given the sound quality and the snug fit alone. Would I recommend them? Absolutely",

Sometimes the sound jumps a bit, but that's almost always at the start of a song. The range is surprisingly decent!",
