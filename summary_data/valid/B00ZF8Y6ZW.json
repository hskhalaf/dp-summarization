I need to get any iron pieces that are less than 1/2\" below the surface of the timbers so I can plane and surface the timbers for use in a workbench I plan on building. This is working perfectly. Since it will likely never be used again after this project, price was important. I was worried something this inexpensive would not work very well, but am very pleased",

After a few months of use, we trust it to find metal in wood, etc. Range is hard to tell, but if we are trying to measure close to anything with a screw in it (like a work table or something we are wearing) it will wink withing 7-8 inches or further and absolutely light up inside of 4-5 inches. Fooled us a few times, until we realized it was reading anything close. We are now trained to use it away from all things but the item we are scanning. It's amazing how many metal items you forget are close by in a shop/work space. Recommend This One",

Hold the button while the m40 is AWAY from the wall and anything metallic for the most sensitive calibration. Change orientation of it for pinpoint measuring. ...And there are a few other bits which add to learning curve the uninitiated will likely misinterpret as this being a crappy finder. It's not.

It cut though 1/4\" tile over 1/2\" drywall like butter to give accurate readings - very very very impressed. If you haven't spent a lot of time with finders, setup a practice field with an old piece of drywall attached over some scrap lumber to get the feel of how this unit behaves. Learn to calibrate, to use the gross field sensor, as well as the spot isolation sensor. Zircon also has some vids on YouTube. I highly recommend this unit.",

What I did was run this across my wall, I marked with tape where it detected metal. I ended up with a more or less of a grid, but I could now easily see where the studs were.

Just don't expect it to pick up mini pellets.",

After I used it for a short while the button got stuck, permanently. I attempted to fix it by dislodging the plastic button, but that only worked for a few times and finally it would start lighting up when there were no metal objects near by. Could be a great product if it was a bit more durable.",

    "title": "Zircon MetalliScanner m40- Handheld Electronic Metal Detector Use on Dry Wall, Concrete, Lathe and Plaster, Stucco and More, Battery Included",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Frustration-Free PackagingThe Zircon MetalliScanner m40 electronic metal scanner quickly and easily detects metal in lath and plaster, wood, drywall, paneling, tile, stucco, plaster, concrete and other non-metallic surfaces. This metal detector locates ferrous (magnetic) metal up to 4 inches (100 mm) deep and non-ferrous (non-magnetic) metal up to 2 inches (50 mm) deep. The Zircon m40 has two scanning positions, Wide Scan and Pinpoint Scan. To get started, install the included 9V alkaline battery. Hold the tool in the air away from any metal but make sure the blue sensor is parallel to the surface being scanned. Press and hold the Power Button to calibrate the unit. Once you hear a beep and see the green \"Ready\" LED illuminated, calibration is complete. Continue to hold the Power Button as you slowly slide the tool across the surface. As the MetalliScanner approaches a metal object, the red LEDs progressively light from the bottom up in both scanning modes. The top lighted blue coil and an audio tone indicate when a metal target is located. This MetalliScanner m40 tool easily solves the very difficult problem of finding studs in lath and plaster walls. It works as a nail finder by detecting the pattern of nails that attach the wood lath to the studs. Additionally, the MetalliScanner m40 metal locator finds plumbing, ductwork, rebar, nails and screws in your walls, floors and ceilings and is great for scanning reclaimed lumber for hidden metal. Now in easy open packaging, this product comes with everything you need to get started, including the battery! Backed by our world class customer service and support, we at Zircon know that whether you're a Construction Professional or weekend DIY enthusiast, you'll find the m40 has the technology and durability you're looking for to get the job done right.",
