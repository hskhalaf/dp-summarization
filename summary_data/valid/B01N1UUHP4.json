I use the number cards to make sure that a child can identify the numbers and then that they can place the numbers in the correct order. Then I start with one set of the cards for a very young student. My more advanced students can use all the sets. The quality of the game is impressive. The cards are sturdy and well made. Each set of cards is bright and colorful making this work fun and interesting for the child. I plan to use this set for years to come. This is one of the best purchases I have bought for my classroom.",

My first grader's favorite is playing memory with two different decks - one is a ten-frame and one is polka dots. He has to try to find the ten frame that has the same number as the polka dot (dice) card. Fun for him and us grown ups!",
