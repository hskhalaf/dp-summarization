      "text": "We purchased this piece for our adult son who was in a serious motorcycle crash. His multiple injuries cause him to be in a lot of pain and he has trouble finding a comfortable position. Although he does not use the pieces the way they were intended, they do help him relieve pressure points and get rest. I like that the covers are removable and can be washed.",

Just be aware that it comes wrapped very tightly. When you open the package, you will wonder if its the right thing, it is! As soon as you take the plastic off it forms correctly. Enjoy!!",

The Kind Bed Comfort System offers four incredible pieces that work together in harmony to bolster your body while sitting up in your bed. The Back Scoop offers firm yet supple lumbar support, which can be adjusted by sliding up and down the Scoop Cradle to fit your body.

The end result is sublime, flexible comfort to give you the ideal support to read, watch TV, or meditate. All four pieces of the Kind Bed Comfort System are made from ultra comfortable polyurethane foam that gives you the perfect amount of support, while an added layer of memory foam contours and cradles your body.
