It does take a week-ish for the chemical smell to go away, but this thing is very comfy. We just came off of a cSE sleep number bed, that felt good for the first 5min after laying down....then never being comfortable again that night. It cost 2x what this Casper did....lesson learned. We love this mattress. Its a huge improvement over sleep number. This mattress does sleep warmer than the sleep number. I am a hot sleeper, but this casper is still not as offputting as the sleep number was. Thanks Casper!",

Now, six weeks after receiving it, the smell is only noticeable if the bedroom door has been closed for a couple of hours.
