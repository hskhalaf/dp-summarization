Brought this oven over to my daughters house and we had a pizza party. You will need the Pizza Peel that is metal like they sell or one like it.

Went to Walmart and got a splatter screen that was the correct size to fit into the pizza que. I placed the pizza on the splatter screen supported by the peel and inserted both into the Que. When positioned correctly slide the peel away and leave the splatter screen directly on top of the stone. After about 4 minutes you can pull the splatter screen and pizza out and the pizza will come right off of the screen. Rotate the pizza and finish cooking the pizza directly on the stone.",
