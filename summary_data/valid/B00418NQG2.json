Black in color....the cast aluminum will keep them from rusting in our Florida location. We are proud to announce that these lamps survived Hurricane Irma. No paint chips, no cracked or broken glass panels. Now that is a recommendation! Very Pleased!",

They'll work but it looks nicer with the shorter ones I picked up at the hardware store. The wiring is good and easy to attach even with a photocell on the pole. It looks nice when off during the day, or on when it's dark. Good product.",

I guess if you are ok with paying the cost of these and knowing that they will only last a few years they will be great for you...me, I'm moving on to something that will last.",

My only issue is with the two screws that secure the top (as noted in several other reviews). The screws do not fit securely against the lamp, even with the 2 rubber washers provided. Thus, a small part of the screw is exposed. I forsee needing to reach out to the company for replacement screws after changing the bulb a few times. The receiving screw holes were not machines deep enough.",
