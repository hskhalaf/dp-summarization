Thread strings thru the holes at the top of the poles. Stand the tent up, spread out the poles and tighten the strings. Took about 10 minutes! I can see years of fun to come with this tent. It seems to be made very well. I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase and would recommend to anyone.",

I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d and the top of the poles reach my height. Poles were easy to assemble and good quality wood. Instructions were easy to follow. I put the tepee up by myself.

So far my kids love playing in it and we've had many adventures in it and we've only had it a week! Great idea for a kid's play place if you don't have a while playroom. Great idea for grandparents to have as a small kids space to make a little kid corner in their home as well",

I love being able to store the teepee, assembled, by pulling the sides together and flopping it in a corner. I am very impressed with the material and think it will last us a long, long time. The lights are a fun bonus. Highly recommended. Enjoy and have fun.",

He is also a rough and tumble kind of kid so it's really durable and he hasn't knocked it down yet.",
