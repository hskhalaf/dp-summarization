My summary of this shoe: adidas is the best at what they do. Good value and high quality are a winner in my running life. This new unitized upper design has really changed the game for runners. They are stable and comfortable, stylish and well made.",

I still would recommend these shoes but strictly as a casual shoe not for running even though they feel good during a run they won't last on the streets.
