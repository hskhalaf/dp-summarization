It's alcohol-free (alcohol isn't great for the gums and teeth, anyway, but, as a recovered alcoholic, I didn't want to be putting 10-25% ethyl alcohol in my mouth) and seems to be, IIRC, the only mouthwash type that is suitable both for general hygiene and gingivitis. This six-pack option also seemed to be the most economical option on Amazon at least for my needs, though a Prime Pantry offer or going elsewhere would likely be cheaper if you don't wish to buy in large bulk here.",

In between dentist visits, no matter how much I brushed or flossed, there would always be a little bit of plaque buildup. After my last dentist visit a few weeks ago, my hygienist said that I\u2019ll be set for life if I keep my routine up! The only downside about this mouthwash is it has a little bit of a funny mint taste (which is why I use it before flossing and brushing). Other than that, I highly recommend adding this to your daily routine!",
