We secured the ladder vertically to the bunks and replaced the top hooks with rubber feet. This way it also serves a a bit of a bed rail. Great, no complaints!",

I understand this damage is likely an Amazon Warehouse oversight, but after seeing / feeling the flimsy nature of this ladder first hand; it\u2019s safe to say it didn\u2019t take much at all to bend / damage this ladder. Regardless of what the manufacturer says, this ladder cannot bear much weight and I would not trust it to support my children (both under 50 lbs). I highly recommend seeking a safer ladder.",
