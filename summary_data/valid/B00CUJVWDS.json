Press the button and the ice is shaved and drops into your flavoring then the blender comes on automatically and mixes and further pulverizes the ice. Total time about 2 minutes. Want yours less watery or thicker press shave button and it makes it thicker. Want the ice extra fluffy press the blender button and its done. If there is any ice left over its drips into a removable compartment in the back and will not drip into your mix. It works great and is sturdily built",

First night of use 10lbs of ice ran through this thing it perfect for the hot summer.

Put it on \"Shave 'n Blend,\" and it automatically churns out a full, 36-ounce pitcher of frozen drinks as good as any you'll ever get in a restaurant. If you want to put your own spin on the concoction, use the custom \"shave only\" or \"blend only\" setting. You'll be sipping on a slice of paradise in no time. It's better with the Bahamas Frozen Concoction Maker.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n * The only frozen drink maker that shaves ice--instead of crushing/pulverizing\n * Make a 36-ounce frozen drink in one easy step with the automatic \"Shave 'n Blend\" cycle\n * Customize the consistency of drinks using the manual \"shave only\" or \"blend only\" setting\n * The blending jar really lasts--it's high-quality, dishwasher-safe, and shatter-proof\n * Forget about watery, slushy drinks because melting ice is channeled away\n\nA TROPICAL BREEZE TO USE\nNO-BRAINER MIXER\nDesigned with markings up the side, the included No-Brainer mixer makes it easy to add the right ingredients for pina coladas, daiquiris, margaritas, and more. After measuring in the ingredients, release into the blending jar, and you're well on your way.\n\nAUTO OR MANUAL MODE\nPress \"start\" to employ the automatic \"Shave 'n Blend\" cycle, which uses a sharp shaving paddle to finely and evenly shave ice from the reservoir. Additional sharp blades in the blending jar pulverize all the ingredients to perfection.\n\nFor manual control, there's a handy \"blend only/shave only\" toggle switch, which lets you add more ice--and blend it as long as you want.\n\nSHATTER-PROOF PLASTIC BLENDING JAR\nThe Bahamas Frozen Concoction Maker provides a durable Shatter-proof Plastic blending jar with a roomy 36-ounce capacity, measuring marks up the side, and a generous easy-grip handle. Both the No-Brainer mixer and the blending jar/lid are dishwasher-safe for quick cleanup.\n\n\nNo-Brainer mixer for mixing top 3 frozen drinks and releasing right into jar. view larger Automatic \"Shave 'n Blend\" cycle--or toggle between manual \"blend only\" or \"shave only\". view larger Shatterproof, 36-ounce shatter-proof plastic blending jar. view larger WHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nMargaritaville DM0600 Bahamas Frozen Concoction Maker, 36-ounce shatter-proof plastic blending jar, No-Brainer mixer, user manual",
