It's very uncomfortable, not only because it feels like someone with giant inflatable hands softly strangling me, but because the material itself is itchy and hot. I can't even wear the thing for more than five minutes at a time because it's oppressively hot, and I have to put some other material, like tissues or a towel or something, between the device and my skin so it doesn't drive me crazy with itching. Maybe this kind of product will work for some people, but it just wasn't for me. I'd really suggest finding a softer and cooler material to wrap it in.",

Some days I'm in so much pain and using this for about 20 minutes really gives relief. Only concern might b that it can get a little warm sometimes but actually, the heat even helps. The device itself doesn't generate heat but holds your body's heat in, making you feel warm. The real purpose of course, is to decompress and relieve pain in the joint spaces of the neck and it does that very well.",

      "text": "All the reviews looked favorable, but must have all been from petite people. I have a 17 inch neck. The front closure straps are too short, so they cut into my neck. I tried extending them with some velcro straps I had, but I ended up wedging a piece of soft foam between the straps and my neck to cushion them better. Once inflated, it feels uncomfortable as it puffs up a lot in the rear, but not much up front. The little \"ball valve\" is not convenient as the ball is loose in the tube can travel away from its little recess pocket lobe up and down the tube. I am returning this item, disappointed.",

I do like that you are able to adjust the size using the velcro straps and the build is quality.",
