Maybe baking soda or vinegar could get rid of the scent. Plastics are safe for me, however maybe it varies by dishwasher. EDIT: So after a few non detergent washes and soaks of the impacted silicone item, the scent is almost all but gone. So it's not the end of the world if you do use silicone, just soak it in normal soapy water and air it out, and it will dissipate eventually, but it's probably still wise to avoid washing silicone items with this particular detergent, non scented ones would be the preferred ones.",

This stuff is the only detergent I've found that consistently performs well. One pod of this plus a little Finish Hard Water Booster Powder in the pre-wash and all the dishes come out great most every time. Run some Finish Dual Action Dishwasher Cleaner through the dishwasher once every few months and let the Cascade Platinum take care of the maintenance cleaning. Best setup I've found, ever.",

Hopefully, the dishwasher thoroughly cleans the chemicals that are in the tablet and the chemicals are not harmful to the environment. But, we have clean plates...and bowls...and cups...and pans...and pots...and cutlery...and... It's not as magical as one might hope. Items that have really dried and caked on stuff on them will still have stuff remaining after the wash. So, those kinds of items still need some hand cleaning but overall it's a 5.",

While the new dishwasher cleans WAY better than our old one even with cheaper soap or pods, it does a WAY better job with this stuff. I know I'm getting really spoiled because I hardly ever even pre-rinse anymore, even with crusty dishes, and I NEVER pre-wash.",
