It also did not give off enough usable light. I took some pliers and pulled the wick up about twice the length it was originally. The flame was fine and did not blow out any longer. I did not bother to time the length of burn but I can safely say it did not hit the 100 hour mark. I'm sure you could argue that it wouldn't hit the 100 hour mark due to lengthening the wick. No worries, they are still handy and I would probably purchase again.",

The only thing you need is a flashlight to find your lighter or matches to start the candles. That way you can save the flashlight batteries for going outside or other places the candle would not work.",
