It's really stable and tracks perfectly. I tried to tip it in a lake without standing up just to see if I could and it didn't capsize. The seat and foot rests are adjustable and very comfortable. The quality of this kayak is way above the price I bought it for.",

Was fishing on the Hedonista Lagoon, got caught in outgoing tide and could not turn quick enough to avoid crashing into the chain barrier just past the railroad bridge. Impact upended the boat and dumped me headfirst into the water. Had to be rescued because was not wearing a life jacket. Learned a good lesson about kayak stability. Wear a life jacket always!!!",

If you want a full skirt for it the Seals Sneak Nylon Skirt size 7.0 is the way to go. I would recommend this product. One more thing....Old Town was smoking crack when they installed the drain plug. Its very difficult to drain from where they put it. I wet vaccummed mine out once i got home.",
