    "description": "Endeavor Tool Company 200MO Gator Grip the Original Universal Socket 3PC Kit. Made in the USA. Self-Adjusts for shape and size as well as Standard and Metric application\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Gator Grip Universal Socket is a universal socket that instantly adjusts to grip hex nuts, screw eyes, hooks, lag screws, and bolt heads. It features a wide range of adjustability that will fit standard 1/4-inch to 3/4-inch and metric 7mm to 19mm nuts and bolt heads. The tool's socket contains 54 hardened steel spring pins for long-lasting durability. When placed onto a fastener, the center pins retract and the outer pins surround the fastener.
