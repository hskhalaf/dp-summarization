The wood is a little lightweight and soft, but it seems to be a quality hutch. Does have room for their litter boxes so I just put them in the playpen. The tray walls are not very high so litter flies everywhere, if your bunny 'goes' in the corner prepare for spillage. Otherwise very nice! Will order another!",

Means a lot of cleaning . Maybe it\u2019s good for an inside cage but for outside needs a mesh bottom for filth to fall through and Rabbits to stay dry . Please think about a mesh panel above the solid bottom. Also the metal panel will rot quickly due to staying wet .",
