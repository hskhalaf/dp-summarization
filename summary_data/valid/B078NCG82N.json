      "text": "I have used this Kodak Ultra Mini Portable Projector for projecting photos on to my table so I can trace and see each and every color. I do this with the help of a tripod (make sure tripod has right size mounting screw) which has two screw sizes. I don't need a very dark room, but the darker the better to see the picture. The main reason I purchased this mini projector is because it projects a very small picture which I can trace onto watercolor paper, most of the other mini projectors can't go down that small. Happy with this purchase and I recommend.",

It can be connected with my MacBook Pro using the HDMI cable that came with it, but it requires some setting on Mac side instead of just connecting. However, I still like it.

Well if you plug this into your Xbox you will not get the advertised 1080p picture quality, you will be stuck at 720p. In fact I think the only way to get the 1080p quality is by using this with a PC and forcing the secondary display resolution to be 1080p. So the 1080p advertising should reschedule qualify that it's limited situations. Otherwise it's bright enough if you're in a dark room and works fine.",
