I was thrilled with how easy it was to move this vacuum around but it won't vacuum any of the rock salt, no hair, misses most dirt. It's a glorified duster at best. Missed cob webs on walls too though. The cord clip kept falling off too. (I only used the bRand New machine for one cleaning day: 8hours). Not sure why it's an amazon pick.",

These attachments actually lock into place and will not come free when you are using them. The bag is reusable which is also a nice bonus. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",

My only suggestion for improvement is that they provide a padded strap for your shoulder.",
