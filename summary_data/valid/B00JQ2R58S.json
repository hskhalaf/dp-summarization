      "text": "Love almost everything about this watch. 2 caveats that won't make a dang bit of difference to the manufacturer, but you should know about: 1. The carbon fiber insert band is nice and rugged... however I would highly recommend a titanium band. 2. The hands look like they are full Glow-In-The-Dark (GITD). NOTHING could be further from the truth. There's just a hint of a speck of GITD paint and they are VERY hard to read in the dark. The watch does have a pretty nice light on it, but that's a little obnoxious when you're trying see what time it is while camping.",

IMO it's a much better looking watch. I love the green accents and the hour and minute hands, as well as the bezel markers. The YT does have better lum because of the solid hands, but both have the same LED lights. Overall at about $250 cheaper, I think the 6000 is the way to go.",

The sapphire bezel scratched very easily. I've have a number of watches with sapphire and this can't be made of sapphire. In addition, the display and mode buttons failed. I'll see if Casio will service the watch. However, I suspect this one is a fake.",

I like the Casio line for two main reasons - solar charging and world time and it's the latter where this falls short. Selecting the destination city is difficult - the city abbreviations around the bevel can be difficult to see unless there's very bright direct light as the codes are often difficult to see in dim light or the bevel shades the codes. Okay, I'll use the LCD display but - unlike my old trusty digital model it doesn't show the city code but just \"CITY\". Useless.",

I find it to be about 10degrees higher than ambient temperature, so I just keep that in mind when looking. The altimeter and compass seem to be spot on. It does take more time than desired to catch the GPS time, but when it does, I love knowing it's spot on. It's attractive for a sport/outdoor watch, but I wouldn't wear it for a formal occasion.",

I have one criticism/concern: The crown only requires 1/2 a turn to lock. I have found on many occasions with simply movement of my wrist that the crown will unlock and release.

    "description": "Casio Protrek PRW6000Y-1A Atomic Solar Wristwatch\n\n\n\nCasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.\n\nToday, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time.
