Makes the experience much more fun for a minimal cost.",

It's a bit hard to control your swerving with these but obviously they make the game more fun by pretending you're steering. Getting these in a two pack is a must, never know when you'll have a friend who wants to play and there are two controllers on the Switch by default!",

The design is faulty IMHO. The underside of the top buttons are too large and hit the casing of the remote that's inserted, so it doesn't always depress the button. The slide on wrist straps that come with the remotes are a better design because the top buttons have a smaller point to depress the buttons and don't hit on the remote casing. Those work fine, but these steering wheel remotes just don't.",
