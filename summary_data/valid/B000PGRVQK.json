This cage is big enough to house two canaries comfortably and with the plastic guard it virtually eliminates the mess that come with keeping birds. Anyone that owns canaries is familiar with the fact that they love to bath daily. Which means they're splishing and splashing every time I change their water. They leave water stains on the walls and windows frequently. With the mess guard my walls (and floors) are free of any water and seeds. It is a hassle taking out the tray and cleaning it every so often but that's a small price to pay considering...",

When the time is right, I'll replace my other two with Vision cages for sure. I would recommend them to friends and family. By the way, my birds include parakeets, canaries and zebra finches.",

Actually, I've found that a roll of parchment paper from the grocery store is the most economical way to cover bird cage floors.

    "description": "Size:SmallThe Vision Small Bird Cage #S01 is a suitable cage for budgies, canaries, lovebirds and finches. It provides your bird with lots of room to move around and Vision makes it easy for you to take care of your bird. Bird movements cause air currents, which flow outwards, and in the case of most standard bird cages these air currents eject waste and seed debris outside of the cage and onto the floor. With Vision Cages, the combination of the debris guard, the deep base and the placement of the seed/water cups helps combat air currents to keep the majority of the waste and debris inside the cage. This reduces the amount of mess and time-consuming clean ups, leaving you more time to enjoy your pet. The Vision Small Bird Cage is a great home for your new bird. Dimensions : Horizontal wire :0.06 inch, Vertical wire : 0.10 inch, Wire spacing (center to center) : 0.48 inch",
