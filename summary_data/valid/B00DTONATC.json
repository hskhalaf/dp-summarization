I am amazed at how much nicer my pantry looks with these set up and how much easier it is to see the cans. I did lose a little space from just stacking them up, but I can see clearly what I have. The shelves are not the most stable and I wouldn't stack them on top of each other. Once they are set up in single file, however, they are fine. I especially like that the separators can be adjusted for different can sizes. The shelves are not so close together that you cannot see back at what is deeper on the shelf.",

First, the packaging for this product is perfect, with all of the pieces wrapped in plastic. And I was pleased (and somewhat shocked) at how heavy-duty this one was - definitely not a cheap lightweight rack. Assembling it took all of two minutes, and the manufacturer actually emailed additional/clarifying instructions once my order was received. If you follow them (including drawings), it's impossible not to assemble it correctly - and quickly. I don't give many products five stars, but this rack is the real deal. Now my pantry is really organized!",

The paper attached to the sides tell you which side faces out, so perhaps that is new after other reviewers said they had problems.

I assembled it, disassembled it, and reassembled it all with no problems (1st assembly took me less than 5 minutes). Due to all the complaints on assembly, the seller sent an e-mail shortly after the order was made with additional tips and tricks, which was appreciated but unnecessary once I received it and saw how simple a device it actually is. Great product, great seller. Will be checking out their other products.",

The rack fits a surprisingly large number of cans! I would recommend purchasing this product.",

I was shocked at all of the random cans I had too many of because I just keep re-purchasing the items when I can't find them. What I will be saving in outdated, repurchased canned goods will more than pay for this investment.",

But it's far from a fatal flaw - I've never seen a solution like this that didn't have that same problem. So I would definitely recommend this for pantry storage.",
