For those considering this, there is a new model that is said to be greatly improved an puts it on par with the better Sony RX100 models. I was excited to have the eyepiece viewfinder, but realized atf it takes the camera a bit too far out of the \"pocket\" category. The new model is pricier, but has a retractable eyepiece, a better sensor 4k video and solid software. Yes, the camera does reasonably well but I was hoping for something more.",
