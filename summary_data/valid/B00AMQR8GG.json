      "text": "Purchased these in July 2016 for $32.99, listed on the manufacturer's website as $69.99 and currently listed here at $99.99. Would not pay anymore than $32.99. Anything more is a rip off. At the price I paid, they are a practical and economical way to combat hearing loss in my child when he uses them on planes and on long drives as they are limited to 80dB on the kids setting, which lights up so you know what setting the little ones are using. With this in mind they have good audio performance with clear highs and deep bass. Another plus is the tangle-free cord. Downside is the requirement for a AAA battery.",

They also unplug entirely from the headphones so my kid can't run aroumd with the cord dragging behind him.

I bought them mainly due to their volume limiting feature, but the quality of other Fuhu products we own extend to these as well. They come with 2 detachable plug wires, so you'll have a replacement when needed. Even the packaging is outstanding.",

I have one child that barely uses them and when he does he can barely hear from them. My other child uses them all the time and the same situation. Don't spend the money on them...you might as well spend the extra money and get a pair of Beats for you kid.",

Not one product photo shows the headphones as they would appear during actual use. Have to read complete product reviews to ensure they are not wireless. My son fell in love with them out of the box now we are stuck with headphones that are wired when we expected a wireless set. For this price I could have purchased a decent wireless set for my son to use.",
