I returned both and switched to another brand, really wanted a jacket with pink in it, but this was the only one with pink and the sizing was just not proportioned correctly which is important when using it the cold waters of lake michigan.",

If you're considering a wetsuit, I highly recommend getting 2 pieces instead of a jump suit. There are lots of times when I get too hot and have to take the jacket off and just wear the pants... Can't do that with a one piece. The jacket appears to be very good quality and has been laundered once on the hand wash cycle of my front loader and hung to dry inside with no problems.",

Don't worry if you need to snug the waist line a bit because there is a draw string. I won't need it but its there. Most Neoprene suits are somewhat uncomfortable because they try to make you conform to their stiff nature. Since the shoulders, arms and sides are lycra there isn't an unnatural pulling around the shoulders and underarms. I will be able to use this for cold days to bike, do rowing, or swimming. If there was another pattern I would buy a second one. It very nice",
