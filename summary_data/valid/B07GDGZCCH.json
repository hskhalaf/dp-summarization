At this point, to make the camera useable I remove and re-insert the battery which sets everything back to normal.",

Another issue is firmware update, it was impossible to do the upgrade through the phone app, I had to download file from GoPro website and do manual update, hope these issues can be fixed on future firmware. Other than that, it's an awesome camera.",

Nonetheless I\u2019m still a gopro fan, love how compact they are. The battery life in the 7 may be a little better than my 6 but nothing significant.

GoPro seems to have no solution for this fix and just sends you a battery as a \"sorry for the inconvenience\". I know you can just leave the battery outside the unit, but if i'm paying $300 for a camera, why do I, the consumer, have to worry about that? Best part is that my fathers unit is perfect and doesn't die overnight. Returning, and might just get the DJI. THANKS GOPRO",

It also doesn't retain the setting after rebooting the camera. This is far from idea for example if you're trying to film from inside a car where the interior is much darker than the outside. Otherwise, i felt it was very easy to use with great video quality.",

Issues : heats up very quickly Battery life is poor when you record 4k videos .",

The additional size and weight makes it a bit clunky compared to the session. The battery seemed to not last as long. It's easy to swap them out, however so this isn't much of an issue.",
