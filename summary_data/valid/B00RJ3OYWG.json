I started wearing these regularly and my headaches are significantly less frequent, my eye fatigue is almost gone, and I can go without worrying about damaging my ocular muscles. As a 1/2 blue blocker, it's not as yellow as some other computer glasses I've put on, but I much prefer these. Things that aren't actually white don't look yellow after you adjust to them. Plus... they're really cute. I actually found myself wanting to wear them more than I needed to at first.",

If you are accustomed to wearing glasses a lot and with dark frames then they likely won't bother you. They are pretty comfortable on.",

I purchased these since the $40 price tag was more reasonable than spending $100 or more through my eye doctor. What a godsend they've been!

If you have recently had cataract surgery, consider these. After wearing these glasses for a few hours at the computer, it was the first time in two weeks that I didn't have a need for eye drops.",

The most premium thing about these is the packaging and carrying case. Some of that money should have been used towards a stouter pair of glasses.",

And they are cute, comfortable, and lightweight. The lenses are more or less clear, and I can barely notice a difference in the colors on my computer screen (which, as a graphic designer, is important). The price is great, too, especially compared to similar products. Very glad I found these!",

These glasses have made a HUGE difference in the eye fatigue and headachy feeling I usually have at the end of each day. I highly recommended you try them if you experience eye strain or headaches in artificial light or when using LED devices - computers, laptops, etc. They are super lightweight and look just like contemporary reading glasses.

I work for the Florida Legislature and I own my own photography business, so I am on the computer A LOT! When looking at the glasses you don't notice the yellow tint, which I like. Also, I really love the frame shape and the splash of red. They are very trendy and look good (not huge on my face). They are very lightweight and came with a great case to store them in. So far I am extremely happy with my purchase.",

Well, I've been using this product for almost a week, and it blew my mind , I literally can stare at a computer screen for HOURS on end without feeling anything , it's like my eyes don't even detect any sort of blue light, it's amazing.
