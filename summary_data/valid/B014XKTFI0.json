They look awesome, got a lot of compliments, and they are comfortable to wear. Crashed hard a few times and the magnets held, never fell out once; I watched my friend fall multiple times and his expensive anons wouldn't hold up as well. The clarity through the lenses are fantastic too. These are beyond worth the purchase.",

It has a magnetic lens, which is very neat because you don't even really need to remove your goggles if you want to scratch your eye or something.. just pop the lens off and put it back on after. But at the same time its strong enough that the lens didn't detach even once during my numerous falls! I hope they release more lens options for these, I'm definitely going to snatch a few up.. maybe a yellow one for clarity.

I thought they'd have a red tint internally to contrast snow - they don't. It's just a clear view, slightly darkenened. I hope they have a lense that actually shows variations in the snow!? Also, someone please confirm if the Anon lenses will fit?? As I'm assuming they'd do a better job...(yes - I removed the protective plastic film from the lens and rode in them for several hours).",

The dark lens looks awesome with a cool reflective look, but are no good for night (which is why i plan on buying the transparent lens).

If they goggles fog up, they usually clear up within a couple seconds.",

The magnetic connections are great when skiing (in-bounds) and make a really great lunch/drink conversation when you are in the bar.",

For the price, I'm pretty sure its impossible to beat the looks, comfort, and function of these goggles. As a casual snowboarder, its not worth spending hundreds on big name goggles when these are so much cheaper and practically just as good.",

The 10% lenses were great for sunny days, and ordered some 65% for those overcast days. The ability to switch lenses is awesome. One negative - I tried to wear fairly small glasses under them (I just need them at twilight especially) and couldn't make it work. The glasses would get pushed against my eyes.",

That's why I have now have 2 pairs fo goggles: these for bright lights and a second pair for low/flat light conditions. I'm now a happy advanced skier!",

The tint looks great, magnetized lens feels really sturdy and I was most surprised by the box it arrived in. Being a cheaper goggle I didn\u2019t expect much but was amazed when it came in an even nicer box than the dragon brand did, Along with the included lens bag.
