My skin is usually so sensitive that it breaks out from EVERYTHING, but was also so itchy. Tried La Mer, La Prarie- I'm willing spend the $$$$ but why??? Grape seed oil from Sky Organics beats them all . I keep mine in the refrigerator , use a few drops and my skin is hydrated and not ittated . Great, great product .",

Also, the pump is so handy. I will be buying this again when I run out.",
