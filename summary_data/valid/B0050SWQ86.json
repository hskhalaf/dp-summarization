Was very happy with the deal I got as well and the shipping time and the condition of the product and packaging itself. Love the upgraded sleek look over the old bulkier looking model. Mine is still going strong to this day with ZERO problems. We use our PS3 almost every day to play games on and also as our home DVD/BR/entertainment system. Couldn't be happier with this product, would recommend!",

They repackaged it and sold it as new to me. It doesn't say anything like that in the product description. I complained to Blinq and they said they would contact me within 24 hours but now it's been over a week with no contact. On top of that, my unit had some problems but i've got everything working now. This is the first problem that I've ever had with ordering through Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying from Blinq.",

I traded up from a 32GB difference and it feels great. I was a bit worried about the new system hearing that some thought the sliding disc tray was cheap, but actually I really like it, I didn't find it cheap at all, probably my favorite iteration of the ps3 console, sleek and very light with reduced energy output, I recommend this bundle for anyone looking to upgrade or as a gift.",

So to satisfy my gaming I bought a PS3. I wish I would have know before I bought the Xbox how much better the PS3 was. Runs quite and just seems more reliable. The games run smoother it is just a better system. I guess if I ever get the xbox back from Microsoft I'll trade it for more PS3 games.",

The lack of backwards compatibility is disappointing, but to be honest, I rarely used it on the old PS3. This version is much lighter than the original, but it's also flimsy. The disc slot has a strange garage-door like opening that feels like it's going to break off at any moment. Other than that, it plays games, so there's not much else to say.",

The bundle seems like a really good deal for 500GB capacity. You get AC III also and one wireless controller.
