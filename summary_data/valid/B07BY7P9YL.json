I mix 1 cup of So Delicious Unsweetened Organic Almond milk with cashews, a heaping scoop of this + 1.5 tap of MCT oil and have that for breakfast or lunch. It tastes GREAT! I still can't rave enough about my skin clarity and what seems to be volume coming back in a healthy glow kind of way. I can tell it's working from the inside out. I highly recommend.",

My body functions best with beef, and I love that Nature's Property, has only grass-fed beef in its protein powder. What I was the most surprised with Nature's Property pure unflavored bone broth, was the taste, even using two dates as a sweetener, the other brand still had a slight 'meaty' aftertaste, which isn't great in a fruit smoothie. Nature's Property tastes great and is my new favorite, as it has a very pleasing and delicious flavor. I love it.",

      "text": "This stuff is delicious and easy on the stomach. Mixes well with water, almond milk, and milk. Due to my ignorance, I was worried that it would have at least some hint of a beefy flavor of some sort because of its bone broth derivative, but I was really off-base. Most protein powders give me a stomach ache or cause some sort of indigestion but not this stuff. I\u2019m really pleased with its nutrient profile and taste. I\u2019ll be ordering this consistently from now on.",

I tried various bone broth powders but they didn't always blend well, there was a texture issue or a slight taste. This bone broth protein is the BEST! No flavor at all, blends in perfectly with all my food and no weird texture. I will definitely be buying more.",

      "text": "After trying this collagen powder I will not be ordering it again. It has a scent that is difficult to overcome. It's not that I taste it when put in a shake, but there is an unavoidable odor that makes it difficult to drink. It would be fine mixed into something savory like a soup, but not good at all in a green/fruit smoothie. Also, when I add it before blending, it creates a result that is mostly froth. The only way I can use it and keep the smoothie drink-like is to add it after pureeing the other ingredients and only pulse it a couple of times.",
