I bought aftermarket adapter and cable and it fixed the issue. However, now that the device is 1.5 years old, it now had a defect in the screen. There is a fairly-wide vertical strip that is \"yellowish\" in color. it won't go away. The computer is just not good.",

The keys are not the most responsive so you end up with typos, which is annoying when it's messing up with your passwords... Otherwise, it's a very solid buy.",

So I feel swindled because no where does it say this!
