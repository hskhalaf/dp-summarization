      "text": "A solid game that starts out strong but goes downhill fast after the player escapes from the plantation house and abandons its Texas Chainsaw atmosphere and aesthetic for the utterly cliche\u0301 \"young dark-haired girl with supernatural powers\" trope and the less interesting environs of a wrecked tanker and salt mine. It also has very little replay value due to the abundance of scripted sequences, static puzzles and almost complete lack of meaningful player choice. All that said you'll have a blast on your first play-through and it's certainly better than the last entry in the main series.",

It's atmospheric, and that's even without vr! Turn the graphics up to break your computer though, played on medium settings, really feeling I need an upgrade soon.",
