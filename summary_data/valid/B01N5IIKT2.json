      "verdict": "The carefree, relaxed style of the Keds Champion Sweatshirt Jersey makes it a highly qualified pick for spring and summer. Tucked under its heathered jersey cover is a blend of striking features that provide undeniable comfort, flexibility, and durability. The cushioned bed, pliable rubber outsole, and top-to-bottom hard-wearing materials on this revitalized version are among the exact reasons why the highly desired old-time classic hasn\u2019t lost its charm and remain a champion to this day.",

      "text": "I've been searching for a casual sneaker to wear with leggings, and these are great - they look good and feel good. I've always liked Keds and the dark grey makes these just a little more sophisticated and versatile than then classic white canvas. One note on the product description - the color is listed as \"brown\" but they are a very dark charcoal grey. I had found this style in a local store and they didn't have my size, so I snapped a photo of the label and the box and found them online, so I wasn't surprised that they weren't brown as stated in the color choice. Pretty true to the color shown in the photo.",

      "text": "I used to love Kids for their comfort. I needed a pair of shoes to stick in my briefcase for running through airports and these looked cute. I also thought since they were made from Champion sweatshirt material they would be soft and comfy. When they arrived, they were stiff as cardboard and tight across the arch. They feel cheap. I wore them a few times hoping they would soften up but they are just stiff and NOT comfortable. Very disappointed.",
