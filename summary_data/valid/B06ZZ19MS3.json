Hope on the next release of this product you can adjust the brightness of the screen or change screen color. Other than that this product works as intended. The different modes is a cool feature.

I have relief from scar tissue, pinched nerves and loss of sleep. My opinion is that you don't have to spend a lot for muscle stimulatiors to get good results. The process is simple once you have done it just once. Thank for a great product.",

      "text": "Lots of power for a tiny machine that is hardly bigger than a credit card. I do wish there was a setting that was simply a steady vibe rather than those that sort of morph in and out, up and down (hence the 4 stars.) Sometimes a steady unwavering stream would be preferred - I know this is available w some machines. That said, I am very happy with how well it performs. Came with all necessary cables, charging cord, storage bag. It's quite compact - fits in my purse and it very easy to take with me for long days. Happy with this purchase, and would recommend it.",

However, I still have occasional issues. Sometimes it's just time to turn the mattress. But 10 minutes with the TENS and I'm ready to go! For me, just placing pads on my back above and below the waist line does it. I have not had a need to use it elsewhere. So, for muscular backaches, this does the trick.",

Two for my dad for his knees (I got him one and he liked it so much he asked for a second so he can do both knees at one time), one for my brother in law for his back and one for my neck. There are many different settings so you can find one that works best for you. It is powerful and it really works!",
