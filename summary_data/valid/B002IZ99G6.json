Instead, I purchased this extension and moved the charger to another part of the garage and it works great. The cable was just long enough to reach where I wanted the charger mounted. Very pleased with it. Most reviews here are for a welder but it works great for electric vehicle chargers.",

It takes some grunting to unplug one machine, and I don't quite feel comfortable with that and having 220v right in my (gloved) hands. Hopefully I'll have a subpanel installed in the next month or so, then these cables will let me move both tools around the shop with ease.",

      "title": "Great Heavy Duty Extension",
      "text": "If you need to be able to move your 240v welder away from the power source this very heavy duty extension is the way to go. I considered building one myself, but couldn't keep the price anywhere near this one. The connectors are very nice. I have used this quite a bit within the last couple of weeks of purchase and know it will hold up for some time. One thing of note is that the outer blue skin is prone to scratches from being dragged across the cement, but to me that is not a deal breaker.",
