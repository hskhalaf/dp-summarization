What I like about this unit is that it\u2019s a variable speed fan, not the typical single speed, and adjust its speed automatically as needed. What I don\u2019t like about this unit is, that its very loud. Mine is install in the 2nd floor attic, and I can hear it from my 1st floor master bedroom, has a very loud hum through the wall. Can be a little annoying during hot summer nights. I\u2019m planning on remounting, using some kind of insulator. Hopefully that will help with the noise level.",

      "text": "The overall quality, function, and noise level of the fan are good. I installed this in November in the Pacific Northwest, and was surprised that the fan never turns off. I suspected it was the humidistat keeping the fan running, but called to clarify. I was informed the fan will continue to run if the humidity level is over 65%. My attic is very dry, but the humidity level in the area is well over 65% through the winter. Therefore, unless I want the fan to be running 24/7, a separate thermostat switch will need to be added. It would be nice to have a solution for this issue in the original set up of the fan.",

The fan responds exactly as described, I'll never need to worry about unplugging it for the winter, or setting a thermostat. Even at maximum speed it takes less than 150 watts and pumps a massive amount of air. I've built electronically controlled motors myself -- the engineers who designed this motor really know their business. None of this would matter if the attic didn't see a significant temperature difference, but it's cooler by about 30 degrees! I think this fan will pay for itself in less than one year in reduced air conditioner use. Thanks, Amazon and Quiet Cool.",

This fan removed that heat and the house feels more balanced. The AC runs for a shorter amount of time now since it has less less work to do. You will not regret buying this product.
