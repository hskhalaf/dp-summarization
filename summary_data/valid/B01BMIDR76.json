      "text": "This is a really nice item! Arrived in two boxes on pallets. Lots of pieces, but instructions are straight forward. You will need at least two people for the assembly. The key to it putting it together is to not completely tighten the nuts and bolts until they are all installed. Once you have it together, square it up and tighten the frame first then the roof panels. We anchored two of the legs on one side once the frame was built, then finished putting it together followed by squaring it up, tightening and anchoring the other two legs. Very happy with purchase.",

Assemble time was the only downfall; lots of little pieces. With two people it still took a day, but it is sturdy and looks like it cost more than what I paid.

It took a certain amount of shimmying and elbow grease to get it to line up enough to put the screws through. Tip for buyers: organize all parts prior to assembling. There are many parts and the instructions are not very descriptive. It's basically only pictures.",
