I am a dog walker, so the pockets see frequent use for holding and retrieving pick-up bags, treats, etc. It is relatively windproof, but if you are in a lot of wet weather, do not count on this jacket keeping you dry. I can't believe how flimsy the pockets are (zipper and lining).",

Even in fall and such I run warmer than most so I like how you can use this as a great raincoat but also a lil light jacket so you're warm not hot. The jacket pockets are awesome. The hood is A bit odd but I don't mind it. Something looser, better than velcro would be nice but it's not bad at all! Highly highly recommend buying especially at the price",

I usually only wore my thermal shirt underneath during temperatures in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s and was comfortable. Only drawback for me was that if you lean your head back far enough while fully zipped up and hood secure, there is a gap where your neck is exposed, but I did not find this to be a major problem.",

Keys and a dog waste bag are the heaviest things for which I used them.I have had no issues with the top breast or inside pockets. Another downside to this jacket is the lack of a breath ability. The length of my arms sweat when wearing in rainy warmer weather.",

The part that attaches together with Velcro in the front just sticks out when just wearing the jacket and looks odd to me. Makes me think of a \"penguin look\" too when the Velcro is together lolz Live in Pacific NW so really going to test this baby",
