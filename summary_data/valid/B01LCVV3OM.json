      "title": "Delicious REAL Peanut Butter",
      "text": "This is REAL peanut butter -- not the stuff most of us grew up with. Rather, this is simply ground peanuts with nothing else added. Therefore, the oil will separate over time requiring it be stirred before using. Optionally, you may pour off the oil and use it in cooking; however, that dries out the peanut butter and makes it less pliable. Another option is stirring well, then refrigerating...but that challenges spreadability. Your best bet is simply to enjoy this excellent product the way nature intended...and be glad you're not ingesting hydrogenated oils, palm oil, sugar, salt, and other stabilizers! Enjoy this very healthful product! I eat it with heart-healthful celery!!",
