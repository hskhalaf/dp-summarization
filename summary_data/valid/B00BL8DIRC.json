      "text": "Firstly, they were too warm for comfort, but that was partially my fault for not checking the material. The biggest problem is that everything about this was obviously cheap construction. The night mask only has a single strap along the middle; that puts uncomfortable pressure across the eyes. The stitching around the button holes was loose and would constantly catch when manipulating the buttons through the holes. The final straw was after the first washing a large seam in the elbow came undone. I've only gotten a single month's of inconsistient usage out of it before it just completely fell apart.",

They fit nicely and comfortably. The sleeves are a little long for him, but that's good for other guys. I'm just going to do a little altering and the sleeves will be perfect. The fabric is so nice. Perfect for our upcoming cruise and our room with a balcony.",
