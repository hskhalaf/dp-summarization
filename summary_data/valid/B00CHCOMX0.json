I decided upon this food for its ingredients. This food did not cost any more than the less efficient food I was feeding my dog. It took 1 week for my dog to make the transition and wow what a difference! Her stools are firm, no more problems with anal glands and she seems to have more pep! I hope I did the right thing for her.",

He's been eating it for about a week, so maybe too soon to tell if it is helping his skin, but he goes nuts for this food. I think it might be the best thing he's ever tasted. He literally waits by the pantry hoping we're going to give him more. Yes, it's more pricey than most food, but I feel really good about the fact that I can read the majority of the ingredients and based on how crazy he goes for it! I would definitely recommend this if you love your dog :)",
