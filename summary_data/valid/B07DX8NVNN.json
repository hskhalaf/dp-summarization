      "text": "Everyone who received a gift from me in one of these bags loved it. They're really nice, cute, and durable. They don't stand up very well on their own, but once I laid the gift down flat on the bottom of the bag and put tissue paper inside it's fine. I did find that I had to use more tissue paper with these bags than with regular paper bags. I think it's because the fabric bags are more flappy (if that makes sense) and it took a bit more paper to fill the opening hide the gift. Not a big deal, but just something to keep in mind.",

They are perfect for larger and heavier gifts that would probably tear a paper bag. Also, perfect for items that don't wrap well or need a big ugly box. I'm going to check and see if they make a more generic (non-Christmas) version.",
