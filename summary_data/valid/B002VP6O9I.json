But having used this piece three times in one month, I was pleasantly surprised my jackets & pants remained fresh. TRAVELERS TIP: Before packing, have your dry cleaner press (or clean) each suit and wrap separately in plastic. Keep the plastic around each suit - it helps with preventing wrinkles while the luggage is in transit. Lastly, I was able to pack an overcoat (which did wrinkle a bit due to its length), 3 suits (and matching pants) and two slacks. Any more items and you're rolling the dice.",

It would have been nice to put a couple in the corners where suit shoulders aren't using space.

The construction is good for the price-point and I especially like the pockets for your shoes which kept the black polish off my white shirts. Only issue I have is that the the extending handle is a bit weak when you strap a second bag to it. It flexes some and feels like it might bend or break. Also the handle does not lock when fully extended so it is pull only as pushing causes the handle to retract. All in all a good bag for the price.",

However, this case lacks an inner-zipped cover, and it hangs from the bottom (wheel side). I don't think it was designed to be packed or unpacked while hanging, since the inside pocked upens downward when it is hanging. Adequate for the price.",
