Placed it in two places where mosquitoes always were, one was under my deck. I even put mosquito bait in it. In about 6 days I think it caught 15 mosquitoes. The sad part is it caught a ton of moths and other beneficial insects.",

I\u2019m lead to believe the trap is broken...even though the fan runs. I\u2019ll reach out to dynatrap to see if they will make this right.",

It did a superb job of catching moths. But I STILL cannot sit on my patio without being bitten! I went through the entrails, and not one single mosquito among the corpses. Yes, it catches bugs. No, it does not catch the bugs I want gone!",

We have had the dyna on for about 4 weeks now and it\u2019s been filled up (totally full) twice. The population of insects has dropped drastically and we are cooking out, enjoying happy hour, and even playing cards in the evenings.

Each trap comes with two UV bulbs that provide a powerful lure to flying insects while the extra-large size is capable of trapping more insects than ever before. The size of the trap isn\u2019t the only extra-large update made as these traps now provide protection for up to 1 acre of your property. The DynaTrap XL Mosquito and Insect Trap was designed to be simple to use. First, a UV fluorescent bulb generates a warm light, attracting insects. Then a second lure, an exclusive Ti02 titanium dioxide-coated surface, produces CO2 that's irresistible to mosquitoes. Third, a powerful yet whisper-quiet vacuum fan sucks insects into the retaining cage where they dehydrate and die.",
