If you REALLY want to unlock its horsepower, spend some time watching videos and reading the manual \u2014 there's a lot of functionality under the hood. There are plenty of nice aftermarket lenses available. I recommend the Lumix 1:1.7/20 for day-to-day photos. I don't recommend this camera for someone with large, clumsy hands because the controls are pretty tight and small in an effort to squeeze everything in on the small camera body. And, buy some lens cap lanyards ... you're gonna wish you had some after you get the camera.",

Batteries last for about 2 hours. Now that it's been replaced by the EM-10 II, the older version is a steal!",

I got used to the smaller size very quickly. I attached a couple of the first pictures I took with it, fresh out of the box, in auto. Almost unbelievably, out of 16 million pixels, there are only 2 hot pixels. The video quality is excellent as is the stereo sound. I haven't tested the anti-wind setting yet for the audio, but I will soon.",

Right off the bat, the 3axis IS is vastly improved over the epm1. I can shoot at ISO3600 and get usable photos whereas on my epm1 I couldn't really use over 1000. I know there's a new processor and it does seem significantly quicker and jpgs look terrific. I normally shoot RAW but jpgs are quicker/easier when they come out this well.",

      "text": "So far I love it - Small camera that I can bring anywhere together with my 12-40mm f2.8 Olympus PRO lense and a portrait lense sigma 60mm f2,8, - I can use a very small bag. for a beginner like me this is my step up from the E-PM series, I did a lot of research and what I got is exactly what I need. I won't take full advantage of the OMD-EM1 or 5 so I don't need to spend the extra $$$ for it. Maybe in the future, for now this is a great camera for me.",

      "text": "Beautifully designed and handles very well. I purchased after shooting Canon 5D III and Sony A7 nearly exclusively for years and find the portability of the Olympus to be a very welcomed feature. You can't expect the same image quality but this camera certainly holds its own. The JPEGs are really nice at low ISO but the noise reduction is, in my opinion, a bit strong. I shoot RAW mostly and find that it does 95% of what I want it to do. You can't take a picture if the camera isn't with you. This camera is very compact and fits in very convenient places.",

It reminds me of my first 35mm camera which was an Olympus oh M1 back in 1970 something. It's lightweight small and yet takes wonderful pictures. It has a multitude of settings and interchangeable lenses. No regrets.",

    "title": "Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mirrorless Digital Camera (Black)- Body only",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Body only| Configuration:BaseThe new E-M10 boasts a powerful TruePic VII image processor, a large, interactive electronic viewfinder, built-in flash and Wi-Fi, a warp-speed AF system that allows sequential shooting at 8fps (yes, eight!), and much more. The sensor, image processor and lens technology are the core of any digital camera. The E-M10 ups the ante by pairing a 16MP Live MOS sensor with our most powerful TruePic VII image processor for extraordinary resolution and accurate color rendition. The OM-D E-M10\"s partner in photographic excellence is the acclaimed Olympus M.ZUIKO lens system, a family of professional-grade glass with digital optics that delivers unsurpassed resolution and overall image quality. Add 3-axis in-body image stabilization that compensates for horizontal and vertical angular shifts as well as rolling, and you have a camera that captures incredibly sharp images and video, yet is compact enough to bring just about anywhere. \n\nUse this comparison chart to compare all of the Olympus OM line.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nBUILT TO A HIGHER STANDARD.\nThe E-M10 boasts a powerful TruePic\u2122 VII image processor, a large, interactive electronic viewfinder, built-in flash and WiFi, a warp-speed AF system that allows sequential shooting at 8fps (yes, eight!), and much more. So ditch the bulky DSLR and lighten up with the E-M10.\n\nUnprecedented Image Quality That Exceeds Others in its Class\nThe lens technology, sensor and image processor are the core of any digital camera. The OM-D E-M10\u2019s partner in photographic excellence is the acclaimed Olympus M.ZUIKO lens system, a family of professional-grade glass that delivers unsurpassed resolution and overall image quality. The E-M10 ups the ante by pairing a 16MP Live MOS sensor with our most powerful TruePic VII image processor for extraordinary resolution and accurate color rendition. Add 3-axis in-body image stabilization that compensates for horizontal and vertical angular shifts (yaw/pitch) as well as camera shake along the optical axis (roll), and you have a camera that captures incredibly sharp images and video, yet is compact enough to bring just about anywhere.\n\nLens Options and Flashes for Every Conceivable Shooting Situation \nOnly Olympus offers such a wide array of portable, professional grade lenses. You can choose from no less than 17 Micro Four Third M.ZUIKO lenses -- an impressive assortment of fast primes, telephoto zooms and macros - to support your unique photographic style. A number of versatile external flashes (with wireless remote control capabilities) also play well with the E-M10 for situations that require additional lighting.\n\nDesign That Blends Classic Cool and Modern Performance\nWe believe that a go-anywhere camera designed for avid photographers should feel and look solid. That\u2019s why we built the E-M10\u2019s slim, elegant body out of metal, and tricked it out with meticulously engineered metal parts. (The 2x2 dial controls are particularly sweet!) The E-M10 just feels right, substantial yet perfectly balanced. It\u2019s only fitting that a beautiful camera like this takes such beautiful photos.\n\nKeep Your Eye on the Prize with the E-M10\u2019s Large, Easy-to-See EVF\nShooting at eye level is comfortably familiar. And when you get a live view of exposure, white balance and other useful information, and the ability to control highlights, shadows, colors and more \u2013 as you do with the E-M10\u2019s electronic viewfinder \u2013 you\u2019re in position to take some of the best photos of your life. You can also apply various framing grids and a leveling guide for composing better photos and even monitor video recording!\n\nThe high-res EVF (1.44 million pixels) provides 1.15x magnification, double-speed 120fps refresh rate and adaptive brightness technology, which automatically adjusts brightness to the optimum setting for a more natural display.\n\nA Wealth of Built-In Features\nThe E-M10 is a marvel of thoughtful design and useful functionality. Built-in Wi-Fi for easy image sharing and wireless control, built-in flash for filling in the shadows and numerous creative tools, tiltable LCD monitor with touch screen - there's more, but we don't have to do into all the impressive details here! It's not what you'd call inexpensive, but the value is clear.\n\nLife Moves Fast\u2026and the E-M10 is Designed to Keep Pace\nYou might want to wear your running shoes when using the E-M10. High-speed sequential shooting \u2013 at a best-in-class 8fps \u2013 and super high-speed FAST AF technology ensure that you won\u2019t miss the shot no matter how quickly your subject is moving. In fact, the autofocus tracking function is better than ever thanks to enhancements to the group target Continuous AF function. The E-M10 also provides an 81-point AF grid that covers the entire image frame, giving you more focus options than basic DSLRs.\n\nWith So Many Creative Tools, Finding the Shot Is Only the Beginning\nFocus peaking in manual focus mode. Color Creator. HDR and HDR bracketing. Twelve Art Filters and nine Art Effects. Photo Story (including a new Zoom In/Out theme). Photo and Movie Capture (high-quality stills while shooting a movie \u2013 at an insane 5fps in P/A/S/M mode). Live Composite Mode for capturing starscapes intuitively. The E-M10 offers you an incredible array of easy-to-use creative tools that can transform your photos from excellent to spectacular.\n\n\nSEE HOW THE OLYMPUS OM-D FAMILY COMPARES\n\n\nOM-D E-M1 OM-D E-M5 OM-D E-M10 Image Sensor 16.3 Megapixels 4/3 Live MOS 16.3 Megapixels 4/3 Live MOS 16.1 Megapixels 4/3 Live MOS Image Processor TruePic\u2122 VII\nwith Fine Detail Processing II TruePic\u2122 VI TruePic\u2122 VII\nwith Fine Detail Processing II Image Stabilization Built-in 5-Axis Image Stabilization\nwith Multi-Motion IS and IS-Auto Built-in 5-Axis Image Stabilization Built-in 3-Axis Image Stabilization\nwith Multi-Motion IS and IS-Auto AF System DUAL FAST AF System,\nContrast AF (81-pt) and\nOn-Chip Phase Detection (37-pt)\nAF, Focus Peaking and Magnifed\nFocus Assist Available FAST AF System,\nContrast Detection (35 Selectable AF Points),\nMagni ed Focus Assist Available FAST AF System,\nContrast Detection (81 Selectable AF Points),\nFocus Peaking and Magni ed Focus Assist Available Continuous Shooting 10fps (S-AF), 6.5fps (C-AF) 9fps (S-AF), 4.2fps (C-AF) 8fps (S-AF), 3.5fps (C-AF) ISO Sensitivity ISO Low (100), 200 - 25600 ISO 200 - 25600 ISO Low (100), 200 - 25600 Max.
