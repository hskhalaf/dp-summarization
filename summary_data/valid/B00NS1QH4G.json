Both dogs loved the taste and would readily eat this up when hydrated with a bit of water. The problem is that both dogs ended up with upset stomachs. I thought this was because this was new in their diets, so ordered a second bag to mix in to their current kibble. The diarrhea continued and one of the dogs ended up vomiting (bright green bits were thrown up) after the second day of mixing this in. Threw out the rest of the second bag unfortunately. This might just be my dogs, but I will not be purchasing again.",

I bought 4 bags. Opened 2 so far & both she's just not into. I've been throwing some of her portions away. I'm wondering if it's an Amazon storage thing?",

Now they stay by their bowl and do not leave till all gone. They even lick it clean. When I prepare the dinner for them they get excited and bark till they get it. When I put it down they jump and dance till it is on the floor. We recommend this product 100%.",

      "text": "My dog (55 lbs.) is highly treat motivated and also a picky eater. Meal Mixers work for her in both cases. These are expensive so I don\u2019t use them as a nutritional supplement; it\u2019s just a little something to pique her interest and that little can go a long way. The pieces are soft and super easy to shred, which is how I get a lot of mileage out of them. For her meals, I break up 3 pieces by rubbing them between two fingers for a few seconds and then mixing it in with her kibble. For training, I tear a piece apart with my nails and can still quickly reward her while keeping her caloric intake reasonable.",

Admittedly, I do add a dash of warm water and a few shreds of organic cheese. However, this is nothing compared to hours spent carefully cooking organic chicken broth with minced organic chicken... which she would reluctantly pick at. If you have a picky-eater, this just might do the trick!",

A whole bag of this stuff should last me a long time doing it this way. I have the chicken flavor and when it runs out will try one of the other flavors.
