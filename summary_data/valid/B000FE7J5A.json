I've seen the other reviews that say this paddle is a little heavy, but it feels just fine to me. Giving up weight is giving up strength.The paddle blades are very strong. Both the drip rings and the foam hand grips work very well. I wouldn't change a thing about this paddle. I just wish I could have gotten it with green blades to match my kayak, however Ireally do like the color it comes in though.",

The paddle is comfortable for longer trips and feels substantial. One thing that I noticed- is that the blades are well made and DO NOT buckle easily. You will notice SOME give if you use them to push off, but there is absolutely no give with harder paddling. I'd recommend this paddle to anyone.",

The blades do flex a little when paddling but not much and not to the point that they are going to break. Of course this paddle is heavier than a fancy carbon one but it's still not heavy. The weight is kind of subjective - if you are racing or performance kayaking then you are not going to be using a $30 paddle off amazon. Overall this is a great paddle so far.

I extended both our paddles to 96\" with aircraft aluminum tubing and they now work well. We also found that we could only use the paddle with the blades vertical.

The only downside I can note is that there is some minor flexing of the blades when pushing off--they could be more rigid. Overall, however, it's a great paddle and I'd recommend it for recreational paddlers.",

The lock is firm and it has no problem staying afloat. I'd give it five stars, but I wish the padded handle was a little more padded (though it does serve well in providing extra grip).",
