      "text": "I bought 2 of these for my garage. To make them hang at the correct height from a 9' ceiling, I cut the down rods short and drilled a few new holes. That worked like a charm. The fans move a lot of air and are quiet, except for the sound of the blades cutting through the air. I love the industrial look of these things. Both came with the huge fan speed controllers. I swapped those out for the normal size Westinghouse controllers available here on Amazon. Even with the added cost of the controller, this fan is a bargain. Highly recommended so far.",

Live in North Carolina so it is fairly humid but I am shocked and disappointed that these fans aren't designed to hold up better than this!",

So they are useless in a shop or barn environment this time of year. I have asked electricians if I can change the rotation by adding a switch and they said its not possible. wish I would have noticed this before renting a lift and mounting them. my bad.",

This is not like a ceiling fan you have in your bedroom with a little chain to control the speed settings. They wobble a bit, not too much. Air movement is adequate, but certainly was no clear about the wiring requirements for more than one fan.",

Sure, the switch is cool old-school and silly looking, but moreover, its 5 positions are redundant -- settings 1 or 2 produce no virtually no air movement, although I suppose some folks might like the ambiance of a slow-moving fan. At setting 5, it whirls pretty fast, but the three blades are limited. I even ordered a 24\" extension and it barely made a dent. In a very small enclosed room it might be sufficient.",

You have to throw the whole fan out and buy a new one. Or in my case, two new ones... I consider product support an important aspect of a purchase, which is why I'm giving these fans three stars.",

Instructions are easy if you've put up fans before, but did not quite match the model delivered. - Instruction mention blue wire (maybe for light), but this fan does not have. - It is easier to assemble the fan on the ground, and then put it up. Instructions do it the opposite way. - Instructions mention a short \"post\" for hanging fan, but that didn't come in the box. Looks great, though!",

My only criticism is it comes with a control box that is to be mounted on the wall. The box is not attractive and seems cumbersome for how things are made these days. Instead, we installed a switch with a control on the side. I suspect you could also connect it to a dimmer switch. Also, when on high it really does whip up some air and gives off a whirring sound like a plane or helicopter blade. But no one should need to run a fan that high!",
