Edit 10/15/18: I noticed that I had trouble tightening my right shoe. Come to find out, the adjustment strap near the exterior ankle area(see red oval) was sewn down. I took a seam ripper to remove a few stitches and it now adjusts properly.",

These are made really well and I think they would be extremely comfortable if it wasn't for the fact that they run a little on the small side. I wear an 8.5/9m so I went with a size 9. When I tried these on I realized I really should have ordered at 9.5. The heel of my foot is on the very edge of the show so after walking for a bit my heel really starts to bother me. Aside from the size issue, I do still believe these are great shoes and great quality.",

The shoes are ultra comfy and provide some toe protection so I used them when riding ATV's. These shoes are the all around perfect active foot ware for warm weather.",

The great thing about these is that I can put arch supports in them & they will stay. If you have really high arches, you might consider that. These will be great for playing outside with the kids this summer & a trip to the zoo & sea world.",
