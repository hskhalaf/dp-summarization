I got this hutch so that there was enough space for the bunnies and also, in case they didn't get along, there's a trap door that closes the top floor from the bottom floor. Well... One of the bunnies turned out to be male so the trap door is keeping him away from the female bunny and hopefully not getting me any extra bunnies in the near future. The hutch is quite large but not difficult to put together. I did it alone. I would suggest putting it together a few days before getting your new pet since it did smell a bit strongly. The smell dissipated after a few days.",

For our outdoor one we installed a K&H Small Animal Outdoor Heated Pet Pad in the top level and added a piece of Plexiglas covering the wire section of the top cage door to better contain heat. I treated the outdoor one with Thompson's water seal before assembling, and we keep it under a covered porch. I wouldn't expect it to hold up to the elements at all otherwise.

Like any pre-built cage, it is not super sturdy, so we did add some additional supports to make it a little stronger. The rabbit loves it, but unfortunately also loves to chew on it. The cage is used indoors and has a fence-type thing around it to give him more space to run. He has chewed on the edges of both of the doors when they are open and is able to quickly make quite a dent. Overall I am happy with the cage, I just wish the rabbit didn't want to eat it.",

      "text": "We have two buck rabbits and use this hutch on nice days outdoors. It actually sits on our porch in the shade. Being able to keep them separated was very important to us, as these are 4H show rabbits that cannot be neutered according to competition rules. We simply did not install the ramp. It was easy to put together and has been easy to maintain and clean. It has been a perfect addition to our rabbit project!",

      "text": "We bought this hutch to keep in our house for a rabbit. I love the size of the hutch and I like the way it looks. It did come with a couple pieces that were damaged but we were able to make them work. However within about 2 weeks our rabbit has figured out how to open the doors by lifting up on them to unlock the latch and get out. So we will be buying new latches. This was not a huge deal for us because the hutch is in the house but this could be pretty bad if the hutch was outside.",

When you look at the two front doors they are separate and one is supposed to go on top and the other down below. It took a little bit of thinking and putting the puzzle together. Recommend a drill to help put it together quicker. Over all though it is pretty solid. The wood is a bit cheap feeling. I am surprised the rabbit has not eaten the thing yet. I would recommend getting it though!",
