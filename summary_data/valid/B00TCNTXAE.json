Since she was mostly outdoors all her 14+ years, she's been a bit picky about what she eats. Since she also has lost many teeth and has a tendency for UTIs, I wanted simple, grain-free, real (and wet) food for her. I'm using a mixture of this, the Chicken formula and the low-ingredient Turkey formula. She's been eating it right up and we're on our 4th case now, so I think this is going to do it for us.",

About three days after feeding this to him he was like a different cat. His fur became sleek and soft, he lost weight and became more muscular and limber, and his personality changed. He was much more alert and engaging. It sounds like an exaggeration but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a great food for a great price.",

It has been one month now without any of the described problems occurring.",

It's packed very densely and takes some smushing to mix well with water after being chilled, and the 'jelly' never quite mixes into the water, but my my cat loves it.",
