    "description": "Battle Back Bone Back Plate\nWe know football protection and performance like it's our job. Because it is. The Battle Back Plate is designed to deliver maximum protection and comfort to players of all ages, and the football back shield is an effective and reliable protector for the lower back, kidneys and spine.\n\nCurved Back Protector\nThe Battle Back Plate absorbs impact to your back region, acting as a buffer against the hardest hits on the football field. The interior backing of the back plate is a high impact foam. Compared to flat backplates, the unique design of Battle's curved back shield ensures maximum energy and impact disbursement, as well as being much more comfortable to wear with your football pads.\n\nEasy Fitting\nThe sleek and lightweight rear shield pads are available in Youth and Adult sizes to ensure the perfect fit, and in a range of bold and vibrant colors. The back protector is designed with strong attachment straps to keep the backplate close to your back - floppy back plates won't protect you from painful blind side hits. Hardware is supplied, and the back protector plate can be hand washed as required.\n\nBattle - The Highest Standard of Sports Safety\nHere at Battle, we know the feeling well. Former athletes and now passionate weekend warriors, we know all too well the agony that sports injuries can bring. By blending cutting-edge science with a keen understanding of the athlete, we produce some of the finest sports safety equipment anywhere, and will continue to push the envelope to make sports safer in the days to come.",
