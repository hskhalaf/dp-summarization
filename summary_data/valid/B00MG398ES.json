This blade has a built in seal/gasket that you place on the container and then you screw on the plastic piece to hold the blade in place with no leaks.",

However, now that it has been only 5 months that I used it, the bottom cap has broken altogether on the replacement piece. I don't use it for smoothies even, so cant be a fault of usage. Never fell either. I use it only for milkshakes of fruits and ice cream. This shouldn't have happened. I have owned blenders that have lived for 20 years or more with this kind of use.

When it started it just about blew the lid off the top of the blender - well it did even though I held my hand down on the lid it had too much power for me. Would be a great blender for more than just liquids I think as I'm sure it has enough power to blend anything. Just can't use it for my purpose.",

I am using this blender to make frozen fruit smoothies and it is working great! The problem that I think see in the negative review is that they are ether stacking all the ingredients wrong, and/or they just forcing the blender to do certain tasks. Sometimes the blade will get stuck (Happened only once for me), but you have to stop the blender and let the drink resettle. I recommend using the pulse mode, rather than the smoothie mode.",
