I now have a size 6 and if I was going off of dance shoe etiquette, where the shoe is basically another set of skin, I could have gone down at least another half shoe size. But these are for cosplay and not a perfomance and they are wonderful.",

If these are to be worn as dance shoes, they should fit like second skin, but that's hard to do with the information provided for sizing: \"Little kid\"? \"Big kid\"? \"LEN??\" It's only when it arrives in the mail that you see that the European sizes, which are typically fairly accurate, are included, but only inside the shoe (not on the website). I purchased one, which was baggy; returned for the next smaller size, returned them and just gave up, because the event that I needed them for was the next day. They're pretty cheaply made, so they might hold up for a few wearings.",
