When we got the product and assembled it, we noticed that it was making a grinding noise around 10 setting and we called tech-support and they said it was normal and that we should try to use the setting just above that for the finest grind. We tried using that for making espresso and it was far too course to be used. Very disappointed. Contacted them again and they said the grinding is normal at 10 and to try gronding beans lower for espresso. Seemed to grind ok at 6.",

Cons: Cleaning is challenging, grinds have a tendency to static cling to upper shoot resulting in grinds spilling on counter. Overall: I recommend buying this burr grinder for someone who is looking to get the most out of their coffee brewing equipment. It takes more effort to maintain then a simple blade grinder, but the quality, adjustability, and ability to replace the burrs make this a good option for someone looking to upgrade their grinding equipment.",

      "text": "I am real happy with the Baratza Conical grinder. We've used a smaller/cheaper grinder for years, but it uses blades to chop the beans instead of burrs that actually grind the beans. I've read for some time that grinding is better and I am now a firm believer. We've enjoyed several pots of great coffee and wish we'd made the change much sooner. This grinder is considerably less expensive than others making it a great grinder for those wanting to \"taste\" the difference, but don't want to shell out 2-3 hundred dollars.",

I tried a few more batches at finer and finer grind settings all with the same boulder output. A quick trip the the Common Problems section of the Baratza website and there was my problem! I made thr necessary change and have been grinding perfect coffee every mornin since. Could be a tad quieter, but it\u2019s not really an issue.",

It will grind finer than what would use, so with setting scale going from 0 to 40, I use a setting around 10. My only complain is the length of the cord, which seems very long and it is bulky. I wish there is a way to tuck it inside of the grinder body so only a necessary length would stick out. Really, this is a minor gripe, the grinder itself is great so far. This is a first impression review. I will update if encounter any issues down the road, but so far I\u2019m very pleased.",
