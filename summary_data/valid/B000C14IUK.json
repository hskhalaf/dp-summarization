She was able to ride without training wheels and without hurting her knees. I also didn't have to go out and buy a whole new bike which was super.",

We just needed a taller post for the six year old\u2019s 12\u201d bike, ended up cutting an inch off to make it work. Little guy has a new bike coming for his birthday. This hand-me-down trainer just needed a bit more height to be comfortable until then. One other thing, there is a nifty safety line so you don\u2019t over extend the height. And it is chrome steel, so not for weight reduction for races but plenty strong.",
