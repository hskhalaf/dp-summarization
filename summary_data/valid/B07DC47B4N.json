My baby has severe reflux and spits up ALL the time, sometimes it feels like it\u2019s his whole meal... these burp cloths do a great job absorbing all the fluid and cleaning up the mess. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the inside layer on some of them seem to be balling up a little bit after washing and I can\u2019t get them to lay flat anymore. It\u2019s not a huge deal to me, but I\u2019m not sure how they will fare long term.",

Upon arrival I loved the size and thickness, but after the first wash the insides balled up like other reviews mentioned and they are difficult to straighten out. The material isn\u2019t absorbent either so most of what is spit up onto these just slides off making them pretty ineffective. I am sad because I loved the prints and the size, but in the end it was a waste of money- should have gone with Copper Pearl after all.",
