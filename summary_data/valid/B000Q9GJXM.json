      "text": "knives a while ago, in red, and decided to get one. Glad it comes in black because I'm removing all the colored cutlery (mostly paring knives) from the kitchen. Knife itself cuts tomatoes well. Guess if you're not careful, you could easily slice through a finger. Textured plastic makes this better than the KR tom knife. Handles well and sits well in my hand. Based on my memory of my old Messermeister serrated knife,, the plastic on this is much rougher around the seams, especially noticeable on the protective sheath. Fine where the sheath is concerned, but would prefer not to see hanging plastic on the handle. Best in its price range.",

My father adores heirloom tomatoes, and comes home from the farmer's market with huge bags filled with them, every Sunday the entire time they are in season. I bought this knife for him a few years back -- the reviews were great, and I figured that if it turned out to be junk, I'd only be out twelve bucks, and could always upgrade to a higher price-point if necessary. It has exceeded all reasonable expectations. It's still sharp as the day it came in the mail, and it cuts tomatoes perfectly. I recommend this to anyone.",
