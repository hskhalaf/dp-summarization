For two speeds and extra power, I later bought the corded version. Bought one of those for my son for Christmas. He raved about it. So now I have both and use them each according to conditions of the job. Pros: freedom from the many hassles of a power cord; Cons: only one speed and uses up full charge in 7-10 minutes with 2.0 AH battery, much better with 4.0 AH, which I also use. Very nice product.",

      "text": "Excellent for what you pay for it. Has enough oomph to moves leaves but not much more, light sand can be blown but takes a bit of battery to do so. Gave it a 4 only because we would all like a longer stronger battery but this blows for about 10 minutes so enough for small jobs like the patio. I am getting another for our second home in the mountains.",
