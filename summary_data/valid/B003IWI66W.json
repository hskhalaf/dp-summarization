Edited to add: I have reached out to the company who fulfilled the order and they stated the pair we got either was defective or somehow we received a knock off product. They're sending out a new pair and I hope I can update this review after we test out the new ones.",

      "text": "I've heard some opinions of items like these that only serve one purpose in the kitchen being bad, but I think these claws are so much nicer than trying to tear apart a pork shoulder with a couple of forks. They seem pretty durable, but even with them being made of a tough nylon the tips will undoubtedly begin to bend and lose some of their sharpness. For the price though, I still prefer the surface area you gain over forks. They also really help transferring mead from the smoker or oven to a resting surface. Would definitely buy again when my current pair needs replacing.",

Having made the same meal about a year prior, and spending a couple of hours shredding chicken with 2 kitchen forks, we knew there had to be an easier way! Using these shredding claws, we shredded 40lbs of thighs in about 45 minutes. There were 2 of us & we kept swapping put, because shredding still hurts your back/shoulders. But these claws are so sharp & useful that it took less than half the time! I've since used them to make shredded pork at home & they also work wonderfully for that!",

These are sturdy and the tines are a bit further apart, so meat mostly just falls off. This means you can keep going and going until the job is done. Cleanup was easy. Scrape them off each other to get the useful pieces of meat off, then rinse and put in the dishwasher.",

They glide through the meat and rip it into shreds in a matter of seconds, and they're stupidly easy to clean. Plus, you can hold them and pretend to be a bear.",

I used them once for pulling chicken breasts and once for a pork shoulder. I will never go back to chopping. This method of pulling pork is so easy and the meat comes out long and stringy and perfect for serving. Try it! you'll never use anything else to prepare pork or chicken.",

I recommend putting these \"tools\" up or hiding them, away from the normal plastic utensil drawer...if a child gets hold of these, it can be all bad. I put mine in the dishwasher, top rack, accidentally hit the point while taking them out..great self defense weapon too",

Well to my surprise not only did the bear paws make it easier on my wrists they do an AMAZING job of pulling pork and chicken. It took me probably 5 mins to pull an entire 5 lb pork shoulder. These things are incredible and I have nothing but good things to say about these. Plus when you pick them up you cant help but feel like wolverine (that's just and added bonus). HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",
