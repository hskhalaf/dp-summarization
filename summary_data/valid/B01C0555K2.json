I am 6'4\" and the straps are long enough for me to use comfortably. I would do it again and will probably get one for my wife.",

The lifejackets are very easy to use and very comfortable to swimming. The thing that I liked of this lifejackets is when you're not using them you can easily keep them in their net bag for the next use because it doesn't need many space. Other people asked me where I bought the lifejackets. So I recommend them for easy use, secure for swimming and good sizes for kids and adults.",
