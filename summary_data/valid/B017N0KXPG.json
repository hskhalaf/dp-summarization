      "verdict": "The Dyad 9 is a neutral running shoe\u00a0like the Brooks Launch 6 that offers excellent arch support. Brooks recommends it for those who wear orthotics or those with wider feet. Versatility is a great asset of this shoe as it can work as a daily training partner and as an everyday wear for people who are up on their feet for long hours. It should be a solid option for those with flat or medium arches that also need good cushioning in their shoes.",
      "pros": [
        "The Brooks Dyad 9 is very comfortable, according to most reviewers",
        "It is lighter than the previous model",

        "Some runners noted that it is quite responsive",

        "The cushioning is really good for those who work long hours or run daily, as remarked by more than a few",
        "A handful loved its reliable arch support",
        "Several runners have used it for endurance training and gym workouts",
        "Some runners appreciated the adequate space in the interior to accommodate orthotics",
        "A moderate number of runners gave a thumbs up to the shoe\u2019s durability",

      "cons": [
        "The 9th iteration of the Dyad is a bit stiffer than before",
        "Despite being lighter than the earlier model, a handful still thought that it is a bit heavy",
        "The toe box is narrower than the previous version, which greatly disappointed several loyal fans of this line",
        "Ugly is often associated when it comes to the appearance of the 9th edition of the Dyad, based on the comments of some runners",
        "The heel is shallower and does not provide security like the past model of this shoe, according to a few followers of the Dyad line"

The shoe has the perfect firmness and cushion needed to get you a good run without being too soft and too hard. Definitely worth the $65 I paid. The new model of this shoe Dyad 10 was fitting little better on the sides, but it costs double. I was told Dyad 9 and Dyad 10 has the same fit but only the design is different. That's not completely true. There are subtle upgrades. Nevertheless, this Dyad 9 serves my purpose for pavement and blacktop running easily. I am happy with it.",
