The sound quality of the speakers themselves is great, so I will try one more time. If the third unit is also defective, I'm swearing off Logitech speakers and telling everyone I know to do the same. EDIT: The third unit was also defective. Disgraceful. It's a damn shame, because I loved the way they sound. Do not buy this.",

Major drawbacks: - the cable for the right speaker is a very short ~4.5' to 5' in length. - if the right speaker is the one that's furthest from the bass unit, then you're out of luck. - the right speaker plug is some proprietary connector, so extending that cord will be a very frustrating & possibly costly experience. - the cabling is extremely thick and difficult to hide and negotiate in tight locations - the speakers are very large and bulky, your desktop area & patience will never forgive you",

BTW, for speaker setup, Windows 10 provides some \"full-range speakers\" option. Make sure that is checked.

If I didn't have the Bose & just had to listen to these alone, I'd return them. But, they are high quality and maybe other people aren't as picky as I am about their sound systems.

These are great sound speakers except one crucial problem They developed crackling/popping noise. I tried to trouble shoot and if you plug in audio cable into aux input ( located on small right speaker, one with volume and bass control) instead of bass input and crackling/popping disappears. This doesn't solve the problem since running speakers that way creates annoying hum (think of a guitar amp hum without noise gate) even if sound is set to 0 on a computer.

I wish there was a similar knob for treble. Note: you must have a 3.5mm male-to-male stereo audio cable in the right length for the connection. I am happy with Mediabridge, which is nicely priced.

      "text": "I bought this speaker set based largely on the reviews for it. I couldn't afford an expensive set of studio monitors for my keyboard so I got this and boy am I happy. They are plenty loud for my living room in my apartment and the sound quality is awesome. The Bass is BOOMING at 50% and I guarantee that my neighbor 2 floors up can hear it. All components are very well made and solid. The sound is true to the keyboard, no distortion at all. Now I don't believe they are as loud as a 400 watt system should be, but it's still loud enough for most applications other than performing at a gig. A+++++++++++ LOGITECH",

The sound is amazing, and the bass is loud and tight!! The speakers also have solid (not cheap) anti-slip rubber underneath them, which is great. I took one star off because of the short wiring, and the VGA connector set up for the right speaker. Weird design - why not just make both speakers connect using RCA jacks? Overall, you won't be disappointed in sound. Great value for the price.",

One corner on the subwoofer was cracked (I\u2019m assuming this happened during shipping since there was minimal bubble wrapping and no protective factory packaging). After set up I got to mix approximately half a song before one speaker stopped working almost entirely. Occasionally it would jolt back on only to go back out again immediately. I triple checked all the connections and they looked secure but I could not get the speaker to work consistently. For the 15 seconds everything was working it sounded great, but sadly I had to return and have these speakers refunded. Super bummed!",

So I contacted Logitech, and they replaced it under warranty. They shipped a new set out, easy as pie. Awesome! Except a week later, the new speakers started doing the same thing. Avoid these speakers unless you don't mind turning the power off every time there's no sound coming from them.",

This is great if you want to donate a lot of desk space to them but it makes it nearly impossible to get them off the desk. For this price point I am blown away!

Also if you share a wall, floor, or ceiling with a neighbor... I hope they like bass haha. It pounds. Luckily there is a nicely responsive bass control on the right speaker. Otherwise pretty lightweight and sleek looking. Definitely recomend these!",

So while they are unsuitable for people who are serious about listening to music, they would be a fine present for a kid who wants to use them for gaming and wants to hear loud explosions, especially if you get them on sale for $90 as we did.",
