Camera quality was okey, but while taking a vid/photo the picture would shake, so you can\u2019t see what you taking a picture of. Siri doesn\u2019t work - we tried everything to set it up, but that was one of the additions to a broken microphone. Proximity reader didn\u2019t work. We didn\u2019t have any issues while returning it. Got our refund quickly.",
