I have arthritis and fibromyalgia, which makes getting a secure grip on items very difficult a lot of the time. I also am a bit short, but because of balance issues I try to avoid using step stools to reach higher shelves. I have tried at least 6 other grabbers, some cheaper, many more expensive, but none that worked as well. Thank you for a quality product at a good price.....I am recommending it to all my friends!",

You can also rotate the claw so it is at a more convenient angle. For such a cheap price this is a great bargain.",
