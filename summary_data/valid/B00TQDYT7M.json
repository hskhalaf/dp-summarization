      "text": "After an exhaustive and confusing search I settled on this wine chiller based on a Chicago Tribune article on the best wine chillers under $400. I have had this chiller for four days and it is perfect. The upper part holds 12 bottles and it has been holding steady at 55 degrees while the bottom half, which also holds 12 bottles has been holding steady at 48 degrees. The motor isn\u2019t completely silent, but it is very quiet. The racks are steel and can be turned over to accommodate fatter bottles like Pinot noir which makes it easy to fit 24 bottles as stated. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase.",

      "title": "NO LIGHT ON BOTTOM SECTION",
      "text": "Looks very nice until someone asked why the light on the bottom wasn't working. Looked in the manual. There is a divider halfway in the unit that separates the red from the white wine and it has to be removed to enable the light to brighten the bottom. If separator is installed to allow 2 different temperatures for the wine then the bottom will appear dark. Pull it out you got light in the entire unit but no temperature gradient. Who designed this needs to be fired. Sending it back. Nowhere in the description that I found will it tell you this. Good for someone who does not care about the temperature. FAULTY DESIGN!!! Just received today.",
