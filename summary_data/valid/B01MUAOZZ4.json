I managed to get about 4 rides in before both pedals had worked their way free enough to strip the inside of the housing badly enough that the pedals will now not attach to the bike. A bike without pedals just takes up space. I would not recommend this product as this seems to be a design issue.",

I've had less expensive stationary bikes where the pedals eventually fell off. This bike is built solid and will probably outlive me!

Simple fix we got a seat cover off amazon for about 15$ and it's fine. I use this everyday and I like the challenges and fun rides. This thing isn't terribly heavy probably about 50 lbs.

This bike was used minimally to moderately by one woman of average weight, me. I was told by Schwann that I would need to purchase a motor about $50-55 and a special tool $20 and sent a set of instructions to replace the motor myself it have a tech come out at $100 plus parts to fix it. For a non tech person this repair is complicated and time consuming. My expectation is that this product would have lasted for many many years. A $400 bike not worth the money. Very disappointed",

Other than that it's a workout I can do while pregnant without worrying about getting hurt and I can take it as easy or hard as I want.

Assembly was very easy, it took about 90 minutes by myself. The only problem is the seat is very uncomfortable to me, probably because of my weight. I ordered a new extra wide and padded seat to try instead. I give it 4/5 stars now because of the seat, but if the new seat makes it more comfortable, I will update my review and give it a 5/5.",

I purchased a recommended seat cover and that doesn\u2019t help. I used to look forward to riding my bike and now I don\u2019t want to get on it.

I can get a good workout in, but I put it on manual and keep it between level 6-8. Anything less and it's almost like not pedaling at all. That being said, the rest of my family gets a decent workout with the preset workouts. Overall, a decent value for the price.",
