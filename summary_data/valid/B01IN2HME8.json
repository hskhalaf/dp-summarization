I probably have bought and returned 5 different leaf blowers trying to find anything even close to the power of that one. Just when I thought it was hopeless and I was going to be stuck with crap that could barely blow leaves farther than four or five feet I got this one. I think the secret is the huge intake on the side. Obviously it won't function as a lawn vacuum and mulcher but that isn't what I need anyway. This one might cost $30-40 more than the rest, but it's worth every penny if you value your time.",
