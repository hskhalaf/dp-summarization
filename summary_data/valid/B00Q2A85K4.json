      "text": "This works really well and it's a really big! I have to fill my electric kettle up all the way to fill this puppy up. It retains heat for a few hours, and if you use very hot water like me, you will definitely need to wrap this in a cloth or cover. I really like that this is translucent because I can easily see how full it is. My only complaint is that the rubber feels plastic-like, and it will stick to my skin. However, when you use a cloth, that is a non-issue.",

I've been using it for a couple months now as a foot/leg warmer in the bed at night and the construction has held up with no leakage. I think the thickness of the rubber is just right so it warms quickly but isn't too hot. I don't use the hot water bottle with the little sweater but it's cute too. This product was as expected and hasn't let me down yet!",
