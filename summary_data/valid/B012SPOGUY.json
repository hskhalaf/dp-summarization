I can wear them with thick fuzzy socks or thin socks, both still fit great. Attached is a photo of my normal size 6 boot for comparison.",

The fit is really good but I did put a soft insert in for more cushion. The are very good quality and I like the height of the boot, not to high and not to low. I also bought a pair for my aunt who works in the yard a lot. She loves hers to. UPDATE: Got these just in time for a hurricane! Yay!",

However, if you have wide feet you might find that they are tight around the ankle/arch area where they get narrow. Perfect for my foot, but I can see why some reviewers are complaining about tightness. Also, they only come halfway up the leg. I'm 4'11\", so its just right for me, but if you want a long boot that comes closer to the knee you might find these to be too short. They are light and have wonderful support. For me they are perfect!",

They are a bit shorter than I prefer, with a similar height as a crew sock, rather than a knee sock. It takes a little practice not to fill them up while rinsing them off. Even with a couple small annoyances, I highly reccomend them. I wear them every morning to clean the horse barn, and every other time I need a quick, easy way to keep my feet dry while in the yard. With the cute pattern, I've even worn them grocery shopping on rainy days.",

I'm a 71/2 but they do not carry half sizes. The fit is great. There's enough room for a fluffy sock to be worn for chilly rainy days. You can hose them right off and they're clean. Easy to put on and take off. They're color is very bright as well which is great.",

I love gardening but it is very hard on my shoes...they were always wet and dirty. Then he presented me with my pretty blue floral Sloggers (not the boot kind). I\u2019ve worn them for 5 years now when I garden and work around the property. Now that we have chickens, my husband felt I needed something that would cover my legs a bit more so he got me these awesome Slogger Chicken Boots. Love them!",
