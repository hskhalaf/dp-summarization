I usually pin my hair or put it in rollers when drying and it does a good job and comes out nicely. I haven't had any issues with it getting to stay up or anything. I've even set it on a stack of pillow cushions and used it while I watched TV in bed. But it is really loud and obnoxious. I won't even use on the high setting because it sounds worse than when it's on the low setting.",

I wish I could send this back, I absolutely hate it and cannot believe that it is 1875 watts, since the drying process is so slow and inefficient. A waste of money, save your money and buy another hood hair dryer.",

Very pleased with it light weight but only has 2 speeds high and low. My only problem with this is; it does NOT have drying vents on the drying stand to dry the hair curlers around your neck. You have to keep turning your head and stretching up to reach the bottom curlers.",
