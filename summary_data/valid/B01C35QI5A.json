I bought two train sets for two of my grandchildren. One set works fine the other set never worked it stop and wont run we have tried two sets of new batteries but it doesn't help. I went to do a return and it said it was to late. i tried to find a contact to see if I could get an exchange and there is no way to contact anyone so we wasted money. I would say be careful its hit or miss.",

The remote has the option to increase or decrease speed as well as put the train in reverse. Our 4 kids think it's amazing and I have to say, it's magical even for the grown-ups!

This might seem unimportant at first, but the heavier trains do a much better job of staying on the tracks. This is a decent train if you have low carpet or a hard surface for a floor, but I can see how it wouldn't do as well on thicker carpet or surfaces with more give to them.

No problems with breakage during play. Requires adult play participation to keep on the rails. Pro? Con? Cons: Challenging for kids to get on track and coupled. Can be challenging for adults! Proprietary track to this set. Can't buy extra Lionel track to expand setup. Kids like to put toy people/animals on the train. Box car doors slide well to allow things to be put inside.

After using this for a few days, I am beyond irritated that the train will not stay on the tracks.
