      "text": "I have small hands (7.5 inch palm circumference) and short fingers (6 3/8 inches from longest fingertip to base of palm) and have found glove shopping frustrating. The hand compartment fits well, but still allows room for wraps; the padding is good, as is the construction; my short fingers curl easily at the end of the glove but my fingernails don't hit the seam. The cuff doesn't go up to my elbow, as some gloves do, and has a wider, sturdy Velcro closure.",

The womens fit is great. They will seem tight at first but you get used to it and love the stability. I tried on sobel (?) gloves. Felt like balloons and floppy. I like the thumb protection too.",

My fingers were getting jammed when I was punching because my fingers were stuffed at the end of the glove. Also, the gloves were HARD AS ROCKS. I bought them for sparring, but they would have needed hours and hours of bagwork to be broken in. Between the size and the firmness of the padding, I wouldn\u2019t recommend them to an average sized woman or a competing boxer.",
