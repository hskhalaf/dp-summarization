Will have to see if anyone can repair this thing at a reasonable price. The range is 2.5 years old. Waste of money.",

The forward position of the cook top controls coupled with WEAK DETENTS creates a situation that is ESPECIALLY HAZARDOUS in that the cooktop burners can be unknowingly activated. This has happened several times among family and friends. The last incident caused extensive damage and breakage to the large front right burner of the cooktop. These controls would be readily accessible to YOUNG CHILDREN and TODDLERS causing immediate SAFETY TO LIFE ISSUES. I have rid myself of this range after less than a year and will not accept warranty repair or a new range of the same model.",

Good to know that Amazon doesn't publish perfectly reasonable negative reviews. I'll be looking elsewhere for product information and purchases.",
