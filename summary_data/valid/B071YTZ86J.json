I'm a pretty strong woman but I have to struggle carrying these in after a shopping trip, (a flight of stairs would be painful). For a smaller shopping trip they're just too big. So bottom line, I think these are high quality but I suggest the manufacturer make these smaller and sell them in a pack of 6-8 instead.",

We get comments all through the store about how cool they are but for us the convenience and organization of these bags as opposed to bunches of mismatched smaller bags is what we really like. They are neat to store in your car and make shopping easier and quicker and help make unloading the groceries also easier and quicker.",
