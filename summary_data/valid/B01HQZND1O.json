It's a great alternative to many of the larger name brand pet carriers. It's a lot more affordable, but it still looks like you spent a bunch of money. I also love that they give you an extra pad for the bottom of the carrier. The last carrier we had didn't have removable pads, so once it got dirty enough, we couldn't just replace it.",

It is a light color on the inside with plenty of vents to see out all around, so it isn't a dark hole. She went right in and travelled in the car and on a 2.5 hour plane ride. It fit nicely under the seat in front of me, and when she got a little restless I put the carrier on my lap and put my hand in the small zippered window to comfort her. It is lightweight but the bottom stayed flat while I carried it. I can't think of a thing that needs improving!",

The shoulder strap goes directly in front of the mesh in the front and back of the bag, so when I unzipped to let my dog poke out her head, she had to jam her head in the small spot to the left or right of the bag. It only has two small pockets (one mesh, one short but long). Pros: seems sturdy. Has a bed (and a replacement). That's about it.",

This was our first plane trip and I was worried because she's usually distressed when riding in the car. However, with this carrier she slept most of the flight (Alaska Airlines)! Be careful side zipper where cats can poke out their head -- my cat can fit through and jump right out! Luckily, she did this at home, not on the flight. I highly recommend buying this long before your trip and allow your cat to mark it with their scent and get comfortable being inside it.",

It can benefit of a more pluffy bottom tray.... maybe a small blanket can be folded for more cushion. It only fits under the airplane sit, if forced. But not impossible to manage. Traveled on Southwest. It is nice and Panchito looks very elegant inside his blue carrier.",

Our dog even likes to sit in it when we\u2019re not traveling.",

The material seemed okay for a low-cost pet carrier which would be the only thing that merits a star. I was leaving the next day to fly domestically, and I'm only glad it didn't break as I was in the TSA line as that would have been a total disaster. I will try to return it if allowed.",
