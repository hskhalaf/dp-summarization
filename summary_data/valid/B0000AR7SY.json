      "text": "Same as many others have found, the grinder design leaves an unreasonable quantity of ground coffee remaining in the burr area and chute. As much as 11\u20442 tablespoons, just sitting there, getting stale. The easiest way to clean it out is to dump the bean hopper, then remove it and the upper burr, and tip the grinder over above a bowl. This fault in the design also makes for a difficult-to-avoid mess of ground coffee collecting under the drawer. It's also a bit difficult to judge when the drawer is beginning to over-fill, because pile remains at the back of the drawer, in the dark, which then is spilled into the drawer area.",

Static does build up in the coffee ground container. I control that by adding a few drops of water to the hopper before starting to grind.

Which means it\u2019s incredibly easy to put it back together wrong. Which renders the unit unoperational. Capresso-it might be good idea to make it so the burr grinder insert doesn\u2019t fit in so easily upside down, and so it\u2019s not absolutely impossible to get out if I do accidentally put it in upside down",

The only way that might work would be to use a vacuum cleaner, because the coffee grounds are stuck in the burr, which is not removable. So, after the first time you use it, unless you are willing to use a vacuum cleaner to clean it, you'll have to put up with some old, stale coffee grounds being mixed with your freshly ground coffee. Yuk!",

Now all the plastic parts have many cracks forming on them. To top it off, I was told that anything plastic is not covered by the 1-year warranty. So it is $85 to replace the plastic ($50 for bean container, $5 for its lid, and $30 for the grounds catcher). A new one is $95 on Amazon right now. When the parts break completely I'll just buy a new grinder, and it won't be another Capresso. Which is a shame because it is a good grinder and we have enjoyed using it.",

    "description": "Color:Black\n\nCAPRESSO - INFINITY CONICAL BURR GRINDER\nELEGANT, TIMELESS AND USER FRIENDLY DESIGN\nFor maximum aroma and flavor retention nothing beats the Infinity Conical Burr Grinder series. Computer controlled special grinding heads cut the angles and shapes of the steel burrs to within 0.1 mm precision (1/250 of one inch). Burrs are produced as matched pairs and are hand assembled in Switzerland for precise fit. The multiple gear motor produces the slowest grinding action (< 450 rpm) resulting in highest precision grinding from Turkish fine to percolator coarse. Lowest noise conical burr grinder.\n\nLow Noise FEATURES & BENEFITS\n * Extremely wide range from Turkish fine to coarse for all kinds of coffee preparation.\n * Clearly marked fineness settings, 4 each for extra fine, fine, regular and coarse. A total of 16 settings.\n * Commercial grade solid conical steel burrs with advanced cutting design for high precision grinding.\n * Gear reduction motor grinds slow with reduced noise and little static build-up.\n * Slowest grinding speed in its class creates less friction and heat build up preserving maximum aroma and flavor in any grind setting.\n * Safety lock system.\n * Upper conical burr removable for easy cleaning.\n * Tight fitting ground coffee container (holds up to 4 oz. of ground coffee).\n * See through bean container holds up to 8.8 oz. of beans.\n * Timer can be set to grind from 5 to 60 seconds.\n * Cleaning brush and measuring scoop included.\n * Heavy duty zinc die-cast housing.\n\nEasy to Use . Watts/Volts/Hertz: 100W/120V/60Hz\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFor grinding larger quantities of coffee beans for a coffee-drinking crowd, Capresso's commercial-grade Infinity grinder handles 8-1/2 ounces of beans at a time. Sixteen different settings--four each in the four categories of extra fine, fine, regular, and coarse--let you adjust the grind to the specific blend of coffee and method of brewing. The finest setting is ideal for preparing Turkish coffee, which is a rare feature to find in a grinder. A built-in timer sets the grind for anywhere between 5 and 60 seconds so you can walk away without having to constantly press a button to continue the grinding process. The Infinity has an advanced conical burr design made of steel that is usually only found on commercial grinders. This burr design slows down the gears and reduces the amount of friction and heat to preserve coffee's flavor and aroma. The coffee container holds up to 4 ounces of grounds and remains sealed during grinding. For safety, the bean container also needs to be locked into place for the Infinity to operate. For easy cleaning, the bean container and upper burr lift off so you can clean the grinding chamber with the included brush and wipe down the heavy-duty zinc die-cast housing. The 100-watt burr grinder measures 7-2/3 by 5-2/5 by 10-4/5 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. --Cristina Vaamonde",
