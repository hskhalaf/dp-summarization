Not impressed with the MyQ app, but it works most of the time. Installation was easy, as a replacement for another unit. Spent most of a day getting it right, but the instructions were easy to understand and plenty of video to consult. I never had to use the telephone service offered. My last Chamberlain lasted 20 yrs. so hopefully this one will as well. It is quiet, and has all the features you would want. Highly recommend.",

The seller-brooker wash its hands for a lifetime guarantee equipment, so i need someone from Chamberlain to talk to. Will appreciate your inputs!?",

Thats a flaw in app not this product. Could use longer cable going from wall button to the unit. I had to add more but had a ton left over from sensors to the unit. Kind of backwards if you ask me.",

When I was researching why it ran slowly, it turns out that the motor is 1/2 horsepower (at best) - even though it is advertised as 1 and 1/4 HPS. There is a disclaimer in small print in the instruction manual stating that \"HPS\" does not mean \"horse power.\" Very very annoying. The garage door opener is installed now. It works. I can live with it, but is is disappointingly slow . . . and I don't appreciate being tricked by false advertising. I'll never buy a Chamberlain again.",
