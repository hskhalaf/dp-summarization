Pros: *You have to play through levels to unlock items. *Levels have added challenges for extra difficulty but are not required. However completing challenges unlocks more worlds. *You can download and play levels created from the Wii U version Cons: *You can't use amiibos *You can't upload your own levels via internet, instead you have to use street pass or download with friends who have the game. Overall it gives you endless mario levels to explore and create. Glad Nintendo made this for the 3DS",

You can also play challenge courses, share via streetpass, and play select courses from the Wii U edition. This offers the opportunity for hours of Super Mario fun and frustration, especially when you get another one of those \"don't move\" courses. Pros: Make your own levels Play lots of pre-made and online courses Cons: Stripped online functionality Lack of costumes, Amiibo No diagonal ground Boredom ensures when creating levels",
