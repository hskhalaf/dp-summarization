We spent a lot of times looking at the prepared slides and he and his father were going to make more of their own thanks to the directions that explained how. As a retired teacher, I love the fact that I can give something educational as a present and still see all the joy that it brings. We were all impressed with the microscope and how easy it was to use.",

Focusing the microscope is something of a challenge and she can't just grab it and look at something, so that was disappointing for her. I think it is very appropriate for an older child, but 7 is just too young. It's way to involved.",

You cannot see anything. The light source is extremely poor. I have used microscopes professionally for years and this one was impossible. I was very disappointed because I got it to introduce my 7 year old grandson to microscopes. Incidentally we replaced it with an AmScope in a similar price range which is absolutely top notch!",

First the rack and pinion gears for the focus adjustment are just awful, and would only engage sometimes. Second, though the microscope says it will go up to 1200x this just isn't practical without fine adjustment. I ended up returning this microscope and buying a low end all metal microscope for about $20 USD more, it has coarse and fine adjustments to get the focus at higher imaginations not to mention the clarity improvements are 10 fold.",
