    "description": "Color:SilverWhat choose an Espresso Cup Set from Farnsworth & Lloyd? \n\nFarnsworth & Lloyd set out to build a set of espresso cups that were handsome, functional, durable, and affordable. After exploring the other espresso cup sets available we knew we could do better. We needed espresso cups that could look good and work well in the office or at home. The Demitasses had to be insulated, but not bulky or fragile. Finally, the set of espresso cups must be affordable without being cheap - something you could confidently purchase for yourself or offer as a gift. We think we have achieved that with the 2-ounce Farnsworth & Lloyd Stainless Steel Double Wall Espresso 4 Cup Set. \n\nStylish Espresso Cups Available in sets of Red, Silver, or Black we offer an Espresso Cup Set designed to match any style. The Silver Espresso Cups look great at home, in a cafe, or at the office and can either blend in with a modern minimalist style or stand out as a conversation piece in a more traditional setting. Use without a saucer or mix and match with your existing favorites. \n\nDurable & Functional Silver Espresso Cups. The double wall silver espresso cups keep the heat or cold on the inside preventing burnt fingers or condensation. Unlike glass or ceramic these 18/0 Stainless Steel espresso cups can survive the occasionally drop or spill.\n\nNote: These are single shot espresso cups, they have a maximum usable capacity of one-quarter cup (2 fluid ounces, sixty milliliters). Each cup has a diameter of two and one-eighth inches (2.125\u201d, ~5.4cm) and a height of one and three-quarter inches (1.75\u201d, ~4.4cm). . Hand wash only with warm water and gentle detergent.",
