      "text": "I put this on the rear of my motorcycle (yes, I know it's a car tire!!) and it has been working very well so far. I have about 3,500 miles on it right now and it still looks like a brand new tire! It rides well and has excellent traction. I expect to get at least 20,000 miles out of this tire!! That's well over twice as many miles as most motorcycle tires making this a great value!! As always, Amazon did a great job with the shipping got it here fast. Our car will need tires pretty soon and I believe I will be buying four more of these. (-:",

I researched these on tirerack.com last year and found them to be the best value for my situation. First impressions are excellent. Very quiet and confident traction in both dry and wet pavement here in West Michigan. Had Discount Tire do the the install for just over $100. I will update this review once the snow flies.",

I was always fishtailing, spinning, etc and never felt confident driving. These new tires have completely transformed my car. We are having a snowy winter and they are performing perfectly and I feel so much better driving my car around. They have traction, they don't fishtail, and they have amazing grip. Quiet too! I want to purchase 4 more just to keep for a future car. So happy I made the switch.",

I had already purchased another tire to save on time cause I was going on a trip. Customer service was beyond words. I WILL buy from this seller again.",
