I no longer have to use bungee cords to prevent the wind from blowing the cover off the ATV. It is completely exposed to the elements and keeps my ATV perfectly dry. It has held up very well in the Texas sun.",

Skirt enclosed all the way to the ground, elastic cord on the entire bottom perimeter keeps the cover in place. Cover also reaches over the handlebars and the front and back carry racks without problems. Reinforced corners; material seems strong enough for our high mountain winds, but not so heavy that it's like a tarpaulin. I removed the belly strap in favor of long flat bungee straps, much easier and quicker to fit and forget. Easy on the pocket book, recommended.",

We live in Vegas and are prone to winds, this is most likely the cause along with not strong enough securing to the cover.",

Strap that goes under helps with high wind cause elastic isn't strong enough to hold cause it's like a parachute when wind gets in it. I think to cover your atv in a barn or garage this would be great to keep the dust off of it. Just not outside in the weather.",
