The reflection is so clear and we can see exactly what our son is doing in the back seat. We have a fixed headrest in my husband's car and this thing does not move going over bumps. We liked it so much we put it on my son's Christmas list so I could have one for my car even though I already have a different brand one in my car. We were disappointed we didn't have this mirror for our first kid! And it's so cheap!",

In short, this product is good, but it would be great if the mirror was a little bit bigger.",

The suction cup is small so it keeps sliding down and needs to be adjusted. It may be because the seats are leather. I'm not sure if it slides with cloth seats. The image is clear enough in the rear view mirror but it does look a bit stretched out horizontally because of the curvature. It's a inexpensive mirror that gets the job done.",
