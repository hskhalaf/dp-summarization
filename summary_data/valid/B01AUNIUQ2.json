Never got a really hot cup of coffee out of the Breville and no matter what kind of coffee I used, it always tasted weak. Not anymore with my Aicok. I'm VERY happy. Coffee is HOT and delicious. I hope it lasts for a long time. Ps: Never heard of this brand before, but took the chance because of the reviews. People, lets keep giving unbiased feedback on our purchases. We need to support those companies who are doing well their jobs. UPDATE: Still in love with my Aicok coffee machine.",

My husband and I make at least 6 cups of coffee a day in it and have had it for 5 months now. It works great and the coffee tastes good. I also like that it uses all the water you put in it for each cup so the water tank doesn't get gross. Highly recommend. Just be sure you press your kcup into the holder so it pops in before you close the lid to brew.",

Then, last week after 6 months of use a huge POOF of steam, coffee ran out the bottom, and it's now dead. I wrote the company through Amazon's Customer Service link over a week ago (supposed to take 2-3 days to respond) and not a word. Edit May 8, 2017: The company shipped a brand new coffee maker which arrived today. It works great. Hopefully this one will last as we do love this machine.
