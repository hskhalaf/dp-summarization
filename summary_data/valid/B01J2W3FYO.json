They weigh about 50 lbs. each, very strong and very well made. I like how they mount to vehicle, there are a total of nine screws each side, three underneath, and six to drip rail with nuts. They are textured black and look very sharp. I\u2019m sure if I was to have a side impact these bars would help out. They look AWESOME!!!!!",
