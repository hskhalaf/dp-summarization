Having said that, it was perfectly understandable. The wireless mics are wonderful, especially for long phone calls. Now, I can get up and pace during a call without effecting the call quality.",

Usually need to use one of the cordless mics placed within 12-18 inches in order to be heard easily, even when sitting only a few feet away from the base unit. But as long as you're close to a mic, works great. Excellent sound quality from the speaker. Would recommend for home office or light duty commercial applications where an analog speakerphone is needed.",

      "text": "I just received the phone, set it up just in time for a conference call. Within a minute the group asked me to switch back to my plantronics headset, call quality was terrible! So I tested it a few times leaving myself voicemails, no matter what outlet it was plugged into, or how close i was to the phone, it sounded as if i was on an airplane, and my voice cut in and out. Going to try the Polycom that others have recommended.",

Did no know this until after I purchased it and wasted a lot of time spent speaking with Vtech and Spectrum Cable phone service reps. Now it is too late to return to Amazon, so I\u2019m out $200. The phone may work fine with analog phone service, but the nonprofit agency that I donated it to has digital phone service, so I\u2019ll never know. I just wish this had been made clear in the product description before I bought it.",
