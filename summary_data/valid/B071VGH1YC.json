      "text": "I have a narrow foot (no such boot exists) so I need to be able to lace up to get a boot to fit me. I've had Bare Traps before and been happy but I needed a taller boot. This is excellent, waterproof, warm. It has a side zipper once the laces are customized. However, the cuff at the top is solid so the zipper is underneath it. It's a little weird but not difficult to get used to. The traction is good (important to me with my bad hip and general clumsiness in snow.) I'm still wearing a pair of BareTraps boots that's about 8 years old. This appears to be just as well made. Highly recommend.",

About half an hour is all I can stand to have them on. They're rather stiff and a little on the heavy side also. They're like fancy hiking boots. But, they are well made, and stylish. I just can't see spending that much money on something I can't wear very long. They are being returned.",

If you need arch support, use inserts since this boot does not offer much support. I bought a size larger than my shoe size so I an wear heavy socks inside. This boot looks great and feels even better. I love it.",
