He said when he would run around outside he would have to grip the pants otherwise they would slide down his waist exposing his batman briefs.

They're great pants for the autumn season, as they are nicely lined on the inside, but water resistant on the outside. I like the tapered legs to help prevent tripping while running. They're cute, comfortable, size appropriate and great for fall/spring weather or could easily be layered when it gets colder.",

The drawstring pants allow them to accommodate most waist sizes and I like that the bottoms are near the ankles are fitted so the pants don't drag (ruining the pants or posing a tripping risk). Definitely the quality you'd expect from this brand and they look great too.",
