      "text": "I've been struggling with this tablet since I bought it almost a year ago. It is painfully, agonizingly slow. Wait time between taps and response is an eternity. The surface is sensitive but, unfortunately, it's not very accurate in relation to touching a given item to open it. There are big problems with the image you view and touch actually connecting you with your target. For example in Hotmail it's incredibly difficult to select an email- something that should be simple. Slow processing time makes using this tablet almost pointless. I'll say this, though: The screen is beautiful and the slow processor is still fast enough for hour after fabulous hour of Angry Birds.",

Pros: *Works Great *Feels Great *Looks Great Cons: *Unnecessary drain on power in standby; shut it off *Proprietary connector for power supply *Cannot be charged via USB",

Reason I dropped it to 4 starts is because the SDcard can ONLY be used to transfer files to and from the tablet. Meaning you can run apps from the SDcard to free up space on your device like you can on your smartphone. This wouldn't stop my from buying the tablet....I don't see us having 16GB in apps. I use the SDcard to store our Pictures and Music (it all still doesn't come close to 16GB since I mostly use Pandora for music).",

Remote app works excellent. few things I found not so good are battery with my kind of heavy use it last for about 5.5 hours.

However, I found that it was a little bit heavier then I expected. In addition, the WiFi was inconsistent and more aggravation then the price of the product was worth. Don't get me wrong, there are a ton of benefits and pluses to this tablet! I think that most would like or love it, but with my wrist being so sensitive and the WiFi concerns I had to return it and go with something smaller and lighter.",
