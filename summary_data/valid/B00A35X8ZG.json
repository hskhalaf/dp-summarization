The ART thing is false, I tuned and shot it on my D610, D750 and Z7, my Nikon 35mm 1.8G kills it.",

Bokeh is good. Negative: AF performance is terrible. At wide open, the lens is unacceptably unreliable in low light situations. Basically useless in these conditions. As with every Sigma I've ever tried - AF performance cannot come close to matching Nikon. It's pretty much hopeless. For all intents and purposes, this is a manual focus. If approached in that manner, it is a fine lens. Otherwise - avoid.",

I much prefer nikon\u2019s 1.8 lens that I always get sharp images with and are much more affordable. It wasn\u2019t worth the $800 price tag for just okay images, personally but the build and materials of the lens were excellent it just isn\u2019t for me. The 1.4 was also impressive just the focusing made me return it right away.",

Then at infinity, it flips to being horribly front focused. It feels like I have to pick having it either tack sharp from under 1' to ~5' and then completely out of focus until infinity., or out of focus around 5' and tack sharp at infinity. I love the rendition, bokeh, and sharpness when in focus, yet the big BUT has me eying a replacement, even after investing this much into the lens. Unfortunately testing and trying to calibrate it brought me outside of the return period.",

However, like others, I experienced spotty focus and lower light when shooting wide open. This was with a D800. It never did seem to nail focus accurately at 1.4. Also I compared it to a Zeiss 35mm f2 and there was a distinct difference in color and contrast. I can't say which was \"better\" because that is so subjective, but the difference was not subtle. I sent it back. If it won't autofocus reliably, I may as well have a manual focus lens.",

This allows pinpoint, sharp, start when shooting at night at f 1.4. - Very close minimum focus distance - Great build, and balances very well on my D600",
