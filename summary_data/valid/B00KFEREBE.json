I was also looking for a scanner that did good OCR, but the Canon CaptureonTouch V4's OCR results were poor. The product was supposed to come with a different scanning software , better for OCR, but I couldn't find this in the box. It was only after contacting the seller, who was very helpful, that I got a link to a webpage where this could be downloaded.",

If someone else comes a long to scan it drops the connection to my MacBook then says cannot load the driver. Solution - restart my MacBook. Very disappointed after spending so much money on a scanner. If I had my time again I'd go Doxie! Cheaper and easier to use. Don't be lulled into thinking higher cost = better quality. p.s. Cannot even connect wirelessly on my Win10 machine.",

Have had a couple of paper feed jams. Bundled software more tricky to fathom in order to get the output where you want it on your PC. Fathomed it out in the end but took a while. The speed and scan quality does it for me though - very impressive",
