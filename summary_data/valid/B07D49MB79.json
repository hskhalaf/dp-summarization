Having not touched a Lego brick for eons - and having never built anything with a guide book, the assembly was a bit confusing at first. The biggest problem I had was identifying the part colors (light grey vs dark gray, clear brick vs smoke brick). But, a couple of hours later, I had a mini-Las Vegas skyline just like the picture on the box. Would love to see an expansion kit to add more buildings.",

I have all the skyline sets and most of the others and so when Lego release this set I just had to purchase it. It is another well done set and even with the delay and redesign after the Vegas shooting incident it still looks beautiful. There were a lot of places they could have picked from the strip to include and personally I think Caesar's should have had some space here they really did make it look wonderful.",

He did not have Vegas yet, so I was excited to get this for him, and to share with him what each area of the strip were represented. While you can't capture all of Vegas in a set like this, they do a great job of getting some of the standouts. The Bellagio fountains and Luxor are represented. They also include the Vegas sign, as well as the Stratosphere. I shocked my nephew when I told him I had been to all of these locations, and had even jumped off the Stratosphore myself. Very cool to see that represented in this model.",

Yes, I measured it as that\u2019s something I would like to know. :) There are details like clear bricks for water, bushes, and even the Bellagio fountains! There\u2019s even a tiny Las Vegas sign! My son, who is 17, and quite the expert at Legos, still enjoyed building it and completed it in about 1.5 hours. So happy with it!
