I feel if I start using it as a multi tool it will not last as long and should only be used as intended (wire strippers).",

A pair of strippers I got at all places at harbor freight work much better and at a fraction of the cost, unfortunately they don't work for larger size conductors.",

I choose to stick with the smaller yellow handled pair with no lock. Hope this helps",
