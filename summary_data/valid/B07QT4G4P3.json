      "text": "Skate is fast and comfortable no complaints there.The skate buckles are the only drawback.Very difficult to get tight.On my old skates the plastic strap fed through the buckle and you would tighten it and the excess strap was outside the skate.These skates for so unknown reason the excess strap goes inside the boot.It jams up and results in a loose fit.To remedy this I cut an inch off each strap.Now the skates fit.Dumb feature on an otherwise good skate.",

I went with a 10 and there\u2019s a little bit of room but it isn\u2019t a problem. A 9 would likely be too tight so I believe I made the right choice.",
