If they do, i will update the Stars/Review, if they confirm that it is counterfeit, I will also let you know. Back soon.",

This is a semi professional camera which allows you to take very good pictures and the beautiful thing (well it's all beautiful) it's that it's not heavy! It's very comfy in your hands, and with the adaptor for the lenses, you can use all the lenses that you like. I will update the video part, I have to buy a good gimball soon... I'm very happy with it, totally suggested!",

It is easy to use and the results are great - but you will require an external mic for decent audio, as the internal mic sound quality is very poor when recording video. I have only used it's basic / automatic settings, so can't comment on how good a lot of the features are, but for what I bought it for (food photography, recipe videos and vlogging) it is excellent, and very forgiving for a beginner. I recommend buying an external mike which will plug in and attach on top of the camera, and a tripod.",
