      "text": "I got this to use on my camping trailer. I have two 12 volts batteries. This charger works great. The blue light lets you know it is charging. And it is waterproof. I bolted the charger onto my trailer using the two holes in it from the factory. Then I cut the battery clamps off the end of the cord and installed connections to mount it on the positive and negitive battery post. This way I still have the two prong plug to disconnect it if need. If the blue light does not come on, you have your positive and negative wires connected to the wrong battery post.",

Since I bought the battery before purchasing the Renogy 100 watt Solar Starter kit, I needed a way to keep my battery charged and healthy in the meantime. The Sunway Solar Charger was very simple to use and charges (based on the blinking blue light) even in shady times of day. I'm very pleased and once I order my Renogy system, I'll have a handy solar charger for my boat battery.",

I think anyone in the same situation can benefit from this charger so your battery does not get damaged from draining.",
