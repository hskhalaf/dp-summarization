Installing the games directly onto the Xbox hard drive afterwards worked perfectly, so it is not a problem with the Xbox.

The only reason you shouldn't get this drive is if you're only concerned about space and have hundreds of games and want a lot of them always installed.

Xbox wouldn't recognize the drive, PC wouldn't recognize it to recover the data or use repair tools. Checked the serial via the manufacturer's website, and it was out of warranty. $111 for 11 months isn't worth it, I won't be buying a replacement from Seagate.",

Just make sure the usb cable is firmly seated flush on the SSD. the indicator light will still light up but the xbox will not see it if the plug is not ALL the way in. otherwise, most games load up a minute or so faster, some no appreciable difference, depends on how disk intensive they are.",

I read that the time differences were more due to the SSD vs HD technology than the faster CPU, and that appears to be the case. The drive installed easily, moving the games over to it after formatting was very easy. The difference is immediate, you won\u2019t regret the purchase.",

We considered ordering a regular stand-along hard drive, which would have been cheaper, but ordered this game drive specifically because we wanted it to integrate seamlessly. Installation was super simple, and the Xbox One recognized it right away with no problems saving information. We are now able to download as many games as we would like, and have no more memory problems. Well worth the money!",
