      "text": "eero charges $99 per year for parental control when my old Netgear router does it for free. So instead of replacing my old Netgear router now I have to keep both. This is what I did: Plug in eero after Netgear. Turn on the bridge mode on eero and let Netgear handle the routing. Turn off the WiFi mode on Netgear so it is now just a wired router. Parental control should be free especially when the system costs $400! Why so greedy?",

You have to go through different levels of support to prove to get your unit replaced. Do yourself a favor and save your money and time and buy yourself a traditional wireless router and repeater.

After constant issues with my 3 node Velop system I decided to move to Eero. What a difference. All of my devices stay connected and I can view several wyze cams at once which the velop just couldn't handle. Devices actually connect to the closer Eero unit instead of randomly connecting to whatever node it felt like. Bummed I spent nearly 2 years accepting constant issues with Velop when this eero setup (3 eero pros) was available all along. Best upgrade I have ever made since wifi is so important to my tech footprint.",

Ever since I installed my Eero units, coverage gaps have disappeared and my mobile bill is more in line with what it should be. Got three units - I used internal house Cat 5 wiring to tie the Eero's together. Speed is maintained even in the farthest reaches of my home. Really like the app and security features which gives me even more visibility into what is going on with my home network. Would highly recommend.",
