If your kitty is aging or having bladder crystal issues then by all means do not hesitate to get this supplement.

He turns his nose up at the food and the UTI is back. I'm heading to the vet with him this afternoon, and I will be purchasing a bottle of Cosequin from the vet. I guess the savings on Amazon sometimes do come at a price. Never again!",

When it was flared up he would hardly put weight on it. Gave it to him for a month, 2 pills per day, and he did much better. Mostly normal. Since then i basically just give 1-2 pills a day if he begins limping or just infrequently as to avoid giving him pills everyday. He jumps on stuff and seems happy to do whatever he wants other than run for very long because that does cause him to limp for a few minutes afterwards.",

My vet recommended a product like Cosequin to help alleviate some of the pain he\u2019s having in the joints of that leg. I sprinkle 1 tab on his wet food mixed with about 2 tbsp of water twice a day. I haven\u2019t noticed a notable improvement, but he gobbles up any wet food mixed with this product without turning up his nose! So that\u2019s good!",

After a month of these supplements and a self-heating bed, she was tearing around the house like a kitten. After a year, I have fun asking guests to guess our kitty's age. She is playful, eager to cuddle, stretch, jump and climb and she rarely gets cranky with the family anymore.",
