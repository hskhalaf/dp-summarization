I read many reviews on other cameras that stated low picture quality. This one didn't seem to have so many of those reviews. I'm disappointed that the photo quality is less than it should be for the specs it stated online. Pictures in a darker situation are very grainy in my opinion. I take professional photos, so maybe I pay more attention to details, but I wouldn't buy this again nor would I recommend it!",

I'm lazy so I want a camera that can take great pictures in auto mode. To me Canon does a good job at this which is a good thing because the menu settings can be a pain to learn. This takes better pictures than my Galaxy 5s phone and some other point and click cameras that I have used. Not as good as bigger and more expensive cameras but that's why they cost more. I also like that it fits in jean front pocket.",

The ideal tool for capturing everything from daily fun to special occasions, it's equipped with a powerful 12x Optical Zoom for maximum versatility, plus Intelligent IS to make images clear and almost shake-free even at high zoom lengths. Sharp, high-resolution imaging is fast and easy thanks to the 20.0 Megapixel* sensor and DIGIC 4+ Image Processor. Beautiful 720p HD video is as simple as pressing a button, while Smart AUTO intelligently selects just the right camera settings based on predefined shooting situations, so all different types of shots come out perfectly. Fun and easy-to-use Scene Modes such as Fisheye add instant creativity to your photography. And the PowerShot ELPH 170 IS camera can easily connect to Canon's optional new Connect Station CS100: the ideal all-in-one solution for storing, managing, sharing and viewing images and video.\n\n* Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.\n\nSPECTACULAR LENS POWER FOR STUNNING IMAGES\n12X OPTICAL ZOOM\nThe PowerShot ELPH 170 IS camera features a 12x Optical Zoom so spectacular shots are within your reach. You'll love the flexibility it gives you when shooting with an amazing range of 25\u2013300mm (35mm equivalent) in a slim, stylish compact camera.

The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also enhances image quality in several ways. Processing of high ISO shots has been shortened by 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This significantly reduces noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations, and beautiful detail even in low light. The processor also allows for the integration of electronic Dynamic IS. This advanced system compensates for multiple motion types, effectively preventing angular blur, shift blur, and blur caused by parallel movement and tilt shift. The result is images that are reliably sharp and clear at all lengths of the camera's powerful 12x Optical Zoom.

Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nSCENE MODES\nThe PowerShot ELPH 170 IS camera provides shooting modes that easily give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters.
