Been through PT, massages, chiropractor visits, etc. I am a runner and stretch and foam roll but it wasn\u2019t until I saw a fellow runner post about using something like this did it prompt me to do some research. Foam roller is too awkward to target my glutes and hips which is now where I\u2019m feeling residual compensatory pain from my back injury. But the Orb ball...so much relief. I\u2019ve used it every day for my glutes, hips and hammies. My pain is significantly less and my range of motion at my lower back is much improved. I no longer feel locked at my hips. Great investment.",

My physical therapist recommended I purchased this so that I can continue to do my exercises at home. Prior to my exercises, I use a heat pad to loosen things up, and then go in with this orb along the neck and shoulder blades. This thing really gets in there! I'm impressed and surprised at how this simple shape and do so much. The orb has a solid firmness to it, and the pebbles surface helps prevent slipping. it's like foam rolling for your neck lol Great to tool to have in your arsenal!",

One observation I made is that the round, ball-like shape is now more like oval, egg shaped roller. I guess after years of usage, the ball got \"elongated\".

Takes a while to get used to it but once you get the technique down it's a great addition for those extra sore and stiff days after work or exercise. Really do wish it was a lot more dense, so it would stay round and make it easier to roll with. Would have happily paid extra for that version.",

This thing is about the only thing that really truly helps with my shoulder pain, I work it from side to side, which I saw suggested in a video and then do that 3 times and then move the ball down a little bit. Hurts like hell, but man, you can feel it grinding out those knots and in about a minute or less I feel great for the day.",

      "title": "What a great massage ball!",
      "text": "This is great to loosen up tight muscles and release fascia. However, it is hard so you will get a very deep tissue massage which could be too intense if you're not accustomed to deep tissue massages.. I would recommend buying the 15cm Pilates Mini-Exercise Fitness And Massage Ball together with the Orb. Sometimes if I feel I can't take intensity of the Orb I use the Pilates Massage ball first and then use the Orb after.",

      "text": "I hurt my leg doing squats, and kept having pain in the muscle along the side of my leg. While using a foam roller helped, it kept refusing to go away. I saw this mentioned on Joe Defranco's blog while doing \"Defranco's Limber 11\" (which helped immensely in getting my leg to go away). This finally worked out that slightly painful tightness on the outside of my thigh that my foam roller wasn't able to get rid of. Awesome product.",
