They replied to this review and answered some questions along with offering above and beyond service. Kudos. This thing has run daily with some amazing results. I can't actually believe what its picking up. Update #2 Dec 2nd 2019 This vacuum lasted around 7 months before a noise happened internally. Couldn't fix it. Replaced with Deebots.",

I run it daily in different parts of the house and need to empty out the dust bin daily - but then we have three dogs. If it were only dust and just some human hair that would probably not be necessary. Does a great job! Quickly found out where it gets stuck and put up the boundary tape there. Still looking for the ideal place to locate it permanently, will probably end up under a sofa end table in the living room.",

I was using Roomba before and it worked much better in picking up hair and dust. It was rather noisy and the brush sucked in too much hair and hard to remove.

(They even refunded my Amazon price for a replacement roller I had in stock!!) I immediately purchased the Robovac30 on the first day it was offered for sale. It has many subtle improvements. The Robovacs have done a stellar job of protecting our hardwood flooring investment. They take all the effort out of vacuuming. I am a stickler for maintenance and clean the filters and roller brush daily. I replace the filters and side brushes on a schedule. The boundary strips are a nice addition. Highly recommend the Robobac30.",

I\u2019ve had this for months and I\u2019ve never been satisfied with the amount it vacuums. It barely gets anything off the floor and I have to vacuum myself. Not sure the point in having it.",

On wood and carpet it's great. In summation, well worth the money especially when you consider the value of time!",

The main draw of the 30 is supposed to be the magnetic boundary strips. However, the rotating bristles on the vacuum push the strips around before the vacuum gets to it, meaning their position is constantly jostled, and the vacuum often gets around them eventually, making them basically useless. The 11 series is great in rooms where you don't care where it ends up going. However, if you need to keep the vacuum out of certain areas this model will cause you nothing but stress and aggravation - don't buy this one.",

The only downside is you need to make sure you pick up any cables or objects that it may get stuck on or try to roll over. Every once in a while it will get stuck and I have a hard time finding it. If you use it properly it is a wonderful cleaning tool...Especially for moms!",

      "text": "Great robot vacuum, I haven't vacuumed the floors since I got it. I haven't had to sweep either but I run it every day. Great customer service I had an issue with mine but after asking for a video of the issue they sent me out a replacemet. I live with 4 girls and I have to clean the brush every day since hair gets wound up in it but I don't have a single regret about buying it.",
