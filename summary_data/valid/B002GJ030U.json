If you are not careful when using this trowel, there is a chance that your hand could slip off the handle, and forward into the sharp edge, resulting in a bad cut. Fix: a very simple solution is to use a file to round over the edges, doesn\u2019t take but more than 2-3 strokes per side. If this issue were fixed, it's a 5-star trowel. Other trowels pictured:",

The only way I would need another one is if it's lost or stolen! Would never recommend anything else other than this model and brand!!",

If the blade was a tiny bit wider, and hand handle was rubbery and maybe heavier and longer by an inch, I think this product would sell like hot cakes and work better. The blade is the highest quality I have seen, no doubt in that. To me it looks kind of a knife and works better for weeds in narrow area then a trowel.",

I used to find it impossible to dig an adequate hole for planting anything. Now it is almost effortless. This is the Rolls Royce of trowels!.",

      "text": "This is an awesome trowel! Certainly the best one I've ever used. I've bent probably 5 trowels in the 10 years I've been gardening because my soil is very heavy and I'm perhaps a little rough on my tools. But this baby is so strong and sturdy, I can foresee it lasting me forever. Probably if it ever breaks the part that breaks will be the handle, since it's plastic. I would love to see this with a wooden handle. Another perk about this trowel is that it comes with a slight edge on the blade, so it works great at cutting through weeds and roots too. I highly recommend it to anyone having problems with trowels bending.",

This is the best planter trowell digger I have ever come across, thank you Wilcox! MADE IN USA!!! I am updating my review, I used it for weeding violets that are spreading beyond their area and this tool was perfect as a weeder, also.",
