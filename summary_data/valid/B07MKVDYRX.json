The universal smaller size than ones I have seen in the past allowed me to put my bulbs into my outdoor garage lights with ease ans they did not stick out the bottom. With it being only a 4 watt Led light bulb I think it should last for a long time. Thank you for making a great product.",

As expected, at only 3W the light it casts is cozy and intimate, but don't expect it to flood the room like a fireplace might. The offputting thing however is that the light itself, while in the orange spectrum, has a peach caste which makes it look artificial. It's hard to discern in the video, but at a distance (and without the auto-white balance the camera employs to correct the color), it becomes more obvious. Still these bulbs are quite cool for the price and since I tossed the boxes they came in, I don't think I can return them. The search for the perfect bulb will continue.",

I would suggest using a combination of lighting types if you are using these if you need actual illumination because they don\u2019t really throw much light. For instance, these bulbs are in the lights outside my front door and I struggle to see the lock on the door when it is dark out. I plan to solve that with some flood light landscape lighting because the \u2018gaslight\u2019 effect is too cool to go back to regular lightbulbs.",

Not sure I want to replace light switch to fix this issue. May return bulbs. Still thinking about it. UPDATE. I decided to install a new wall switch that is not illuminated. That solved the problem of the flame bulbs flickering. So keeping the bulbs. They are pretty cool. Changed rating from 2 to 4 stars. I did let seller know of this problem. They said they would look into it",

The only slight cons are that if you're closer than 6 feet, you can see the bulb and can tell it's not gas (although the flame effect is just as impressive). And it's pretty orange. I'd like a bit more yellowish light mixed in, but that's just nitpicking. Could use a few slight improvements, but very impressive and we love them. Haven't seen anything better on the market as of yet.",
