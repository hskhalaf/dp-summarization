Although the color I chose is darker than my skin tone (but will work perfectly after I self tan) this stuff is pretty darn amazing. It blends easily, is buildable, and absolutely positively stays put!!! Even after a shower this stuff will stay on your skin unless you use a makeup remover. I had pretty low expectations because my veins are very large and dark but I was blown away by the results. I am including before and after photos below---photos were taken immediately prior to & following product application. Such a fantastic product!!",

Is there a better recommendation I can give you? Now, if you are trying to 100% cover a tattoo - it's not going to do that. If you want to have the look of hose without those evil things - this is the answer! I can't recommend it highly enough.",

    "description": "Color:10N Fair IvoryAmazon is an authorized retailer of Dermablend Products. Dermablend Leg and Body Makeup covers up scars, spider veins, varicose veins, stretch marks, bruises, blemishes, and skin imperfections. This leg make up works as a body concealer, temporary sunless tanner, a body BB cream with SPF, body bronzer, or makeup to cover tattoos. Available in twelve fade-proof shades, and without the smell of a self tanner, it leaves the skin with natural looking sun-kissed coverage. HOW TO USE: 1)Using fingers, sponge, or a brush, apply a thin layer to desired area and blend. Do not apply on top of lotion. 2) Once dried, apply a generous amount of Dermablend Loose Setting Powder all over the makeup. Wait 3-5 minutes, and then dust off the excess with a powder brush. This is an essential step for the makeup cover up to be smudge-resistant, transfer-resistant, and longer lasting. HOW TO BUILD COVERAGE: 1) Apply and blend on a thin layer. Let dry, and use Dermablend Loose Setting Powder after each layer. Repeat to build coverage. 2) For tattoo cover up, first apply Leg and Body Makeup. Then glide on Dermablend Quick Fix Body Concealer to cover tattoos. For both applications: layer as needed, let dry, and set with setting powder. HOW TO REMOVE: Use Dermablend Makeup Dissolver to instantly and gently remove high-performance makeup on face and body, including layered makeup that covers tattoos.\n\nBRAND STORY\nPowerful Makeup for All. Dermatologist created. High-performance pigments, fragrance-free, allergy-tested, sensitive skin tested, non-comedogenic.",
