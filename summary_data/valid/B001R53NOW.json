      "text": "It works okay and is easy to use, but the printing of letters that hang lower (p, g, q) is off. The font of those letters is smaller in order to cram them into the same lateral area as the non-hanging letters (see photo). The result is that the labels look sloppy and uneven, not clean and organized. The font is also blurry/pixelated and there are not different font options like I had thought. Overall, poorly designed product and I wish I had gone with a different one.",

      "text": "My wife bought the smaller, non QWERTY version, and I used it a bunch. I hate alpha letters, though, considering we type all day on QWERTY keyboards. So, I got this one for myself. 4 batteries is a bit of a throwback to 80s toys, but whatever. Rechargeable or HF batteries do the trick. What I cannot stand about label makers is the preceding/succeeding amount of tape. Print a huge label? Ok, I could argue it. But a short label (or small text) doesn't need to have nearly 1/2\" of extra tape on it. It's wasteful and only serves the purpose of using more tape so you have to buy more sooner. Still 4 stars, though.",

The small printing isn't laid out well for multiple lines, but the larger sizes look decent, if a little bitmapped-looking, and I like the Italic setting. One word of caution, even the best batteries will not print for long in this device. They're fine for typing and formatting your label, but when it's time to print you'll want to use an A/C adapter to get the best results. Without it, you will probably not be happy with the output from the thermal print heads, unless your batteries are alkaline and relatively new.",

      "text": "I purchased this item to label plastic bins in my office, and my storage unit. While I was quite pleased with the capabilities of the label printer, I have found that the labels themselves do not stick very well. On the smaller containers, the labels are on a curved surface on the lid; I have found that the labels become detached at one end or the other. On the larger bins, the labels were on flat surfaces, but they tend to fall off in the process of moving the bins.",
