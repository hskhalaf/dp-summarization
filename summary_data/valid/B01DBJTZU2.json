But this means less portable -your typing speed will increase due to clicky feedback Feels really sturdy, so no question about durability (will update if I run into problems).

It has a solid feel, it's made of heavy metal, and it has that clicky sound and feel. I'm a programmer not a gamer, but I like this one. I like that it has the keys in the standard spacing for fast touch typing, but it not so huge on my desk. The only thing not perfect is that it's much thicker (taller) than most modern keyboards. So I got a wrist rest to use with it. Problem solved.",

On my main PC I'm still using a mechanical ps2 IBM keyboard from 20 something years ago. I just like that old clicky response. Well this one definitely has that feel. Super clicky. Love it. Also it had some weight to it, nice and solid feeling. For 28 bucks, cant go wrong.",

I can barely reach 100 WPM and with much less accuracy compared to a Logitech K120 membrane keyboard from Wal-Mart. My comfortable typing speed is down from ~105 WPM to 80. The keyboard also has a weird curve to it that makes it harder to press the lower keys. Is this supposed to be ergonomic? It feels like they intentionally tried to make this keyboard as hard as humanly possible to type on. I'll probably be returning this. My wrists already hurt from typing this review.",
