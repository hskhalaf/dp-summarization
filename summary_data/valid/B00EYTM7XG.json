Her mom and dad were less enthusiastic, given the setting up and knocking down of the pins - but eventually warmed to the toy after they saw how much fun she was having. My granddaughter is 2 1/2 years old and she got the idea very quickly. The set comes with a zippered carrying case for easy clean up after play. The colors are vibrant and the little animals can also be used as bathtub as toys. The \"pins\" are sufficiently weighted to stand up by themselves and not just fall down by themselves. It comes with one \"bowling ball\".",

The animal bowling pins are extremely cute. The colors are bright and beautiful. Everything is made of soft rubbery material that won't damage tile floors or even make any noise when the pins fall down. The carrying case makes it easy to put everything away neatly when it's not in use. This is a wonderful toy.",

It comes in a durable plastic zippered bag that everything can be neatly packed away in. Nothing feels cheep about it and the pins are really cute. My niece just was maybe a bit too young for it, she played with the pins and ball separately rather than together.",
