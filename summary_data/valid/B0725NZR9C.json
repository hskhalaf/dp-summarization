The metal is not staining at all either. The only issue is that it doesn't seem to retain heat that well. I tested it with my normal ceramic coffee mug and it stays only a little bit warmer over time. I was hoping it would be a big difference since the ceramic coffee mug doesn't have a lid or any insulation.",

In a pinch you can always put a ceramic mug in the microwave for a quick warm up, which you can't do with these. Also, these wouldn't be my first choice for a travel mug. But these work well for the purpose I bought them for. You just have to make the choice that best meets your needs.",

I think the shape of these mugs is aesthetically pleasing. The bottom is big enough to be stable. The handles are large and easy to hold. The lid works well...a slight turn opens the spout. When closed, there is no leak. Works good for me.",
