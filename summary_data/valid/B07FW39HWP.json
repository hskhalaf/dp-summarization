I am use to my weight lifting shoes to last a little bit longer, would not buy this version again.",

Those are a little lighter than this version but this shoe feels very stable with weights, jumping and just about every movement. As usual, not the best shoe to run in but you can suffer through short distances encountered in the usual Crossfit WOD. My only gripe is the added weight, I'm not sure that whatever stability is added was worth it. Still lighter than comparable 'main stream' brands.",

    "description": "Inov8 F-Lite 290 Training Shoes The newest addition to the training range, the F-LITE 290 brings together everything we have learnt from a decade in the box and delivers it all in one perfect package for committed athletes. Unrivaled grip, lightweight agility, slipper-like comfort and tough-as-hell durability, this shoe will get you through every kind of workout, no matter how punishing it is. Now boasting a 4mm drop (heel to toe differential), the F-LITE 290 is set to hit the training sweet spot in 2018. Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the F-Lite 290 Training Shoes as Grade 4. Breathable Upper The upper of the F-Lite 275 is constructed using mesh fabric that allows air to permeate, ensuring your feet stay cool and comfortable when the temperature starts to rise. Additionally, synthetic materials work in tandem with the laces to provide you with a nice midfoot lockdown fit, keeping you tight within the shoe preventing any unwanted slipping but not tight enough that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Additionally, an internal heel cage wraps around the rear of the shoe and provides",
