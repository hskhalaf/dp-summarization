They are good of you are in the mood for very sweet , salty, dry and crumbly cookie type snack. Very \"carb\" rich. It goes well with a nice cup of tea or coffee.. If you are wanting a chocolate or coconut taste/ flavor, this is NOT it. I didn't taste either. It is very good for a dry cookie- like salt sweet craving. I wanted something with chocolate and coconut. These are good, just not what I wanted at all.",

Then I saw these, and since I love coconut flavor (macaroons, Girl Scout's Samoas), I had to give them a try. As they say - O...M...G. They taste exactly like the aforementioned coconut cookies. They are to die for! Definitely my new favorite. Now I will have these and chocolate raspberry on every-other rotation. Cannot recommend these enough.",
