I bought Confidence Quilter Computerized machine, it lasted 3 weeks THEN THE MOTOR BLEW UP. There is now only one place in this area who is authorized to repair Singers. It is two hours distant from my home. I got it repaired, took it home, it worked for another two weeks and the same thing happened. I have owned Singers for all my adult life and they have always been very reliable, not now. Sadly, I hate to see this trusted brand be so diminished.",

I appreciate the support I get in the way of You Tube and other online sources. I think I'll keep it.",

The instruction book has large pages with lots of diagrams and an instructional CD is included. I used both to learn some of the features. The one I had difficulty perfecting was the self-threading feature. It required a little more practice. But now I am off and sewing. I think this machine will serve me well for many years. I did buy the warranty packet offered. Although I do not anticipate issues, I am have more confidence with having it should some repair be needed. I thought the price was fair.",

Have used some of the speciality stitches to mend some stretch knits which worked wonderfully. Changing feet and needles is a breeze. Only issue I've had is with the automatic needle threader. It's not all that automatic and I've only got it to thread on the first time, once. I'll keep practicing",

It has everything, but the throat is small, and the machine has problems going over doubled seams. I have already made my first quilt, a queen-size quilt, and was able to quilt it without too many problems. It didn't take me too long to figure out how to operate the machine; it is quite simple and I love the built in stitches. I recommend this machine as a starter machine to beginner sewers and quilters. Thank you",

I still rely on the instruction booklet to steer me thru some of the things that I'm not sure of..like buttonholes and applique stitches. Love the free arm for sewing on small items such as sleeves and hemming jeans. The only thing I would change is the foot pedal. It is so light I tend to kick it around and have to look for it under the table! This is a great little machine and I would definatley recommend this machine to my friends & family.",
