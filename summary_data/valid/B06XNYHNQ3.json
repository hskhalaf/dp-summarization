It smells so good and I can definitely tell a difference in my scalp and the number of days I can go without washing.",

I have pretty bad dandruff, itch, and it builds up on my scalp so I really thought something more exfoliating would work. The consistency is a bit weird and hard to work into your scalp to get the foaming and clean feeling, but that was not too bad. Just did not have any improvement, and for the price I would definitely not buy this again. I'm sure it may have worked for others, but this is so expensive that I would really caution anyone buying this to try other remedies before spending this much on a shampoo.",

      "text": "I highly recommend trying to get a smaller sample to try before committing to the full-size product. It smells great and my hair feels really clean after I use it, but it actually exacerbates my scalp dryness. Since I've got a giant tub of it I've been using it as shaving cream and really like how it exfoliates - but it's a crazy expensive shaving cream if you ask me. If you've got a dry scalp or dandruff, this may not be a helpful product for you.",
