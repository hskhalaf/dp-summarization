They\u2019ll also pair well with the ZBT 16\u201d crash and 20\u201d ride (much better than the 18\u201d crash/ride!). Great value and great sound!",

I mean, dont expect audio gold, but expect something cheaper than pro-models. And yes, if in a toss up between these and the meinl's you can pick up for 15-20 less, just go with these. The meinls are good, but these are better.",
