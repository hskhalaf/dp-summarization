      "verdict": "Loving the Arrowhead is not that difficult to do. Indeed, with its top-tier precision and amazing sensitivity, fondness for this sport climbing wonder can come quite naturally.That said, this remarkable all-rounder still comes with a few flaws, the most worrying of which has to be its inability to keep its shape over time. Nevertheless, the Arrowhead has enough send-worthy aces up its sleeve to be considered a confidence-inspiring climbing companion.",
      "pros": [
        "Many customers find their Five Ten Arrowhead climbing shoes exceptionally precise",
        "Its all-around performance is very impressive, based on a decent number of reports",
        "According to several owners, the Arrowhead is an excellent tool for sport-type ascents",
        "Some Five Ten Arrowhead reviews speak of the rock shoe\u2019s incredible sensitivity",
        "This climbing shoe from 5.10 offers high amounts of grip, say about a handful of those who have tested it",
        "A couple of those who have climbed in the shoe several times adore its great ability to get into cracks"

      "cons": [
        "Based on a small number of reviews, the Five Ten Arrowhead loses its form and becomes too soft too soon",
        "A few customers are rather irked by its baggy heel",
        "The Arrowhead is not satisfactory in the area of toe hooking, according to less than a handful of wearers"

      "text": "These are an aggressive version of the anasazi verde. Similar sensitivity and locked on heel, but with a sharp point and curve and velcro closure. Sizing will be a little smaller than similar of the anasazi line, perhaps a half size bigger is needed if you've worn the anasazi vcs. However, the amount of flex and sensitivity make them relatively easy to wear once on, and a slight stretch after a couple sessions makes these wonderful for a few hard attempts.",

Enough of a curve in the toe to make a difference climbing overhangs and toe hooking but not enough to be uncomfortably painful. Velcro makes it fit nice and snug. Only gripe is the heel doesn't fit firmly around my heel but it doesn't hinder me for the occasional heel hook. I'm mostly an indoor lead climber/boulderer FYI. Limited outdoor climbing.",

I find that the Arrowheads have a lot of what I liked about the Anasazis, but the footwork feels way more precise. The slight downturn of the toe definitely helps when bouldering on overhung routes, but doesn't seem to hinder their performance on slabbier routes. So far they fit smaller than expected, but seem to have a bit of stretch in them.",
