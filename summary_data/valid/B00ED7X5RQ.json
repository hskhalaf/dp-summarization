I struggled through the spelling errors in the Hampton Bay instructions and finally (after 2 hours) found that the fan didn't work. This Hunter fan has great instructions. They are clear, accurate, understandable, and written by an English speaker. The hardware is not all mixed into the same bag. Each page in the manual directs you to a specific plastic bag which contains the hardware needed to complete the steps on that page. The fan assembled easily and it works great. Any future fans I buy will be Hunters.",

Can afford more expensive but why do so when Hunter works well for me?",
