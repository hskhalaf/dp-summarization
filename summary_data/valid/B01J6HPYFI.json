      "text": "This thing is hardy as heck. I bought it for my son for his birthday because he loves Minecraft and asked for this toy specifically (thanks Youtube), in June. It still transforms and doesn't have so much as a scuff on it after several months of really rough play. (My kids are hard on toys) The only thing I'd caution parents about is that it is a very hard plastic and while there are no sharp edges it's essentially a blunt weapon. So really think about what child you are giving it to because it could do some serious damage if swung to hit someone or something. The mechanism for transformation is really clever and quite amused my boy.",
