When I reordered it I found a scooper in the container that was less than 1/3 the size. No difference in either the formula or the serving recommendations. Obviously one (or both) of these containers had the wrong scooper in it. Makes me wonder what other errors were made in the formulating, blending and manufacture of the product which is presumably much more difficult than dropping the correct sized scooper in...

Casein will always be thicker than whey, so don't expect it to go down as easily.

Which I don\u2019t mind at all since it\u2019s about to be time for bed. Highly recommend to try this flavor.",

If you use casein you know it's generally thicker than whey with a different flavor profile. This protein mixes extremely well and doesn't clump up anywhere near as much as other casein proteins I've used. But what I really like about it is the taste. It's now my favorite tasting protein by far. Highly recommend it. Tastes better and mixes better than Optimum Nutrition in my opinion.",

    "description": "Flavor:Cookies & Cream| Size:4 Pound (Pack of 1)Dymatize Elite Casein provides 25 grams of slow digesting Casein protein per serving. Dymatize 100% Casein is specifically designed to digest more slowly in your body than other rapid release protein sources, such as whey. This slow digestion is a result of the natural pH sensitivity of Casein protein in the digestive track. Because of the natural thickening effect of Dymatize 100% Casein in the low pH environment of the stomach, a prolonged and steady release of protein is obtained. In fact, the resulting digestion can take more than twice as long as other forms of protein. This delayed digestion is often desirable, especially at bedtime or other periods when your body may go for an extended period without food.",
