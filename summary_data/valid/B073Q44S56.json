He is happy to use the Chrome OS (we were not a \"Windows\" house) and as a result he is very happy with this machine. The battery life is a day and the build quality is (currently) teenager-proof. This is not a high-end laptop but it is a portable and effective machine.",

You have to remember it is not a laptop and I did crash it a few times by having too many Chrome tabs open. I stick to 4 or 5 now, and works fine. Virtues like being easy to pick up don't sound very exciting, but are really nice in real life.",

You can run the chrome apps and most of the Google play store android apps. Goes great. It's got rubber corner protection so it will take a bit of workshop abuse. simple to setup. Cheap as chips. IT is not however a Windows laptop. Some bad reviews on here because it doesn't run MS Office. It can but it is better with Google's apps.",

Better, tougher case which is easier to hold, screen folds right back this time and now with two USB and one HDMI ports. Had to update to current Chrome before able to use properly, problems with screen resolved when 'high contrast' mode was deleted. So a cheaper, tougher and more versatile version of a device I found to be really useful before and the modular approach for the internals will make it easier to fix if necessary,",
