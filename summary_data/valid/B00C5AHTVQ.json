It was only after using it a few more times that I noticed my scalp was very irritated and itchy and TONS of hair kept falling out. Those were two huge red flags for me. As soon as I stopped using the shampoo and conditioner, my scalp felt better, tiny bumps from irritation around my face went away, and my hair stopped falling out in clumps. Do not buy these!",

Therrape (I'm sure I spelled that incorrectly) shampoo is a bit heavy for my hair, but I switch off between that and another one so my hair doesn't get too weighted down. It's also fairly concentrated so get a dollop and rub it in a bit then add some more water to your head else it can be hard to get it massaged in.",

Unfortunately after a few weeks, my scalp seems to become immune or something and it\u2019s not working as well in the beginning. Probably a personal issue with my hair and I am looking into scalp products etc in combo. It\u2019s impossible to figure these things out it seems, kind of like skincare!",
