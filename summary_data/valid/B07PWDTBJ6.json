But if you want watch 4K films I recommend F2-220 as this one struggling a little with transcoding. Although I must say it\u2019s a great peace of gear and I\u2019m very pleased withe performance, aluminium case make it durable plus it\u2019s very quiet! Terra master support is simply astonishing and I have never seen such a quick email response Truly recommend for HD films and other multimedia content, working great on Plex and Emby , could have more apps available but I assume it will come with time !

      "text": "The NAS by Terramaster is very unreliable. I purchased 2 RED WD 4tb matched drives to operate a RAID 1 setup. The drive continually disappears from the network. Front start button does not shut the system down. Only power down from the main power socket. Judging from the comments on Terramaster forum the product seems to be in virtual beta. During the brief times when the NAS was working it did not seem to be capable of running PLEX or EMBY servers without locking up. My problem is I have put my faith in this product Terramaster F2 -210 and transferred my music and photos which does not look to be retrievable now. Returning to Amazon for refund",

The App Store is plentiful and device can support docker which allows you to run apps without needing full stack os environments for what you need to do. Comparable hardware and noticeably cheaper than other brands. If any nitpicking is to be done I\u2019d say it\u2019s the firmware, but, if you know what you are doing you can get round those issues. It is a little plastic-y but mine is in a (well ventilated!) cupboard and keeps quite enough. Even with 5 disks spinning at full toot.",

Most frustrating of all however, was when I discovered that several of the apps the company advertises as being available with its operating system (TOS) were not actually available for this unit and there is no disclaimer on their website concerning this. Great tech support though, very fast and responsive.",
