Shame on you, Optoma! 4) The zoom function is almost useless. So you need to move the unit back and forward to adjust the image size. The zoom function is used to minimal adjustments only. 5) The DVD player is not region free. [UPDATE] 6) After 18 months the speakers are gone...",

Its great because theres only one power cord to plug in to get it to work. Everything needed to get started right off the bat is basically in one package. Had my dad bought it all separately he would've bought 1 dvd player 1 projector and a pair of speakers all of which have to be plugged into a surge outlet and all the wires connecting them all together.. it would've been hell. Instead he has this nice all in one which effectively puts it all together. A very good buy for this case.",

My recommendation: Stay away from Optoma. I think a big screen TV / monitor, is much better. You don't need screen, you can watch it with ambient light, much more reliable.",

When I bought this projector it was priced at $1499.00, two weeks after I got it the price dropped to $1299.00. I thought well ok I guess I can live with that - prices do drop on electronic equipment all the time. Now the price is $999.00, come on OPTOMA, you really stuck it to early adopters. I'd recommend this projector to anyone once the price drops to $699.00, should be in the next several weeks.",
