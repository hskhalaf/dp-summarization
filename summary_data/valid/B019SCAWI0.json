As some other people have mentioned the masks don't really get close to the inner corner of the eye or sides of the nose. This doesn't bother me too much, but worth mentioning. Only downside I can find is that the beads sometimes pile up in one area and leave another less full, thus less cold. Not really a big deal though.",
