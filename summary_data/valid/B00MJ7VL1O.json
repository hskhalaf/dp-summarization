We wanted to try to give her a little boost before she started kindergarten since we knew she would be hit hard with a lot of different sicknesses starting school and all and they really seemed to help! Often when she just catches a cold she ends up hospitalized but since starting these gummy\u2019s a little over six months ago she has not been hospitalized once this School year/winter. We are going to keep her on them for now since we feel that they are helping.",

We had an elderberry syrup that she found too sweet & tart, and finally flatout refused to take it. She loves these. Not bad price point. Get an extra bottle or two for flu season.

Also, to get a more maximal dose of 4-5 g (as opposed to 50 mg), the calories and price would be prohibitive. I enjoyed my one order very much, but I won't be reordering.",
