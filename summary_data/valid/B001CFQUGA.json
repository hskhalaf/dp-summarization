However, it appears that we are only able to love 8 of the 12 purchased. The 4 mugs representing the the balance of the two orders cracked. One cracked while the Keurig was brewing coffee into it while the other three simply cracked while sitting on the counter shortly after brewing. It would also appear that they seem to crack in nearly identical locations, perhaps suggesting some flaw. Purchasing them is gambling. I would hope for a better than 25% survival rate.",

Yes: this is a minor flaw; but it's just one of those \"life's little annoyances\" that could easily have been avoided by a flat bottom. I don't see any purpose to the concave bottom.",

UPDATE: I was quite surprised to be making a cup of tea (as I often did, with hot water poured in, not from a microwave) and have one of the glasses with no visible imperfections crack and spill very hot water all over my counter. Not happy. 4 stars to 2.",

They are large, durable, and easy to clean, and despite what some reviews have said, there is nothing about them that is uncomfortable while holding them. I highly recommend these mugs, if you're looking to use and own a set of large glass mugs. And they are very reasonably priced on top of all of that. Five stars.",
