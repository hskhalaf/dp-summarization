      "title": "I especially like the addition of spot focus .",
      "text": "I bought the Canon 90D primarily for wildlife photography for use with Canon 100-400mm EF L zoom lens. Already owning the 70D + 80D, I had no problem adjusting to the upgrades in the 90D. The spot focus is a great addition for use in precise focusing for wildlife shots and the additional pixels, now a 32.5Mp sensor, allow for grater cropping as can be the case especially when photographing small birds and mammals. I've never been disappointed with my previous Canons and this one is no exception.",

      "text": "This camera is wonderful, a big upgrade in most parts from my well used EOS 7D MKII - this picture quality is fantastic, as is the 4k video mode. The ability to send all files to the PC's over wi-fi is a great benefit. There are many pluses to owning this camera. The one downside is there is no GPS built-in which I find quite shocking in 2020 and on such a high tech camera. It was nearly a deal-breaker for me but I thought I could buy an add-on cheaply, but they are around \u00a3200 - \u00a3300 which is not good. Come on Canon, all DSLR's should have GPS built-in!",

Flip out screen handy. Never used flash. Battery lasts me two or three days for stills. Shorter for video. Auto focus good enough for shooting birds in flight. Stuck little wind muffs on mic opening. Phone app good for previewing or social media on the go. Turned off touch screen. Rather use physical buttons. Lost the view finder rubber surround twice, but mught just be me not taking care when removing rain cover.",
