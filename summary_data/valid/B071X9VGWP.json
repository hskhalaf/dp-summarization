      "text": "There are 2 styles of the Nike Comfort Sandal. One of them has a perforated upper, and the other (this one being reviewed) does not. The one with the perforated upper is much more comfortable. That one is a heavier sandal, more comfortable thong between your toes, and more padding. This sandal that I'm reviewing is uncomfortable between my toes, has stiffer padding (therefore less comfortable), and lightweight sole. If I had not tried the other style first, I'd probably say this sandal is ok other than blistering between my toes. But now I know spend a little more and get the other style.",
