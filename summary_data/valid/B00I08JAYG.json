I have to say I am not thrilled with it. Got the least amount to purchase but still a lot of coffee to drink. Not impressed with the flavor. Maybe it is just me but I am very fussy. Just not liking this very popular blend. I won't be drinking this again.",

If I could just slow down the K55 brewer so instead of 35 sec. it took, say, 45-60 seconds, then it would make an even better tasting brew.",

The Donut Shop brand box had more defective cups than Barista French Roast. Ir seemed that the top foil was not fastened snuggly to the plastic cup. Perhaps this was due to improper storage which caused the seal to weaken and release. Whatever the cause, I will avoid this vendor in the future.",

Donut Shop provides the perfect compromise, dark enough that I enjoy it but light enough that he can as well, and he can add flavoring to it to get his vanilla fix. Nice!",
