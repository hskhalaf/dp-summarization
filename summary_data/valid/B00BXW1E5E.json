I haven\u2019t been disappointed - these sandals are so comfortable and really support my feet. The fit is perfect and you can adjust to secure a better fit, if you need to. They are really well made with great quality materials. They\u2019ve been a pleasure to walk in and have made going for 2+ hour walks a breeze. Am loving these shoes and hope they last me a good while as I intend to use them on a daily basis for as long as possible. Very happy with this purchase.",
