      "text": "I had purchased the 20x10-8 Kenda Scorpion K290 Rear ATV Tire for the rear of my Cub Cadet lawn mower. These worked well except they had so much traction that when I turned sharp the stock front tires lost traction and the mower would continue in a straight line. With that said I decided to buy these for the front as well. These tires don't tear up the lawn and grip very well. I couldn't be happier with these purchases. Highly recommended. Pros: Way better traction Does not damage lawn Faster cutting time Great price Cons: None Note: Should have purchased these years ago. Make grass cutting fun.",

They don\u2019t seem to sacrifice the ride as well. No more sliding! I bet you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

Took these tires to Walmart and replaced my 18x8.50-8 with 18x9.5-8 and no slip or spin. Was nervous about them working, but am very happy with the results. I may put them on the front as well. The only unknown is durability since they are 2ply and I just got them. The tire said 5 lbs pressure, but it took 10 to fully inflate. Hope that doesn\u2019t cause an issue later.",

These tires ended up being slightly less expensive than lawn tractor tires. I have a hilly lawn, and the aggressive tread pattern actually tears it up LESS because the tires are less likely to spin and throw clods of dirt around. They held up fine for the entire time I had the tractor. When I finally scrapped it, the tires were like new. When (if) my new tractor needs tires, I'll be buying these or something like them.",

The turf saver compound was harder and the nubs shorter putting more surface area on the grass resulting in \"tearing\". The tread design on the Scorpions is deeper with a softer compound giving the right amount of flex that doesn't damage my hilly lawn and gets me up 30+ degree inclines with no wheel spin.
