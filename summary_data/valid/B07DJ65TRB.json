They are comfortable, and they do look great, but your big toe really shows through the material and because of this I'm wary about how quickly they might wear through because after only a few times of wearing there are slight white patches where the toe sits at the top, not sure if it's to do with wear or the fact I was wearing white socks! For the price though they're fine.",

Absolute class trainers for the \u00a341 pricetag and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them",

      "text": "Very nice shoes, fits probably a little smaller than as expected, due to the narrower toe box. However this happens only to your longer foot, but after some days this feeling fades. So if you wear e.g 28cm try half cm larger. If next size is 1cm larger its unknown whether its better to go to it, or to stay to your original size. I got 11uk,initially I thought the right shoe is a bit tight, but over the days the shoe adjusts to the foot.",
