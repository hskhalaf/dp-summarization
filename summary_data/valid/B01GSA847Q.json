      "text": "This was a fabulous find and buy. I had been searching a long time for a contemporary style of bar cart with wheels, and given the prices of everything I had seen I was pretty much resigned to make do without one. Then I saw this, read all the reviews, scrutinized the pictures for quality, and am so glad I purchased! The assembly is a little involved (for me anyway), but I'm lucky I have a great Handyman husband, and it took him ~ 45 min. He got a kick out of the instructions also, which are pretty good (even for me). Pardon the cat, she has to check out anything \"new\".",

The wood is beautiful, it\u2019s easy to assemble and is such a staple for a living room or office. I loveee dressing it up too for the holidays. The best part is that it has wheels so you can bring it anywhere your visitors are sitting and mix them up a drink! I would buy this over and over again.",

The castors (wheels) work great, the shelves have a bar on the bottom of it reinforcing the wood so that it won't bend or buckle with weight added to it (only time will truly tell but I have confidence in it!) For the price this is a really great deal. Honestly it looks like a much more expensive item. Right now stores like Target/Ikea type places have bar carts for $200 or more for crappier ones. I'm going to be loading a photo soon. So with all of that in mind I hope my review helped you in some way! :)",

The table is on wheels so it may be pulled out to where you need it. Not too wide, a good height, sturdy, the lower side edge on the top shelf makes accessing items easy without bumping you arm. It is well made materials and was relatively easy to put together. I bought one as a trail basis to see if it worked and now have purchased the second one. Very happy with this table.",

It's huge and can store/hold a lot of liquor bottles. I don't like clutter, so we only put up a few bottles on the cart. You could definitely hold up to 50 liquor bottles on this cart. Assembly was extremely easy for my husband. You could assemble it if you've ever put together IKEA furniture. Great piece for storage or decor, either way...I highly recommend buying this bar cart over anything else on Amazon.",
