After using them, I have a couple comments: -No L/R hand indicator -The hand length is good, but there's two velcro parts for wrapping around your wrists -- the first pair of flaps is kinda small. I have wide wrists and the two pieces barely velcro around them. The second, stretch velcro part that wraps over the first flaps is what holds these in place. Otherwise, they get the job done. They save my hands so that I don't have to wear gloves to avoid some callouses.",

However, the only thing that I do not like about these gloves are that they will turn your wrist black (at least mine did), and it takes a few washes to get the discoloration off your wrists. Other than that, I use them a lot and I like them. They hold up very well and get the job done.",
