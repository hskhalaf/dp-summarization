      "text": "Really nice unit. Love the real wood (or close enough to real wood.) Its sturdy, has nice doors and nobs. The finish matches my vintage 1920s dark furniture as well. My only concern is that is appears to scratch easily. Just assembling it we scratched the top. Assemble took about 2.5 hours mostly in all the details of doors and back panels. The only thing I don't like is how narrow it is. The shelves are not deep enough to accommodate my VCR (I know, old school) without it hanging over the front edge about an inch. I didn't think to measure for this. Otherwise I am very happy with it.",

And here we are, a week later- and the whole thing is bowing & sagging in the middle. The doors & drawers no longer open & close correctly due to the sag, so this whole thing has lost usage almost immediately. Not worth the $$.",

This table has been very well cared for, has had no unnecessary stress put on it, but is just splitting. For example, the top of the table is one solid piece of wood. In 2 separate areas the wood has splits. The allowed time for a return has expired so we are just stuck. I will not buy from this company again.",
