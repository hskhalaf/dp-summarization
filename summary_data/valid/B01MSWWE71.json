If you want actual tommy Bahama quality go to the source. Or buy this version for less at Costco so if it does end up only lasting a season it won't hurt the wallet as much.",

      "text": "Convenient chair that holds everything you need. Easy to handle, light weight, and sturdy. My only complaint is that front bar can be uncomfortable depending on the positioning of your legs. I was able to look past it as I had my legs arched at a comfortable position. I would recommend this to anyone who doesnt want to carry a bunch of items to the beach. Plenty of storage and it frees up your hands, seemed like no-brainer purchase. On a side note, I needed one for my wife as well and ended up getting one from costco at a cheaper price. That being said, I do not regret purchasing it at a higher price as I really enjoyed it.",
