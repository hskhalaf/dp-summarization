      "text": "I had a pair of New Balance Fresh Foam shoes I bought several years ago which I loved and wore until there were holes in the bottom. I couldn't find that model number in my size anywhere online and I went through several pairs of Fresh Foam shoes until I found these which I believe are a newer version of my favs. They're just like my old pair with a fairly roomy toe box, squishier insole, and mesh upper which allows my feet to breathe. These shoes are very lightweight and the neutral ride is most comfortable for my feet. I did order half a size up based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.",

I wear a size 9 in Adidas boost, for reference. In the 9.5 size I have some room length wise (don't like it when my toes can touch the edges) and the toe box is plenty roomy, which I like as well..
