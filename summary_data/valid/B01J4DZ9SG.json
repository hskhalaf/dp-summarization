I currently have my box spring on there as well due to a lack of place to store it, and it adds some nice height actually. Doesn't creak or anything like that, which I was honestly worried about with a frame of this price! The particle board slats the mattress lays on do have a pretty strong smell to them initially, which kind of worried me after reading about the chemicals that might cause said smells, but de-gasing for a few days helped a lot. Overall very pleased!",
