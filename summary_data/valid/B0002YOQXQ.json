This device circulates bleach product into the toilet bowl after every flush where it is needed to prevent staining such as water lines from calcium build up. However the chlorine water is restricted to the bowl, not the tank. If chlorine is in the tank it will erode away the \"flapper\" and foam seal which separates the tank from the bowl, requiring more expensive repairs. This product solves that problem with no drawbacks and don't look unsightly like the clamp-on bars of chlorine that are permanently inside the bowl.",

      "text": "The point is to reduce cost and effort of manual scrubbing, while protecting the seals of the toilet gaskets. This product does both well. With a little adjustment it is a lot cheaper in the cost of refill cartridges. I cut the bottom of the cartridge off, leaving just the part that threads and seals the water compartment. Now the aftermarket tablets on Amazon can easily be dropped in any time you need. I only use one at a time and they last over a month average between 3 toilets.",

      "text": "Brand new Toto toilet and Flush and sparkle restricted flow too much to fill bowl following flush. Solution: Add y fitting to incoming water line in tank to shunt some of incoming water directly to big tube for bowl refill water; and the rest to Flush and Sparkle unit (whose output also goes to same big tube for refill). Now Toto fill valve works right, toilet bowl refills fully, scent is subtler. Cartridge probably lasts longer because water flow through it is less per flush.",

Takes all of about 3-4 minutes to install. The refills only take about 5 seconds to twist and replace. Refills last about 3 months at my house. Your mileage may vary.",

      "text": "I'm giving this 3 stars because it does what it is supposed to, keep your toilet clean. It was easy to install (took less than 5 minutes), and works as designed. However the bleach version is simply too smelly to be used in a home setting. Within 1/2 a day the bleach smell had moved out of the bathroom and into the bedroom to the level it made our eyes water. We removed it as it simply isn't healthy to be breathing in chemicals at that concentration. We pulled the unit we installed and are returning the others we didn't.",

I recently upgraded the toilet into the 21st century and it only takes 20 seconds to refill the tank after flushing. The diameter of the tubes connecting this product are smaller than the diameter of the tube that came with the toilet. This allows less water into the toilet's bowl. Been using it for a month and no problem with flushing things and having them stay flushed. Will continue using this product. This is the clear version.",
