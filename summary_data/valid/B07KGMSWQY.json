Secondly, I am amazed by the quality of wood that this is made from. Everything is thick, sturdy and smells like real wood pieces. And lastly, I just can't get over the rustic style. I love brand new things that look old so this piece is sure to match with almost any living room set.",

I will need to put some things in it to make it heavier but other than that it looks great. I will be getting the smaller version for the other side of my room.",

If we needed one more, I\u2019d buy another. There\u2019s also a beautiful coffee table that goes with it for a great price, would make a beautiful set, but don\u2019t need that either.",
