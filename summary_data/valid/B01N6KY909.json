Since then, every time I use it I can stretch further and my back feels great. It is strong. I am 5\u201910\u2019 and 200 lbs and the wheel fits good. My son, who is 6\u20192\u201d and weighs a solid 260 says he wished it was a little wider for his back. It does feel a little hard when using for the leg balances but then it might just be me who is not used to it yet. Happy with the purchase.",
