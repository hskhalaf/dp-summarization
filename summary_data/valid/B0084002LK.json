I should say that I use only bamboo kitchen utensils, didn't scrub it and didn't fill dirty pan with the water before it's cooled after cooking. I didn't expect such a bad quality from T-fal set, maybe it's a bad replica. I'm really disappointed in this purchase. I attached photos of the pan used the most and the less. As you can see even the latter one has already started to bubble and flake.",

I actually kept them like on a cloud although they don\u2019t brake. So with all my love and care they changed their shape, i\u2019d say that they shrunk because they became more narrow that their lids. None of the lids fit anymore",

This is dangerous for human consumption and leads to poisoning. We will not buy TFal again and advise others to avoid this.",

Otherwise, the inside is non-stick even if you accidentally forget to wash them overnight and food crusts on decently, it also cooks damn even as well, with a batch of Hamburger Helper not having one bit of a problem.

The non stick holds up really well, though we also make an effort to clean these immediately and we don't put them in the dishwasher. However, that's really not a problem as even handwashing they clean well with a few suds and a little elbow grease. The only issue would be that the handles come loose over time and I've had to add a screwdriver to my kitchen tools so I can tighten things back up every couple of weeks.",

I, having never bought new pans before, didn't know they were supposed to be washed first. The first thing I tried to cook got burned and tasted awful.

      "text": "I have had the same T fal pans for approximately 15 years. They were wonderful. Lately I've noticed the screws that hold the handles on were starting to strip and didn't feel safe to use them etc. So I wanted to purchase something similar. I chose this set. These are fantastically non-stick and easy to clean. That's where the pros end. The first time I used it, the lid cracked on the large pan AND the screw was loose. You can't steam anything in the pans as the lids don't fit properly. This is a terrible set of pots and pans.",

The lids do fit for both the pots and pans in the set, so you don't have to splash around while doing splattering things in the frying pans. One note is that they do recommend you either oil your pans regularly or refrain from putting them in the dishwasher, but even by hand, they've just been wiping clean with a sponge. I'd recommend these.",

It still does the job, but it's amazing what that little extra size can hold for large family gatherings! Otherwise, this is still a fantastic set & a great deal!",
