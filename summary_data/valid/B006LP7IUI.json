It was really hard to play with right out of the box because it's just not round and the weight isn't well distributed. It ends up bouncing a little off-kilter and causing unfortunate-looking turnovers because it doesn't return to your palm in the place it should (if you spin it up in the air, you can see the wobble). I like the tack on the ball, but they were out super fast. I'll probably go back to Spalding after this ball wears out.",

After 3, 1.5 hour sessions (2 outdoor and 1 indoor) and cleaning it with a damp cloth after each use. There is a bubble forming about 3 inches long. It is slight but noticeable. The nice grip is gone but I didn't expect it to stay that way. You have to get the air pressure correct to keep the correct bounce. I've pumped it up a little bit, 3 times to keep the PSI correct. It isn't very durable for outdoor use.",

I can palm it with a lot less squeezing than I do with Wilson or Spalding. I wouldn't spend the extra money if I played mostly indoor, but for playing street basketball, for me it's worth the extra $15.",
