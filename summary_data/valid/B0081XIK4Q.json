He's able to stay afloat with this vest (we're still working on keeping his head above water, but the neck piece on this vest helps a lot). We ordered a size small. For reference, he is only 9 pounds (which is in range for size XS), but all of his measurements put him in the Small range. I was worried it would be too big, but he fits (almost) perfectly in the small since the straps cinch him in. It's a little big in the back, but he's still young so he's got room to grow.",

Additionally, the straps around the chest are too far forward on the dog, meaning if your dog's hind legs start getting lower in the water your dog could easily slip out of the safety device altogether. I would not recommend this at all and think the company should redesign the device.",

The straps are made to be adjusted every time; fit should be a tad tighter than most folks might think it needs to be.

If you will be using for accidental fall in water for the dog, it will float them for life preservation, but may not be best for swimming.

If he were any smaller it would be too large as I have pulled all of the adjustable straps to the smallest they go. But good news is it\u2019ll fit him as he grows because he\u2019s only a year old. Seems to be sturdy and well built with good material! Can\u2019t wait to put it to the test come summer time! Update: we finally got out to the lake, and this life jacket is awesome!",

The chest strap fits much better, but the neck is a little big. I am able to adjust it tight enough so he won't slip out of it though.

The only disappointing part is that our dog's chin is not kept out of the water because the chin \"ledge\" is very small, so she tends to drink the pool water in a panic. I might have to buy a separate floating ring to go around her neck and keep her chin up.",
