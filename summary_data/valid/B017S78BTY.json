What they meant was how far in from the papers edge would the staple be placed. Again, not a big deal. It's a great product with a very good price.

      "text": "My job requires using the stapler almost every day, multiple times a day running a wholesale business. Stapling so much caused pain and also a slight bump that I could feel in my thumb-joint area. I picked up this little beauty on here on Amazon after reading all the reviews and I could not be more pleased! The pain and the bump is gone! Easy to use and not to mention you can use standard AA batteries or the ac adapter that is included. The customer service is superb as well! Will continue to shop with EcoElectronix in the future.",

Although very low priced, it has the same features and performance as many of the higher priced electric staplers offered through Amazon. This model is notable for it\u2019s small desk footprint and it's metal working parts: it takes no more space on a desktop than a standard heavy duty manual stapler and is heavy enough to stay in place when in operation. Also, although a plug in power supply was included with this model, it works quite well on battery power. Overall, this is quite a bargain.\"",

But that is just the way it works, and it pushes back in the same way. I would certainly recommend this stapler, and the company's focus on eco-friendly products is wonderful.
