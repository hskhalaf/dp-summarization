They print four pictures (screen grabs from the 9 HP universe movies) on each card, but they are each only about 1 inch diagonal in size. I have pretty good vision, but I have a hard time identifying some of the scenes depicted. The manufacturer seemed to \"cheap out\" on these to save about a penny per card. I also have the Disney Pictopia game, which we enjoy (really the only reason I bought this Harry Potter edition). The Disney version's cards are larger and easier to see and read.",

Bottom line: if you're a true Disney fan, this game isn't challenging enough. If, however, you don't know too much about Disney, it's a great game.",

We would finish one game and immediately start a new one. We even played again the following day. It's great family fun. We love the collaboration aspect and the wagering of spaces. The questions are not too difficult, but still challenging. If you are thinking of purchasing this game, go ahead and do it. You will enjoy it!!",
