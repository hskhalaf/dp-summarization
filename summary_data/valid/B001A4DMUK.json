They do however fit in your suit case when you travel and if you need to put a few boards on a rental car on your next trip this is the right tool. Make sure the rental guy notes the roof scratches left by the last guy so you don't get charged for them, in Hawaii and Costa Rica and similar places it happens more than you'd think.",

Only drawbacks are those you'll find with all soft racks - the straps go through the car, and you need to be careful of scratching the paint work (with the heavy duty clips) whilst removing the rack.",

The only con, if there are non surfers in the car with you they might be annoyed with the straps hanging down, but all you have to do is wrap it up. Takes a away a little head room in the cabin but not even noticeable! If you're looking for a soft rack that holds a lot of boards, easy to install and uninstall, then get this one!",
