Gel and they stick back up. I finally tried this stuff and a little dab actually works. Just don't use too much or you'll look like a greaseball! And be prepared to smell like a man.

After trying around 10 different types I settled on Suavecito. It is water based and doesn't make your hair feel like Vaseline has been run through it. It easily washes out with simple water. Also, with a small amount of water, you can simply reactivate the pomade to restyle your hair, if needed. I have found myself doing this when I wake up in the morning and go for a run. Highly recommend this product!",

My hair is thin and products that are too heavy easily weigh my hair down, make it greasy, etc. Suavecito has a medium-strong hold and lasts all day.

      "text": "I had read good things about the Suavecito product line and I must say I can't but agree with them. The pomade is perfect for my needs and provides a rather strong hold while leaving me room to style my hair - which is rather thick; it also is 'beanie-proof' and leaves no residue when washed off. Sometimes, and based on my previous experience, the stronger the hold, the more difficult it gets to have your hair the way you want, but this pomade seems to provide a rather satisfying balance. Finally, it smells nice - more of an aftershave-like scent but not too strong anyway, in my view. Highly recommended!",

I've tried many other types of hair products but none work for me the way this does! Nice strong, but yet movable and playable, hold! Nice subtle shine look and NO FLAKING! I have naturally waving hair and this really helps keep my hair straight enough for a nice smooth combover! Definitely recommend",
