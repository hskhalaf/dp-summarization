It turns out I only used the sponge and the microfiber towel. They work very well. One attached picture shows my car after shampoo and the other one shows the finished look. I would say the towels feel soft and good quality. Have not try plastic parts yet. Anyway, I am very satisfied with the car wash kit.",

The best item is the carrying case, it\u2019s sturdy and sizeable for a few quick detailing or cleaning items you may keep around to keep your baby shining. Other than the carrying case, I really have no use for anything else that came with it. I suppose I\u2019ll just use the towels around the house.",
