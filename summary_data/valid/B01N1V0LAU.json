As the dehumidifier collects water, the water level is easy to see without turning off the machine and/or removing the reservoir. Emptying the water is very easy so using the humidifier is very simple. I have used the dehumidifier in rooms approximately 10' x 12' and collected about 20-25 ounces of water in a 8-10 hour time frame. (There were condensation problems in my house...)",

It often gets a musky odor. I closed the doorI ran this over night and very little water was collected. I could tell a small difference in the room . It could be that it is too small or the room is not a damp as I think it is. When the spring rains come I will be able to tell more about its efficiency. I might change my review at that point. Right now I would say it is just okay.",

I first started using it near the end of a very rainy and humid winter in the Pacific Northwest. Before plugging it in, the relative humidity was 72% at about 45 degrees F. After about 4 hours of it running, the RH was 51%. As the weather has gotten warmer, the RH has gone down and usually ranges between 30% and 55%. I empty it about once every 7 to 10 days. It works great and the trailer no longer smells musty. I couldn't be happier with its performance.",

    "title": "Ivation GDM30 Powerful Mid-Size Thermo-Electric Dehumidifier - Quietly Gathers Up to 20oz. of Water per Day - for Spaces Up to 2,200 Cubic Feet",
    "description": "Advanced Peltier technology \nThis is a highly effective mid-size machine, built around the powerful and quiet (a lot quieter than standard dehumidifiers) Peltier technology. Because Peltier technology works with almost no moving parts, we managed to design and develop our dehumidifier as a compact appliance: small, lightweight, low on energy consumption, powerful, effective at drying up musty rooms, and, with all that, a long lifespan. \n\nRemovable Water Reservoir \nRated at being suited for spaces up to 2,200 cubic feet, our mid-size dehumidifier is the perfect tool to extract moisture stagnant areas and mildew- and mold-stricken rooms. From bathrooms to laundry rooms to bedrooms to antique cars to boats, it rids the air of mustiness and unpleasant odors while quietly pulling in excess humidity at a rate of up to 20 ounces per day at 86\u00b0 Fahrenheit and 80% relative humidity. \n\nSuited for spaces up to 2,200 cubic feet \nThe Ivation mid-size dehumidifier is fitted with a removable water reservoir with a capacity of 53 ounces. This spares you the hustle of emptying out an overflowing water tank every day, as it can hold approximately 3-days\u2019 worth of dehumidifying action. Our dehumidifier is also programmed to shut off automatically once it has reached capacity. An indicator light will go on to remind you to empty the tank out. \n\nSpecifications \nPower consumption peaks at 70w, making this an efficient, reliable, low power, simple to use and effective unit. \nLightweight, low power, simple to use, safe and effective \nDehumidifier rate: 16oz/24h at 86F, 80% RH \n53 ounce water tank \nAutomatic switch off when the water tank is full (with LED indicator) \nCompressor free, no chemicals, no moving parts; an environmental friendly product \nWeight: 4.8 lbs",
