      "text": "I searched tons of crock-pot models looking to replace my broken crockpot. The problem I was having in the stores was locating one that did not have the \"high/low setting\" and instead had the button where you could select the hours \"4hr/6hr/8hr/10hr\". Trusty amazon pulled through with this beauty! I love the temperature gauge at the bottom and the travel lock handles. I've never used those specfic features yet as I haven't traveled with it so I can't comment on how well it's insulated and all that fun stuff. But the cooking countdown is awesome. I never thought I'd care, but it's nice to know how much time is left if you get home earlier than you think! Highly recommend!!!",

When I pulled it down to use it, there was white, black and brown mold growing in these microfractures. Yuck! I don't trust it. It's beyond my warranty so there is nothing I can do about it, and as a replacement crock costs more than the unit ($69), I won't be going that route. Neither will I purchase this crock again.",

      "text": "Real easy to use. Liked the glass lid with the handle, rubber seal around it, two carrying handles, the cooking temperature controls and the thingie to wrap the cord around. The manufacturer thought of everything to make this crock-pot the best if not one of the best. Liked the price too. Liked the speedy processing, packaging and the delivery of my order. It came in time before the event where I plan to bring something that's going to be kept warm in a very classy container!",

    "description": "YOUR MEAL STAYS HOT WHEN YOU GO OUT\n The SCCPCTS605-S 6-quart Programmable Cook & Carry Slow Cooker with HeatSaver\u2122 Stoneware is the ultimate for on-the-go convenience. Designed with all the great portability features of the Cook \u2018N Carry line, this model also uses special heat-retaining stoneware and temperature gauge so prepared foods stay warmer longer and ready to \u201cserve on arrival.\u201d Perfect for potluck dinners, tailgating, get-togethers and holiday parties. \n\nFEATURES\n * Keep the heat in with HeatSaver\u2122 stoneware to help maintain an ideal serving temperature \n * Temperature gauge shows you when it\u2019s time to plug unit back in for additional warming\n * Easy-to-use locking lid featuring lid gasket provides extra seal for less mess on-the-go \n * Programmable pre-set digital controls \n * Shifts to warm setting automatically once the cook time is complete\n * 6-quart capacity is perfect for 7 or more people or a 6-pound roast \n * Removable, dishwasher-safe oval stoneware \n * Convenient cord storage\n\nTHE ULTIMATE IN PORTABILITY\nHeatSaver stoneware keeps food hot up to 30% longer* than other portable slow cookers. Specially-designed HeatSaver\u2122 stoneware maintains an optimal serving temperature--with or without a power source--keeping food hotter up to 30% longer* than existing portable slow cookers.\n\nDigital control panel with travel temperature gauge. Click here for a larger image The slow cooker features a temperature gauge that shows the temperature of food in the stoneware once the unit has been unplugged. The gauge indicator points to the red \"hot\" section, then over time moves closer to the yellow \"cool\" section, offering at-a-glance checking of the heat status.\n\n The front-mounted digital control panel also provides a simple on/off button and programmable controls for selecting from four pre-set time settings. Push the \"select\" button to choose from 4 or 6 hours on high heat or 8 or 10 hours on low heat. \n\nAfter the selected cooking time has elapsed, the cooker automatically switches over to keep-warm mode. A digital display shows the time remaining when in cook mode and provides a count-up timer when in keep-warm mode.\n\nMeals stay securely contained during transport. Oversized handles for safely carrying the cooker.  The SCCPCTS605-S will keep food safe while on-the-go with hinged locking lid and carrying handles. The tempered-glass lid uses a rubber gasket to create an extra seal to ensure mess-free transport. With these features, there\u2019s no need to repack food in other containers, making travel a breeze. This slow cooker also has removable oval stoneware that can double as a serving dish. \n\n Large, integrated, loop side handles on the heating base help ensure a secure grip when transporting the slow cooker, while onboard cord storage keeps things neat and tidy. A stay-cool loop handle on the lid allows for easy removal when serving.Housed in brushed stainless steel with black accents, the attractive slow cooker makes an elegant choice for any social gathering. \n\nThe unit measures approximately 16 by 10-1/5 by 16 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. A user manual comes included, and both the removable stoneware and locking lid clean up easily by hand or in the dishwasher.\n\n*Compared to Crock-Pot 6-quart Cook & Carry slow cookers",
