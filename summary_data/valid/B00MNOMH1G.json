      "text": "All of the reviews are true, but beware, no matter how careful you are there is a large chance *any* of the threads will strip. People are only having issues with the lamp because the weight makes stripping this thread almost impossible. I would suggest having multiple people slowly screw it down -- oh... and there *will* be a gap. Do *not* try to fix the gap unless you want to waste your time/money praying that Amazon will assist and accept the broken crap you are forced to ship back (somehow) So basically, if you are careful, two lamps for $90 -- not the greatest deal afterall. The lamps themselves are attractive enough given the materials they are built from.",

You can clearly see the threads sticking up from the bottom portion at a 10-15 degree angle. Not only does this not stand up straight but the top portion doesn't even screw down entirely. The gold painted lines, which are mentioned by another reviewer, are horrible. I can see wavy, jagged, and incomplete lines on not one but all of the lamps. I cannot recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a quality product for the price.",

If you barely bump the table that the table lamps are on, the knob falls off. Pretty annoying. Also the shades that came with mine seem to be off just a little. I would prefer them to put out more light, but that probably is my fault for not reading the wattage of what kind of bulb you can put into the lamps. I liked the price of them, so I guess you what they say is true. \"You get what you pay for\".",

The gold accent paint on the other is almost non-existent, so they look only halfway the same. The two stars is because they still turn on. i can't believe a product was allowed out of the factory like this.",

The only thing I have to comment on is that the lampshade is quite wobbly as they just fit right into the little lifted circle piece on top of the lamp and they don't have anything to secure or screw them on to be sturdy. Other than that the only thing I had an awful time with was getting them out of the box. They were packaged pretty tightly into one box leaving me to cut half the box apart and the styrofoam to just get them out leaving a mess. But once I got them out and together I was pretty please otherwise.",
