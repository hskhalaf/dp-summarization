Fortunately, I'm still in the return window, though I expected to get more than 3 weeks of use out of the speaker.",

For its size it puts out a lot of power, Only complaints are that there is no skip button on the speaker and that Bluetooth signal doesn't travel through water so if it is floating and there is anything but completely still water then it will skip in and out. It's battery life is about 4 hours when at 3/4 volume and it still plays that long after 2 years. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a small, portable, durable, and waterproof speaker.",
