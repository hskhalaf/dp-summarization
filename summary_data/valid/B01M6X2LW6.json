Love the ability to watch the hockey playoffs or major league baseball games outside. Very happy with my purchase so far. PRO Built in speaker gives adequate volume. 2 USB Ports CONS I wish that the Bluetooth USB micro adapter I plugged in would work. Menu options seem scarce. Wondering what would happen if I connected Chrome or a firestick. Would it even work?",

I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. If you a looking for a tv with a lot of bells and whistles you may want to upgrade but for just enjoying sports or other shows/movies this tv is perfect. Easy installation and great picture.",

However, even though it is in full shade under my patio the glare is almost unbearable during the daytime. Awesome picture at night but not so good during the day. This is quite disappointing considering the price...I thought the veranda was for use in full shade....I'll try to upload photos later.",

We put it on a rolling stand because in this rainy climate though the tv is made for outdoors, we will bring it inside for the winter. Sitting on the deck with a glass of wine watching our favorite program is the best! This tv is highly recommended. The sound is good but my husband is talking about a sound bar. We'll never be inside !!!",

So far it's stood up to the extreme temps we have here in NC. If you've ever been here you know it can snow in the AM and by lunch you need shorts and a tank top for the 100 degree weather. I am very satisfied with this product and if not for the volume I would have given it 5 stars.",
