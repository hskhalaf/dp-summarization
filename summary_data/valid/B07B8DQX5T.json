For that amount for a device of this nature, they should include masks! I do not want to have to pay an additional amount to purchase masks to be able to try this out. Way too expensive for what you get! Returning for a refund...overpriced hype",

I suspect the pulsations are weak, but I don't have the real deal yet to compare it to. It was a much better price than anywhere else, so I snapped it up without reading reviews here. I knew I wanted one, why bother? While I wish I had, I will say I had ZERO problems getting a refund from Amazon. I was happy with that. I will buy from a more reputable source such as Sephora, and I recommend you do, too!",

Mine came with four different masks, I don't have a negative thing to say about any of them and I really appreciate that it came with different ones so I could try a variety. You can see results immediately and it doesn't take long at all. It also really makes your face feel refreshed. It's a pretty penny to spend on a beauty product, but I was not disappointed.",
