It does not move easily, and once it's in the \"leaning\" position, you have to \"crack\" it in order to get it to stand up straight. The very worst design problem is that the red \"on-off\" button is an inch away from the red \"dump cannister\" button! So if you're at all distracted--by a phone call, child, whatever--and you go to turn it off, there's a decent chance you'll hit the \"dump\" button instead.",

The 'pro' in comparison to the old Animal: lighter, improved suction, good mobility due to the ball, and does a better job on stairs. The 'con' compared to the old Animal, the cord is shorter than the old one, the tools don't fit on the vacuum, and the parts don't seem as 'heavy' duty as my old Animal. Overall - it works well (have had for about a month and I vacuum about twice week).",

I will echo the sentiment of other reviewers -- it is frightening just how much dust it pulls out of a carpet well-vacuumed with other older vacuums. The mobility of the ball design is quite handy, and the product feels very modern in its attachment design and assembly. Overall it feels very sleek and somewhat delicate - it isn't a monster you can carelessly bang around worn baseboards and expect it to operate or look as nice as it comes; but it is an excellent choice for its price range.",
