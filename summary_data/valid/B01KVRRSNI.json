Wi-fi coverage is much better in my home (quite large), and there appear to be no issues yet. Still early days, but seemingly a good product.",

I wasn't sure if such a product existed, but the satellite has four sockets of its own so not only does it extend the wifi, but allows these computers and printer to plug directly into the network. The speed is as good as the main router and apart from some niggles that their tech line helped with its been great!!",
