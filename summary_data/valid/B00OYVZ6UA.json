I have been trying different sulfate free shampoos and this is the worst one I've used. The conditioner is fine. I think it's trying to make up for the fact that the shampoo strips your scalp from all its natural and healthy oils. I bought this because it was a lighting deal. Never again. I'll go back to getting my climatologist friend's advice before buying a new product.",

The shampoo is VERY good at cleaning hair and will leave your hair smelling good and squeaky-clean but also needing the very effective conditioner.

I only wash my hair twice a week and this produce has been a life changer, I only wish I found this sooner. If they made a grapefruit or any citrus scent I\u2019d be all over it. If your hair is on the more dry side, wait until your scalp is a little oily for best results.",

Thankfully, this Natural Mint Shampoo and Conditioner Set leaves my hair feeling soft and clean with plenty of volume. While the bottles are small, a little (quarter size) goes a long way and is plenty for shoulder length hair. The fresh, minty smell is very refreshing and clean. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good clean while also offering a balanced level of conditioning.",

One more thing that is important, washing my hair has also become a relaxing aromatherapy routine since the shampoo & conditioner have a wonderful light scent!

      "text": "I love the smell of this Winter Blend. I especially love the conditioner, and use it year round. The shampoo isn't bad, but I just like the Maple Holistics Hydrate shampoo best. I wish they would break the set up so you didn't have to buy it as a set and could buy the shampoo and conditioner individually. The other thing is that while it smells great when you're shampooing or conditioning, the smell doesn't linger at all on your hair. I would like if it did, but I still enjoy the smell while I use it. Someone else might prefer that the smell didn't linger",

The bottles are so stiff and the product is very thick, so I have to unscrew the cover and tap the product into into the palm of my hand. I'm not able to squeeze it out of the cap. I've never encountered this type of problem before. If the bottles were more user friendly I would have given this a 5 star review.",

More importantly, this shampoo and conditioner is fairly clean...no parabens, sulfates, etc. The scent comes from essential oils rather than \"fragrance\" which could include any number of terrible ingredients. These products make my hair feel light, unlike other sulfate free products that tend to weigh my hair down and feel greasy. Definitely a great product that I will continue to use!",

My daughter says that the shampoo and conditioner both smell good, perhaps I should have her try them in hopes that maybe it's just my hair that's the problem and not the shampoo and conditioner.",

The shampoo has a fresh minty smell, lathers well and leaves your hair squeaky clean. The conditioner left my hair soft and shiny. Even better was knowing these products were not laden with chemicals. There was also a nice lip balm included with these products (thank you). So far, very happy with this purchase.",

Shampoo does lather up very well if you get hair very wet first and then add another quick splash of water once shampoo is applied to the head. We love the smell too!",
