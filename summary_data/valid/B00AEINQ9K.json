It lived in the little pocket on my trousers near my boot, and got soaked in mud and sweat, banged up against countless objects, dusted with sand and dirt, and still provided a consistent, if sometimes uncomfortable (due to the sand and all) shave. The batteries would last well over a month, and little more than a rinse of the blades/foil and the occasional oiling was required to keep it going. A very reliable, compact, and inexpensive shave. I'm very happy with this razor.",

Cleaning head is easy and does not need too often; I always removed head and tapped out cuttings.

I was using a braun series 5 razor before this, and didnt have high hopes when i bought this to go in my travel bag. on the flatter parts of my face (cheeks) the braun did a noticable better job, but on the nooks and tight areas, this one beat the braun hands down. overall shave is actually close to being even between them. the braun was only slightly better, but not enough that my wife could tell the difference between me using that or this one. this should be a wonderful razor for anyone, and should do well for those that just need a basic shave.",

But to shave close you have to spend a long time over the stubbles. That's because the rotary blades and motor are so weak. I also have the Panasonic travel shaver, which is a lot more powerful and does the job in half the time. Given my experience with both I prefer the Panasonic one much more - and it's shower proof. This Norelco does the job but falls short of the competition.",
