This is my second order of this water. The first order was great and taste like Essentia. The second order is definitely not Essentia and taste like unclean tap water. I should have been suspicious as the package labeling was a little off. I surely hope this vendor is not poisoning people. I have poured out all bottles and requested a refund. BTW, you will not receive a full refund. I only received $7 back.",
