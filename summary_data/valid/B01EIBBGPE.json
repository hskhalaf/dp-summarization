Front mats are actually 17.5\" in width. No big deal, but the rear is only 51\" in total. Note that the rear mat has a middle section that is only 15\" in width that is connected to the rear mats that are 18\" each.

In order to get it to cover the hump,it buckles the side pieces,and causes them to go partway up the back seat leaving the part where your feet go, partially uncovered.if I push the side pieces further forward,the hump piece rides up the back of the console. Tried turning them around just for kicks,nope. My only option at this point is cut them in half,which defeats the purpose. Also front mats very narrow many inches from edge to edge.",

      "text": "The product seems pretty durable and fits well for my 2013 Ford Fiesta, but the factory smell was HORRIBLE! It smells like someone smoked all over it for weeks. I left it outside to air out for 3 weeks and then soaked it in dish soap and apple smelling body wash and it didn\u2019t make ANY difference. I wish I could send it back but being that it\u2019s been three weeks it\u2019s hardly likely. Again it\u2019s a good product but the irreversible stench makes it unusable.",

Simply just tear or cut along the many lines you can pick from.
