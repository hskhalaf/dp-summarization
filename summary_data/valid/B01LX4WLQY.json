I think one thing that helped was the customization of the nendoroid and I always enjoy the little backdrops. Thumbs up and would reccomend to any naruto fans or collectors on the fence about it :)",

The only thing that's weird is that the pictures on the box show Naruto \"holding\" the rasenshuriken with a straight arm and his palm open, but that arm isn't included in the set. There's multiple photos of him posing with this straightened arm and open hand. There IS one arm included that has an open hand, but the elbow is bent, so you can't really acheive the rasenshuriken pose. Just an observation",
