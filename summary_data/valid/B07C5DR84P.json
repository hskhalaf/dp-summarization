      "text": "First of all, this doesn't work the best in a small home soft serve ice cream maker. It tends to have a gel that plugs up the dispensing hole, so I end up scraping it out of the bowl, which sort of defeats the purpose of the soft serve. However, that aside. The flavor is good! My husband and I enjoy it. Just a tip, I have discovered that 1 scant cup of mix, 1 cup water and 1 cup milk works (since it doesn't give directions for small batches)",

Ice Cream maker and I used 2 cups of milk and 7/8 cup of mix. I stirred it to dissolve, then chilled the mix for 10 minutes, poured it in the frozen bowl mixer and it chilled perfectly and had great flavor. It says you can use milk or water, I will try water next time, but really enjoyed the milk and mix concoction.",

I divided it to 6 portions of roughly 21 ounces and bagged them. Then add 2 2/3 cup of liquid, mix, then pour it in to the Cuisinart Ice 45. It says you can use milk or water. I tried milk and it came out very tasty. I made a batch yesterday using pineapple juice instead of milk or water and it was great. Going to try some with orange juice to try for that creamsicle taste.",

I've used it in both a compressor ice cream maker and old style (ice & rock salt) machine with good results. Arctic Ice may not be well known for home use. But it's the brand used by many major theme parks, including that famous mouse. I highly recommend it.",
