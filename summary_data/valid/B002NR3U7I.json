I've had to put concrete stepping stones on one side of the steps to make them usable for myself and my friends. I would say these are only usable for people who are in good physical condition with no knee problems!!",

They arrived quickly and in new condition but I was very disappointed with the assembly instructions and the extra 36$ I paid for a wrong size liner mat included. It is only about 18x30 which is not big enough to cover the entire bottom of steps. I Added 125 lbs of sand in canopy weights underneath steps and it still could use 25 more.",
