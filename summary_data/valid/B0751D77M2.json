The bag is sturdy and will even hold my trolley as well. The anchor keeps me in place on windy Stockton lake and on the swift current on the rivers as they are near flood stage. Great product.",

They especially like the bright green color because it's not only stylish but also much easier to see in the water than anchors they've had in the past. There is also no need to worry about your board or kayak being scratched by the anchor because the padded bag included with the anchor does a great job protecting! The best part is how sturdy this anchor is and how well it holds you in place even in rougher waters and even mud! I would absolutely recommend this product and company!",
