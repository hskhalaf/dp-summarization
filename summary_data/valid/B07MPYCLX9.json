(1) It fit perfect (I am 6'6\", 200 lb and the XL was long enough), (2) It absolutely protected this white boy from the Mazatlan, Mexico sun, (3) When I got out of the water, its cooling effect was incredible, (4) With no seams the shirt was extremely smooth and nice enough to wear to the bar afterwards, and (5) Just use a towel to wipe the water off and it drys very, very quickly. I cannot say enough outstanding things about these shirts. I bought 2 of them and just kept alternating during my stay in Mexico.",

My only issue has been that the seams come loose after a few washes and I've had to do some repair to keep from further fraying. We're buying a second one now in case the first one is ever beyond repair with my basic sewing skills.",

Once the shirt gets wet, it takes some doing to get it off as it sticks to your skin, so let it dry for a while or towel dry it before removing. Overall, I like the performance of these shirts and will continue to use them on a regular basis.",
