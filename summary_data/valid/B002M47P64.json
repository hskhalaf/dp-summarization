This quality of this product is awful at best. Compared to the original it is constructed of thinner cheaper metal and the grill surface e is aluminium and warped the first time it was used. The. Burner does not fire evenly and the bottle connector leaks requiring Teflon tape to make a seal. I have already filed for return and hope that you do not make the same mistake. Coleman had a customer that was loyal to the product. They lost this customer.",

I wouldn't use it for complicated or long grilling items, that's not what it's designed for. It's a nice basic lightweight grill. The only negative is it does not grill well under windy conditions, it simply is too affected by the wind, such that it doesn't get hot enough to effectively grill in windy conditions, this is why I gave it 4 stars, not 5.",
