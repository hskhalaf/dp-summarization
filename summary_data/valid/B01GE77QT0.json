Great when you are smoking two different thicknesses of meat too. I've also used it on the grill with equally stellar results. Let's me put the meat on, walk away, and then follow the progress - especially for low and slow cooking. I did leave the batteries installed over the winter, and they leaked. :( But ThermoPro was there for me. They actually man their 800 number (so unusual these days!), and replaced my sending unit right away. so.. not only a 5* product, but also 5* service. Kudos to ThermoPro!!!",

The reason I say this is because I have a pellet grill and the digital control panel temperature said 250 degrees. The analog thermometer on the grill lid also said 250 degrees(plus or minus 2-3 degrees), but the ThermoPro temp was reading 275-295 or higher. The fact that 2 of 3 thermometers read the same thing makes me think the temperature on the ThermoPro is off. Once I have a chance to review in more depth and calibrate with ice water @ 32 degrees, I will post an updated review.",

This is completely false, as the 2 probes are too long to monitor the temperature of a grill. The 2 probes are really only good for monitoring the temperature of food. 2. No low temperature warning. This means you have to manually monitor the grill temperature yourself so that you can add charcoals before your grill temperature dips too low. This product is really only good for monitoring food temperature, and would probably get a 5 star rating from me if it didn't claim to be able to monitor grill temperature.",

Biggest complaint is the constant alarming if you're fluctuating near your target temp. You can silence the alarm once it goes off, but if it dips and returns to target, the alarm goes off again. This can be avoided by setting your target temp a little high, but then you run the risk of staying above you target temp for the duration fo the cook. I do wish it also had a low temperature alarm that could be used with the grate probe.",

Now I can sit a hundred feet from my Kamado Joe and see what the grill temperature and internal temperature are. This is especially helpful on low-and-slow cooks like pork butts and brisket. I had a temp probe fail recently, so I contacted Thermo Pro and they promptly sent me out a replacement at no charge. If you're currently bbq-ing without monitoring temperature, you need to give this unit a try.",

Next, the display on the receiver started to fade to the point where we have to turn it to an extreme angle just to read it. New batteries did not help. Now the transmitter has failed to read any temperatures, unless by some chance both probes went bad at once, very unlikely though. Again new batteries do not help.

Still had problems after removing probes from grill, allowed the probes to return to normal temperature, unplugged and checked connections, restarted both units, and place back in grill.

      "text": "Made some filets with this unit and came out perfect. Seared for 2 minutes on each side and placed them in the oven at 350 F until center temperature reached 125 F before taking out of the oven then let them rest. Just measured internal temperature on one filet. Perfect medium rare was achieved on both filets. Very happy with this purchase and looking forward to using it as often as possible. Loved the idea of not standing over the oven and checking every few minutes to make sure the meat was not over cooking.",
