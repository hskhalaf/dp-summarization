I am 6\u20192\u201d with a 7-8\u201d wrist, and tried a friend\u2019s Fossil with the leather band, which fit. It is unfortunate because the watch is a good looking timepiece. The contract of numbers against the face make it easy to read - a nice military appearance. I could see no more than three stars as a watch with such a large case should have been designed with a band to fit a normal wrist",

The band is a bit small for my wrist but is well crafted and just fits. I highly recommend this watch to anyone interested in a black watch that exudes power and no-nonsense purpose.",

I found this to be odd as it should have not had the battery active until I pulled out the plastic guard. So I don't know how long the battery has been running before I received it.",

It has a nice leather strap and is beautiful. He has gotten many compliments on it. All depending on the size of your wrist, this watch would be great for anyone who is a watch lover. I do suggest maybe you print a template of the size of the face to make sure it's not too big for your wrist. Everyone's different.",
