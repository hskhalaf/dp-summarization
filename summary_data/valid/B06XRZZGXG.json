The label in the sheets actually say they\u2019re changing pad covers, which makes more sense given their size. They\u2019ll still work with a little stretching but I feel I shouldn\u2019t have to stretch them so much to make them fit. The prints are really nice and the sheets themselves are really soft so there\u2019s that. I\u2019ll just use these as back-up sheets in case baby has a blowout, which let\u2019s face it, happens from time to time.",

However, the biggest problem is size---the sheets make the insert pad bunched up and bent. The elastic is too strong, nothing that can't be fixed if you're able. Pictures show bent mattress after I removed out some elastic out. When purchased it was bent even more, that's why I gave it only 3 stars. Dimensions of my bassinet mattress are 14.5 inches x 29 inches x 1 inch.",
