Now I don't want to return it, and I don't know how to cancel the return. lol.",

I like the feel of the rubber coating on the Metabo and the clutch is better than the red brand. Only drawback is no battery level indicator however it does come with a light. This is a bargain. Tears down and assembles laptops in seconds. This tool is not for building a deck in the backyard with 6\" lag bolts. This is for assembly, repair, teardown and light/medium work. It feels solid and it is a professional grade tool. 8 month update - Still going strong at work. Cameras, Laptops, Large Projectors, misc.",

I've been using this to drill in screws for cable clips and with little use the green rubber protection grip is already peeling off and excessively. I haven't had this issue with black and Decker tools and for what I paid for this unit I expected much better quality. Especially after reading all the great reviews. Apparently there is lifetime warranty on the body so I'll have to check that out of its an option.",

Ergonomic, good torque, accurate torque release, excellent battery time, quick charging. We've been using them for a good while now and out of over 50 in service only one has died.

Bottom line is for light work, I'd rate it 5-stars.

This drill is the perfect size, great price, with uncompromising power, and two lithium ion batteries - the first of which I am still using after almost two months of use. One hesitation I had is the magnetized bits. They are useful to keep those buggers from falling and to keep an incoming screw steady, but in electronics it is very risky to use magnetized material due to the sensitive components such as hard drives. This can be overcome by purchasing a separate non-magnetized set by Hitachi. When I first got the unit, I folded it up and back down, and got a good pinch. Watch your fingers!",
