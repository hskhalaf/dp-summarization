RV tires typically \"wear out\" by date, not by tread depth. This merchant shipped tires with date codes only about three months past, which is about what you would expect from the best brick-and-mortar tire shops. Can't yet speak to actual mileage/wear on Carlisles, as ours are still new.",

Maybe they hold up better if they stay covered but I have Goodyear's that are about 10 yrs old that still look better. I wouldn't expect to see the side walls do this for at least for years, I will go with Goodyear's next time. All tires had 2018 date codes.",
