His only complaint is that the beverage comes out slowly, but that's not all bad if you are filling a cup from this cooler. I would definitely recommend this and purchase again.",

I had to try to dry up about half a gallon of water from my car one day. Lol. But I am still pleased with it, as it functions perfectly as long as it's not dropped on its side... And I only paid 9 dollars for it, so I can't complain! It doesn't leak all over the place when pouring into cups.. Or directly into my mouth. ;) So It's a great jug in my book!",

This style holds enough water and DOESN'T LEAK. We still have one in the garage, as we had to match the color to the group he's in this year. Also, these are made in AMERICA, which many of the others aren't - huge plus!!",
