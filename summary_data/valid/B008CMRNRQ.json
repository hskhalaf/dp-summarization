      "text": "This is NOT a weather resistant timer. I repeat: NOT WEATHER RESISTANT. I bought six of those for my wife's garden. I left them outdoors for a summer, and kept them in the garage during the winter. Out of 6 timers, 2 has malfunctioned. Apparently, the water leaked inside, and caused a shirtcircuit. I noticed that there is a fog and drops of water under the screen of LCD. When this happen, the timer starts to \"switch off\" on its own. In addition, setting them is a pain. There's no energy-independent memory; every time you need to re-program them, you need to do it from scratch. Programming interface is poorly designed and hard to use.",

When winter came, I stored it indoors in a large Tupperware bin. When spring arrived, I took it out and set it up again. It was leaking water everywhere as if all of the internal gaskets and seals were broken. It still worked for about a week, but eventually died completely. It\u2019s a shame too, the timer worked perfectly for what I wanted. It was easy to set up and it worked like clockwork. The durability issue is so big though, I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone.",

The other issues is they need to have a \"manual mode\" dial that is not bound to a timer.

The digital display is as good as ever. Seals are tight, even the plastic housing hasn't faded. Super easy (didn't need instructions) to set and change the timer. You install batteries, set the clock and then punch in time you want to start and for how long and how often. Haven't tried rain delay. Super intuitive and whole year later I'm still on original batteries.",

Seems like this would be a checklist thing given the relatively low overall quantity of parts. Product works as designed. Very simple, hose attached timer for 1, 2 and/or 3 zones. Needs a fourth outlet for always on hose because you have to disconnect one of the 3 outlets for manual watering. Not convenient. Low priced. 10-month update: Really don't like the manual watering feature. Would be much simpler to have just a on/off button to bypass the timer feature. Perhaps thats why the low price.",
