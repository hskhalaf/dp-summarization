But please be aware that if you have a wireless charger for your phone it will not charge unless you put it on the very bottom or top of your phone. I had to take it off and put it back on 3 times before the wireless charger would work correctly. Luckily, they give you several 3M sticky pads so I had enough but it did slightly mar the surface of my phone case. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s metal and not plastic like the Popsocket I used before. Looks Great though!!!",

      "text": "This ring is just what I was looking for. I\u2019ve been using it for about a month now and do not see any lifting up from my case. It is still fully in tact and working wonderfully. I love the rotating option as this has come in handy depending on how I\u2019m holding my phone. I can fit two full fingers in the ring for extra support, but I have smaller fingers. The ring is also sturdy enough to prop my phone up on its side, just as described. Love it!",

      "text": "I had one of these before, it lost its rose gold plating and the ring hinge got loose, but it was after a year, and overall it was fine so I bought the same one mainly because I knew it had a strong magnet. The magnet in this newer version will not hold my phone, which is a deal breaker. If you\u2019re not looking for a magnetic mount, it\u2019ll probably be okay for you, but if you need one your phone will become a projectile in your car with this.",

Because the ring can be adjusted 360 degrees, my finger can rest comfortably however I'm holding my phone -- it sounds like a small thing, but it's definitely a big deal. Way better than door-knocker style rings I've seen and tried that only flip open without an adjustable angle. Package came with simple instructions, a cleaning wipe and like ten extra stickers; good if you're switching phones or phone cases often I guess. Will update if anything changes my opinion with time and wear, but overall would recommend!",
