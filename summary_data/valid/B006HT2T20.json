Healthy skin is worth the money if you can shell it out. I do wish they would find a way to make these cheaper, though. The cost is the only reason I didn't give these 5 stars.",

If your tot has super-soaker tendencies, be very vigilant if they're wearing these. We've had to do a lot of laundry lately. These also don't hold soft BMs well.
