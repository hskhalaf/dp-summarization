The scent is absolutely lovely, though I know that this is very subjective. I just did not really expect it to smell so good AT ALL! The bottle design and label didn't really appeal to me, I think they could work on that a little, but the product inside jumped right up to scrub number one in my book. So highly recommend it!",

The moisturizer in the scrub is light enough to help protect my skin while shaving but not greasy. I sometimes lightly scrub after shaving as well as it helps to kill bacteria and works as an after-shave though, it can sting if you're not used to salt. I find though momentarily uncomfortable it stops irritation and reduces ingrown hair. I highly recommend it as it doesn't have perfumes which would only further irritate skin. It's great for the rest of the body too.",

I dont break out alot, but if I do its typically in small instances. However when I used this, I did break out in one spot and it has been a nuisance. I chalk that up to my skin needing to get used to the product. I will definitely use this again.",

The scent is very subtle and to me is smells like pink lemonade. I love it because it leaves a nice oil left behind after you rinse off but by the time your completely dry your skin doesn\u2019t feel oily but just super soft! Use as a pre shave and not after because it does burn like hell on any kind of cuts or acne but doesn\u2019t last long. Love it!",

The salt does a good job of exfoliating all the dead skin cells and the oil helps to moisturize after rinse. So far, I haven't broke out and in fact, my skin looks much smoother and softer.

I used a back brush and rubbed it all over, even on the bottoms of my feet. Exfoliates wonderfully and leaves you smooth. And as I mentioned, the scent is wonderful. Great for rough elbows too!",

I\u2019m so happy with the results, I\u2019ll always have this on hand. I bought this because I was intrigued with stem cells and lychee scent. The scent is so light, I couldn\u2019t really identify it. But the salt is the finest I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019m a skin care product addict! I\u2019ve used everything and made my own. This is hands down the best.",

I have combination, menopausal facial skin, and this product is doing wonders clearing up topical imperfections and dryness. I love it and may be a lifetime customer.

Cons - I wish they had a tub size or a larger size. Great uses besides as a body scrub. You can use it as a body soak, you can put it in your foot spa when giving yourself a pedi. It will revitalize your aching feet.",
