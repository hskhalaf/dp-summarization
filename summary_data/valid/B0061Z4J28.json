Our family has always raved about the great cup of hot coffee we served, using a Farberware perculator. Have use Farberware perculators for years, the quality of the perculator is NOT what it used to be. Very disappointed customer.",

I tried a different cable, a different outlet, still nothing. I'm not about to try anything else since it is brand spanking new. Seller was great; I received product before expected, but Faberware is a different story. Too bad. I love percolated coffee, but the life of of their pots has gotten worse and worse.",
