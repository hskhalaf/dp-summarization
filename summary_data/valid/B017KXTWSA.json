I dont know how to best explain it other than it had no real defined shape. But ultimately, my real complaint is that I couldn't get the bag to stay upright when I put it down, it would fall over in different directions and everything would slide out. Maybe it was the size and weight of the Milady book, maybe it was the material, but I am done struggling with it",

I loved the velcro system though, it was so easy and efficient to just open it, throw a book in, and close it back up, had a feeling it would last a while. If you don't like lint; be wary!",
