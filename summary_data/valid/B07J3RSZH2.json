      "text": "I purchased this product because it was advertised as providing very bright light. It does. The electricity in my house went out for several hours last night. I popped in four D-cell batteries and turned the lantern on to its brightest setting. It put out an amazing amount of light. I was able to read comfortably with the light it provided -- unlike most camp lanterns, which are rather dim. Also unlike most competing products, it was easy to insert the batteries. Very satisfying. One warning: At the lantern's brightest setting (it has four), the batteries only last for about six hours. Keep some extra D-cell batteries in reserve.",

The hanging hook on the base, to hold the lamp inverted in a tent just pops off easily. You should hang it by the bail. This is a heavy, bulky unit. Not for the backpacking camper. But as far as *light* is concerned, it is a fantastic unit that will outshine a Coleman Propane dual mantle light. You can dim in several steps if you want less light or you want to conserve batteries. Five stars.",

One of the posts that is connected to the lid also broke. This has been consistent with the quality of most Chinese products at low price points.",

Battery installation should be EASY and take less than 5 seconds - not on this lantern. This product should be redesigned, especially the battery cover.",
