They welcomed its apparently efficient stability features, its correct sizing scheme and width profiles, and the comfortable underfoot experience. Some testers lamented its seemingly large silhouette, but they\u2019re isolated complaints.",

Also, I'm a heavier runner who also does triathlons, and I must say I really enjoy the comfort of these shoes. They're a little crazy in the looks department, and I wish the material wouldn't get dirty quite so easily. But, they are fairly light for their size and really comfortable. I highly recommend these shoes.",

That is across New Balance, Nike, Merrell, Vasque, etc. They were bought as walking shoes, so nothing heavy duty. They started to smell awful, a problem I've never had before with my feet and shoes. They also fell apart at the inside heal area in both shoes. Again, I've never had these issues. I really want to buy another pair, but know they'll fall apart again. Now, they are unusable because of the heal issues. A set of Odor Eaters insert took care of the smell problem.",

So much so I also bought the Blue and Lime pair. Also bought a pair for my dad who is a chronic back patient, he walked around Disney world for two days and said his pain was basically non existent, when in other shoes it usually would be at least an 8.
