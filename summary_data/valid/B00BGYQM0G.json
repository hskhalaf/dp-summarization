Hated to buy this and give my kids more sugar, but it was my son's biggest wish for Christmas. Gumballs included are fine, better than expected. Taste just as artificial and loose their flavor after 3 minutes just like the gumballs 30 years ago. Childhood memories for me as a parent too.",

They just never want to leave it alone and I have no way to lock it.",

Does not light at all. The top cover is the only piece made of metal, and the coin dispenser is made of a cheap plastic and you can turn the knob without putting any money in it. We were disappointed because it was a new way to teach my daughter how to save money and also for her not to have her sisters take her Gum all the time without giving her coins for it. But she likes it so that\u2019s I guess is the important thing.",
