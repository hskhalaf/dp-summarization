      "text": "I bought this in November 2013. It last about 4 years. The bottom is still chilling, but the upper compartment stopped chilling. It did the job well until it failed. It has a nice look - pretty much inconspicuous in the corner of the dining room. I never really used the pull out feature of the shelves. I just pulled the bottle right out. I might have had a couple of instances where the bottle was a bit too big, but not so much that it really stuck in my mind. If you do not mind having to replace it every 4 years or so, it is a good choice. At least it wasn't one of the $800 models.",

I have it in my dining room which has a wood floor and it is whisper-quiet, even when the compressor is running. The most I hear is very low hum. As far as temperature control is concerned, it's pretty even, though sometimes it does go a couple of degrees cooler than my standard setting of 58-degrees, especially in hot weather. I suppose the compressor is working overtime. But all in all, this is a great storage unit for a small, temporary collection.",

Before purchasing I'd read reviews with people complaining of some wine fridges being too noisy, however, we don't hear noise from this one. Although we keep it in the pantry, we leave the pantry slightly open so there's plenty of air circulation, and we don't hear it. We're also frequently in there and don't hear it. Once I accidentally left mine open for 24 hours and was so scared that I broke it and I didn't! I just unplugged it for a few hours, plugged it back in and it was fine.",

I made an inquiry to the company, but it was past warranty, and it would not have been worth it to repair. Yesterday, the lower chamber died as well. I realize that appliances don't last forever, but this was an especially bad buy. I would not consider this brand in the future.",

      "text": "We've had the unit for about 2 months and it is working fine so far. Temperature control is accurate. The wine slot is tight for a larger bottle but not too inconvenient. The LED only lights the upper half of the interior. We need room lights to see the lower half. Your add says the top holds 10 bottles, bottom holds 8. It is reversed on our unit. Unit is fairly quiet, but seems to run continuously.",
