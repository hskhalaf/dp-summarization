Also, the top firing sound on this system is weak. If you want this feature you should purchase a soundbar that ha top firing drivers and not just holes pointed up. would I purchase again...NO Is it a good value...probably yes, since it does give good 2 channel sound quality.",

Our speaker then started a static sound out of the left side 1 week ago which makes it unbearable to listen to and worsened over the last week. The $300 speaker has become just an expensive paper weight. I reached out to the company who refused to replace the product. So although the initial sound was great, the product and service was a disappointment.",
