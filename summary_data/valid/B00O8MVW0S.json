      "text": "This was purchased as a replacement for the same model which failed (one in six) in about a year after installation. I just wanted the duo detection mode & having matching detectors. I like the dual mode photo & Ionic. Maybe this will save a life someday. I would of liked this smoke/fire detector a lot more if it had a 10 year battery life, but changing the AA battery (not 9 volt) is not a game changer for me. The battery change only takes a few minutes.",

Even though the mounting bracket was a different size, it has two sets of holes for the mounting screws, and we didn't have to drill new holes to fit the new bracket. That was nice. What I'm really excited is the ten year battery life. Ten years without replacing batteries or waking up at three a.m. to low battery chirps. To me, the extra cost for the ten year battery was worth it. I'd spend more than that replacing batteries every six months over that time, anyway. And we'll sleep better too. :)",

This alarm makes use of both ionization and photoelectric sensors to offer the earliest possible warning regardless of the type of fire. Sometimes a fire can smolder for hours before erupting into flames. Photoelectric Sensing Technology is more sensitive than Ionization Sensing Technology at detecting these sorts of smoldering fires, like those caused by cigarettes burning in couches or bedding. Other fires erupt into flames quickly, like kitchen grease fires or fires fueled by paper burning in a wastebasket. Ionization Sensing Technology is generally more sensitive than Photoelectric Sensing Technology at detecting these sorts of flaming fires.",
