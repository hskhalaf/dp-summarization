In my opinion an this is not my first nor my fifth speedboat that I have gotten, an all on a very good speed bag platform with zero vibration to interrupt my rythm or speed or rebound. For the durability part I put three stars. Cuz I have just gotten it. due to the fact that I constantly brake them I have a good feeling that this one won't last more than a week. In my opinion (the Pro impact small speed bag). is the best bang for your buck considering these 2 are the same price.",

It's shape makes it forgiving to hit as it has a large sweet spot. The colored title bags are also good bags if you change out the butyl bladders for latex ones. This bag has a butyl bladder but it doesn't have the dead feeling that the colored title bags have. I would say that this is a bag you can learn on and grow your skills with.",

The bag holds air great, rebounds really well and has been an outstanding bag since I first hit it. However, make sure you have some decent rhythm before you get a 5x8 bag as they are smaller and a bit more difficult.",

So, a speed bag was shipped and it did not retain air, I called Title and emailed amazon working together they replaced the bag quickly. I am extremely content with the speed bag, but even better the service. I will certainly order Title equipment and order from amazon again. Title is a professional leader in providing combative sports equipment and I am impressed with the selection. They have quality products priced to gives the consumer that has more or less money options.",
