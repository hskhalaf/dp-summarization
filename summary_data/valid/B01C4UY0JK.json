Sometimes the cameras don't work at all, and other times they don't record any events or send any notifications. There is very little support for these. The only suggestion is to just return them. There are a lot of problems with these, but for 60 dollars there were initially a really good deal. Now, I'm not sure they're even worth owning at all. There are so many other cameras that have software that is actually well-written, unlike the abandonware-quality that runs these. I would not recommend.",
