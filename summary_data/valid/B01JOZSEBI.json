But today when I went to use it a second time to roast another turkey it just won't come up to temp, it's been all the way up on 450 for more than 90 minutes and not even hitting 300 degrees.This is after preheating and roasting with the dial set to 325 for another hour and a half before realizing my thermometer was registering only about 190 degrees. So glad I used this again within the return period. Dont know what happened cause like I said it worked great the first use.",

After 3 months of use of this Roaster Oven, I have to say that this is a good quality oven and I am using it for the restaurant every day, and everything works well. The size is good too. One thing that I have to mention is that this oven can't boil the water. I don't know it only happens in the oven that I have, or they don't expect the user to boil water in this oven.",

I probably use electric roasters in the summer more because it doesn\u2019t heat up the house but all year long I love roasting turkey, chicken and baby back ribs the most. They are always moist and tender! I bought a digital thermometer that you poke into the meat and the internal temp is transmitted to a unit that sits on your counter. Best combo ever!",

My biggest complaint is that it doesn't have an On Light or an Off setting. A fifteen cent LED indicator and an ability to have it plugged in but off would increase the value of this device immensely.",

They live in a spec house with some cheap wiring so if your place is older or if you occasionally blow fuses with multiple appliances running simultaneously I would avoid this. The turkey was moister than usual so if your wiring is soild it\u2019s probably a good buy.",
