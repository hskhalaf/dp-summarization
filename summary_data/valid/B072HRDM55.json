I have Samsung Note 9 and the only negative thing I notice that when recording video in the highest resolution (UHD 60 FPS) it will not save it to this card, it will be saved to the internal storage of the phone. If you record in the second highest resolution (UHD) which I believe it's 30 FPS it will save to this card with no o problem. So you will have 2 Camera folders with images in your Gallery app. Other than that it's a good card.",

I\u2019m not one for investing a ton of time into reviewing these things, and I\u2019m sure there are many other reviews with in-depth speed tests, but I will say that it\u2019s been very speedy for me. Using a reasonably high speed USB-C memory card adapter, and flashing Raspian onto this card for use with a Raspberry Pi 4b (why I bought this card) it writes the image at around 45mbps and reads to verify the write at well over 60mbps. Color me happy!",

In that case Samsung needs to work on there quality control. I love Samsung products and have them for TV and phones, and even ddr4 ram, and a Evo plus ssd in my laptop. All work wonderfully, there SD cards are just bad stick with other well know well tested brands.",

B when speaking of transfer is Bytes, where 'b' is bits' which is 8 times smaller than a byte. To translate to real-world numbers this card transfers just around 750 to 900 megabits per second which is almost the same raw speed as full Gigabit Ethernet. USB3 is required to read at this speed as USB 2.0Max speed is around 39MBps.",

After multiple attempts, it did finally snap in and I was able to insert it back into my phone. I figured something will go wrong, but so far it's working like a charm! No more low storage alerts! I've had it for a couple of weeks, so hopefully it will all remain good!",
