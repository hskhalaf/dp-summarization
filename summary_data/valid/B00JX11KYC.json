As most of my yarn is man made fibers, I don't have to worry about moths and other bugs eating up things they way they can natural fibers- what little I do have in natural fibers has been bagged and sealed. These organizers hang easily on the closet rod and I have three of them, holding about 160 skeins of yarn in various sizes and types. It makes a great display in my craft room with my yarn arranged by color too!",

There are pockets on the side that hold all my pattern books as well as my knitting needles & crochet hooks. This product has freed up so much space & made me so much more organized with my yarn crafts. I have not let a needle or hook since I started using this!",

The other I store bins with a variety of toiletries and personal care supplies. They've held up great, and the pockets along the side are perfect for hiding little treats that you don't want to share with your kids or husband especially since neither has noticed the things have pockets ;)",
