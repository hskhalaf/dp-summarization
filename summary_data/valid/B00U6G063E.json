I didn't know spect too much from this little pad with plastic spikes. :-) Pleasant surprise\u2014so far it's much better than I expected! I used it for ~10 minutes with a cotton cloth between the pad and my skin. The discomfort was minimal and the big 'crick' in my back that woke me in the early hours of the morning was 90% better. The effect lasted for almost 3 hrs. FYI, I'm a chronic pain sufferer, so anything that provides relief is rare. I'm looking forward to trying it throughout the day to see how well the effect lasts.",

She said that the mat she normally uses(she sleeps on one every night) has longer stronger needles that are spaced closer together and her mat is smaller so it only provides pressure one area at a time which is a lot easier to handle. So I would not recommend this product for a beginner for sure! A cheap product like this one is not suitable for acupuncture, a very delicate matter!!!",

The foam is soft but so supportive that it does not lose its shape even after sleeping on it all night (which has happened) It is sooo relaxing.

The pillow took some getting used to and I dont feel like it's as ergonomic as it should be but still did a wonderful job loosening tight neck muscles.",

It\u2019s definitely uncomfortable to use, at least initially, and takes some getting used to but is well worth it, and well worth the price. Definitely something I will add to my regular pain relief arsenal and it may help me save money by cutting down on the number of chiropractic and accupuncture appointments I need. Great product.",
