I've tried everything and this is by far the best, and this specific original formula of fake bake. Not orange at all and u can reapply each night till you get your desired deepness of color. I had melanoma this past year from tanning, so I am sticking to this. Can't find a better price than here on Amazon either. Will rebuy over and over again!",

It goes on very dark so it's nearly impossible to have streaks. It will leave your hands dark if you don't wear gloves but if you scrub well after It dries just fine. I HIGHLY suggest this.",

It has that usual self tanner odor, but it does go away after you shower. If you apply Fake Bake before bed, you will need to change your sheets. Follow the directions and you will have a very pretty tan that will last several days.",

Make sure you exfoliate prior to using any tanner, btw, as it ensures even tanning.

The newest bottle is a lot thicker in consistency than previous ones and is a just a bit harder to apply, but it still does a good job. The colorant in the product makes it easy to see where it's been applied. I found that a slightly damp makeup sponge makes a great applicator and helps spread it evenly.",

It is also possible that it was exposed to extreme heat or cold prior to delivery; in which case, I paid full price for a faulty product.",

I tried it on two occasions following the directions and I did not get a shade darker. It tints you when you put it on so you look tanner, but in the morning when I showered it all came off. I could still smell it on my skin but I wasn't any darker. Buy this at your own risk.",

No orange tint at all, just a natural looking tan like you have been laying in the tanning bed for weeks. I only gave four stars because the tan than you get after immediately applying fades rather quickly. I mainly use it after showering and results are best after shaving. Results are even better when you have somewhat of a tan already, but still works well on pale skin. Melanoma is prevalent in my family, so this is the best alternative to sunbathing and tanning beds for me.",

No streaks, no orangey color. It dries quickly and even leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth as it does when using a regular moisturizing body lotion. My only recommendation for users would be to purchase an inexpenssive box of latex gloves...the product only comes with one set and, as one would imagine, they can only be used so many times before tearing or getting a bit grimey. No complaints - will continue to use!",

Also, the smell is kind of gross, but there is pain in beauty, right??",
