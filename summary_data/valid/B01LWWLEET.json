We use these strip cut shredders to shred our old papers and the shredded paper is then donated to animal shelters and rescues for use in puppy crates- and the strips are perfect for that.

It is not heavy duty, so don't put a lot of papers in at any one time and don't expect it to shred papers for hours and hours. 10 minutes tops is what this can handle in terms of steady shredding. And then it shuts off, and you must wait 10 minutes or so for it to cool down and re-set. So, if you have a busy office generating a lot of paper, look elsewhere. But if you're at home and have small piles of financial papers, bills, personal information that you need to take care of, then this is the right fit.",

Nevertheless, it was adaptable enough to work with other bins.",

I have not decided if I am going to reorder one like this again or not. Really liked the way it worked at first.",
