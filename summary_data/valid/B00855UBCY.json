It was time consuming, but if you follow the directions it goes together fine. The island is constructed of real wood, not particleboard. There are dowels to help hold corners together since it's mobile. I do suggest, though, that you track the packages. That way you can have freshly baked cookies to entice the deliveryman into helping you get those two 100# boxes into your house. My packages sat in the garage for a couple of days.

When removing the labels, the paint came off with them. I'm very unhappy. Now, ever if we \"touch up\" it will show through. Door hinges cause a dead space on hinge side of door so storage space is less that width of shelf. Do like the cart, just wish it was better quality and as advertised. Assembly was a PIA..",

The doors are not even, the right side is lower than the left using the holes they drilled. The shipping box was not damaged so I assume it was negligent quality control.This unit was not fit for sale. I had to do a lot of extra work to try to get it to look minimally acceptable. Overall you get what you pay for cheap Chinese junk. If your standard is low you will love it.",

I'm very impressed with the way all the doors, drawers and shelves line up. Its very sturdy and stable unlike some I've seen in the local big box stores. I would definitely recommend this cart to anyone.",

It will suit my needs after adding angle brackets myself, but the assembly process they provide (specifically, installing the bottom while two of the pieces are just flopping around on dowel rods) results in more frustration than $350 is worth. EDIT: I'm dropping this thing to one star. The bottom piece is so warped, that I've had to add my own wood-screws to keep this thing together. I'm sure they'd send me a new piece, but I'm done wasting my time. We'll use it until it falls over, and then throw it in the trash where it belongs. Very frustrating.",
