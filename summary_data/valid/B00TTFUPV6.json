They do not come with rims which wasnt a problem for me, but it might be for others. Tire shop said they were good tires, they had a little difficulty putting one on the rim but they said it was the rim and not the tire. Came in quicker than dated which was good considering the pandemic. Approximately 2 days. Only thing I didn't like was I couldn't cancel my order 30 secs after paying because I accidentally used my credit card instead of my bank card.",
