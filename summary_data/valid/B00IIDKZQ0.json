I have a medium sized helmet, and I had to have them on the loosest setting to fit on the outside of my helmet.",

If money is no object, go with a high end goggle from Dragon. However, Spy is the most underrated brand out there. The build quality of the Marshall is equal if not better than every other brand at this price-point. I am a huge fan of Dadali, so his pro model priced at 40$ bucks is a no-brainer.",
