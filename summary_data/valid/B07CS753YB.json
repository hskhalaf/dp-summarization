They worked with me in replacement parts to get this grill to 500 degrees as that\u2019s why I bought it to do pizzas on it I\u2019m so glad I bought it.",

      "text": "Love the ease of use! Just fill the hopper, connect it, set the temp, let it reach reach set temp, and put your meat in the grill. The temp probe allows you to monitor cooking level. The biggest adjustment will be changing how you cook vs propane or charcoal. I personally think wood pellet cooking is superior. You have more control and great smoked flavor!!",

      "text": "This is the best answer to outdoor cooking that will give you great results nice smoky flavors and a minimum of effort. The wood pellets provide the smoke and heat the water provides pellet feed, automatically to maintain the temperature you select so all you have to worry about is refilling the pellet hopped every so often. I was able to cook a 14 lb Turkey in 3 hrs and it tasted great! I swore by Weber and that is all I had for years but this one is great for slow cooking as well as grilling at high temps also. Highly recommend this one.",

      "text": "This grill replaced a Zgrill. It cooks better and more evenly with the fire box in the middle. It is less expensive than the Traeger and does a better job, IMO. The included meat temp probe is a nice bonus. The only criticism is the lack of a shelf. Yes, they do sell them but they are very expensive. Should be included.",
