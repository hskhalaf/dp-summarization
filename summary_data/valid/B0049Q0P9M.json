      "text": "After reading several amazing reviews I broke down and ordered this for myself. I\u2019ve had chronic back problems for years, so I thought why not at least try it. Even after buying it I looked at it for the last couple days unsure- THEN I pulled a muscle in my back during my morning workout- I\u2019ve been laying low all day- then I remembered I purchased this mat. Well let me tell you, after just 10 minutes of laying on it my pain had vanished. I\u2019m just blown away. My boyfriend also used it the other day, and after 20 minutes his pain was gone. I can\u2019t recommend this enough",

No of course not, but even a fifteen minute session drastically improves my pain and tension. It looks a little scary but honestly does not hurt at all and after a few moments feel great. If you\u2019re on the fence, give it a shot. It\u2019s affordable and the results are great!",

The mat works better than the pillow. It appears the bristles need pressure for them to work properly. Pros: 1) Good quality mat. 2) Effective. 3) Mat is more effective than pillow. Cons: 1) Can be shocking to use at first.",

It is painful at first, but then my back warms up and I feel relaxed laying on it.",

Produced a very good increase in blood circulation in my back, neck, head, face, thighs and knees. Work up to 30-45 minutes once you have acclimated to the mat. Extremely relaxing. Place a pillow or bolster under your knees if you have lower back problems. This will take the pressure off the lower back. I am a massage therapist and have recommended this to some of my clients.",
