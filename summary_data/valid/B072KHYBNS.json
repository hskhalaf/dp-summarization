When I first purchased them, I really regretted it - they were so tight that I had a fight to get them on, and they felt like they were cutting into my feet. I nearly returned them. A quick google, however, suggested keeping them on for an hour. And in that space of an hour, a miracle occurred - they fit beautifully. Very, very comfortable - I had two days walking around London all day in them, non-stop. No rubbing, no pain. Brilliant.",

I squeezed my feet into them and tried wearing them around the house for a bit. They bit into my heels and started to hurt. I put a pair of medium thick socks on and literally forced my feet into them and wore them like that for around 1/2 an hour. I then took my socks off and the shoes fit perfectly. They are now super comfy and I love them. TLDR - wear socks with them for 1/2 hour and they will then fit perfectly.",

This pair, as with all that\u2019s owned start a little tight before they\u2019re broken in. She\u2019s a 5.5, so this is what I ordered, and they are slightly right to get on. In a couple of weeks they\u2019ll stretch and shape to her feet and be the most comfortable shoes she\u2019s ever worn. Well recommended in terms of style. This deep red colour goes well with jeans and a variety of styles, and work equally well for popping out into town or wearing round the house as an alternative to slippers. Well worth the money.",
