Less expensive mandolins do not seem to have the option of several different thicknesses of slices. The legs are sturdy and the mandolin does not seem to move around a lot on the counter.

The plastic platform that you slide the food item you're cutting over is capable of flexing a bit as it meets the blade. It's a problem if what you're slicing is harder than a potato. You have to apply pressure to get the blade to cut it, which causes the plastic platform to bend a bit. Then the food item enters the blade at an angle and gets stuck.

I rated it 5 stars across the board despite some people's concerns about cutting hazards. Sharp blades are SAFE blades - and anyone who runs their finger across anything sharp (like a razor blade) can expect to be cut - common sense, people. What a nice, convenient time-saver. I also have a large, professional mandoline with a straight blade that I will give away because I never used it after using my friend's Mueller Mandoline. This one is sooooo much easier to use and clean!",

The metal prongs don\u2019t extend down past the flat surface of the holder so whatever you are trying to cut has to fit perfectly in the cut out holder in order to be held by the metal prongs. Additionally the guides that keep the holder off the blade are too high so you are left with a half inch piece of fruit you can\u2019t slice. Wish we had kept the box so we could return it as I end up using a knife to cut the remainder of the fruit or vegetable anyway.",

I do wish their was a fully lowered position for the main slicer blade so as to completely remove the accidental cut risk.

With most fruits and vegetables, it works great, but with stuff that is more firm or harder, it gets a bit more difficult, like potatoes, but that was expected.

I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH JOHN PALMER WHO WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL, COURTEOUS AND KNOWLEDGEABLE. HE NOTED THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF ITS NEWNESS AND ADVISED ME TO LEVEL THE BASE AND TO PRY IT UP. IT WORKED! I EASILY CHANGED BLADES WITHOUT FURTHER PROBLEMS. I USED IT TO SHRED ZUCCHINI, SLICED CUCUMBERS AND EGGPLANTS. IT WAS EASY TO CLEAN AND I SEARCH RECIPES WITHOUT CONCERN FOR CUTTING AND SLICING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",

I would highly discourage you to buy this. I tried to return it and was 5 days outside of my \u201creturn window\u201d so that was a fun 30.00 gone to waste. Additionally to the things mentioned above this thing is nothing short of a nightmare to clean and takes about three times the room to store than my previous slicer.",

So when I want to slice something 1/4\" (for example), I can adjust the thickness, but it's not labeled for the thickness.
