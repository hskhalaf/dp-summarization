I have since noticed that these do not have a Franklin tag on the inside like the ones bought from the store. The tag indicates where they're made as well as model number. Neither of these gloves have that. The first pic shows store bought on left, Amazon ordered on right. Also after taking a few swings in the mirror the right glove shows separation in pic 2. I've lowered my rating and expectations. I'm beginning to think they're knock offs.",
