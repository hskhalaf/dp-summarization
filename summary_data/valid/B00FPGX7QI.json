Also, after using a specific type of glass cleaner, (which could have been my fault for not doing a spot test first) some of the black strip looks as if it\u2019s worn or chemically faded. That cleaner did a number on it. :( Update- after having this table a while, the glass is easily scratched, and that same black ring has faded more and looks terrible. I don\u2019t know if this was continued degradation from the cleaner, or just a bad product.",

I love the way these things look and the glass is kinda thick, so I know it's not going to break easily. Assembly was a little annoying, but the trick is to not fully tighten all the screws until you get all of them all inserted and threaded. You'll need the wiggle room to line up the holes to screw the legs together. Afterward, tighten all the long screws holding the legs together, then tighten the smaller ones to the big metal ring. I looked at many end tables before finding these.",
