The worse is, you have to reboot your machine after seeing that error msg, otherwise windows can't find the scanner. Never tried film scanning, going to return it.",

I have compared images for a week and I cannot get an image as good as the Acer produces, therefore I will be trading the scanner in for something different. I really didn't expect the scanner to be below the quality of my 4 year old scanner. Images appeared to have serious focus problems, tried all sorts of color management with no help on color issues. Spend a little more money for something better. Also, the external scanning is only 24-bit, and not true 48-bit as advertised. Only after reading some PDF files did I find this.",

The software that comes with this scanner is great. Installation was a breeze. Not to mention I was in market to but another printer, I bought an Epson Printer and this Scanner and got a rebate back. So I actually got this scanner for free. Great bargain!",

The slide scanner attachment worked well, but the flat bed scanner produces dark color bars over about one third of the scanned page and I can't figure how to get rid of them. The part of the page not effected by the color bars looked very nice, but I need a full page scanner not a two thirds page scanner. I'm going to return this unit and request another, if that doesn't work I'll go with a different brand. I'm surprised, I've always had good luck with Epson products. One star was for the unit design, the other for the slide scanner attachment.",

Buy a Canon for less and go out to dinner on Epson with what you saved.",

It even picks up fuss and dust, so you need to make sure whatever you are scanning is wiped off first.",
