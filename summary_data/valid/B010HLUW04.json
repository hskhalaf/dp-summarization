I bought another at the big box store that had been sold out on Amazon and went through all of the noise modes for a couple of weeks spontaneously even after wraps.

The head and legs are pose-able. She will walk toward the sound of the rattle (or any sound). If you lay her on her back, she will coo or snore. Very cute. There is no padding under the fur, so you can feel the plastic robot parts underneath but that's a common issue that doesn't seem to bother my child.",

It actually walks which is impressive because we have the far more expensive Roaring tiger and he doesn't walk at all. The fur is soft, but the paws are made of felt and the eyes don't blink. I bought it on sale for $35 on Black Friday which was a great deal, but I think if I paid retail price for it I would be slightly disappointed. Overall it's a decent present for a little girl.",

It walks, mews, makes little \"baby snow tiger\" sounds (realistic? who knows), makes slurping noises and kicks legs when you feed her the bottle. Only moves for a few seconds before needing stimulation again. Head is positionable, so are back legs. Baby is under recommended ages but really there are no small loose parts and skill needed to operate is minimal. Interest is probably optimal at this age rather than for older kids. Can recommend based on how my toddler likes it, plus its cute and not annoying.",
