I'm assuming that the sprayer head dropping on the ground during the work caused the leak. Replaced the sprayer head with a Bidet Sprayer Head for $10 and now up and running again, and so far the new sprayer head is way better than the one that came with it originally. Pressure with the original head wasn't great but it worked. If you try this out and have problems with the pressure, try a Bidet Sprayer Head instead of replacing everything. Hopefully the new head will last as long as the original.",

It has been working great for the past 2 yrs and despite the kids playing with it and making a mess in the bathroom it is a great product. We did have to tighten it a bit after a while just because it got loose and didn't stay up on the edge of the toilet. But it was a 5 minute fix. This makes cloth diapering so much easier since we can get her diapers clean with out getting our hands dirty and scrubbing poop off!!",

With the shutoff being by the wall, it is hard to get to. I end up leaving it on, which means if i bump into the handle or drop it, i get sprayed. I guess if it's good enough to buy it again even after it broke after a couple months, it's worth buying the first time.",

Our main sprayer at our home is the Aquaus sprayer (rebranded Bumgenius sprayer) and it is VERY high powered. I sometimes hate it, because it splatters everywhere when you push it completely. This one is the opposite, the water pressure is much lower and it takes forever to spray off things when visiting and definitely made me appreciate the quick effectiveness of the Aquaus water pressure. Not bad though if you don't have much to spray off (peanut buttery sticky poo) as this one won't get everything everywhere and make such a mess.",

Maybe the pressure at my house is higher because it is too powerful.

Then all of a sudden the hand piece (the part you use your thumb to release the water) broke. I had thrown away the packaging and was a littler over a month so it was too late to ask for a refund. I'm pretty upset because it wasn't cheap and I expected to get more use out of it. I didn't even get to use it on the diapers. I'm very disappointed.",

But then one night I heard water running in the bathroom, the sprayer was leaking like crazy. We couldn't fix it. It was 2+years old at the time and had seen a lot of use. So we bought a new Bumkins diaper sprayer. It leaked from installation. I hate it. It gets water everywhere and it's not easy to work with. I limp along with it, but it has to be turned on and off at the toilet connection. Won't buy another from Bumkins.",

It works great on Bum Genius but I noticed on Fuzzibunz it takes longer to get it off. It also causes some back spray on the floor but thats not a fault of the product.",

I wish I could just look at it and tell if someone left it turned on or off. But I can't see it and I can't tell from looking at it.",
