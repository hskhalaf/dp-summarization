Additionally, the tablet would frequently freeze mid applications and sometimes even restart it self when I was in the middle of a task. The only thing I found that I did like about it was the weight, size and expandable memory feature. Other than that I felt like I really got what I paid for with this tablet.",

UPDATE: this is a great tablet but not for drone use, it continued to lock up and freeze using the DJI Phantom Pro 3 and DJI software. This issue can lead to flyaway drones. WARNING!",

      "text": "First a confession: I am a big fan of Apple products and I have an Ipad2. But when I was given the opportunity to review the Acer tablet I decided to get off the Apple bandwagon and give the Acer tablet a try. The screen clarity and resolution are very nice but unfortunately the Acer did not perform well at all for me. The touch screen controls are very buggy - I found myself having to really press and hold my fnger against the screen to get it to respond. The applications are very buggy and the battery life short. My recommendation is that if you want a table, do yourself a favor and get an Ipad.",
