It got so hot it partially melted the plastic top. Had a sunbeam for 20 years, wish they still made that old machine....",

All you have to do is pour in the kernels and plug it in. Make sure you have a large bowl ready. Taste: I love that it's a healthy option but boy, does it taste different from popping with oil. It took us a while to get used to. We add powdered popcorn flavors to this or spray oil and salt onto it. I recommend this machine as a healthy alternative! We use it once a week.",
