The Power Bank would solve that problem since I could put it under my pillow and not worry about turning in bed. Highly recommend this for anyone BUT especially for dry eye people.",

Negative: there is a slight neoprene-esque odor that isn't the best (I am VERY sensitive to odors), but this not a deal breaker for me. I would recommend this eye mask.",

I was confused about the invitation to get an \"extra\" mini power bank if I reviewed the product for Amazon: there was no mini power bank in the original package. I'll use this mostly for travel when I don't have access to a microwave to heat up my other eye mask.",
