I bought 2 wooden muddlers on Amazon and by the second use (same night) they had developed serious splits. This is bad cosmetically but also for health because you are not supposed to wash the wooden ones. Anyway, the black plastic muddler works well, has enough length for tall mixing grasses, cleans easily and doesn\u2019t add any off-taste. It cost more than many others, but it is worth it. I comes with a cardboard tube shipping box that is ok for storage. Now I must go to attend to my mint plants....",

It\u2019s super easy to stick the muddler into the opening of the glass mouth and I am able to grate the ginger directly into the container and muddle it in the bottle so I don\u2019t lose any of those nutritious juices like I would if using a separate container to muddle, then poured the results into my bottle. I love that I can use less dishes to make my fancy water!",

I have used this multiple times for cocktails and I have also used it when creating fruit flavored lemonade for my boys.

Allows me to have more wiggle room when im muddling multiple drinks, instead of having to really go for it with a smaller muddler. Material is also quite sturdy, yet comfortable in the palm and has a good grip. Very pleased!",

    "title": "Cocktail Muddler - Dishwasher Safe, Ergonomic Drink Muddler for Home bars and Professional Bartenders (Black, Plastic) - A Bar Above",
    "description": "Professional Grade Black Plastic Muddler\n\nDesigned by a career bartender for bartenders and serious cocktail enthusiasts. This cocktail muddler was created from scratch to be the most comfortable, durable and beautiful muddler available on the market. We designed it to solve all of our frustrations with the other muddlers we:\n- It is extra long\n- It has an ergonomic, comfortable handle\n- It is made from food-safe, dishwasher safe polypropylene\n- It has a flat end, perfect for muddling herbs and fruit alike.\n\n\nKnuckle Friendly and Ergonomic\n\nThis muddler is meant to make your hand happy! First, it is extra long - so you won't bang your knuckles on the edge of the pint glass or cocktail shaker you are muddling in. Second, it has a rounded, ergonomic handle that's been custom designed to be the most comfortable muddler you've ever used. \n\n\nFood-Safe and Washable\n\nMany wood muddlers have a lacquer finish which can chip off and contaminate your beverage. This muddler is made from safe and washable plastic. Throw it in the dishwasher without hesitation!\n\n\nDon't Kill your Mint!\n\nWhen muddling herbs, it's important to muddle gently to release the aroma without smashing too hard - as you will run the risk of turning your drink bitter. That's why you'll almost always see craft bartenders choosing muddlers with a flat end (without spikes). The flat end is the best way to release the beautiful aroma in mint and fruit alike - without releasing bitterness instead.\n\n\nChoose the muddler that's been shaped from years behind a craft cocktail bar. You'll love the comfortable handle and beautiful hardwood style that are perfect for busy commercial bars and home bars alike.",
