I will watch the ball quickly sail out of the backlight's range and it will be a yellow/white orb approaching the ground. Sometimes it will bounce before Annie gets it, other times not. Either way, the glowing orb stops, changes directions and floats (in a trotting run) back into the light. 3 years with this set. Many times over the fence but even then, follow the glow. If your dog doesn't care that it is dark, just stares at that thrower, this is the ball for you! I'll try to add a picture.",

Our dog grabbed it and took off, chewing it like she does any other ball. Less than half an hour later and it was torn to shreds and we had to track down every piece to make sure she didn't eat it. Admittedly, she is an aggressive chewer, but we had always had great luck with the non-tennis ball chuck-its. If they could make these like the ultra balls, then it would be great. Right now though? Not even close to worth the money.",

We have 5 year old male and female German Shepherds and they love fetching this ball and trust me they can really chomp on them. They seem to last forever, especially the more solid type but thought I'd try the glow in the dark version. It glows very brightly when placed in sunlight for just a few minutes. I'm sure a lamp would also work well or maybe a bright LED flashlight. We also buy Kong products. Durable and safe. Try getting the large size for larger breeds.",

Charlie loves this ball and the blue whistler ball so much we have to put them away until the next time it\u2019s time for fetch.

If it can be destroyed, it WILL be destroyed, and if it can't...she's not interested). Sometimes these balls make a whistling nose when thrown, which really attracts her attention. The glow is awesome--only takes a few seconds with a flashlight or phone light to charge these, and they stay bright for quite a while. Perfect for winter-time fetching! I'll probably have to find somewhere to buy these things in bulk.",

They glow and whistle slightly, which helps him track them when it's getting dark. They've also got a good bounce. We recently lost his first one down a rabbit hole, and it was not damaged at all after four months of daily catching, fetching, and chewing. I've just bought two more. I don't know what makes them glow and can only trust that it is truly non-toxic.",
