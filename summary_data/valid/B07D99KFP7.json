I replaced the drives with a 1TB NVMe Drive and 2TB Firecuda extra drive and dropped in 32GB Ram. This things well packaged, gorgeous, black brushed metal, and wicked fast. Everything just worked, booted right up after upgrades and nothing stops it with instant loads. My last HP was an HP Envy and it was also remarkably well built so I stepped up to Omen.",

The size, graphics, memory is everything my son wanted/needed to start his music production/engineering career. The screen and sound quality are virtually perfect.",

Anyone experiencing different either has too high standards, is unrealistic, super rich to find a thousand dollar laptop 'lower end', or got a fluke dodgy one. Maybe some were buying used.
