It came out great but next time i'll put the setting at a 4. My family likes waffles a little lighter. Over all I love this machine and in my opion well worth the money.",

It\u2019s a bit expensive, but worth every penny! If cost is a factor, the 2 slice waffle maker (BWM620XL SmartPro) is an option as well as the 4 slice with less customizing options (BMW604BSSSmartWaffleMaker).

I appreciate that Breville has spent the time to come up with the pretty cook time for each waffle.
