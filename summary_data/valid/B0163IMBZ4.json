      "text": "I love my new OOFOS! My first pair of OOFOS and I ordered these black flip-flops. Read lots of Amazon customer reviews before deciding to order a pair. I'm so happy with my OOFOS. I wear a women's size 9\"-9.5\" in most shoes. My feet measure exactly 10\". I was debating between the women's size 9\" or 10\". Based on very helpful customer reviews I went with the size 9\". They fit perfect! Not too small and not too large. So I decided to include a picture with my review to hopefully help someone out. These OOFOS are so soft, have good arch support, and I feel like I'm walking on cushions of fluffy clouds!",

Love the looks and the color though - periwinkle I think (blue).",

I decided to take a chance and reach out to the Oofas site directly. Well, guess what, they exchanged my wrong size. I only had to pay for the shipping of the shoe back to them (which was better than loosing out in total). Not only did I find a new brand of shoe my feet love, I also found a company I love!

I will say that even though the size was the same as the blue ones, they seem slightly smaller. I just ordered another style, the slide, in hopes they will allow my to walk my dog without pain.
