For it to be a half cord, it must measure 96 inches long by 48 inches high. You can get a half cord to fit, but you have to stack it much high than the rack. I thought by paying over $200 that I was actually getting what I paid for. Not true.",

The only reason we did not give it a 5-star rating is that the cover would be more effective in keeping out the moisture if it had another grommet in the center. It is a very windy day here today and the center of the cover flies back to expose the wood to the rain. Hope this can be modified for the next customers!",

The cross arms are symmetrical, so they go together either way. There are only two bolts and they only differ by length. They send two wrenches to assemble it, but having a ratcheted socket wrench will make assembly faster.",

The only drawback as I could see is that if you use 12 inch or less length logs (I have shorter wood for our chimenea) I had to stack longer logs at the ends to pinch the smaller logs into the unit.

They are made for a single stack of wood so they are only 14\" wide. Because I store my firewood in two double stacks, I bought 4 of these. So far, I have loaded up 2 of them. I'm able to store more wood in the same space because these allow me to stack the wood higher than I could without the rack. I highly recommend these.",

I think it's probably too expensive but I can't find anything else that works nearly as well. I've thrown away two other racks and just bought more of these.",

Easy to put together. Three winters old and looks new. Fantastic purchase and well worth the difference in price over cheaper racks.",

      "text": "I have had two of these for for more than 9 years. They look and function like new. The short cover really allows green wood to season (dry) quickly while keeping the soaking rain out of the pile. The new covers (they last about 5-7 years) come with grommets which facilitates tying it down - handy in a windy spot or when the rack is full - I added my own grommets to the original covers. I would order this again - except the ones I have show no signs of wearing out. Highly recommended!",

The unit description says that the rack can hold up to 24\" logs. If you stack your wood and put any larger pieces, even 16-18\" pieces, near the top, the cover fits very poorly and only covers 2 rows of wood barely. Nice rack but will need to purchase new cover or use only small log pieces.",
