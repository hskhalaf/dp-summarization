When I tried to install the new VirusScan 6.0 program, it removed the old virus scan program. After that, my computer refused to re-boot. I had to use a boot disk to get it going, and reinstall the old virus scan to make my computer run again. I contacted McAfee by e-mail for help and am still waiting for a reply. I am glad this product has a full rebate because it isn't worth a dime! I will purchase some other virus program for my computer soon. Guess if a deal seems too good to be true...! Beware!",

The software box and documentation claim 6.0 will work on Windows 95 or higher version, but this is not true in addition to Windows, processing speed, etc the documentation should list Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher as part of the necessary equipment. After two years of trying to eradicate IE from my system I can finally run Netscape and Mozilla with no complications, but I can't install Virusscan 6.0. I have seen the program run sucessfully on Windows 2000, but I was disapointed that the improvements over 5.X are not really significant. IMO this program is a waste of money.

The virusscan apparently was continuously running in the BIOS and I was unable to stop it. I am very troubled by this turn of McAfee's standards.
