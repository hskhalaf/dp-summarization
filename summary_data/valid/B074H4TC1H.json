We loved the color of these boots but unfortunately they are too small and not the size 5 that we ordered. In the photo I placed them heel to heel with a locally bought size 5 BEARPAW boot.",

I own like ten pairs of these things, in a variety of styles and colors and I never have regretted a single purchase. Anyway, I actually bought these for my husband, he like to wear them with jeans and also like slippers, his ancient Uggs finally gave out and he wanted taller boots anyway. So,....size 12 (women's) Bearpaws fit him. His own paws are 10-10.5, so I knew they would. He is delighted, I am delighted, Amazon gets money, Bearpaws gets money, and you get the picture. ^_^",

I feel like I really lucked out with these, a wonderful value for the price. I'd recommend them to anyone. PLEASE NOTE: These are not a dainty boot. The toe is rather bulky, but not bulkier than I would expect for this style. Just something to note if you're concerned about that at all.",

      "text": "These boots are great. I've owned UGGs and these are just as great if not better. They are very well lined and fit snugly around the calf. I got them in black, the color is rich, NOT at all dull. The sole is a sturdy thick rubber so no worries about slippery surfaces. I plan to wear them with leggings. I'm a 6.5, based on reviews I decided to get the 6. It fits just right, a little tight with a sock on but I know the shearling lining will start to wear after a few uses. I'm very happy with this purchase and will probably order them in another color!",

The boot is very very warm and can feel a bit heavy toward the end of the day. They look great, but I would have liked the shorter boot only because these are very wide at the top and difficult to get boot cut jeans over them. They look better with skinny jeans tucked in. Definitly a good boot though.",

I can't compare them to Uggs since I don't have any, but since they're $40 and not $150-200 like other brands, I think it's worth it to give them a shot.

It's not uncomfortable or anything, it's just, don't expect to be wearing them with thick socks or anything. They also don't have the best support, so I wouldn't recommend them for walking around Disneyland all day or anything. But for wearing around the house and running errands, they're fine. Good quality for the price.",

The color is a lovely shade of deep green. The craftsmanship of the boots is solid. I like that the boots have a rubber bottom instead of foam like Uggs. They are very warm and keep my feet toasty even with the weather being -3 F. When I received my boots they felt a little small, but after wearing them a few times the lambskin stretched to fit comfortably. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",

I appreciate that the soles are holding up and last until we have to buy a second pair, not because they're destroyed (like an ON pair) but because she'd need a bigger size.",

It was the foot section that fit too short at the toes. My toes bunched up at the front. This is annoying because now I have to pay for shipment back and shouldnt for poor manuf sizing.",
