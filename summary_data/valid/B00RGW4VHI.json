I contacted Columbia about this -since my boots were under warranty- and they said that I had to pay to send the boots to be repaired/replaced. Not happy about this solution as they are great boots.",

Walking in a pouring rain (but not through standing water), my feet would end up soaked because rain dripped off my pants and onto the fabric between the laces.

Still, I would have liked to get at least nine months out of these boots.",

      "text": "For a casual hiker (and someone who just found out he inherited a bleep-load of forest), these are terrific. They're light weight, well put together, and the treads are disturbingly 'catchy.' They're hiking boots, not work boots, so they probably won't handle a hunk of rebar being dropped on 'em, but on the other hand they weight a lot less -- so it's easier to run from bears. One note on size: I'm a 12-1/2 wide (in US size), so I ordered the 13 wide version. They fit perfectly, which tells me they run a teeny bit small. I'd order a half-size up and wear thicker socks if necessary.",

It fit him good but stopped wearing them after his bad experience. It was the deep of winter and very freezing temperatures and when he went into a store, the soles of the boots must have got too cold and lost all its traction. It was like walking on ice and had difficulty walking without slipping. I thought these were made for winter??? I\u2019m so disappointed that we wasted our money. Beware!",

Super comfy, space in the front for going down hill, took very little time to break in, durable, and waterproof. I recommend wearing liner socks and a pair of hiking wool socks together with these boots to have the most comfortable experience!",
