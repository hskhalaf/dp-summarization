Similar enough to give you and idea how it goes and what to look out for. Ours had all the parts needed, and nothing was damaged. A lot of the negative reviews are old/out of date. The build went smoothly here after watching. One thing I did have to redo, I put the brackets on the television a bit too low. Nothing about the stand to fault. We did have to remove the set, reposition the bracket, and rehang. We don't roll this thing around much, though it is fine on wood flooring.",

It's well balanced, but if the wheels catch on something, you'd better be pulling from down low on the tray, rather than on the TV as it can topple over if you're pushing too hard/fast. It is really nice to be able to move the TV around to different rooms or even on the porch. Definitely, recommend. if you're going to be pushing it on a deck or uneven surface, you might want to purchase some larger 4-inch wheels, the 2-inch wheels that come with this model are easily stuck in tile grout joints or other rough surfaces.",
