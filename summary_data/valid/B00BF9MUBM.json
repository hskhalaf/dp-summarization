This camera is pretty small (for a mirror-less camera) and fits well in a coat pocket. It is difficult to find bags for this camera because of it's medium, not-quite-pocket-size dimensions. The \"Superior Auto\" mode is the best I have ever seen on a camera, it takes vastly superior pictures compared to a Canon ELPH 330. If you are looking for a cheaper, almost pocket sized DSLR, then I highly recommend this camera.",

If you need to use flash, there are some caveats: The flash will not just pop up and go off when you need it. You must manually raise it by pushing the \"thunderbolt\" button. AND if you have the steady shot function turned on, the flash with not go off. This is stupid, but that's the way it works. Found this out the hard way, at a restaurant with a table full of relatives and a puzzled waiter.",

The claim that the screen if low resolution is true, we often find ourselves reviewing the pictures and thinking they are not very good, but after transfering and looking in a monitor, turns out great. This is capable of getting excellent pictures, but you do have to know a little bit of the basics at least to maximize its features. It shoots good pictures on auto modes, but I recommend learning a little about photography and shoot on manual. (P.S.: Get a proper lens cleaner)",

On several occasions now I have been shooting in conditions that would have produced marginal pictures with what I had been using before, and wound up with 'keepers'. What I have particularly enjoyed using is the terrific low light shooting capability made possible through the cameras 'Twilight' mode, a feature that is automatically engaged when conditions warrant under the 'Superior Auto' setting. Bottom line is that I am getting better pictures now and deleting less when reviewing the shots I have taken.",

I am perfectly happy with the performance so far, the images are crisp as you would expect from a DSLR. The camera does a great job at compensating the limitations of the lens (due to its size) and the high-iso results are pleasing.",

I was hoping that I could use any of my USB plug adapters and USB cables to charge the camera, but when I tried different combinations, only using the Sony USB cable and plug adapter worked. The cable is really short too. Very annoying.",

But a few days later the lens is physically failing: the zoom mechanism seems to have failed and the lens just \"falls\" back and forth when the camera is turned upside down, and doesn't respond to the zoom lever. Has this happened to anyone else with this lens? How did you go about addressing it?",

You can tell by the other reviews and indepth analysis. I will just say this...you are getting a DSLR in a small compact camera. Great for days where you don't want good quality pictures but do not want to lug your DSLR.",
