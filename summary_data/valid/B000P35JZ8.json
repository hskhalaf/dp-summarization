      "text": "This is great product that well serves it's intended purpose. Some may prefer a cylindrical design versus square but I find the square shape to be nice compliment to the rectangular backboard. My 10 year old boys have no trouble storing and removing their basketballs and the metal collar with locking screw nut has held up to impact from basketballs. My only gripe is that if you're not familiar with using the locking collar, it may take you a bit to figure out how it works. To that end, I think a little guidance on the instruction pamphlet would be helpful. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 starts.",

Note however that you will not be able to attach this to a square pole with the provided clamp. I used self-drilling metal screws and drove them into the pole to attach. Also, it's not flimsy, but it's also not heavy duty so if kids climb onto it or hang from it, it will bend. They should have made it from a heavier gage wire.",
