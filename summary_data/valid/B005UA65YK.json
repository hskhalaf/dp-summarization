It does ask you for your Facebook account but you can just skip it, the reason it asks you is because there is a button on the mouse to upload photos (completely unnecessary, but like I said, just skip it). I have WPA-2 encryption and had no problems getting it to work. The only negative I have is the scroll wheel has been replaced with a touch interface, you have to watch where you put your fingers, but it's not annoying enough to take a star away. If you have large hands you will fall in love with this mouse.",
