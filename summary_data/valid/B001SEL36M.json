I spent a great deal of time trying to work thru the instructions, but finally hit a point I could not get past, so never succeeded at firmware update. I did reinstall with the original cd and it worked like majic... for about 4 days, then it quickly faded. Failed too soon given the purchase price.",

If you have a lot of devices (more than 5-6) it seems to sense a TPN (or something) and randomly reboots itself. Again, I have a couple of Roku devices, three or four laptops, a gaming device, an AT&T MicroCell and a handful of other handheld devices that all need to connect to my network - so maybe it is just getting confused trying to handle 10-15 devices. Unfortunately, this was $100 that was basically wasted - my old D-Link router did just as well/badly.....",

This product did not even last two years, and most router I have owned last forever. I will never buy a Linksys product again (or Cisco or whatever they are calling themselves).

I recommend it if you are a general PC/MAC wireless user, and are not in need of hi-tech equipment. I am able to listen to music, watch videos, view emails, etc. The basics. Overall, i'm happy with it!",
