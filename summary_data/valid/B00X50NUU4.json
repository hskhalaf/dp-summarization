Avoid this infuser and look for something more durable.",

They have a quarter-turn style where there are three tabs that fit into three slots and you have to give a little twist once the tabs are seated. Then, these do NOT open! Definitely not a design flaw! Also, they do sometimes flip upside down, but that's what the little hook on the end of the chain is for. You pour the water in, the steeper may flip upside down, but then the hook grabs the edge of your mug and the chain won't fall in. Love these! :)",

Also as a rule I have found to only fill them up to half as the tea leaves will expand and fill in the space. good overall but just annoying to scoop the leaves out when the lid fails.",

This has led to the lid coming open during use at times. You can bend them back to make a tighter fit but due to their fragility, they can break off. The product works well with only two clips(each one has three holding the lid down) but would not work well with only one.",

I had them about two weeks before I started noticing discoloration. The other negative, some of my teas escape from the infuser. The first tea I tried with these was a Rooibos tea. About three minutes after putting the infuser in, I thought the lid had come off because I had so many floating leaves! For comparison, I can use the mesh ball infusers for that same tea without the leaves escaping.",

Though the little teeth that are used to lock on the lid seem fragile, I've been using them about 3 months and they seem to be pretty robust. One thing I have noticed is that the volume of the infusers is small, so if you typically use 1.5+ tbsp of tea, you will have trouble fitting it. Also, when packed full, it takes more time than normal to infuse the tea, compared to an infuser that fuller immerses the tea leaves and then strains them out afterward.",

It's the perfect size for one cup. Don't fill it all the way - you have to leave room for the tea to expand. The little hook on the edge of the cup makes it easy to pull out. The lid fits tightly and it's easy to clean. Yay! It works and no residue!",

Unfortunately, the floating Finums come apart too easily and dump all the tea leaves in your tea pot. I haven't seen a perfect solution yet.",
