Tried this unit in three different players including the airplane's inputs. DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY. Back it goes. Part of 17,000 miles vacation ruined.... NOT HAPPY.",

I was having difficulty hearing books on tape or music from my iPod while flying using regular ear buds - what a world of difference these make! I could still hear voices coming over the aircraft speakers, and some other background noises, but these head phones have such good sound quality, and are so good at masking droning noises, that the background noises I could hear were not bothersome. I've started wearing them around the house (hubby and kids don't like that). :)",

Cancels general annoying noise, like all airplane background noise the actual plane makes. Generally comfortable for a few hours, but if you wear a very long time they start to ge that around the ears and make you sweat. I suspect most noise canceling headphones are like this however due to the need for a secure connection. I also love BOSE customer support. I have never had an issue with these, but my in-ear BOSE have broken a few times and they replace them no questions asked.",

I love that all I have to do is plug in the rechargeable battery for an hour or two the night before a flight. They have lasted plenty long for our domestic flights as well as to the Caribbean.

      "text": "I been taking this headphones everywhere I go. the noise cancelling technique is so good that when I take off the headphones, I put it back because I like the silence. Good thing I love about this technology is that it gets rid of annoying bus noises, humming noises from kitchen and stuff while it still let the sound of someone calling you or other noises that may save your life. Great outdoor headphones. But if you like powerful base and impact, you may want to try other headphones. this one is all-around kind headphones and I sometimes wish it to hit the beat more, well just sometimes when I feel like rock n roll",

      "text": "The love: The noise cancelling function is fabulous. It's amazing how much stress just melts away when you remove that ambient noise. Unfortunately, that's all that is removed as you can still hear every word from the obnoxious guy in the seat behind you. Plugging in to music or some other sound source eliminates that guy too! The hate: I have been traveling with these weekly for about two months and they are painful to wear after about an hour, especially if I have my glasses on. Sadly, I'm returning these and purchased the in-ear version to try instead.",
