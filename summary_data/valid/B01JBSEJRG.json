I did a lot of research, which is a good/bad habit, and I am very pleased by my decision. I've had no quality issues at all, and the travel case is actually nicer than I expected. The best word of advice I received was to just upgrade the strings, which I don't hold against the manufacturer/distributor in any way. Strings are more of a personal preference, and although the stock strings are sufficient for a true beginner, the ukulele really came alive even with just an $8 pair of aftermarket strings.",

It stays in tune just as good as the product description promises. It also has a great sound for the price, much better than I expected.

It plays very well and feels easy when handling it. The package arrived a day before expected. It arrived with a nice, sturdy case and a tuner.

The intonation is great and rich, which make it a real playable instrument instead of a toy. The good quality bag gives it a plus. It is easy to carry along to anywhere I like to go. This Ukelele has elegant design, but not overly fancy. It made of good material and doesn't look cheap at all. I really enjoy playing it, which creates lots of happiness.",

I got it specifically for one song and it sounds great. Arrived right on time and I love playing it.",
