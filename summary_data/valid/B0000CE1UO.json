Be careful to watch for traffic! :-) -Great price (got them for $60 via Amazon) CONS -I have no complaints. If you have an mp3 player, do yourself a favor and pick these up so that you can actually appreciate the audio quality of your player. If you don't have an mp3 player and are looking for a small one, I'd recommend the Zen Nano Plus.",

Very small (obviously) with a snappy carrying case. The alternate ear pieces are great - oddly enough my ears seem to be different sizes! They stay in my ears even when sleeping (bad habit). Sound deadening is very good - I did not notice the flight attendants attempting to entice me with airline food! Sound quality is quite good (not as good as my full headphones though). Good investment for a traveler or anyone who wants a high performing set of earphones.",

The foam isnt as reusable as the rubber pieces included and can get a little rough on the ears however they're cheap to replace and fit odd size ears (like mine). The sound they put out is excellent and very well detailed however they do lack bass of other larger headphones I've used in the past. Plug and wires seems of a better grade and much more sturdy then most other brands you would buy in the store. Highly recommended with a star deduction for the lack of bass they reproduce.",

The sound reduction is not quite as impressive as I had hoped - I suspect the ear-covering style (Bose, etc.) might insulate more from airplane drone. Also, the way Shure wants you to curl this around your ear from the back, over the top, and down is a little too persnickety for my taste. I found myself reaching for my basic Sony buds just for the ease of use. I also found the sensation of the earphones in my ear canals wearing after some use.",

One problem is that they create kind of a weird vacuum feeling in the ear when they create a seal.

However once the product was out of warranty the cables began to tear and peel apart. They still lasted about 5 years through a combination of gentle use and electrical tape. They now no longer work. Because of this I would question Shure as a long time purchase option since the cable issue started after the 2 year mark. However despite all this I plan on trying to solder together a new cable and see if they still work just for fun since I've gotten new headphones since these died.",

For those other reviewers who insist that the base on these is realistic, I would recommend that they go out and listen to music live. The bass on these is just weak.

      "text": "After reading the many reviews suggesting that this headset was great I bought a pair for myself. I found the earbuds very uncomfortable and did not like the pressure it caused on the inside of my ear. I also found that there was way too much high end and not enough bass response. I found the sound to be way to harsh. I'm an audio producer so I plugged these earphones into everything from an i-pod to a hi-end studio system with same results. After a couple of days trying to get used to these earphones I tossed them for the Philips Surround earphones which are much more comfortable and sound very warm.",

The cord does not easily stay in that position and when it slips, sound is adversely affected. The supplied options of tips for the ear canal is a good assortment. Mid-range is a bit honky or nasally, treble was good.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Shure E2c In-Ear Headphones combines a Dynamic MicroDriver speaker technology with a sound isolating design, to deliver rich, full-range sound while blocking outside noise.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nShure's E2c in-ear headphones are tiny, lightweight, and designed to sonically outperform most ear-bud-style headphones. The E2c's unique, relatively affordable design comes from Shure's years of collaborating with professional musicians. With high-energy drivers in distinctive enclosures, the E2c produces high-quality sound with excellent isolation from background noise.\n\n The E2c's speakers are constructed with studio-grade components, producing exceptional audio clarity. Their in-ear design, using supplied flex sleeves, naturally blocks background noise. This permits lower listening volumes in loud environments--critical in safeguarding your hearing during performance or other activities. No batteries or extra equipment are needed for sound isolation.\n\n Because every ear is different, E2c earphones come with 3 pairs (small, medium, large) of flex sleeves and 3 pairs (small, medium, large) ultra-soft flex sleeves to ensure a personalized fit. These disposable foam sleeves gently compress to fit in the ear canal. Once in the ear, the foam expands to form a tight seal. Once tightly sealed, the sleeves hold the earphones firmly in place.\n\n The E2c's cables pass behind the ear--out of sight and out of the way for comfort and discretion. Weighing only 1 ounce, the E2c is lightweight and comfortable enough for any portable listening application. The set comes with a soft, stylish, compact, and zippered carrying case, which allows for an easy, tangle-free way to store your earphones.\n\n What's in the Box\nEarphones, 2 triple-flange sleeves, 3 pairs (small, medium, large) of flex sleeves, and 3 pairs (small, medium, large) ultra-soft flex sleeves (kit 90XC1371, with cleaning tool), a soft carry case (80B8232), a user's manual, and warranty information.",
