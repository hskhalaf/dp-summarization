A lot of feedback says this isn't a meal replacement, but the fact is that it all depends on what you do with them and how you use them. You may not be a big eater and these are just fine. I eat these for breakfast every morning, just to get something in my stomach. The small, but filling meal (bar) allows me to each a nice bigger (healthy) meal for lunch.

The variety pack is the best deal ever knowing that we can try different flavors on a daily basis. I think the only downfall is that there are new flavors that are out, but for some reason, we're only given the following options of flavors when we order through Amazon. Hopefully, one day, it can be switched up. For the most part, these protein bars are one of the best, if not, the only best out on the market. Thank you for providing us a safe and nutritional protein bar.",

Anyone from children to adults love the taste as they don't have the typical chalky taste. For an even better taste be sure to warm them up a few seconds in the microwave. Thank me later!",
