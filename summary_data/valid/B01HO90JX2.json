But I put a magic touch on mine that makes mine work just as well I think! But, yeah! EMDMAK works great! Mister doesn't last long like other reviewers have noted... But it lasts long enough for a small joyful period...! Like at the pool or just coming back from a hot environment or stress fueled day! Hope that review helps!",

The fan didn't do so well. It blew air. But it wasn't cool and it didn't help at all in cooling me down. I'll continue to use it, but it didn't work for what I needed it for.",

With the mister going at the same time as the fan, it feels like an air conditioner! I used this in Tennessee in the hottest days on July while on vacation and while 6 months pregnant. I also use it at work (without the mister) to help when I overheat (I'm now 8 months pregnant and getting hotter). I love that I don't need batteries - I just plug it into my computer to charge! It doesn't get any better than this.",
