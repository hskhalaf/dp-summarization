      "text": "This is a great adjustable bed base. It's made far better than the Casper base. It is heavy, solid with a good core fabric. The wall hugger works, so the pillow doesn't fall behind the bed. The adjustable legs really let you make the frame go plenty high.... high enough to accommodate my bed skirt. The bed skirt stays in place thanks to the weight of the mattress. The controls are good. I think the massage is silly and not of any value and would have swapped for the port outlets attached to the frame (which this doesn't have). Velcro on the frame also keeps the mattress in place.",

The massage function is a joke but I have never had a mechanical massage that came close to equalling the human touch. I thought the night light function would be worthless but it is just right. I love that light. The bed does stay close to the wall as the head portion rises. This thing is the bomb. The only thing that upsets me is that I waited until I was 58 to get one. Love this bed frame",

When it was finally delivered (third time was the charm), it was a breeze; first two times, not so much (Ceva needs to make customer care a priority. No one should have to wait on the phone nearly two hours before someone answer).",

    "description": "Size:Twin XL| Style:Twin XLWe watch TV, read, play video games and work from the comfort of our beds. It\u2019s the oasis after a long workday, where we seek a tranquil environment that inspires relaxation and rejuvenation. S-Cape 2.0 will cater to these needs, while providing innovative features to help promote a healthy posture during sleep with the user\u2019s comfort in mind. This adjustable base has a 4\u201d low-profile design with a contemporary, charcoal gray patterned fabric. The heavy-duty 2.5\u201d diameter legs are adjustable from 6\u201d to 10\u201d in height so that you\u2019ll always have the perfect fit. A patented MicroHook retention system holds the mattress in place so that you can eliminate the need for a metal mattress retainer bar and the foot of your base. A newly designed, back-lit wireless remote provides the user full control to relieve pressure points with weightless Zero Gravity or find personalized comfort by storing (2) of your favorite positions. Other functions include full-body dual massage with wave motion, and Snore button that quickly elevates the heard of the base 7\u201d to open up airways. These body angle adjustments can potentially help ease stress, reduce soreness in the body, and moderate or eliminate snoring, allowing you to receive the highest level of personal comfort and the sleep you need. While other adjustable bed bases lift your upper body away from the wall, the S-Cape 2.0\u2019s Wallhugger engineering lifts you up, while simultaneously gliding you back so that your nightstand and free standing remote are always within reach. Under the bed you\u2019ll find lighting to provide ambience and functionality, and a high-performance motor with lift capacity of up to 850-lbs. A flat button can also be programmed for safety and convenience, and in the event that electricity is lost, the emergency power-down feature will slowly lower the base. The S-Cape 2.0 Adjustable Base comes with a 1-year full product, 3-year parts and labor, and 25-year parts only warranty.",
