The price on this particular color was reduced so I got a very good buy. The padding makes it very comfortable to prop my feet on, although it does take a while for the dent not to show. It isn't leather and may not hold up well over time, but it could be recovered easily---just staple the new fabric over it. It looks very good and I highly recommend it for those not wanting to spend a lot on a nice, leather look ottoman.",
