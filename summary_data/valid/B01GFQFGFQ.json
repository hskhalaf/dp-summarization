Update: Apparently I had this upside down the first time I used it; I didn\u2019t realize one side was a different mesh than the other side. When I made this change, it definitely cut down on the grease splatter. Still doesn\u2019t eliminate it, but it definitely minimizes it. Perhaps the packaging should make it clearer, like \u201cThis side down\u201d or something. Changed my rating to 3 stars.",

I wish I would have bought this sooner i have some minor burns on my wrist and hands.

Its heat resistant (but I DO NOT have flames going around my pan, if you do that it may char a bit) . its easily cleaned with a dish washing brush. I think you the edges around the sides need a good bruising to prevent oil build up over time. I usually brush mine off when finished cooking and its sill warm from use.

Very solid construction, a bit pricy, but should last for a long time. I deducted 1 star on easy to clean, since I have never considered spatter screens to be \"easy\" to clean-by their nature, screens get grease caught in the mesh, entire purpose, right? Still a lot easier than cleaning it off the stove top & entire surrounding area though. Happy buyer!",

It doesn\u2019t stop 99% of oil but it helps.. maybe 85% if you use max heat like I do to sear things. I still have to clean my stove top sometimes but i don\u2019t get splashes of hot oil when I\u2019m cooking. I need to get one I can put in my oven though! I use a Brillo pad to take oil off so it doesn\u2019t burn as quickly",

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.",
