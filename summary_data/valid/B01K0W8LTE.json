I'm 23/25th through a bottle of wine right now, but I can assure you, the crsipiness was in fact the jam everyone here says it is. It is smaller than the dimensions listed, which is a plus. Highly recommend the wine and the fryer! #godblessautocorrect",

When you cook homemade pizza rolls, for example, they are burned on the outside and the cheese is literally uncooked in the center.. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!",

Using it as a classic toaster oven is great - it's big and has two levels. I use this for small quantity instead of turning on the big oven. Air frying is great - now one tip they don't tell you is that you have to PRE-HEAT before air frying. If you don't then it will blacken your food. Love this thing!!!!!!",

      "text": "Look, I don't like cleaning so, whatever. Also, the temp knob is clearly too high. I burned something that should not have burned. However, that said, this thing is really awesome and It cooks meat and pizza really well. The air fryer is a wonderful feature that I have wanted for a while and tried to get in other toaster ovens by using a wire mesh rack but this is built-in and works so well. Can't say enough about it. If you need a toaster over, this is the one. (This is the first high-class toaster over I've tried. All prior TOs were cheap Walmart versions.)",

This toaster oven as a counter-top appliance is HOT and continuously blows our fuses at the box. Never have had any issues or concerns with any other appliance!!!",
