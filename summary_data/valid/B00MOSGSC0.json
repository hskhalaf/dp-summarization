Then, the scanner stopped scanning as PDFs and only scanned as JPEGS. I cant send JPEGS to my business associates and customers. Now, even when plugged into the USB of my computer, the scanner will not recognize the computer and other mobile devices, saying the printer/scanner is not recognized. Three months and the seller will not let me return it. I am stuck with yet another printer that doesnt work and 2 year's worth of cartridges. Check return policies before purchasing. Unfortunately, electronic devices dont always stop working within the first 25-30 days.",

The help documentation is worthless, because the computer recognizes it as a printer and a scanner, but when I open the scanner it just says idle. When I open other apps to try and get around this problem they do not recognize the scanner. So, yet another printer is rendered totally useless and a waste of money. Skip ahead to a month later and now the paper will not load, even when it's full of paper. Worthless just became garbage for my kids to play hockey with. Shame on you Canon!",

The surprising issue, though, is that it keeps telling me there is no paper in the feeder, when there is clearly a healthy stack of paper in the feeder, and I've followed the prompts to tell the printer it's there. This is hugely frustrating. Eventually, after several resets and pushes, I can get it to work, but there is obviously a fitting problem or a sensor problem, such that it takes way too much work and time to get something printed.",

Love the separate cartridges and ability to keep printing when a color runs out. One thing I have not gotten working correctly... yet... is printing from an Android phone.

Color and B&W scans are good too. Cons: menu is a bit cramped on a tiny LCD screen, and the paper loader is somewhat awkward.
