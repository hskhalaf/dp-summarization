I have installed over 100 sets of brakes pads and Bosch is now my \"go to\" pad for most applications. if you live in a salt/rust area, make sure that you remove the stainless clips and wire brush that area under the clips before installing the new ones that are provided. ensure that your pads slide easily and that you don't have to force them in place.",

The first thing I noticed was that the pads didn't leave any marks on the rotor. That's a good news because I didn't had to change rotors. For the price and 3 years of usage, it's excellent. One thing though. It creates fair amount of dust on the wheel. I can leave with that.",

Upon further investigation I found that on the side it says \"for distribution in Brazil only\". The grease packet was punctured and the brakes are covered in grease. It came with the hardware clips. I'm going to clean the brakes up and see if they fit as it's less than the pita of returning and getting new ones. Besides I doubt Pathfinders in Brazil stop any different than in the US. And further I'm already down to 2mm, and can't put this brake job off any longer. 2/10 I expect better from a Bosch distributor",

      "text": "Ordered front and rear brakes in this Bosch QuiteCast line....the brakes themself are great and very quiet and low dust. My problem stems from the rear set missing one pad with rear indicator on it....how this mistake can happen is hard to understand when there's only 2 of each pad in a box.. Needed the brakes put in right away or I would've returned them...since the pads are identical I just put it in and will just have to rely on feel and visual confirmation as to wear on that side without the wear indicator.. Needless to say I was very upset....hopefully they'll pack correct parts in all future orders...",
