It's only as good as the accuracy of the one who installed the gypsum board in the first place. If he installed it at the edge, then you have a fifty fifty chance you may or may not hit the stud. I wish someone would come up with a combination of both types. You first locate the nail, then locate the stud edges.",

      "text": "This little magnet is much easier to use than a traditional electronic stud finder - which are usually pretty unreliable. The only downside is that it only picks up on nails in the stud, which hopefully are dispersed throughout the stud vertically so you can map out the stud. Unfortunately, all the nails in my studs were across the bottom of the wall so it was unclear whether there was a vertical or horizontal stud. I would probably use this in the future to map out where nails are and then follow up with an electronic stud finder to see specifically where the edges are (without punching holes in the wall with a drill bit).",

My guess that's regarding the level feature. This is a stud finder, not a level.) I have had mine for about 5 years now, and I think it will out last me!

Just place the stud finder on the wall and sweep in an \"S\" pattern to locate any metal fastener. The rare earth magnets are strong enough to allow Stud 4 Sure to hang hands-free on a wall, eliminating the need for pencil markings. The ergonomically designed, China made product is guaranteed to last a lifetime of being tossed, dropped, and banged around.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nPositively locates nails and screws with powerful \"neodymium\" magnets. The magnetic stud finder works like magic. It sticks to the wall leaving your hands free--no batteries, no calibration, no lights, no hassle. It works on wood or metal studs, and uses multiple industrial strength magnets to \u201cField Vector\u201d the stud. This is the last stud finder you will ever buy. Simply slide the flat surface of the magnetic stud finder slowly across a wall in a circular or \"S\" motion until you feel a strong pull to a nail head or screw. Once you have the magnetic stud finder directly above a nail head or screw, let it go and it sticks to the wall.\n\nSee more",
