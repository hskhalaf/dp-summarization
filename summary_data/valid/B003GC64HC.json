I'm a RN and I often work super long shifts so I demand a lot from my makeup, especially my eyeliner. This is one of the few brands that will still look good after 12-16 hours with only minimal touch up. Additionally, I wear contacts and it doesn't bother my eyes as many brands do.",

I feel sorry for everyone who threw out their sticks thinking there wasn't any eye liner left. You simply have to twist the plastic container holding the stick. I had to twist it several times, but the eye liner does advance. Just be patient and use your noodle, folks.",

The liquid liner is much better in terms of staying longer, doesn't run like the smudge stick and it is easier to remove.

When I used that color for the second time a few days later and it happened again, I suspected it must be the eyeliner.

Stila produces some great cosmetics and I decided to give this one a try. It works perfectly.

This has been the easiest to use and the least smudgy after ~5 years of experimenting with drugstore and premium brands. It lasts maybe 2 months each use. Which doesn\u2019t seem a lot to me but then I\u2019m not an expert.",
