There are nice people there that will help you too. It\u2019s amazing. Seriously thought, I told the guy I was a 10 1/2 and he brought me 9 1/2 without telling me. He talked me through how they should fit now and how they will fit after a few weeks of wear. Please support the dwindling number of retailers out there. It was the SAME price as it is on amazon and they actually fit. Great boots by the way, but that is old news to anyone reading this. :).",

It is nice to see the traditional shoemaking features, such as the stitched-on outer sole, rather than the more common Faux-stitching on less expensive boots. That being said, i am a little nervous that the tread (which is very thin) may leave the stitching on the bottom of the soles vulnerable to wearing out rather quickly if worn on hard surfaces. But only time will tell with that; and thanks to the construction i would be able to have them re-soled should that happen.",

After that they have gotten more comfortable with each wear. They are solid leather with no insulation so the do get cold. I've fixed this by simply buying thicker socks.

When the 7.5\u2019s showed up, I was almost positive they were not gonna work. Wore them around the house and noticed some stretching. After a couple days I can def tell they\u2019re breaking in. I\u2019d expect to be in a good spot after another 5-7 days. That being said...these boots are definitely cool. And the quality is evident. Expecting many miles outta my IR\u2019s.",
