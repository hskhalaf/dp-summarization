      "text": "I love using this stuff and it works great. In fact, I am always running out. I may overdue it, but I enjoy using this product and the extra piece of mind of having a clean boat. I also use it regularly to try and help my vinyl seats from 1994 from drying out and cracking. So far so good. Tip for protecting your vinyl--spray this on and let it soak for a good 5-10 minutes before wiping it off. You want to let it soak into the vinyl but also into the threads to keep them protected. Please be sure to let me know if you found this review helpful.",

How a basic silicone product smells this bad is beyond my knowledge of chemistry; must be something other than water-based solvent used. At the quantity, price, and Maguire's reputation with free shipping I thought I would get a better product than the BlueMagic product. Don't use this stuff indoors (should be a warning) but might be great for outdoor/marine vinyl furniture.",

A month after he wiped them down, they're still a majority of the way polished the way Armor All would be. Armor All just doesn't do it for this case on the boat, even though it spends 90% of the time covered. It's good to know, our black dash coverings were pretty thirsty so I see us adding a couple more coats of it back to back but were pretty impressed since this was a shot in the dark.",

I typically do a quick wipe down of the seats using the Meguiar's vinyl cleaner every time we put the boat up with a rag or a terry cloth towel. My boat is a 2007 and the seats are still in great condition. It does a great job of resisting stains and mildew and removing dirt and grime. I recommend always keeping a bottle of this stuff near your boat for daily use. It is a phenomenal product at a good price point.",
