We're building a new home with high-end finishes but ended up over budget at the end and I had to buy less expensive light fixtures for our Jack & Jill bath. These actually look better than the ones I got for the master bath which cost twice as much. I'm attaching 3 photos but they look much better in real life. My husband is an electrician and installed these. He said he had no problems but to note that there are side-mount cover screws and you need to have the ability to get around your mirror.",
