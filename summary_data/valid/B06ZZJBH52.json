These toys are cute and I think small dogs will be entertained by the soft squeak and the crunch of the banana. The seam on the eggplant, however, was torn, and stuffing was popping out of the side. Mind you, we have not even given these to our pet yet. I am very concerned about the quality of these toys. I would not recommend them for an animal that has any level of strength.",
