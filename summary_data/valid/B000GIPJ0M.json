This mass gainer has been absolutely amazing with helping me to get my weight crawling back up just a bit faster than normal. The chocolate flavor was a great surprise, really tasting like chocolate! When I added that with a drop of chocolate syrup and a tablespoon of peanut butter in milk, it tasted like those peanut butter M&Ms. Everyone has different needs for mass gainer, so this was a great surprise for me!",
