The battery door is extremely fragile and I have one broken. (bought 2 cameras). When inside the case, the battery now wiggles loose and turns off the camera. Doesnt appear to be any way to fix or replace this. I have tried to glue some plastic to the outside of the battery to compensate, but then those batteries do not work in the other camera. If they shipped 2 or 3 spare battery doors with each camera it would be a different story.",

Fantastic quality 4K video in a variety of lighting and temperature conditions. I had no problem going from air conditioned space to 95 degrees Florida summer sun and humidity. I was not able to download the 4K video to my laptop but my MAC at work handled it fine. Very pleased with it and look forward it to being in my arsenal of tools to shoot video in my business. Loved the wide angle to show the venues we were in saluting these honored Veterans.",

My issue is not rhe camera itself but the waterproof housing.
