      "text": "I Love the fact this fits in an impact allowing me to carry just one drill, however my one concern is the tiny allen set screw for the pilot bit has a tendency to tweak offsetting the pilot bit. Drilled 30 - 40 7/8 hole's daily through 18g metal with this arbor for couple weeks. There is a version that has a larger slotted set screw adjusted with a flat tip screw driver that holds up well!, I quite frankly wasn't paying attention when I ordered these. To date I haven't found the correct part / model number for that particular slotted set screw.",
