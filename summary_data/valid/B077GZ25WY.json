Sadly, the 7.5 did not fit even after ordering an extra .5 size up following the previous reviews in reference to size. Definitely stiff as most new boots will inevitably be. Overall, sad they didn't fit me but I regifted to someone else who is a 7-Slightly big on her with thin ankle socks. So, I suppose it differs. If your foot is wider, or if you have one foot bigger than the other, I recommend ordering a complete size up. Hope that helps-Enjoy your Fenty(s)!",

With that, the toe box fits well with enough space for thick socks, which I wore to initially start to break them in to avoid any potential heel blisters (happy to report: none!). The width is still a little snug, but not uncomfortable and can\u2019t feel it when walking. Like others said, because of the heavy bottom my heel does come up slightly but it\u2019s not annoying. I love them. If you\u2019re on the fence, treat yourself to some good boots.",

Second pair I just received a few days ago was an size 8 and my woman size 7.5. The shoe fit like a size 4.5 or 5.5 couldn't fit my foot in the shoes. They paid for shipping this time but never again.",

      "text": "These shoes are dope, there\u2019s no doubt about that. And they look way more expensive than what you pay! I get compliments every time I wear them. However, as most of the reviews said, it\u2019s almost impossible to get them on at first because of the toughness of the leather. So you have to be patient, try different socks, and be willing to break them in. I had blisters at first, but now I\u2019m used to the feel. If comfort is your priority, I\u2019d vote against these, but if style is, then I\u2019d definitely recommend. I feel like the world is my runway when I wear them.",
