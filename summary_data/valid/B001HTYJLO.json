      "text": "When my wife asked for this, I never thought for a moment it would help with her migranes. There are a thousand snake-oil supposed 'cures' and 'remedies' out there, and I thought this would be just another in a slew of failed attempts to help her pain. This is the only thing we've purchased that actually helps. Not medicine, not ten trips to a specialist. It doesn't get rid of them entirely, but she says it brings her pain down from an 8 to a 3. It means she can work again, and seeing her smile was worth any expense. We immediately purchased two more. Thank you for everything you do.",

There may be areas around your nose that some light can get through but you can easily use your fingers to fix it. Sometimes it may slide off during the night but if I wake up, I just put it back on.",

As an added benefit, the weight of it allows it to mold to your face better so it actually blocks out more light that a normal eye mask.
