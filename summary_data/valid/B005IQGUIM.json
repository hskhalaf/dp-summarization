However, this product was a bit disappointing. The lens does not take sharp pictures. It gives a nice soft effect though, if that is what you are looking for. Also, this model does not have wifi or bluetooth capabilities.",

Just as importantly, the camera's innovative features and design make those images easier than ever to capture. Expert Image Quality Capture every moment in true-to-life quality. With the best-in-class resolution of the extra large 20.3 MP APS-C CMOS sensor, shots are rich, deep and exquisitely detailed. For active subjects, stills can be captured beautifully with 7fps Continuous Shot/100ms AF Speed. Then review your shot on the large 3.0\u201d AMOLED display\u2014made for sharper images and glare reduction. Expert Image Quality Capture every moment in true-to-life quality.
