Only bad thing is, once its hanging up, it's hard to get the cables to come in and out of the small space in the back of the desk meant to hide everything. So if you add things to it afterwards it's a pain to get the new cords inside.",

Also, just to note you have to be able to hit THREE studs in the wall to hang this, that seems to be something that should be brought to light. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend this piece, its different than anything I've really seen before and is functional for sure. I assembled and mounted this alone- however I think mounting for a female alone might be difficult since it was a bit heavy. Just saying.",

Acceptable in a wide range of environments from the kids room to the most formal office setting, this bold piece of modernistic wizardry will draw compliments from even the most conservative of furniture afficionados. The assembly process was also very easy.",

Even the ends already have marks from the computer chair rotating into it. Overall I love the style and works great for a 27\" touchscreen computer. I absolutely love the hidden part of the desk to hold cords. I do recommend , but I also recommend to be careful around it.",

Sometimes I even forget that it's mounted on the wall instead of a traditional desk and lean on it a little and it never budges.

This desk is easy to assemble and hang, but don't use the wood screws they came with. Get Phillips woodscrews- the ones this comes with have allen wrench tops and they are almost impossible to manually screw into the studs, even with the holes drilled into them. This caused me much swearing. 3. Computer cords will be visible. I'm doing what I can to mask it. Other than that, love it. The main problem was being forced to use an allen wrench for the studs because my drill set doesn't have an allen wrench/socket bit.",
