The recipes are incredibly simple and easy to follow - even for a beginner like me! My favorite part has been experimenting with new ingredients that were previously unknown in my kitchen.\n\nThe author's use [ASPECT_1] makes it so much easier than traditional cooking methods while still maintaining flavor.\n[ISSUE_2]: Some readers have complained about using pre-made mixes or store-bought products as substitutes; however some reviewers suggest adding their own spices & herbs which can be found at most grocery stores"
